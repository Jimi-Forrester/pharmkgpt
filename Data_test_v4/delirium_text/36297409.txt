36297409|t|Targeting NMDA Receptor Complex in Management of Epilepsy.
36297409|a|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and play critical roles in neuronal excitability in the CNS. Both clinical and preclinical studies have revealed that the abnormal expression or function of these receptors can underlie the pathophysiology of seizure disorders and epilepsy. Accordingly, NMDAR modulators have been shown to exert anticonvulsive effects in various preclinical models of seizures, as well as in patients with epilepsy. In this review, we provide an update on the pathologic role of NMDARs in epilepsy and an overview of the NMDAR antagonists that have been evaluated as anticonvulsive agents in clinical studies, as well as in preclinical seizure models.
