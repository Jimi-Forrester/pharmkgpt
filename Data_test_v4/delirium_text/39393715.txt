39393715|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), classified as neurodegenerative disorder that progresses over a period of time, is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques. This present research work was designed to develop a polyherbal gel for the treatment of AD. This research study is aimed to confirm the impact and validation of polyherbal gel on tauopathy and neurodegeneration that had been induced by intraperitoneal trimethyltin (TMT) injection to rats. Polyherbal loaded gel was prepared by cold method, and characterized for gel strength, viscosity, permeation and pH. Subsequently, 5 marker based standardized plant materials of Kalyanka ghrita were incorporated in gellan gum and xanthan gum. Finally, an in-vivo investigation employing rats with TMT-induced neurological disease were used to assess the efficacy of the optimized gel. On day 7, the Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of TMT. From day 14 to day 35, the corresponding groups received intranasal administration of polyherbal gel. In addition to the molecular parameters such as brain acetyl cholinesterase activity, BDNF (Rat brain derived neurotropic factor), protein phosphatase 2 A, antioxidant parameters, and oxidative stress markers, the behavioral parameters were also determined. Studies were conducted on the brain's monoamine levels and histology. RESULTS: Higher permeation over the nasal mucosa was demonstrated by the optimized In-situ polyherbal gel. Significant improvement in cognition was observed from the reduced escape latency, longer paths, and increased social or novel object recognition tests post polyherbal gel treatment. A documented HPLC technique helped in optimization and standardization of the polyherbal gel. The polyherbal treatment groups exhibited a considerable rise in the levels of monoamines, including norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine. CONCLUSION: According to the current study, treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a polyherbal gel formulation may be a viable option for successful therapy.
