22021960|t|Delayed onset, protracted delirium and aspiration pneumonitis associated with a combination of clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy.
22021960|a|Few studies reported the efficacy and safety in combination of clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in schizophrenia; systematic studies are lacking. Side effects like seizure, and confusional state are reported. Authors report two cases of delayed onset/protracted delirium with ECT and clozapine in schizophrenia, one of whom developed aspiration pneumonitis possibly due to clozapine hyper-salivation. Delirium improved with stopping of ECT and clozapine. Clozapine monotherapy restarted to previous dosages in both cases without recurrence of delirium. Authors recommend for careful monitoring for delirium in ECT augmentation on high dose clozapine. Unilateral ECT may be preferred for augmenting clozapine.
