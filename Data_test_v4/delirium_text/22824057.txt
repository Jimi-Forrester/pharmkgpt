22824057|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key molecule in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is metabolized in two alternative cleavages, generating either the amyloidogenic peptides involved in AD pathology or the soluble form of APP (sAPPalpha). The level of amyloidogenic peptides in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered to be a biomarker of AD, whereas the level of sAPPalpha in CSF as a biomarker has not been clearly established. sAPPalpha has neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. Stimulating its formation and secretion is a promising therapeutic target in AD research. To this end, very sensitive tests for preclinical and clinical research are required. METHODS: The tests are based on homogenous time-resolved fluorescence and require no washing steps. RESULTS: We describe two new rapid and sensitive tests for quantifying mouse and human sAPPalpha. These 20 mul-volume tests quantify the levels of: i) endogenous mouse sAPPalpha in the conditioned medium of mouse neuron primary cultures, as well as in the CSF of wild-type mice, ii) human sAPPalpha in the CSF of AD mouse models, and iii) human sAPPalpha in the CSF of AD and non-AD patients. These tests require only 5 mul of conditioned medium from 5 x 10(4) mouse primary neurons, 1 mul of CSF from wild-type and transgenic mice, and 0.5 mul of human CSF. CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity of the mouse sAPPalpha test will allow high-throughput investigations of molecules capable of increasing the secretion of endogenous sAPPalpha in primary neurons, as well as the in vivo validation of molecules of interest through the quantification of sAPPalpha in the CSF of treated wild-type mice. Active molecules could then be tested in the AD mouse models by quantifying human sAPPalpha in the CSF through the progression of the disease. Finally, the human sAPPalpha test could strengthen the biological diagnosis of AD in large clinical investigations. Taken together, these new tests have a wide field of applications in preclinical and clinical studies.
