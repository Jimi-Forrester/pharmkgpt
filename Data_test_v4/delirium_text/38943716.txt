38943716|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a common post-cardiac surgery complication that presents as acute changes in mental abilities with confused thinking and a lack of awareness of the surroundings. Delirium symptoms present in hyperactive- and hypoactive forms. Hypoactive delirium is often overlooked. Although nursing interventions are important in preventing and treating hypoactive delirium, studies focusing on nurses' experiences of hypoactive delirium are scarce. This study describes registered nurses' experiences of caring for patients with hypoactive delirium after cardiac surgery. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study with an inductive approach. Data was collected through focus group interviews with 12 registered nurses with experience in caring for cardiac surgery patients with hypoactive delirium. The study complied with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. SETTING: A cardiac surgery department at a Swedish University Hospital. FINDINGS: The analysis resulted in one main category; "Navigating the complexities of care when caring for patients with hypoactive delirium" and three sub-categories: "Challenges, "Nursing interventions" and "Promoting a team approach". CONCLUSION: Delirium assessment and nursing interventions are perceived as essential yet demanding. when caring for patients with hypoactive delirium. Nursing interventions like maintaining the circadian rhythm and offering emotional support need to be prioritised by the nurses, in line with the autonomy of the registered nurse's profession. Moreover, the team around the patient is crucial for detecting and treating hypoactive delirium, and it is important to involve other professionals as well as the patient's relatives. Future research is needed to develop assessment instruments that more accurately capture hypoactive delirium in the postoperative setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite the use of screening tools, nurses still experience challenges in detecting the symptoms of hypoactive delirium, indicating a need for more clinically effective screening tools for hypoactive delirium. Nursing interventions are emphasised in the care of patients with hypoactive delirium.
