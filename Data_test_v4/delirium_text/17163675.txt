17163675|a|The biochemical processes leading to Alzheimer's disease are just now being elucidated. A recent study shows that a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1, specifically regulates the degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP). An alternative model for Pin1 regulation of APP processing is also proposed.
