36588689|t|Ginsenoside Rd protects transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans from beta-amyloid toxicity by activating oxidative resistant.
36588689|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious public health issue but few drugs are currently available for the disease, and these only target the symptoms. It is well established that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in AD, and there is compelling evidence linking oxidative stress to beta-amyloid (Abeta). An exciting source of potential new AD therapeutic medication possibilities is medicinal plants. Ginsenoside Rd (GS-Rd) is one of the main bioactive substances in ginseng extracts. In our study, we used a network pharmacology analysis to identify overlapping GS-Rd (therapeutic) and AD (disease)-relevant protein targets, gene ontology (GO) and bio-process annotation, and the KEGG pathway analysis data predicted that GS-Rd impacts multiple targets and pathways, such as the MAPK signal pathway and the JAT-STAT3 signaling pathway. We then assessed the role of GS-Rd in C. elegans and found that GS-Rd prolongs lifespan, improves resistance to heat stress, delays physical paralysis and increases oxidative stress responses. Overall, these results suggest that GS-Rd protects against the toxicity of Abeta. The RNA-seq analysis revealed that GS-Rd achieves its effects by regulating gene expressions like daf-16 and skn-1, as well as by participating in many AD-related pathways like the MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, in CL4176 worms, GS-Rd decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and increased SOD activity. Additional research with transgenic worms showed that GS-Rd aided in the movement of DAF-16 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Taken together, the results indicate that GS-Rd significantly reduces Abeta aggregation by targeting the MAPK signal pathway, induces nuclear translocation of DAF-16 to activate downstream signaling pathways and increases resistance to oxidative stress in C. elegans to protect against Abeta-induced toxicity.
