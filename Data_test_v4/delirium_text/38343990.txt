38343990|t|Analyzing the Effects of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on hnRNPA2/B1 Protein Stability and Function: Insights for Anticancer Therapeutic Design.
38343990|a|Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1) is a pivotal player in m6A recognition, RNA metabolism, and antiviral responses. In the context of cancer, overexpression of hnRNPA2/B1, abnormal RNA levels, and m6A depositions are evident. This study focuses on two significant nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) within hnRNPA2/B1, namely, F66L and E92K. Our structural analyses reveal decreased stability in these mutants, with E92K being predicted to undergo destabilizing post-translational methylation. Furthermore, our extensive analysis of 44,239 tumor samples from the COSMIC database uncovers that amino acid position 92 exhibits the second-highest mutation frequency within hnRNPA2/B1, particularly associated with breast and lung cancers. This experimental data aligns with our theoretical studies, highlighting the substantial impact of the nsSNP at position 92 on hnRNPA2/B1's stability and functionality. Given the critical role of pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, and translation regulation in cellular function, it is important to assess the impact of these nsSNPs on the stability and function of the hnRNPA2/B1 protein to design more efficient anticancer therapeutics.
