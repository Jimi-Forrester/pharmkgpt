37747655|t|The Auditory Agnosias: a Short Review of Neurofunctional Evidence.
37747655|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To investigate the neurofunctional correlates of pure auditory agnosia and its varieties (global, verbal, and nonverbal), based on 116 anatomoclinical reports published between 1893 and 2022, with emphasis on hemispheric lateralization, intrahemispheric lesion site, underlying cognitive impairments. RECENT FINDINGS: Pure auditory agnosia is rare, and observations accumulate slowly. Recent patient reports and neuroimaging studies on neurotypical subjects offer insights into the putative mechanisms underlying auditory agnosia, while challenging traditional accounts. Global auditory agnosia frequently results from bilateral temporal damage. Verbal auditory agnosia strictly correlates with language-dominant hemisphere lesions. Damage involves the auditory pathways, but the critical lesion site is unclear. Both the auditory cortex and associative areas are reasonable candidates, but cases resulting from brainstem damage are on record. The hemispheric correlates of nonverbal auditory input disorders are less clear. They correlate with unilateral damage to either hemisphere, but evidence is scarce. Based on published cases, pure auditory agnosias are neurologically and functionally heterogeneous. Phenotypes are influenced by co-occurring cognitive impairments. Future studies should start from these facts and integrate patient data and studies in neurotypical individuals.
