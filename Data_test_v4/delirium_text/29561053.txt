29561053|a|Monitoring the ratio of 40- and 42-residue amyloid beta peptides (i.e., Abeta40 and Abeta42) in human plasma is considered one of the hallmarks of detection of the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, development of a specific, yet non-antibody-based method for simultaneous detection of Abeta40 and Abeta42 may have considerable clinical applications. Here, we developed a 'nanoparticle-based colorimetric sensor array' utilizing label-free gold and silver nanoparticles for visual detection of Abeta42 and Abeta40. Different aggregation behaviors of nanoparticles through their conjugation with Abeta42 and Abeta40 followed by the coordination of Abeta42 and Abeta40 with Cu(ii) led to diverse spectral and color changes. The spectral changes were quantitatively differentiated by a supervised pattern recognition approach, linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The proposed sensor array was able to discriminate among Abeta42, Abeta40, and HSA in different concentrations (50 nmol L-1 to 500 nmol L-1) and their mixtures. Moreover, the sensor array had the capability to identify structurally similar Abeta peptides in human plasma samples. The developed sensor array technology might pave the way for a cheap and rapid, yet robust, platform for high-throughput screening of human plasma for defining the at-risk population for AD.
