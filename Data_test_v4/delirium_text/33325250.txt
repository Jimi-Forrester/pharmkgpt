33325250|t|Verification of administrative data to measure palliative care at terminal hospital stays.
33325250|a|BACKGROUND: Administrative data and clinician documentation have not been directly compared for reporting palliative care, despite concerns about under-reporting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to verify the use of routinely collected administrative data for reporting in-hospital palliation and to examine factors associated with coded palliative care in hospital administrative data. METHOD: Hospital administrative data and inpatient palliative care activity documented in medical records were compared for patients dying in hospital between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2017. Coding of palliative care in administrative data is based on hospital care type coded as "palliative care" and/or assignment of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) palliative care diagnosis code Z51.5. Medical records were searched for specified keywords, which, read in context, indicated a palliative approach to care. The list of keywords (palliative, end of life, comfort care, cease observations, crisis medications, comfort medications, syringe driver, pain or symptom management, no cardiopulmonary resuscitation, advance medical plan/resuscitation plan, deteriorating, agitation, restless and delirium) was developed in consultation with seven local clinicians specialising in palliative care or geriatric medicine. RESULTS: Of the 576 patients who died in hospital, 246 were coded as having received palliative care, either solely by the ICD-10-AM diagnosis code Z51.5 (42%) or in combination with a "palliative care" care type (58%). Just over one-third of dying patients had a palliative care specialist involved in their hospital care. Involvement of a palliative care specialist and a cancer diagnosis substantially increased the odds of a Z51.5 code (odds ratio = 11 and 4, respectively). The majority of patients with a "syringe driver" or identified as being at the "end of life" were assigned a Z51.5 code (73.5% and 70.5%, respectively), compared to 53.8% and 54.7%, respectively, for "palliative" or "comfort care." For each keyword indicating a palliative approach to care, the Z51.5 code was more likely to be assigned if the patient had specialist palliative care input or if they had cancer. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest administrative data under-represented in-hospital palliative care, at least partly due to medical record documentation that failed to meet ICD-10-AM coding criteria. Collaboration between clinicians and coders can enhance the quality of records and, consequently, administrative data.
