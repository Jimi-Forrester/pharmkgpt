39813167|t|Functional proteins/peptides targeting to clear Amyloid-beta for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
39813167|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting individuals over the age of 65. It is characterized by impairments in memory, thinking, analytical judgment, visuospatial recognition, and mood. In recent years, the development of protein and peptide drugs targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) has gained momentum, with several therapies entering clinical trials and even receiving marketing approval. Novel functional protein and peptide drugs, as the first-generation immunotherapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases, have pioneered cellular immunotherapy for AD. However, the currently available drugs are associated with toxicity issues, which can lead to serious complications such as cerebral haemorrhage or edema. Consequently, this study examines the potential for a new generation of Abeta-targeting drugs to mitigate the side effects of existing treatments and offers innovative perspectives for the advancement of therapies for AD.
