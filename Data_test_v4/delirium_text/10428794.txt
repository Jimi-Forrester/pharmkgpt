10428794|t|Biophysical characterization of lithostathine. Evidences for a polymeric structure at physiological pH and a proteolysis mechanism leading to the formation of fibrils.
10428794|a|Lithostathine is a calcium carbonate crystal habit modifier. It is found precipitated under the form of fibrils in chronic calcifying pancreatitis or Alzheimer's disease. In order to gain better insight into the nature and the formation of fibrils, we have expressed and purified recombinant lithostathine. Analytical ultracentrifugation and quasi-elastic light scattering techniques were used to demonstrate that lithostathine remains essentially monomeric at acidic pH while it aggregates at physiological pH. Analysis of these aggregates by electron microscopy showed an apparently unorganized structure of numerous monomers which tend to precipitate forming regular unbranched fibrils. Aggregated forms seem to occur prior to the apparition of fibrils. In addition, we have demonstrated that these fibrils resulted from a proteolysis mechanism due to a specific cleavage of the Arg(11)-Ile(12) peptide bond. It is deduced that the NH(2)-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine normally impedes fiber formation but not aggregation. A theoretical model explaining the formation of amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative diseases or stones in lithiasis starting from lithostathine is described. Therefore we propose that lithostathine, whose major function is unknown, defines a new class of molecules which is activated by proteolysis and is not involved in cytoskeleton nor intermediate filament functions.
