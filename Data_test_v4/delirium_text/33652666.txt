33652666|a|Metabolic reprogramming contributes to tumor development and introduces metabolic liabilities that can be exploited to treat cancer. Studies in hematological malignancies have shown alterations in fatty acid, folate, and amino acid metabolism pathways in cancer cells. One-carbon (1-C) metabolism is essential for numerous cancer cell functions, including protein and nucleic acid synthesis and maintaining cellular redox balance, and inhibition of the 1-C pathway has yielded several highly active drugs, such as methotrexate and 5-FU. Glutamine depletion has also emerged as a therapeutic approach for cancers that have demonstrated dependence on glutamine for survival. Recent studies have shown that in response to glutamine deprivation leukemia cells upregulate key enzymes in the serine biosynthesis pathway, suggesting that serine upregulation may be a targetable compensatory mechanism. These new findings may provide opportunities for novel cancer treatments.
