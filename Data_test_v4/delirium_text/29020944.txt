29020944|t|A convenient UHPLC-MS/MS method for routine monitoring of plasma and brain levels of nicotine and cotinine as a tool to validate newly developed preclinical smoking model in mouse.
29020944|a|BACKGROUND: A sensitive, rapid and selective UHPLC-MS/MS method has been developed and validated for the quantification of Nicotine (NT) and Cotinine (CN) using Continine-d 3 as internal standard (IS) as per FDA guidelines. Sample preparation involved simple protein precipitation of 20 microL mouse plasma or brain homogenate using acetonitrile at 1:8 ratio. Mass Spectrometer was operated in positive polarity under the multiple reaction-monitoring mode using electro spray ionization technique and the transitions of m/z 163.2   132.1, 177.2   98.0 and 180.2   101.2 were used to measure the NT, CN and IS, respectively. The elution of NT, CN and IS are at 1.89, 1.77 and 1.76 min, respectively. This was achieved with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, acetonitrile and methanol (3:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min on a Kinetex EVO C18 column. The method was validated with a lower limit of quantitation 3.0 ng/mL in mouse plasma and brain for both the analytes. RESULTS: A linear response function was established for the range of concentrations 3-200 (r > 0.995) for NT and 3-600 ng/mL (r > 0.995) for CN. The intra- and inter-day precision values met the acceptance criteria. NT and CN are stable in the battery of stability studies viz., stock solution, bench-top and auto-sampler. CONCLUSION: This method was successfully utilized to validate a newly developed preclinical smoking model in mice.
