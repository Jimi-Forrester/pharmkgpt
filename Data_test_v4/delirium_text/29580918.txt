29580918|a|Recently, growing evidence has demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a superior transcriptional regulator that acts via controlling the expression of anti-oxidant enzymes and uncoupling proteins and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, which plays a beneficial part in the central nervous system (CNS). Given the significance of PGC-1alpha, we summarize the current literature on the molecular mechanisms and roles of PGC-1alpha in the CNS. Thus, in this review, we first briefly introduce the basic characteristics regarding PGC-1alpha. We then depict some of its important cerebral functions and discuss upstream modulators, partners, and downstream effectors of the PGC-1alpha signaling pathway. Finally, we highlight recent progress in research on the involvement of PGC-1alpha in certain major neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Collectively, the data presented here may be useful for supporting the future potential of PGC-1alpha as a therapeutic target.
