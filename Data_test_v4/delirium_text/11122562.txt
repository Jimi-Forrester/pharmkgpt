11122562|a|Altered glutathione metabolism in association with increased oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. However, whether strategies aimed at restoring glutathione concentration and homeostasis are effective in ameliorating or modifying the natural history of these states is unknown. In this review we discuss the pathogenic role for altered glutathione metabolism in such diseases as protein energy malnutrition, seizures, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sickle cell anaemia, chronic diseases associated with ageing and the infected state. In addition, we discuss the efficacy of glutathione precursors in restoring glutathione homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo.
