15671856|a|Brain grey matter density changes were quantified using voxel based morphometry in 26 patients with minimal to mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) treated with three cholinesterase inhibitors over 20 weeks. Patients whose drug treatment also inhibited butyrylcholinesterase did not show the widespread cortical atrophic changes in parietotemporal regions invariably reported in untreated AD patients, and which were detectable in the subgroups treated with selective acetylcholinesterase inhibition. This finding is the first empirical evidence that dual cholinesterase inhibition may have neuroprotective potential in AD.
