32239209|a|This study aimed to determine the effects of Bifidobacterium bifidum TMC3115, Lactobacillus plantarum 45 (LP45) and their combined use on cognitive performance and gut microbiota in APP/PS1 mice. The APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into four groups: Alzheimer's disease (AD) model group, TMC3115 group [1 x 109 colony forming unit (CFU)], LP45 group (1 x 109 CFU) and a mixture group of TMC3115 (5 x 108 CFU) and LP45 (5 x 108 CFU). The wild-type littermates were chosen as normal control. The mice were sacrificed at the end of 22 weeks after behavioral evaluation. Collected cecum content was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Combined use of TMC3115 and LP45 significantly increased the times across the platform, time spent in the target quadrant compared with the AD, TMC3115 and LP45 groups in Morris water maze test. Microbiota analysis showed that combined TMC3115 and LP45 supplementation significantly increased observed species and beta diversity, and reversed gut dysbiosis by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and increasing the abundance of Acetatifactor and Millionella. These results indicate the long-term combined administration of TMC3115 and LP45 can improve spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice and suggest that modifying the gut microbiome may provide potential benefits for AD patients.
