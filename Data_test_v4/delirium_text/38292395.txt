38292395|t|A prospective observational study to correlate lung ultrasound with clinical severity and prognosis score in patients with primary pulmonary pathology on invasive ventilatory support.
38292395|a|Background: Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a known imaging modality employed for monitoring patients in an intensive care unit. This study evaluates, LUS in assessing disease severity and prognosis, by correlating its score with the three commonly used clinical severity scoring systems (CSSS), namely, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II. Methods: This single-center prospective observational study included 54 adult patients of primary lung disease-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), on invasive ventilation. The primary objective was to correlate LUS score with SOFA score. Secondary objectives were to correlate LUS score with APACHE II and SAPS II scores. LUS score was also correlated with the estimated mortality derived from the above-mentioned scores. A subgroup analysis on COVID-19-positive cases was also carried out. All scores were calculated on the initiation of mechanical ventilation, daily for 7 days or mortality, whichever was earlier. Results: A significant positive correlation (P < 0.001) was found between LUS and all three severity scores, as well as their corresponding estimated mortality percentages, for all days of the study period, in both non-COVID-19 ARDS patients and in COVID-19 patients. The merit of all four scores in differentiating between the survivor and mortality group for the duration of study also showed significant (P < 0.05) to very significant (P < 0.001) results. Conclusion: Point-of-care LUS in conjunction with CSSS is a reliable tool for assessing the severity and progression of primary lung disease.
