37441267|t|The Relationship Between Chronic Pain and Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly: A Review of Current Evidence.
37441267|a|Chronic pain and cognitive impairment are prevalent geriatric syndromes in the population of older adults, and they are the main cause of disability in people over sixty-five years of age. As the global population continues to age, chronic pain and cognitive impairment will affect an increasing number of older adults. While numerous studies in recent years have shown that chronic pain is associated with cognitive decline, the exact mechanisms linking the two remain unclear. In this review, we aim to present the available evidence on the connection between chronic pain and cognitive impairment and to discuss the potential mechanisms by which chronic pain affects cognitive function. In addition, we review potential therapeutic interventions targeting psychological factors, microglia activation, and altered gut flora that may improve and prevent cognitive decline in people with chronic pain.
