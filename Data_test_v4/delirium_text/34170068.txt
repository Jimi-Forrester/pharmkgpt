34170068|t|Donepezil hydrochloride as a novel inducer for osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells on PLLA scaffolds in vitro.
34170068|a|Over the past decades, bone defects caused by illness or trauma have been the most common traumatic injuries in humans and treatment of orthopedic infections has always been a serious challenge to experts in the world. In this project, poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibrous scaffolds were synthesized as a nontoxic, eco-friendly, and cost-effective scaffold by the electrospinning technique. Then, the impact of PLLA on the cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was assayed in the presence and absence of donepezil hydrochloride (DH) which was prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Also, hMSCs were seeded on PLLA scaffold in the presence (PLLA-DH) and absence of 1 mug mL-1 of DH under osteogenic induction media. Osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was assessed by specific bone-related tests including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin red and von Kossa staining, calcium content assay. Also, Osteocalcin and osteopontin were evaluated as osteogenic proteins as well as ALP, osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen type I (Col-I) and Runx2 as osteogenic genes via immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Real-time PCR analyses. The obtained data showed the higher ALP enzyme activity and biomineralization, more intensity during von Kossa staining as well as the increase in the expression rate of osteogenic related gene and protein markers in differentiated hMSCs on PLLA-DH. In conclusion, the present study revealed that the combination of PLLA scaffold with DH provides a scope to develop a suitable matrix in bone tissue engineering applications.
