34290897|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture patients have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the sub acute effects of a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcomes in highly exposed developing countries are still unknown. Our objective is to describe the morbidity and mortality of elderly patients admitted for a hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile, with a minimum 90-day follow-up. Also, to elucidate predictors for mortality and to compare mortality results with the pre-pandemic era. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicentric retrospective review of patients admitted for a fragility hip fracture in 3 hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and during the same time in 2019. All clinical information and images were recorded, and patients were followed for a minimum of 90-days. Morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes. Uni/multivariable models were performed to elucidate predictors for mortality utilizing the Weibull's regression. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one cases were included. From the 2020 cohort (162 patients), 24 (15%) had a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourteen patients (58%) tested positive after admission. The COVID-19(+) group had a higher risk of in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality (p < 0.001). They also had a prolonged hospital stay and presented with more complications and readmissions (p < 0.05). Only COVID-19(+) status and older age were independent predictors for mortality with a HR = 6.5 (p = < 0.001) and 1.09 (p = 0.001), respectively. The 2020 cohort had twice the risk of mortality with a HR = 2.04 (p = 0.002) compared to the 2019 cohort. However, comparing only the COVID-19 (-) patients, there was no difference in mortality risk, with a HR = 1.30 (p = 0.343). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected healthcare systems and elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture patients with a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 virus infection were associated with increased morbidity and mortality throughout the first 3 months. COVID-19 status and older age were significant predictors for mortality. Efforts should be directed into nosocomial infection reduction and prompt surgical management. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.
