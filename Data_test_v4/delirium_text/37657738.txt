37657738|a|Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone of the incretin family, secreted in response to nutrient ingestion, and plays a role in metabolic homeostasis. GLP-1 receptor agonist has a peripheral and a central action, including stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion and insulin biosynthesis, inhibition of glucagon secretion and gastric emptying, and inhibition of food intake. Through their mechanism, their use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been extended to the management of obesity, and numerous trials are being conducted to assess their cardiovascular effect. Type 2 diabetes appears to share common pathophysiological mechanisms with the development of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, related to insulin resistance. In this review, we aim to examine the pathological features between type 2 diabetes and dementia, GLP-1 central effects, and analyze the relevant literature about the effect of GLP-1 analogs on cognitive function of patients with type 2 diabetes but also without. Results tends to show an improvement in some brain markers (e.g. hippocampal connections, cerebral glucose metabolism, hippocampal activation on functional magnetic resonance imaging), but without being able to demonstrate a strong correlation to cognitive scores. Some epidemiological studies suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer a protective effect, by delaying progression to dementia when diabetic patients are treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Ongoing trials are in progress and may provide disease-modifying care for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients in the future.
