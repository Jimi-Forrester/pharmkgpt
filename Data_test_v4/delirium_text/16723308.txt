16723308|a|BACKGROUND: In the central nervous system, several neuropeptides are believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, previous studies have documented that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) possesses neurotropic properties and can reduce amyloid-beta peptide levels in the brain in vivo. Moreover, the concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY) seem to be altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD and in subjects with major depression. Finally, among the modifications induced by aging, a dysregulation of the ghrelin-growth hormone (GH) system has been reported. METHODS: We investigated the plasma concentrations of these neuropeptides in 14 subjects with AD. Data obtained from these patients were compared with data from an age- and weight-matched healthy group. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two groups in relation to plasma levels of GLP-1, NPY, ghrelin and GH. Peripheral NPY concentrations were positively correlated with ghrelin levels in both groups, and with plasma GLP-1 concentration only in controls. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, peripheral levels of these neuropeptides seem not to serve as biochemical markers of AD.
