33508037|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating illness affecting over 40 million people worldwide. Intraneuronal rise of amyloid beta in its oligomeric forms (iAbetaOs), has been linked to the pathogenesis of AD by disrupting cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis. However, the specific mechanisms of action are still under debate and intense effort is ongoing to improve our understanding of the crucial steps involved in the mechanisms of AbetaOs toxicity. We report the development of a mathematical model describing a proposed mechanism by which stimulation of Phospholipase C (PLC) by iAbetaO, triggers production of IP3 with consequent abnormal release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through activation of IP3 receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channels. After validating the model using experimental data, we quantify the effects of intracellular rise in iAbetaOs on model solutions. Our model validates a dose-dependent influence of iAbetaOs on IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling. We investigate Ca2+ signaling patterns for small and large iAbetaOs doses and study the role of various parameters on Ca2+ signals. Uncertainty quantification and partial rank correlation coefficients are used to better understand how the model behaves under various parameter regimes. Our model predicts that iAbetaO alter IP3R sensitivity to IP3 for large doses. Our analysis also shows that the upstream production of IP3 can influence Abeta-driven solution patterns in a dose-dependent manner. Model results illustrate and confirm the detrimental impact of iAbetaOs on IP3 signaling.
