38024180|t|Effect of adding dexmedetomidine on two methods of labor analgesia via epidural among parturient patients.
38024180|a|Background: Continuous epidural infusion (CEI) has been an optimal and acceptable technique for inducing epidural anesthesia. This study compared two methods of programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) with CEI in labor analgesia among patients receiving epidural dexmedetomidine. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial. The target population was term women candidates for epidural anesthesia. After selection of sample size based on inclusion criteria, a total of 3 cc of dexmedetomidine (0.5 microg/ml) and Ropivacaine 0.1% was injected. Furthermore, 5 ml was injected as a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 0.5 microg /ml and Ropivacaine 0.1%. Then the pain score was recorded. SPSS software Version 23 was used for statistical analysis of data. Results: The neonatal Apgar score in PIEB method was more improved (P = 0.003) and the use of assisted delivery tools such as vacuum, in PIEB method was reduced. (p=0.038) Duration of the first phase of the labor in this method was more reduced than CEI.(p=0.015) Patients in the group undergoing epidural anesthesia by PIEB method were associated with a higher level of satisfaction with the delivery process (p < 0.05) than patients undergoing CEI protocol. Conclusion: PIEB method is associated with further improvement in neonatal Apgar score and maternal outcomes (reduction in the duration of the first phase of labor and no need to use assisted delivery methods) compared to the CEI protocol, but has little effect on hemodynamic conditions or drug dosage.
