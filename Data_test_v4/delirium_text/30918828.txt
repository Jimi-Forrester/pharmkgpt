30918828|t|Circadian Rhythms: Will It Revolutionise the Management of Diseases?
30918828|a|The Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2017 was awarded to Michael Young, Michael Rosbash and Jeffrey Hall for their discoveries into the molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms (CR). The aims of this paper were to present the mechanisms behind the CRs and discuss the impact this could have on human health. We argued that further research in this field has the potential to revolutionise healthcare through understanding the influence on the pathogenesis of disease, including in cardiovascular, mental and neurological health, as well as influence on cognitive function. The research has shown that intrinsic CRs have physiological and biochemical influences on the body, which may affect the efficiency of drug absorption due to the altered activity of enzymes. There is strong data to suggest CR disturbances, due to either shift work, sleep disorders or frequent travel between time zones, has negative impact on health. This article aims to summarise the extent of this impact and analyse CRs as a potential therapeutic target, as well as describing the pathophysiology and mechanisms driving the course of disease among people with CR disorders. These new discoveries may revolutionise the way in which treatment is provided in the future with more focus on lifestyle changes to provide treatment and more optimal precision medicine. Pharmaceutical companies and healthcare staff must consider the significant message provided from this data and use the information to optimise drug delivery and treatment provision. The facts of CRs role in healthcare can no longer be ignored.
