34682534|a|We investigated the effects of Taekwondo training on the body composition, serum lipid profiles, plasma neurotransmitter levels, cerebral blood flow velocities, and subjective well-being of 24 obese postmenopausal women. The women were randomly assigned into the experimental (n = 12) and control (n = 12) groups. The experimental group underwent Taekwondo training five times per week for 16 weeks, while the control group did not. All participants underwent evaluation for the following parameters before and after the intervention: body composition; serum lipid profiles; plasma serotonin and dopamine levels; cerebral blood flow velocities; positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) scores; satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) scores. After the intervention, it was observed that the weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and PANAS-NA (negative affect in the PANAS questionnaire) scores were significantly decreased (p < 0.05)-while the plasma serotonin levels were significantly increased (p < 0.05)-in the experimental group. Conversely, there were no significant changes in the cerebral blood flow velocities (p > 0.05). Taekwondo training can be effective in not only reducing obesity, but also in increasing the circulating neurotransmitters and enhancing the subjective well-being of obese postmenopausal women.
