30782589|a|INTRODUCTION: The European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) project is funded initially by the Innovative Medicines Initiative and has been established to overcome the major hurdles hampering drug development for secondary prevention of Alzheimer's dementia, by conducting the EPAD Longitudinal Cohort Study (LCS) in alignment with the Bayesian adaptive designed EPAD Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: EPAD LCS is an ongoing prospective, multicentre, pan-European longitudinal cohort study. Participants are recruited mainly from existing parent cohorts across Europe to form a 'probability-spectrum' population covering the entire continuum of anticipated probability for Alzheimer's dementia development. The primary objective of the EPAD LCS is to be a readiness cohort for the EPAD PoC trial though a second major objective is to generate a comprehensive and large data set for disease modelling of preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. This characterisation of cognitive, biomarker and risk factor (genetic and environmental) status of research participants over time will provide the necessary well-phenotyped population for developing accurate longitudinal models for Alzheimer's disease covering the entire disease course and concurrently create a pool of highly characterised individuals for the EPAD PoC trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received the relevant approvals from numerous Institutional Review Boards across Europe. Findings will be disseminated to several target audiences, including the scientific community, research participants, patient community, general public, industry, regulatory authorities and policy-makers. Regular and coordinated releases of EPAD LCS data will be made available for analysis to help researchers improve their understanding of early Alzheimer's disease stages and facilitate collaborations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02804789.
