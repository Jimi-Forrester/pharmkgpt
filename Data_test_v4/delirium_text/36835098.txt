36835098|t|Disassembly of Amyloid Fibril with Infrared Free Electron Laser.
36835098|a|Amyloid fibril causes serious amyloidosis such as neurodegenerative diseases. The structure is composed of rigid beta-sheet stacking conformation which makes it hard to disassemble the fibril state without denaturants. Infrared free electron laser (IR-FEL) is an intense picosecond pulsed laser that is oscillated through a linear accelerator, and the oscillation wavelengths are tunable from 3 mum to 100 mum. Many biological and organic compounds can be structurally altered by the mode-selective vibrational excitations due to the wavelength variability and the high-power oscillation energy (10-50 mJ/cm2). We have found that several different kinds of amyloid fibrils in amino acid sequences were commonly disassembled by the irradiation tuned to amide I (6.1-6.2 mum) where the abundance of beta-sheet decreased while that of alpha-helix increased by the vibrational excitation of amide bonds. In this review, we would like to introduce the IR-FEL oscillation system briefly and describe combination studies of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations on disassembling amyloid fibrils of a short peptide (GNNQQNY) from yeast prion and 11-residue peptide (NFLNCYVSGFH) from beta2-microglobulin as representative models. Finally, possible applications of IR-FEL for amyloid research can be proposed as a future outlook.
