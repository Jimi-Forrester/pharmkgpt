22016521|a|Accumulation of PrP(Sc), an abnormal form of cellular prion protein (PrP), in the brain of animals and humans leads to fatal neurodegenerative disorders known as prion diseases. Limited protease digestion of PrP(Sc) produces a truncated form called PrP(27-30) that retains prion infectivity and is the main marker of disease targeted in most diagnostic tests. In the search for new anti-prion molecules, drug-screening assays on prion-infected murine cells have been oriented toward decreasing levels of PrP(27-30). In contrast, we screened for drugs promoting multimers of PrP(27-30), illustrating a possible stabilization of mouse PrP(Sc) species, because recent studies aiming to characterize the conformational stability of various prion strains showed that stable recombinant amyloids produced more stable prion strain, leading to longest incubation time. We identified a family of thienyl pyrimidine derivatives that induce SDS-resistant dimers and trimers of PrP(27-30). Bioassays performed on mice brain homogenates treated with these compounds showed that these thienyl pyrimidine derivatives diminished prion infectivity in vivo. Oligomeric-induced activity by thienyl pyrimidine compounds is a promising approach not only to understanding the pathogenesis of prions but also for prion diagnostics. This approach could be extended to other neurodegenerative "prionopathies," such as Alzheimer's, Huntington, or Parkinson's diseases.
