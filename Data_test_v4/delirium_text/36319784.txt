36319784|a|BACKGROUND: Seemingly, the Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a role in the etiopathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here in this study, we determined the association of MMP9 rs3918242, MMP3 rs3025058, and MMP2 rs243865 polymorphisms with the risk of COVID-19, especially in those with neurological syndrome (NS). METHODS: We enrolled 500 patients with COVID-19 and 500 healthy individuals. To genotype the target SNPs, the Real-time allelic discrimination technique was used. To determine serum levels of MMPs, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was exerted. RESULTS: The MMP9 gene rs3918242 and MMP3 gene rs3025058 SNP were significantly associated with increased COVID-19 risk and susceptibility to COVID-19 with NS. The serum level of MMP-9 and MMP-3 was significantly higher in COVID-19 cases compared with the healthy controls. Serum MMP-9 and MMP-3 levels were also higher in COVID-19 subjects with NS in comparison to the healthy controls. The polymorphisms in MMP genes were not associated with serum level of MMPs. CONCLUSION: MMP9 and MMP3 gene polymorphisms increases the susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 with neurologic syndrome, but they probably have no role in the regulation of serum MMP-9 and MMP-3 levels.
