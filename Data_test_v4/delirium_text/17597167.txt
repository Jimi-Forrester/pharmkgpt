17597167|a|There is ample evidence for the occurrence of inflammatory processes in most major neurodegenerative disorders, both in acute conditions such as traumatic brain injury and stroke, and in chronic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Studies on inflammatory factors such as pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines in experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders suggest that they are not merely bystanders, but may be involved in the neurodegenerative process. In addition, there are findings indicating that inflammatory factors may have beneficial effects on the nervous system, particularly during development of the nervous system. The challenge is to understand when, where and during which circumstances inflammation and inflammatory factors are positive or negative for neuronal survival and functioning. Some of our studies on cytokines, particularly the interleukin-1 system, are summarised and discussed in relation to neurodegeneration, cognition, and temperature changes.
