At present, propofol based sedation strategy still has some defects, such as respiratory depression and blood pressure drop. It is difficult to meet the requirements of safety and effectiveness at the same time. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of propofol/remifentanil with propofol/esketamine for patient sedation during fiberoptic bronchoscopy. METHOD: Patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy were randomly assigned to propofol/ remifentanil (PR group; n = 42) or propofol/esketamine (PK group; n = 42) for sedation and analgesia. The primary outcome was the rate of transient hypoxia (oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 95%). The secondary outcomes are the intraoperative hemodynamics, including the changes in blood pressure, heart rate, the incidence of adverse reactions, the total amount of propofol usage were recorded, and the satisfaction level of patients and bronchoscopists. RESULTS: After sedation, the arterial pressure and heart rate of patients in the PK group were stable without significant decrease. Decreases in diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were observed in patients in the PR group (P < 0.05), although it was not of clinical relevance. The dosage of propofol in the PR group was significantly higher than that in the PK group (144 +- 38 mg vs. 125 +- 35 mg, P = 0.012). Patients in the PR group showed more transient hypoxia (SpO2 < 95%) during surgery (7 vs. 0, 0% versus 16.6%, P = 0.018), more intraoperative choking (28 vs. 7, P < 0.01), postoperative vomiting (22 vs. 13, P = 0.076) and vertigo (15 vs. 13, P = 0.003). Bronchoscopists in the PK group showed more satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Compared with remifentanil, the combination of esketamine with propofol in fiberoptic bronchoscopy leaded to more stable intraoperative hemodynamics, lower dosage of propofol, lower transient hypoxia rate, fewer incidence of adverse events, and greater bronchoscopists satisfaction.
