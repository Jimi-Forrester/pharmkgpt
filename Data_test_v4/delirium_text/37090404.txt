37090404|a|BACKGROUND: The complex innervation of the hip joint may require a combined peripheral nerve block technique for perioperative effective analgesia and early recovery. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) and suprainguinal fascia iliaca compartment blocks (SIFICB) are interfascial plane blocks aiming to involve the femoral, obturator, accessory obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. The data still lacks in providing the standard of care for patients undergoing hip surgery. In this case series, we studied the efficacy of ultrasound-guided combined PENG block and SIFICB for perioperative analgesia and functional recovery in patients posted for hip surgery. METHOD: We studied 10 adults of either gender who underwent close reduction and internal fixation of hip fracture. Before receiving spinal anesthesia, all patients had PENG block and SIFICB with 10 ml and 20 ml of local anesthetics respectively. Patients were observed for ease of giving sitting position for spinal anesthesia (EOSP), visual analogue score (VAS) at rest and 15  leg elevation, duration of postoperative analgesia, the cumulative requirement of rescue analgesic at 48 hours and ability of patients to undergo weight-bearing trial postoperatively. RESULT: The static and dynamic VAS before receiving spinal anesthesia and postoperatively, was reduced compared to pre-block. The optimal position for delivering spinal anesthesia was possible to achieve as the patients were able to sit comfortably after 10 minutes of receiving both blocks. Duration of postoperative analgesia also extended up to 18 hours with the cumulative requirement of injection tramadol restricted to two doses postoperatively. All were able to walk down a minimum of 55 steps after 48 hours of completion of surgery. CONCLUSION: Combining PENG block along with SIFICB is effective in the provision of perioperative analgesia with a considerable reduction in opioids and enhanced functional recovery due to motor sparing effect after surgical repair of the hip fracture.
