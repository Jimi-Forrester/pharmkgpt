39283972|t|Perioperative Systemic Corticosteroids in Modern Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty: A Primer for Clinical Practice.
39283972|a|>> Perioperative corticosteroids are strongly recommended for reducing the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting following elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.>> Corticosteroids may reduce postoperative pain and opioid requirements. Similarly, corticosteroids appear to have a neutral-to-positive effect on length of stay, venous thromboembolism, mobility, delirium, acute kidney injury, and bone cement implantation syndrome (i.e., decreased length of stay).>> Perioperative corticosteroids may induce hyperglycemia among both diabetic and nondiabetic patients; however, there is no strong evidence indicating that these transient corticosteroid-induced glycemic derangements may increase the risk of postoperative infectious complications.>> The dosage and frequency of perioperative corticosteroid administration play a critical role in optimizing postoperative outcomes, with higher doses showing promise in reducing opioid consumption, postoperative pain, and length of stay.>> The optimal dosage and frequency of corticosteroids remain unclear; however, the perioperative administration of 8 to 16 mg dexamethasone, or equivalent steroid, appears reasonable and safe in most cases.
