37842485|a|Backgrounds During the COVID-19 pandemic, visitor restrictions in healthcare settings adversely affected patients. Video calls have emerged as an essential digital alternative that can decrease patients' anxiety and improve satisfaction. This study investigated whether family-initiated video calls could mitigate delirium symptoms and risky behaviors and enhance patients' comprehension of instructions. Methods This observational study used medical chart data and the Diem Payment System from a single acute care hospital in Fukuoka, Japan. The study involved patients hospitalized between May 2020 and August 2021 who used video chat systems. Patients or their relatives used video calls through Skype. The frequency of video chat use served as the primary exposure. Changes in the patients' risky behaviors and instruction comprehension upon discharge were the primary outcomes. Results A total of 532 patients were included in the study, with an average age of over 70 years. After implementing the inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment, an improved balance across age, sex, BMI categories, and other variables was observed. The effects of video calls on risky behaviors and instruction comprehension varied. Patients with three or more video calls showed distinct effects compared with those with fewer calls. When hospitalization was limited to three weeks, video calls noticeably influenced risky behaviors (p=0.022, 95% CI:1.08-2.63), but not instruction comprehension (p=0.226, 95% CI:0.43-1.22). Conclusions The use of video calls as a visitation method in acute care hospitals during a pandemic suggests that video calls reduce risky behaviors in patients with a three-week stay. This alternative to physical visitations contributes positively to patient safety and supports ongoing efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
