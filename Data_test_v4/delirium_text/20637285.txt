20637285|a|Increasing evidence has implicated megalin, a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the brain, megalin is expressed in brain capillaries, ependymal cells and choroid plexus, where it participates in the clearance of brain amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) complex. Recently, megalin has also been detected in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In this study we demonstrate that megalin is widely distributed in neurons throughout the brain. Additionally, given that FE65 mediates the interaction between the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to modulate the rate of APP internalization from the cell surface, we hypothesize that megalin could also interact with APP in neurons. Our results confirm that megalin interacts with APP and FE65, suggesting that these three proteins form a tripartite complex. Moreover, our findings imply that megalin may participate in neurite branching. Taken together, these results indicate that megalin has an important role in Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity, and therefore may be involved in the neurodegenerative processes that occur in AD.
