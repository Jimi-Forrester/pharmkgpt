35207678|t|Does 3D Printing-Assisted Acetabular or Pelvic Fracture Surgery Shorten Hospitalization Durations among Older Adults?
35207678|a|Acetabular or anterior pelvic ring fractures are rare but extremely complicated and challenging injuries for orthopedic trauma surgeons. Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is widely used in the management of these two fracture types for surgical benefits. Our study aimed to explore whether 3D printing-assisted acetabular or pelvic surgery is beneficial in terms of shortening the length of hospital stay (LHS) and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (ICU LS) for older patients. This retrospective study included two groups of 76 participants over 60 years old who underwent operations with (n = 41) or without (n = 35) guidance by 3D printing. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze continuous variables. Chi-square analysis was applied for categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the factors associated with LHS. The median LHS in the group without 3D printing assistance was 16 (12-21) days, and the median ICU LS was 0 (0-2) days. The median LHS in the group with 3D printing assistance was 17 (12.5-22.5) days, and the median ICU LS was 0 (0-3) days. There was no significant difference in LHS associated with 3D printing assistance vs. that without 3D printing among patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation for pelvic or acetabular fractures. The LHS positively correlated with the ICU LS whether the operation was 3D printing assisted or not. For fracture surgery in older patients, in addition to the advancement of surgical treatment and techniques, medical teams require more detailed preoperative evaluations, and more personalized medical plans regarding postoperative care to achieve the goals of shortening LHS, reducing healthcare costs, and reducing complication rates.
