34356693|t|MiRNA Detection Using a Rolling Circle Amplification and RNA-Cutting Allosteric Deoxyribozyme Dual Signal Amplification Strategy.
34356693|a|A microRNA (miRNA) detection platform composed of a rolling circle amplification (RCA) system and an allosteric deoxyribozyme system is proposed, which can detect miRNA-21 rapidly and efficiently. Padlock probe hybridization with the target miRNA is achieved through complementary base pairing and the padlock probe forms a closed circular template under the action of ligase; this circular template results in RCA. In the presence of DNA polymerase, RCA proceeds and a long chain with numerous repeating units is formed. In the presence of single-stranded DNA (H1 and H2), multi-component nucleic acid enzymes (MNAzymes) are formed that have the ability to cleave substrates. Finally, substrates containing fluorescent and quenching groups and magnesium ions are added to the system to activate the MNAzyme and the substrate cleavage reaction, thus achieving fluorescence intensity amplification. The RCA-MNAzyme system has dual signal amplification and presents a sensing platform that demonstrates broad prospects in the analysis and detection of nucleic acids.
