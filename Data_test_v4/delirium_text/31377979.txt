31377979|a|Despite relative frequency of delirium in elderly hospitalized heart failure patients, skills and expertise in managing such complication are usually poor for physicians and nurses facing this clinical condition. International guidelines on heart failure do not provide detailed indication for such clinical condition, and evidence on this topic is limited. A multi-disciplinary approach (cardiologists, internists, geriatricians, psychologists, and psychiatrists) is often required; this review will therefore focus on diagnosis and clinical management of delirium in heart failure patients from a multidisciplinary point of view.
