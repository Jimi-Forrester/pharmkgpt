26053105|a|The effect of yeast red pigment on amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and fibril growth was studied in yeasts, fruit flies and in vitro. Yeast strains accumulating red pigment (red strains) contained less amyloid and had better survival rates compared to isogenic strains without red pigment accumulation (white strains). Confocal and fluorescent microscopy was used to visualise fluorescent Abeta-GFP aggregates. Yeast cells containing less red pigment had more Abeta-GFP aggregates despite the lower level of overall GFP fluorescence. Western blot analysis with anti-GFP, anti-Abeta and A11 antibodies also revealed that red cells contained a considerably lower amount of Abeta GFP aggregates as compared to white cells. Similar results were obtained with exogenous red pigment that was able to penetrate yeast cells. In vitro experiments with thioflavine and TEM showed that red pigment effectively decreased Abeta fibril growth. Transgenic flies expressing Abeta were cultivated on medium containing red and white isogenic yeast strains. Flies cultivated on red strains had a significant decrease in Abeta accumulation levels and brain neurodegeneration. They also demonstrated better memory and learning indexes and higher locomotor ability.
