33400180|a|Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, associated with the presence of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Although the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, the characteristic feature of AD was reported to be the buildup of Abeta plaques. In this study, we extensively investigated the neuroprotective effects of 2-substituted 1,3-selenazole amide derivatives (CHF11) on Abeta1-42 transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176. Results showed that worms fed with CHF11 exhibited remarkably reduced paralysis, decreased levels of toxic Abeta oligomers and Abeta plaque deposition, as well as less ROS production in comparison with the untreated worms. The effective concentrations of CHF11 were arranged in the descending order of 100 microM > 10 microM > 1 microM. Real-time PCR analysis showed that there was no significant difference in Abeta expression between CHF11-administered group and the blank control group, suggesting that CHF11-induced reduction in toxic protein deposition may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. In the meantime, the gene expressions of hsf-1 and its downstream target hsp-12.6 were significantly increased, indicating that CHF11 against Abeta toxicity may involve in HSF-1 signaling pathway in worms. In conclusion, CHF11 exhibits a significant protective effect against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity in CL4176 by reducing beta-amyloid aggregation and ROS production, which may involve in HSF-1 and downstream target HSP-12.6 pathway.
