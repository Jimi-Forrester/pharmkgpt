33991570|t|In-vitro evaluation of antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of novel pyridine, quinoxaline and s-triazine derivatives.
33991570|a|Cholinesterase enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) cause hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter responsible for the cognitive functions of the brain such as acquiring knowledge and comprehension. Therefore, inhibition of these enzymes is an effective process to curb the progressive and fatal neurological Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we explored the potential inhibitory activities of various pyridine, quinoxaline, and triazine derivatives (3a-k, 6a-j and 11a-h) against AChE and BuChE enzymes by following the modified Ellman's method. Further, anti-oxidant property of these libraries was monitored using DPPH (2,2'-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazylhydrate) radical scavenging analysis. From the studies, we identified that compounds 6e, 6f, 11b and 11f behaved as selective AChE inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 7.23 to 10.35 muM. Further studies revealed good anti-oxidant activity by these compounds with IC50 values in the range of 14.80-27.22 muM. The kinetic studies of the active analogues demonstrated mixed-type of inhibition due to their interaction with both the catalytic active sites (CAS) and peripheral anionic sites (PAS) of the AChE. Additionally, molecular simulation in association with fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic analyses explained strong affinities of inhibitors to bind with AChE enzyme at the physiological pH of 7.2. Binding constant values of 5.4 x 104, 4.3 x 104, 3.2 x 104 and 4.9 x 104 M-1 corresponding to free energy changes -5.593, -6.799, -6.605 and -8.104 KcalM-1 were obtained at 25  C from fluorescence emission spectroscopic studies of 6e, 6f, 11b and 11f, respectively. Besides, CD spectroscopy deliberately explained the secondary structure of AChE partly unfolded upon binding with these dynamic molecules. Excellent in vitro profiles of distinct quinoxaline and triazine compounds highlighted them as the potential leads compared to pyridine derivatives, suggesting a path towards developing preventive or therapeutic targets to treat the Alzheimer's disease.
