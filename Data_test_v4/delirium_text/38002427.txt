38002427|t|A Nanostructured Protein Filtration Device for Possible Use in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease-Concept and Feasibility after In Vivo Tests.
38002427|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with other neurodegenerative disorders, remains a challenge for clinicians, mainly because of the incomplete knowledge surrounding its etiology and inefficient therapeutic options. Considering the central role of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the onset and evolution of AD, Abeta-targeted therapies are among the most promising research directions. In the context of decreased Abeta elimination from the central nervous system in the AD patient, the authors propose a novel therapeutic approach based on the "Cerebrospinal Fluid Sink Therapeutic Strategy" presented in previous works. This article aims to demonstrate the laborious process of the development and testing of an effective nanoporous ceramic filter, which is the main component of an experimental device capable of filtrating Abeta from the cerebrospinal fluid in an AD mouse model. METHODS: First, the authors present the main steps needed to create a functional filtrating nanoporous ceramic filter, which represents the central part of the experimental filtration device. This process included synthesis, functionalization, and quality control of the functionalization, which were performed via various spectroscopy methods and thermal analysis, selectivity measurements, and a biocompatibility assessment. Subsequently, the prototype was implanted in APP/PS1 mice for four weeks, then removed, and the nanoporous ceramic filter was tested for its filtration capacity and potential structural damages. RESULTS: In applying the multi-step protocol, the authors developed a functional Abeta-selective filtration nanoporous ceramic filter that was used within the prototype. All animal models survived the implantation procedure and had no significant adverse effects during the 4-week trial period. Post-treatment analysis of the nanoporous ceramic filter showed significant protein loading, but no complete clogging of the pores. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that a nanoporous ceramic filter-based system that filtrates Abeta from the cerebrospinal fluid is a feasible and safe treatment modality in the AD mouse model. The presented prototype has a functional lifespan of around four weeks, highlighting the need to develop advanced nanoporous ceramic filters with anti-biofouling properties to ensure the long-term action of this therapy.
