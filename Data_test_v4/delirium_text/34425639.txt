34425639|a|The evidence supporting the intraoperative use of processed electroencephalography (pEEG) monitoring to guide anesthetic delivery is growing rapidly. This article reviews the key features of electroencephalography (EEG) waveforms and their clinical implications in select patient populations and anesthetic techniques. The first patient topic reviewed is the vulnerable brain. This term has emerged as a description of patients who may exhibit increased sensitivity to anesthetics and/or may develop adverse neurocognitive effects following anesthesia. pEEG monitoring of patients who are known to have or are suspected of having vulnerable brains, with focused attention on the suppression ratio, alpha band power, and pEEG indices, may prove useful. Second, pEEG monitoring along with vigilant attention to anesthetic delivery may minimize the risk of intraoperative awareness when administering a total intravenous anesthesia in combination with a neuromuscular blockade. Third, we suggest that processed EEG monitoring may play a role in anesthetic and resuscitative management when adverse changes in blood pressure occur. Fourth, pEEG monitoring can be used to better identify anesthesia requirements and guide anesthetic titration in patients with known or suspected substance use.
