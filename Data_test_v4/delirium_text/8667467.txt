8667467|t|Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin for identification of drug overdose patients at risk of an alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
8667467|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol abuse is frequent in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute drug overdose. During detoxification, an alcohol withdrawal syndrome may develop in patients with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. Withdrawal or delirium is associated with serious risks, necessitating early identification of patients at risk. Since the information obtained from the patients or their relatives on alcohol consumption is often unreliable, biochemical markers may be helpful. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin is considered a highly specific marker (reported maximum specificity 97%, sensitivity 40-85%) for identifying alcohol abuse. METHODS: In 20 patients with acute drug overdose and suspected alcohol abuse, carbohydrate deficient transferrin was determined by an immunoturbidimetric assay on admission to the intensive care unit. Eight of the patients had carbohydrate deficient transferrin levels above the "positive" threshold and nine in a suspicious range. A "false" negative carbohydrate deficient transferrin was found in three patients who were thought to have changed their drinking habits prior to hospitalization. A "positive" carbohydrate deficient transferrin test is assumed to be associated with ingestion of more than 60-80 g ethanol/d for a period of more than seven days. RESULTS: In all patients, clonidine (30-210 micrograms/h i.v.) was started. None developed delirium. Since alcohol addiction is frequently denied, determination of carbohydrate deficient transferrin may be useful for its early diagnosis but the sensitivity of this parameter requires further evaluation.
