37202948|a|Purpose: Emergency delirium (ED), a common postoperative neurologic complication, causes behavioral disturbances leading to self-traumas and also has long-term adverse effects in children. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of a single-bolus dose of dexmedetomidine in reducing the incidence of ED. Additionally, pain relief, number of patients who needed rescue analgesia, hemodynamic parameters, and adverse events were assessed. Methods: One hundred and one patients were randomly allocated into two groups: 50 patients received 15 mL of dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug/kg (group D) and 51 patients received volume-matched normal saline (group C). Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were monitored regularly throughout the procedure. ED was assessed with Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAEDS), and pain was measured using the modified Objective Pain Score (MOPS). Results: The incidences of ED and pain were higher in group C than group D (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Group D showed significant decrease in MOPS and PAEDS values at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min (P < 0.05), HR at 5 min (P < 0.0243), and SBP at 15 min (P < 0.0127). There was no significant difference in DBP between the two groups at any time point. The mean blood pressure (MBP) at 10 min was significantly less in group D than group C (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug/kg as a single bolus over 10 min immediately after intubation is effective for the prevention of ED and significantly reduces the need of rescue analgesia without compromising the hemodynamic parameters in children undergoing ophthalmic surgery.
