23912744|a|Amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) plays a key role in the neurotoxicity found in Alzheimer's disease. Mononuclear phagocytes in the brain (microglia), can potentially clear Abeta via phagocytosis. Recently, the shuttling-protein nucleolin has been shown to possess scavenger receptor-activity. Here, we investigated whether this receptor interacts specifically with Abeta type 1-42 and mediates its phagocytosis by microglia. While monomeric and fibril Abeta42 were phagocytosed by mouse microglial EOC2 cells, amyloid beta peptide 1-40 (Abeta40) was only weakly phagocytosed. Surface plasmon-resonance analysis revealed that nucleolin strongly associates with Abeta42, but only weakly associates with Abeta40. Immunofluorescence staining of anti-nucleolin antibody revealed that EOC2 cells and rat primary microglia express nucleolin on their cell surfaces. Further, pretreating EOC2 cells with anti-nucleolin antibody, but not immunoglobulin G (IgG), inhibited phagocytosis of monomeric Abeta42 by microglia. Additionally, nucleolin-transfected HEK293 cells phagocytosed monomeric and fibril Abeta42 but not monomeric and fibril Abeta40. Moreover, AGRO, a nucleolin-specific oligonucleotide aptamer, inhibited phagocytosis of monomeric and fibril Abeta42, but not monomeric and fibril Abeta40. These results indicate that nucleolin is a receptor that allows microglia to recognize monomeric and fibril Abeta42.
