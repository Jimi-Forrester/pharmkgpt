39522980|t|Expression Profiles of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Splice Variants in the Hippocampus of Alzheimer's Disease Model Mouse.
39522980|a|Dysregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of BDNF expression in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice, an AD model, focusing on sex and age differences and Bdnf mRNA splice variants. At 3 months of age, female wild-type (WT) mice exhibited significantly higher Bdnf mRNA levels compared to males. However, this difference was abolished in female 5xFAD mice. At 6 months of age, no sex differences in Bdnf mRNA levels were observed in WT mice, and the levels tended to be lower in female 5xFAD mice. Additionally, a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of full-length tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), a BDNF receptor, was found in female 5xFAD mice at 6 months, while mRNA levels of the truncated TrkB were increased in both male and female 5xFAD mice. Specifically, among the Bdnf mRNA splice variants, the levels of Bdnf exon IIA-IX, exon IIB-IX, exon IIC-IX, and exon IXA mRNA were significantly higher in female WT mice compared to male WT mice at 3 months, but this difference was lost in female 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest that the expression of specific Bdnf splice variants would be maintained at higher levels in the hippocampus of young female mice than in males but may be disrupted in AD model mice. Our study may provide insights into the relationship between sex differences in AD onset and BDNF expression.
