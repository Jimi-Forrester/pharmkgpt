35209993|t|Delirium in the Neonate.
35209993|a|Delirium is likely present in the neonatal intensive care unit and has been largely unrecognized. There are several risk factors for delirium including illness severity, neurosedative exposure, and environmental disruptions that put infants at risk for delirium. Regular use of scoring systems should be considered to improve delirium detection. When identified, initial steps in management should include resolving underlying causes and implementation of standard nonpharmacologic measures. Mounting pediatric evidence suggests that the atypical antipsychotics, as well as the alpha-2 agonists, may be additionally beneficial in treating delirium as well as improving the ability to wean off other neurosedative medications.
