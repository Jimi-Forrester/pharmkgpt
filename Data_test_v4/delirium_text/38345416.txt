38345416|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Purpose of this review is to update the ongoing work in the field of glymphatic and neurodegenerative research and to highlight focus areas that are particularly promising. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple reports have over the past decade documented that glymphatic fluid transport is broadly suppressed in neurodegenerative diseases. Most studies have focused on Alzheimer's disease using a variety of preclinical disease models, whereas the clinical work is based on various neuroimaging approaches. It has consistently been reported that brain fluid transport is impaired in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease compared with age-matched control subjects. SUMMARY: An open question in the field is to define the mechanistic underpinning of why glymphatic function is suppressed. Other questions include the opportunities for using glymphatic imaging for diagnostic purposes and in treatment intended to prevent or slow Alzheimer disease progression.
