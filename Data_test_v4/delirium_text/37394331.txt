37394331|t|Impact of Anesthesia selection on Post-Op Pain Management in Operatively treated Hip Fractures.
37394331|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine if the use of Peripheral Nerve Block (PNB) versus Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) for hip fracture patients, affected opioid consumption in the early post-operative period. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Two level 1 trauma centers PATIENTS/INTERVENTION: 588 patients with surgically treated AO/OTA 31A and 31B fractures between February 2016-October 2017 were included. 415 (70.6%) received general anesthesia (GA) alone, 152 received GA plus perioperative PNB (25.9%), and 21 had GA plus LIA intra-operatively (3.6%). Median age was 82 years; predominantly female (67%) and AO/OTA 31A fractures (55.37%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, length of stay (LOS) and the occurrence of any complication after surgery RESULTS: The PNB cohort was less likely to use any opioid than the GA group at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.22-0.61 and OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.35-0.89 respectively). LOS >= 10 days had 3.24 times the odds of 24- and 48-hour opioid administration compared to LOS <= 10 days (OR: 3.24, 95% CI 1.11-9.42; OR: 2.98, 95% CI 1.38-6.41, respectively). The most common complication was post-operative delirium, with PNB more likely to present with any complication compared to GA (OR= 1.88, 95% CI 1.09-3.26). There was no difference when comparing LIA to general anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest PNB for hip fracture can help limit the use of post-operative opioids with adequate pain relief. Regional analgesia does not seem to avoid complications such as delirium.
