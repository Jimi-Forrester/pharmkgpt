8545544|a|The present paper proposes that trophic interplay among cells may represent the final common pathway for both genetic and environmental influences, and hence new criteria for the understanding of central nervous system (CNS) connectivity can be suggested. In particular, trophic signals may make up the common "language" through which genetic and epigenetic influences mold the CNS during development and the adult life. Furthermore, it will put forward the hypothesis that the developmental trophic interplay among cells leads to the formation of trophic units in the adult brain. A trophic unit is defined as the smallest set of cells, within the CNS, which act in a complementary way to support each other's trophism. The trophic units consist of neurons, glial cells, blood vessels, extracellular matrix (ECM). In particular, ECM gives support to the thin elongated cell processes and gives rise to selective chemical bridges between cell surfaces or between cell surfaces and the extracellular milieu. The trophic unit is a plastic device that not only assures neuronal survival, but also operates to adapt neuronal networks to new tasks by controlling extension of neuronal processes, synapse turnover and ECM characteristics. These plastic responses depend on the interplay of all the elements that constitute the trophic units. The concept of trophic unit may help to understand some features of neurodegenerative diseases, for example, the clustering of tangles in the neocortex and in the entorhinal cortex of Alzheimer's patients [corrected].
