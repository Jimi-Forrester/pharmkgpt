38959711|t|Developing AAV-delivered nonsense suppressor tRNAs for neurological disorders.
38959711|a|Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy is a clinical stage therapeutic modality for neurological disorders. A common genetic defect in myriad monogenic neurological disorders is nonsense mutations that account for about 11% of all human pathogenic mutations. Stop codon readthrough by suppressor transfer RNA (sup-tRNA) has long been sought as a potential gene therapy approach to target nonsense mutations, but hindered by inefficient in vivo delivery. The rapid advances in AAV delivery technology have not only powered gene therapy development but also enabled in vivo preclinical assessment of a range of nucleic acid therapeutics, such as sup-tRNA. Compared with conventional AAV gene therapy that delivers a transgene to produce therapeutic proteins, AAV-delivered sup-tRNA has several advantages, such as small gene sizes and operating within the endogenous gene expression regulation, which are important considerations for treating some neurological disorders. This review will first examine sup-tRNA designs and delivery by AAV vectors. We will then analyze how AAV-delivered sup-tRNA can potentially address some neurological disorders that are challenging to conventional gene therapy, followed by discussing available mouse models of neurological diseases for in vivo preclinical testing. Potential challenges for AAV-delivered sup-tRNA to achieve therapeutic efficacy and safety will also be discussed.
