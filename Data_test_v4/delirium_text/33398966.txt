33398966|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common neurodegenerative diseases in human. The pathogenesis of AD and PD is complex, and the current drugs and surgical treatments have not successfully alleviated or terminated the progression of the diseases. The lentiviral vector (LV) is a retroviral vector. In recent years, LV mediated gene therapy has been a hotspot to study the mechanisms of human disease and clinical drug discovery. This review summarizes the recent progresses in the treatment of AD and PD by the application of LV, and offers a prospect for its application.
