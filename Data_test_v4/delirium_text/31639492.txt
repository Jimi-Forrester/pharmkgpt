31639492|a|Most neurodegenerative diseases show a disruption of autophagic function and display abnormal accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that promotes cellular stress and death. Therefore, induction of autophagy has been proposed as a reasonable strategy to help neurons clear abnormal protein aggregates and survive. The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major regulator of the autophagic process and is regulated by starvation, growth factors, and cellular stressors. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which promotes cellular survival, is the main modulator upstream of mTOR, and alterations in this pathway are common in neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present work we revised mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway and mTORC2 as a complementary an important element in mTORC1 signaling. In addition, we revised the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which has become relevant in the regulation of the autophagic process and cellular survival through mTORC2 signaling. Finally, we summarize novel compounds that promote autophagy and neuronal protection in the last five years.
