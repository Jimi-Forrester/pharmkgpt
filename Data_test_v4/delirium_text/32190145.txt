32190145|a|Although Alois Alzheimer described myelin disruption in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as early as in 1911, his observation has escaped the attention of researchers since that time. Alzheimer's disease has been mainly considered as a grey matter disorder; nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that myelin impairment may play an important role in AD pathology. Classical neuropathological changes in AD, e.g. the accumulation of aggregated Abeta 42 and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, are responsible for neuronal loss, but they may also induce death of oligodendrocytes and myelin damage. There is also evidence that myelin pathology may even precede Abeta and tau pathologies in AD. The state of the art does not allow us to determine whether myelin damage is a primary or a secondary injury in AD subjects. The article presents an overview of current knowledge on the role of myelin in AD pathology and its interactions with Abeta and tau pathologies.
