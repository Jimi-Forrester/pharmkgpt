10075702|t|Heparin-induced conformational change in microtubule-associated protein Tau as detected by chemical cross-linking and phosphopeptide mapping.
10075702|a|In Alzheimer's disease, microtubule-associated protein tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated and aggregates into paired helical filaments. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate were shown to accumulate in pretangle neurons, stimulate in vitro tau phosphorylation, and cause tau aggregation into paired helical filament-like filaments. The sulfated glycosaminoglycan-tau interaction was suggested to be the central event in the development of neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease brain (Goedert, M., Jakes, R., Spillantini, M. G., Hasegawa, M., Smith, M. J., and Crowther, R. A. (1996) Nature 383, 550-553). The biochemical mechanism by which sulfated glycosaminoglycans stimulate tau phosphorylation and cause tau aggregation remains unclear. In this study, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a bifunctional chemical cross-linker, cross-linked tau dimers, tetramers, high molecular size aggregates, and two tau species of sizes 72 and 83 kDa in the presence of heparin. In the absence of heparin only dimeric tau was cross-linked by DSS. Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration revealed that 72- and 83-kDa species were formed by intramolecular cross-linking of tau by DSS. These observations indicate that heparin, in addition to causing aggregation, also induces a conformational change in tau in which reactive groups are unmasked or move closer leading to the DSS cross-linking of 72- and 83-kDa species. Heparin-induced structural changes in tau molecule depended on time of heparin exposure. Dimerization and tetramerization peaked at 48 h, whereas conformational change was completed within 30 min of heparin exposure. Heparin exposure beyond 48 h caused an abrupt aggregation of tau into high molecular size species. Heparin stimulated tau phosphorylation by neuronal cdc2-like kinase (NCLK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphopeptide sequencing revealed that tau is phosphorylated by NCLK on Thr212 and Thr231 and by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on Ser262 only in the presence of heparin. Heparin stimulation of tau phosphorylation by NCLK showed dependence on time of heparin exposure and correlated with the heparin-induced conformational change of tau. Our data suggest that heparin-induced conformational change exposes new sites for phosphorylation within tau molecule.
