37631077|t|Chemistry and Pharmacology of Fluorinated Drugs Approved by the FDA (2016-2022).
37631077|a|Fluorine is characterized by high electronegativity and small atomic size, which provide this molecule with the unique property of augmenting the potency, selectivity, metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetics of drugs. Fluorine (F) substitution has been extensively explored in drug research as a means of improving biological activity and enhancing chemical or metabolic stability. Selective F substitution onto a therapeutic or diagnostic drug candidate can enhance several pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties such as metabolic stability and membrane permeation. The increased binding ability of fluorinated drug target proteins has also been reported in some cases. An emerging line of research on F substitution has been addressed by using 18F as a radiolabel tracer atom in the extremely sensitive methodology of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This review aims to report on the fluorinated drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2016 to 2022. It cites selected examples from a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic drugs. FDA-approved drugs in this period have a variety of heterocyclic cores, including pyrrole, pyrazole, imidazole, triazole, pyridine, pyridone, pyridazine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, triazine, purine, indole, benzimidazole, isoquinoline, and quinoline appended with either F-18 or F-19. Some fluorinated oligonucleotides were also authorized by the FDA between 2019 and 2022.
