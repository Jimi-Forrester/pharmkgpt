39888133|t|MVP-VSASL: measuring MicroVascular Pulsatility using velocity-selective arterial spin labeling.
39888133|a|PURPOSE: By leveraging the small-vessel specificity of velocity-selective arterial spin labeling (VSASL), we present a novel technique for measuring cerebral MicroVascular Pulsatility named MVP-VSASL. THEORY AND METHODS: We present a theoretical model relating the pulsatile, cerebral blood flow-driven VSASL signal to the microvascular pulsatility index (  PI $$  mathrm{PI} $$  ), a widely used metric for quantifying cardiac-dependent fluctuations. The model describes the dependence of the  PI $$  mathrm{PI} $$  of VSASL signal (denoted   PI VS  $$ { mathrm{PI}}_{ mathrm{VS}} $$  ) on bolus duration  tau $$  tau $$  (an adjustable VSASL sequence parameter) and provides guidance for selecting a value of  tau $$  tau $$  that maximizes the SNR of the   PI VS  $$ { mathrm{PI}}_{ mathrm{VS}} $$  measurement. The model predictions were assessed in humans using data acquired with retrospectively cardiac-gated VSASL sequences over a broad range of  tau $$  tau $$  values. In vivo measurements were also used to demonstrate the feasibility of whole-brain voxel-wise pulsatility mapping, assess intrasession repeatability of   PI VS  $$ { mathrm{PI}}_{ mathrm{VS}} $$  , and illustrate the potential of this method to explore an association with age. RESULTS: The theoretical model showed excellent agreement to the empirical data in a gray matter region of interest (average   R 2  $$ { mathrm{R}}^2 $$  value of 0.898  +- $$  pm $$  0.107 across six subjects). We further showed excellent intrasession repeatability of the pulsatility measurement (  ICC = 0.960 $$  mathrm{ICC}=0.960 $$  ,  p < 0.001 $$ p<0.001 $$  ) and the potential to characterize associations with age (  r = 0.554 $$ r=0.554 $$  ,  p = 0.021 $$ p=0.021 $$  ). CONCLUSION: We have introduced a novel, VSASL-based cerebral microvascular pulsatility technique, which may facilitate investigation of cognitive disorders where damage to the microvasculature has been implicated.
