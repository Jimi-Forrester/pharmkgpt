34007310|t|Cis-acting: A pattern of lncRNAs for gene regulation in induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with Down syndrome determined by integrative analysis of lncRNA and mRNA profiling data.
34007310|a|Down syndrome (DS), caused by the trisomy of chromosome 21, is one of the common chromosomal disorders, the main clinical manifestations of which are delayed nervous development and intellectual disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have critical roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, cell cycle regulation and differentiation. The roles of abnormally expressed lncRNAs have been previously reported; however, the biological functions and regulatory patterns of lncRNAs in DS have remained largely elusive. The aim of the present study was to perform a whole-genome-wide identification of lncRNAs and mRNAs associated with DS. In addition, global expression profiling analysis of DS-induced pluripotent stem cells was performed and differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened. Furthermore, the target genes and functions of the DE lncRNAs were predicted using Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathway enrichment analysis. The results revealed that the majority of the lncRNAs exerted functions in DS via cis-acting target genes. In addition, the results of the enrichment analysis indicated that these target genes were mainly involved in nervous and muscle development in DS. In conclusion, this integrative analysis using lncRNA and mRNA profiling provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of DS and it may promote the diagnosis and development of novel therapeutics for this disease.
