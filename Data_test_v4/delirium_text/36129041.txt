36129041|t|Gait in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.
36129041|a|Background Gait is a complex task requiring coordinated efforts of multiple brain networks. To date, there is little evidence on whether gait is altered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]). Conclusions CAA is associated with slower walking, abnormal rhythm, and greater gait variability than in healthy controls. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms underlying gait impairments in CAA, and whether they predict future falls.
