37692743|t|Sarcopenia and Related Functional Outcomes Following Hip Surgery Among Egyptian Geriatric Patients With Hip Fracture.
37692743|a|Background Sarcopenia is highly prevalent among elderly patients with hip fracture. Studies reported a significant association between sarcopenia and clinical outcomes in patients with hip fractures. The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia among elderly patients with hip fracture and its effect on short-term functional outcomes, highlighting predictors of postoperative functional decline.  Methods This is a cross-sectional study followed by a prospective cohort. Elderly patients (60 years and above) with hip fractures were recruited from the orthopedic department. Patients were followed by the ortho-geriatric team in the perioperative period and for three postoperative months. Patients were subjected to comprehensive geriatric assessment including a full history and physical examination. In the preoperative state and after three months of follow-up the following were assessed: functional independence using the Barthel index (BI); nutritional state using a checklist named DETERMINE Your Nutritional Health; sarcopenia using the SARC-F questionnaire assessing strength, ambulation, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and fall history. Perioperative risk assessment and post-discharge care were obtained through medical records and by questioning patients or families. Preoperative sarcopenia was confirmed using the Ishii equation which is an equation that includes (age, calf circumference, and hand grip strength). Results Preoperative sarcopenia screening showed that 29.3% of patients suffered sarcopenia by SARC-F questionnaire and 28.6% by Ishii equation score. At the end of the follow-up, 57.9% of patients suffered sarcopenia by SARC-F questionnaire. There was a marked post-fracture decline in independence level; 52.1% had slight dependence in function, 27.1% had moderate dependence in function, and 20.7% had total dependence in function. Conclusion This study gives us the chance for a greater understanding of the negative effects of sarcopenia on the outcomes following hip fracture surgery in the geriatric population. It shows a prevalence of sarcopenia among the elderly with hip fractures at 29.3%. The elderly experience a marked post-fracture decline in their level of independence concerning basic activities of daily living. Those with older age, higher comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and functional dependence with poor nutritional state are more vulnerable to functional decline. Other perioperative risks include delayed surgery, surgery type, postoperative complications, longer hospital stays, lack of planned rehabilitative and nutritional plans, and postoperative depression. Early detection of sarcopenia helps establish early interventional plans to reverse such poor outcomes.
