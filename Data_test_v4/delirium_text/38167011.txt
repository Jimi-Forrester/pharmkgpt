METHODS: Gene expression profiles GSE5281 and GSE28146 were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus database to acquire differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment were conducted using DAVID online tool. The STRING database and Cytoscape tools were employed to analyze protein-protein interactions and identify hub genes. The predictive value of hub genes was assessed by principal component analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. AD mice model was constructed, and histology was then observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Gene expression levels were finally determined by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We obtained 197 overlapping DEGs from GSE5281 and GSE28146 datasets. After constructing protein-protein interaction network, three highly interconnected clusters were identified and 6 hub genes (RBL1, BUB1, HDAC7, KAT5, SIRT2, and ITGB1) were selected. The hub genes could be used as basis to predict AD. Histological abnormalities of brain were observed, suggesting successful AD model was constructed. Compared with the control group, the mRNA expression levels of RBL1, BUB1, HDAC7, KAT5 and SIRT2 were significantly increased, while the mRNA expression level of ITGB1 was significantly decreased in AD groups. CONCLUSION: RBL1, BUB1, HDAC7, KAT5, SIRT2 and ITGB1 are promising gene signatures for diagnosis and therapy of AD.
