38914219|t|The role of CRMP4 in LPS-induced neuroinflammation.
38914219|a|Neuroinflammation has been gaining attention as one of the potential causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in recent years. The suppression of excessive proinflammatory responses is expected to be a target for the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) is involved in cytoskeleton-associated axonal guidance in the developing brain. Recently, the involvement of CRMP4 in several pathological conditions, including inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a widely used inflammatory molecule, has been reported. However, the role of CRMP4 in LPS-induced inflammation in vivo remains largely unknown. In this study, we generated microglia-specific CRMP4 knockout mice for the first time and examined the role of CRMP4 in an LPS-induced brain inflammation model. We found that microglia after LPS injection in substantia nigra was significantly reduced in Crmp4-/- mice compared to Crmp4+/+mice. The increased expression of IL-10 in striatum samples was downregulated in Crmp4-/- mice. A significant reduction in Iba1 expression was also observed in microglia-specific Crmp4 knockout mice compared with that in control mice. In contrast, the expression of IL-10 did not change in these mice, whereas arginase 1 (Arg1) expression was significantly suppressed. These results demonstrate the involvement of CRMP4 in LPS-induced inflammation in vivo, that CRMP4 suppresses microglial proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner.
