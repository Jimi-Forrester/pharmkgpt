39244800|a|PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the predictive accuracy of SOFA, MODS, and LODS scores in determining the mortality of elderly undergoing open heart surgery with delirium. METHODS: A prospective study involved 111 elderly patients who met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected using scoring systems: SOFA, MODS, and LODS. RESULTS: Upon final follow-up, 86.5 % of the patients had recovered, 13.5 % had died. Sensitivity, specificity, negative, and positive predictive values for predicting mortality in elderly patients were calculated for the SOFA score as 99 %, 73 %, 98 %, and 76 %, respectively. For the MODS score, these values were 95 %, 60 %, 95 %, and 67 %; for the LODS score, they were 92 %, 73 %, 92 %, and 75 %, respectively. The overall accuracy of the three scores-SOFA, MODS, and LODS-was 84 %, 76 %, and 82 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the SOFA score exhibited the highest sensitivity and specificity in predicting mortality among elderly individuals.
