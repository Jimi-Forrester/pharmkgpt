31712736|t|Identification and characterization of circular RNAs in Ganoderma lucidum.
31712736|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in animals, plants, and fungi. However, no circRNAs have been reported in Ganoderma lucidum. Here, we carried out a genome-wide identification of the circRNAs in G.lucidum using RNA-Seq data, and analyzed their features. In total, 250 and 2193 circRNAs were identified from strand-specific RNA-seq data generated from the polyA(-) and polyA(-)/RNase R-treated libraries, respectively. Six of 131 (4.58%) predicted circRNAs were experimentally confirmed. Across three developmental stages, 731 exonic circRNAs (back spliced read counts >= 5) and their parent genes were further analyzed. CircRNAs were preferred originating from exons with flanking introns, and the lengths of the flanking intron were longer than those of the control introns. A total of 200 circRNAs were differentially expressed across the three developmental stages of G. lucidum. The expression profiles of 119 (16.3%) exonic circRNAs and their parent genes showed significant positive correlations (r >= 0.9, q < 0.01), whereas 226 (30.9%) exonic circRNAs and their parent genes exhibited significant negative correlations (r <= -0.9, q < 0.01), in which 53 parent genes are potentially involved in the transcriptional regulation, polysaccharide biosynthesis etc. Our results indicated that circRNAs are present in G. lucidum, with potentially important regulatory roles.
