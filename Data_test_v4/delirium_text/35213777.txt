35213777|a|The past few years have seen an explosion in sensitive and specific assays for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, as well as some novel assays based on pathological seed-induced protein misfolding in patient samples. Here, I review this exciting field that promises to transform dementia diagnostics and disease monitoring. I discuss data on biomarkers for amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and glial activation, mention the most promising biomarkers for alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 pathology, and highlight the need for further research into common co-pathologies. Finally, I consider practical aspects of blood-based biomarker-supported AD diagnostics and emphasize the importance of biomarker interpretation in a full clinical context.
