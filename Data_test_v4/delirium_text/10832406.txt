10832406|t|[The role of nitric oxide and other free radicals in ischemic brain pathology].
10832406|a|Nitric oxide (NO), an intercellular messenger and a normal metabolic product, takes an active part in the regulation of physiologically significant functions of the cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems. At the same time when produced in excess amounts, NO as a free radical and an agent that gives rise to highly toxic oxidants (peroxynitrile, nitric dioxide, nitron ion), becomes a cause of neuronal damage and death in some brain lesions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea). Numerous experimental data show the ambiguous effects of NO on the development of cerebral infarct. NO as an active vasodilatory and antithrombogenic agent may reduce cerebral damage in early ischemia. There is evidence for the involvement of NO in the body's adaptation to oxygen starvation and ischemic tolerance formation. In the postischemic period, NO is a major factor of neuronal necrosis and apoptosis. The currently established ideas on the processes of cerebral NO production and on the pathogenetic mechanisms of this agent's cytotoxicity open up new vistas for selective blockers of various NO synthesis enzymes (neuronal, endothelial, glial cellular, and macrophagal and neutrophilic NO synthases) used in the treatment of acute vascular abnormalities of the central nervous system.
