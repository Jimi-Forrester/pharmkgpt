28655199|a|The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is advanced age, but the reason for this association remains unclear. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) primarily after APP is internalized by clathrin-mediated or clathrin-independent endocytosis. Changes in endocytosis in AD have been identified. We hypothesized that endocytic protein expression is altered during ageing, thus influencing the likelihood of developing AD by increasing Abeta production. We explored how levels of endocytic proteins, APP, its metabolites, secretase enzymes, and tau varied with age in cortical brain samples from men of three age ranges (young [20-30], middle aged [45-55], and old [70-90]) with no symptoms of dementia. Abeta40 and Abeta42 were significantly increased in old brains, while APP and secretase expression was unaffected by age. Phosphorylated GSK3beta increased significantly with age, a possible precursor for neurofibrillary tangle production, although phosphorylated tau was undetectable. Significant increases in clathrin, dynamin-1, AP180, Rab-5, caveolin-2, and flotillin-2 were seen in old brains. Rab-5 also increased in middle-aged brains prior to changes in Abeta levels. This age-related increase in endocytic protein expression, not described previously, suggests an age-related upregulation of endocytosis which could predispose older individuals to develop AD by increasing APP internalization and Abeta generation.
