34436057|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, irreversible, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. The main pathological feature of AD is the deposition of misfolded beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plaques in the brain. The abnormal accumulation of Abeta plaques leads to the loss of some neuron functions, further causing the neuron entanglement and the corresponding functional damage, which has a great impact on memory and cognitive functions. Hence, studying the accumulation mechanism of Abeta in the brain and its effect on other tissues is of great significance for the early diagnosis of AD. The current clinical studies of Abeta accumulation mainly rely on medical imaging techniques, which have some deficiencies in sensitivity and specificity. Optical imaging has recently become a research hotspot in the medical field and clinical applications, manifesting noninvasiveness, high sensitivity, absence of ionizing radiation, high contrast, and spatial resolution. Moreover, it is now emerging as a promising tool for the diagnosis and study of Abeta buildup. This review focuses on the application of the optical imaging technique for the determination of Abeta plaques in AD research. In addition, recent advances and key operational applications are discussed.
