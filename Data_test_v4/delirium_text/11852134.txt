11852134|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder that has been intensively studied over the last several years. In vitro and in vivo studies have led to an understanding of some of the physico-chemical properties of amyloid, a well-characterized hallmark of AD. Clioquinol is a drug that acts on amyloid by perturbing amyloid's metallo-chemistry, and Clioquinol treatment has been shown to be beneficial in a mouse model of AD. This short review examines the recent studies relating to Clioquinol and AD, and anticipates the imminent results of a Phase II trial of Clioquinol in AD, due in March 2002.
