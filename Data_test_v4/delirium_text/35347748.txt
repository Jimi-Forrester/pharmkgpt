35347748|t|Predictors of prolonged admission after outpatient female pelvic reconstructive surgery.
35347748|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine factors associated with prolonged hospital admission following outpatient female pelvic reconstructive surgery (FPRS) and associated adverse clinical outcomes. METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we identified outpatient FPRS performed 2011-2016. Isolated hysterectomy without concurrent prolapse repair was excluded. Surgeries were classified as major or minor for analysis. The primary outcome was prolonged length of stay (LOS), defined as admission of >=2 days. Secondary outcomes included complications, readmission and reoperation associated with prolonged LOS. We abstracted data on covariates, and following univariable analysis, performed backward stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 29645 women were included: 12311 (41.5%) major and 17334 (58.5%) minor procedures. A total of 6.9% (2033) had a prolonged LOS. On full cohort multivariable regression analysis, patient characteristics associated with prolonged LOS were older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.1 per 10 years, confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.1, p < 0.001), frailty (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.6, p = 0.001), and Caucasian race (OR: 1.2, CI: 1.02-1.3, p = 0.024). Associated surgical factors included having a major surgical procedure (OR: 1.3, CI: 1.2-1.4, p < 0.001), use of general anesthesia (OR: 2.0, CI: 1.5-2.6, p < 0.001) and longer operative time (OR: 2.0, CI: 1.8-2.2, p < 0.001). The occurrence of any complication (10.3% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.001), hospital readmission (4.3% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001), and reoperation (2.7% vs. 1.0%, p < 0.001) were more likely with prolonged LOS. CONCLUSIONS: After outpatient FPRS, 6.9% of patients experience an admission of >=2 days. Prolonged LOS is more common in patients who are older, frail and Caucasian, and in those who have major surgery with long operative time and general anesthesia.
