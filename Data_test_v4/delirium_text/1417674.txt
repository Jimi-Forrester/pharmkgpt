1417674|a|A reduction in the activity of cytochrome oxidase, a respiratory chain enzyme, has been recently identified in mitochondria from blood platelets and postmortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We have developed an animal model of this deficit in rats by chronic subcutaneous infusion of sodium azide, a selective inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase, delivered via Alzet 2ML4 osmotic minipumps. In previous work, azide-treated rats were impaired in an appetitively motivated spatial learning task, the radial arm maze. In the present investigation, we tested male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g), which were tonically infused with azide or saline, on an aversively motivated spatial task, the Morris water maze. Azide-treated rats were impaired on both acquisition and retention of this task, without showing evidence of a motor impairment. Thus, the present results are consistent with previous findings showing that chronic azide treatment produces a learning and memory deficit. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that azide treatment in rats produces a useful animal model of some aspects of AD.
