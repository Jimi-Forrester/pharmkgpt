33921279|t|Genetic Architecture and Molecular, Imaging and Prodromic Markers in Dementia with Lewy Bodies: State of the Art, Opportunities and Challenges.
33921279|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common causes of dementia and belongs to the group of alpha-synucleinopathies. Due to its clinical overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders and its high clinical heterogeneity, the clinical differential diagnosis of DLB from other similar disorders is often difficult and it is frequently underdiagnosed. Moreover, its genetic etiology has been studied only recently due to the unavailability of large cohorts with a certain diagnosis and shows genetic heterogeneity with a rare contribution of pathogenic mutations and relatively common risk factors. The rapid increase in the reported cases of DLB highlights the need for an easy, efficient and accurate diagnosis of the disease in its initial stages in order to halt or delay the progression. The currently used diagnostic methods proposed by the International DLB consortium rely on a list of criteria that comprises both clinical observations and the use of biomarkers. Herein, we summarize the up-to-now reported knowledge on the genetic architecture of DLB and discuss the use of prodromal biomarkers as well as recent promising candidates from alternative body fluids and new imaging techniques.
