36072674|t|Development and validation of immune-based biomarkers and deep learning models for Alzheimer's disease.
36072674|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in old age and poses a severe threat to the health and life of the elderly. However, traditional diagnostic methods and the ATN diagnostic framework have limitations in clinical practice. Developing novel biomarkers and diagnostic models is necessary to complement existing diagnostic procedures. Methods: The AD expression profile dataset GSE63060 was downloaded from the NCBI GEO public database for preprocessing. AD-related differentially expressed genes were screened using a weighted co-expression network and differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis was performed. Subsequently, we screened hub genes by random forest, analyzed the correlation between hub genes and immune cells using ssGSEA, and finally built an AD diagnostic model using an artificial neural network and validated it. Results: Based on the random forest algorithm, we screened a total of seven hub genes from AD-related DEGs, based on which we confirmed that hub genes play an essential role in the immune microenvironment and successfully established a novel diagnostic model for AD using artificial neural networks, and validated its effectiveness in the publicly available datasets GSE63060 and GSE97760. Conclusion: Our study establishes a reliable model for screening and diagnosing AD that provides a theoretical basis for adding diagnostic biomarkers for the AD gene.
