We aimed to explore the impact of ACEs on HGS among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with data extracted from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative survey with respondents recruited from 450 villages/urban communities of 28 provinces. Participants aged 45 years or older were drawn from the CHARLS 2014 life history survey and the 2015 health survey. Twelve ACE indicators before the age of 17 years were collected. HGS was measured with a dynamometer and the maximum value of HGS obtained from both hands was used in the analyses. Low muscle strength (LMS) was defined according to the recommendation of European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the association of ACEs with continuous HGS and LMS, with adjustment for age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, area of residence, smoking and drinking status, body mass index, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, hip fracture, and memory-related disease. RESULTS: Of the 7209 eligible participants, 2258 (31.3%) had experienced three or more ACEs. Compared to individuals without ACEs, exposure to >= 3 ACEs was negatively associated with continuous HGS in kilogram (beta = -0.93, 95% CI: -1.37, -0.49) and positively associated with the risk of LMS (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.61). Such associations were consistently found both in men and women who had experienced three or more ACEs. Significant dose-response relationship between the number of ACEs and outcomes was also observed in the overall population and different sex groups. CONCLUSION: Exposure to ACEs was associated with lower HGS and increased risk of LMS among middle-aged and older Chinese adults, indicating the importance of intervention in individuals with experience of ACEs in order to mitigate its detrimental impact on HGS and promote healthy ageing.
