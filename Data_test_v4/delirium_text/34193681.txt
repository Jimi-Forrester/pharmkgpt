34193681|a|Ninjin-yoei-to (NYT), a Kampo medicine, has ameliorative effects on cognitive dysfunction via enhancing cholinergic neuron activity. To explore an efficacy of NYT administration for prevention and cure of Alzheimer's disease, here we examined the effect of NYT on amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42)-induced neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus. A diet containing 3% NYT was administered to mice for 2 weeks and human Abeta1-42 was intracerebroventricularly injected. Neurodegeneration in the dentate granule cell layer of the hippocampus, which was determined 2 weeks after the injection, was rescued by administration of the diet for 4 weeks. Abeta staining (uptake) was not modified in the dentate granule cell layer by pre-administration of the diet for 2 weeks, while Abeta1-42-induced increase in intracellular Zn2+ was reduced, suggesting that pre-administration of NYT prior to Abeta injection is effective for reducing Abeta1-42-induced Zn2+ toxicity in the dentate gyrus. As a matter of fact, Abeta1-42-induced neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus was rescued by pre-administration of NYT. Interestingly, the level of metallothioneins, intracellular Zn2+-binding proteins, which can capture Zn2+ from Zn-Abeta1-42 complexes, was elevated in the dentate granule cell layer by pre-administration of NYT. The present study suggests that pre-administration of NYT prevents Abeta1-42-mediated neurodegeneration in the dentate gyurs by induced synthesis of metallothioneins, which reduces intracellular Zn2+ toxicity induced by Abeta1-42.
