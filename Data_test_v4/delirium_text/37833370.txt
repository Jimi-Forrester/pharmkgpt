37833370|a|For neurological disorders and diseases, functional and anatomical connectomes of the human brain can be used to better inform targeted interventions and treatment strategies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that captures spatio-temporal brain function through change in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals over time. FMRI can be used to study the functional connectome through the functional connectivity matrix; that is, Pearson's correlation matrix between time series from the regions of interest of an fMRI image. One approach to analysing functional connectivity is using partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate regression technique designed for high-dimensional predictor data. However, analysing functional connectivity with PLS ignores a key property of the functional connectivity matrix; namely, these matrices are positive definite. To account for this, we introduce a generalisation of PLS to Riemannian manifolds, called R-PLS, and apply it to symmetric positive definite matrices with the affine invariant geometry. We apply R-PLS to two functional imaging datasets: COBRE, which investigates functional differences between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls, and; ABIDE, which compares people with autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical controls. Using the variable importance in the projection statistic on the results of R-PLS, we identify key functional connections in each dataset that are well represented in the literature. Given the generality of R-PLS, this method has the potential to investigate new functional connectomes in the brain, and with future application to structural data can open up further avenues of research in multi-modal imaging analysis.
