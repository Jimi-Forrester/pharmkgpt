34656512|t|Factors Associated With Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Complex Head and Neck Flap Surgery.
34656512|a|PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium (PD) is a common and severe complication, following extensive surgery and prolonged stays in intensive care units (ICU). The study aimed to estimate the frequency of and identify risk factors for PD in a unified sample of head and neck surgery patients. METHODS: The investigators implemented a retrospective cohort study composing of patients undergoing free flap reconstructive surgery over 1 year. The predictor variables were identified as 146 general and periprocedural parameters. The primary outcome variable was PD (+ or -). Descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed to identify existing correlations between the predictive factors and PD and the P-value was set at .05. A logistic regression model (LRM) was created to adjust for possible confounding factors and reveal possible independent prognostic factors for the onset of PD. RESULTS: Hundred patients (group 1, 18 with PD+, group 2, 82 without PD) undergoing microvascular free flap (65 males, 35 females, mean age = 65 [range 18 to 84 years]) surgery were recruited. The investigators identified 15 variables that were statistically associated with PD. In the LRM, after adjusting for age, diabetes status, and preoperative TSH, free fibula transplants (FT) as type of surgery was associated with an increased risk for PD (FT, Odds Ratio (OR) 6.3 (1.6 to 25.7, P = .01). CONCLUSION: The investigators identified 15 variables associated with an increased risk of developing PD, one of which had a statistically significant association after adjusting for other variables in a LRM. Future research efforts should be devoted to assessing the use of these variables for predicting PD further. Since the use of FT showed to be an independent prognostic parameter for the development of PD in this study, patients receiving FT should get special attention in the first days after surgery to prevent PD and associated complications such as increased mortality and prolonged hospital stays.
