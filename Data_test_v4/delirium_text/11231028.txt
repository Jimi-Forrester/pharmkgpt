11231028|a|Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) deletion polymorphism was recently reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a way comparable to apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism in a family-based study. However, the association of A2M deletion polymorphism with AD has not been consistently replicated in successive case-controlled studies. In order to evaluate whether this A2M polymorphism is associated with AD in Koreans, we examined the frequencies of the A2M deletion (D) allele and D-bearing genotypes in a group of Koreans composed of 100 sporadic AD patients and 203 control subjects. The frequency of the deletion (D) allele (P=0.046) was significantly different between the total group of AD patients and the controls, although the frequency of the D-bearing genotypes did not attain significance (P=0.078). When the subjects were stratified according to age at onset, there was significant difference in the frequencies of the D allele (P=0.044) and D-bearing genotypes (P=0.041) between late-onset AD patients (> or =65 years) and the controls. However, no significant difference was observed between early-onset AD patients (<65 years) and the control group. Additionally, when we divided the late-onset AD and control subjects by APOE epsilon4 status, the difference of the A2M D allelic frequency was significant only in the APOE epsilon4 negative subjects (P=0.015). In conclusion, our data suggests that the A2M D allele is a modest risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD in Koreans, and the AD risk conferred by the A2M D allele increases in APOE epsilon4 negative subjects.
