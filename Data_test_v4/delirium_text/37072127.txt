37072127|t|The Association of Cognitive Impairment With Depressive Symptoms, Function, and Pain in Hospitalized Older Patients With Dementia.
37072127|a|This study examined the associations between cognition and depressive symptoms, function, and pain among hospitalized older patients with dementia. We utilized baseline data of 461 hospitalized older patients with dementia who participated in an intervention study implementing Family-centered Function-focused Care (Fam-FFC) and conducted stepwise linear regression. On average, the participants (males = 189; 41% and females = 272; 59%) were 81.64 years old (Standard Deviation, SD = 8.38). There was a statistically significant association of cognition with depressive symptoms (b = -0.184, p < .001), functional status (b = 1.324, p < .001), and pain (b = -0.045, p < .001) when controlling for covariates. This study utilized a large sample of a relatively underrepresented population, hospitalized older adults with dementia, and addressed a topic with great clinical significance. Specific focus on testing and implementing best practices or interventions to support the clinical outcomes, and the cognitive function of hospitalized older adults with dementia is warranted in both practice and research.
