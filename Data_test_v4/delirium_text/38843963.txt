38843963|a|INTRODUCTION: Timely diagnosis and prognostication of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are pivotal for effective intervention. Artificial intelligence (AI) in neuroradiology may aid in such appropriate diagnosis and prognostication. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of novel diffusion model-based AI for enhancing AD and MCI diagnosis through superresolution (SR) of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. METHODS: 1.5T brain MR scans of patients with AD or MCI and healthy controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI1) were superresolved to 3T using a novel diffusion model-based generative AI (d3T*) and a convolutional neural network-based model (c3T*). Comparisons of image quality to actual 1.5T and 3T MRI were conducted based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), naturalness image quality evaluator (NIQE), and Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE). Voxel-based volumetric analysis was then conducted to study whether 3T* images offered more accurate volumetry than 1.5T images. Binary and multiclass classifications of AD, MCI, and NC were conducted to evaluate whether 3T* images offered superior AD classification performance compared to actual 1.5T MRI. Moreover, CNN-based classifiers were used to predict conversion of MCI to AD, to evaluate the prognostication performance of 3T* images. The classification performances were evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROC). RESULTS: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) detected significant differences in image quality among the 1.5T, c3T*, d3T*, and 3T groups across all metrics. Both c3T* and d3T* showed superior image quality compared to 1.5T MRI in NIQE and BRISQUE with statistical significance. While the hippocampal volumes measured in 3T* and 3T images were not significantly different, the hippocampal volume measured in 1.5T images showed significant difference. 3T*-based AD classifications showed superior performance across all performance metrics compared to 1.5T-based AD classification. Classification performance between d3T* and actual 3T was not significantly different. 3T* images offered superior accuracy in predicting the conversion of MCI to AD than 1.5T images did. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion model-based MRI SR enhances the resolution of brain MR images, significantly improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy for AD and MCI. Superresolved 3T* images closely matched actual 3T MRIs in quality and volumetric accuracy, and notably improved the prediction performance of conversion from MCI to AD.
