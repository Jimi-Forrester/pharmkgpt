35955925|a|Obesity is a major risk factor of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The principal feature of dementia is a loss of neurons and brain atrophy. The mechanistic links between obesity and the neurodegenerative processes of dementias are not fully understood, but recent research suggests that obesity-related systemic inflammation and subsequent neuroinflammation may be involved. Adipose tissues release multiple proinflammatory molecules (fatty acids and cytokines) that impact blood and vessel cells, inducing low-grade systemic inflammation that can transition to tissues, including the brain. Inflammation in the brain-neuroinflammation-is one of key elements of the pathobiology of neurodegenerative disorders; it is characterized by the activation of microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, and by the structural and functional changes of other cells forming the brain parenchyma, including neurons. Such cellular changes have been shown in animal models with direct methods, such as confocal microscopy. In humans, cellular changes are less tangible, as only indirect methods such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are usually used. In these studies, obesity and low-grade systemic inflammation have been associated with lower volumes of the cerebral gray matter, cortex, and hippocampus, as well as altered tissue MR properties (suggesting microstructural variations in cellular and molecular composition). How these structural variations in the human brain observed using MR imaging relate to the cellular variations in the animal brain seen with microscopy is not well understood. This review describes the current understanding of neuroinflammation in the context of obesity-induced systemic inflammation, and it highlights need for the bridge between animal microscopy and human MR imaging studies.
