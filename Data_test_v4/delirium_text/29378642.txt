29378642|a|BACKGROUND: Oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau are increasing being recognized as key toxins in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We developed a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb), GW-23B7, that recognizes beta-sheet secondary structure on pathological oligomers of neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: The pentameric immunoglobulin M kappa chain (IgMkappap) we developed specifically distinguishes intra- and extracellular pathology in human AD brains. Purified GW-23B7 showed a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range for oligomeric Abeta and did not bind monomeric Abeta. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, it recognized oligomeric forms of both Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau. Aged triple-transgenic AD mice with both Abeta and tau pathology infused intraperitoneally for 2 months showed IgMkappap in the soluble brain homogenate, peaking at 24 h postinoculation. Treated mice exhibited significant cognitive rescue on radial arm maze testing compared with vehicle control-infused mice. Immunohistochemically, treatment resulted in a significant decrease of extracellular pathology. Biochemically, treatment resulted in significant reductions of oligomeric forms of Abeta and tau. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GW-23B7, an anti-beta-sheet conformational mAb humanized for clinical trials, may be an effective therapeutic agent for human AD.
