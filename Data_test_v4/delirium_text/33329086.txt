33329086|t|Multimodal Computational Modeling of Visual Object Recognition Deficits but Intact Repetition Priming in Schizophrenia.
33329086|a|The term perceptual closure refers to the neural processes responsible for "filling-in" missing information in the visual image under highly adverse viewing conditions such as fog or camouflage. Here we used a closure task that required the participants to identify barely recognizable fragmented line-drawings of common objects. Patients with schizophrenia have been shown to perform poorly on this task. Following priming, controls and importantly patients can complete the line-drawings at greater levels of fragmentation behaviorally, suggesting an improvement in their ability to perform the task. Closure phenomena have been shown to involve a distributed network of cortical regions, notably the lateral occipital complex (LOC) of the ventral visual stream, dorsal visual stream (DS), hippocampal formation (HIPP) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We have previously demonstrated the failure of closure processes in schizophrenia and shown that the dysregulation in the sensory information transmitted to the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in this failure. Here, using a multimodal imaging approach in patients, combining event related electrophysiological recordings (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of priming in perceptual closure. Using directed functional connectivity measures we demonstrate that priming modifies the network-level interactions between the nodes of closure processing in a manner that is functionally advantageous to patients resulting in the mitigation of their deficit in perceptual closure.
