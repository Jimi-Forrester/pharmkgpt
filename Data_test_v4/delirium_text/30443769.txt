30443769|t|Neuroprotective effects of exercise in rodent models of memory deficit and Alzheimer's.
30443769|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fastest growing neurodegenerative condition with no standard treatment. There are growing evidence about the beneficial effects of exercise in brain health promotion and slowing the cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to review the protective mechanisms of treadmill exercise in different models of rodent memory deficits. Online literature database, including PubMed-Medline, Scopus, Google scholar were searched from 2003 till 2017. Original article with English language were chosen according to following key words in the title: (exercise OR physical activity) AND (memory OR learning). Ninety studies were finally included in the qualitative synthesis. The results of these studies showed the protective effects of exercise on AD induced neurodegerative and neuroinflammatory process. Neuroperotective effects of exercise on the hippocampus seem to be increasing in immediate-early gene c-Fos expression in dentate gyrus; enhancing the Wnt3 expression and inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3beta expression; increasing the 5-bro-mo-2'-deoxyridine-positive and doublecortin-positive cells (dentate gyrus); increasing the level of astrocytes glial fibrillary acidic protein and decrease in S100B protein, increasing in blood brain barrier integrity; prevention of oxidative stress injury, inducing morphological changes in astrocytes in the stratum radiatum of cornu ammonis 1(CA1) area; increase in cell proliferation and suppress apoptosis in dentate gyrus; increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B expressions; enhancing the glycogen levels and normalizing the monocarboxylate transporter 2 expression.
