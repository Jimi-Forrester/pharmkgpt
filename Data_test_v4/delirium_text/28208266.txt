28208266|t|Link between Affinity and Cu(II) Binding Sites to Amyloid-beta Peptides Evaluated by a New Water-Soluble UV-Visible Ratiometric Dye with a Moderate Cu(II) Affinity.
28208266|a|Being able to easily determine the Cu(II) affinity for biomolecules of moderate affinity is important. Such biomolecules include amyloidogenic peptides, such as the well-known amyloid-beta peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the synthesis of a new water-soluble ratiometric Cu(II) dye with a moderate affinity (109 M-1 at pH 7.1) and the characterizations of the Cu(II) corresponding complex by X-ray crystallography, EPR, and XAS spectroscopic methods. UV-vis competition was performed on the Abeta peptide as well as on a wide series of modified peptides, leading to an affinity value of 1.6 x 109 M-1 at pH 7.1 for the Abeta peptide and to a coordination model for the Cu(II) site within the Abeta peptide that agrees with the one mostly accepted currently.
