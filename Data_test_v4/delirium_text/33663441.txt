33663441|a|BACKGROUND: Lichenoid drug eruption is rare and can mimic idiopathic lichen planus and other dermatoses. Clonazepam, a commonly used drug for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders and seizures, is known to be an unlikely cause of cutaneous adverse effects. Only one case report of LDE due to clonazepam has been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 81-year-old male patient with Alzheimer's disease developed a lichenoid eruption after taking clonazepam. He developed a violaceous scaly patch on his lower extremities, from both buttocks to the feet. The cutaneous eruption resolved 2 months after cessation of clonazepam and with initiation of corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: A skin eruption that develops after clonazepam administration can be a lichenoid drug eruption, which is less likely to resolve spontaneously and requires discontinuation of clonazepam administration.
