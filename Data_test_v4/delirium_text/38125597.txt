38125597|a|Medical food is consumed for the purpose of improving specific nutritional requirements or disease conditions, such as inflammation, diabetes, and cancer. It involves partial or exclusive feeding for fulfilling unique nutritional requirements of patients and is different from medicine, consisting of basic nutrients, such as polyphenols, vitamins, sugars, proteins, lipids, and other functional ingredients to nourish the patients. Recently, studies on extracellular vesicles (exosomes) with therapeutic and drug carrier potential have been actively conducted. In addition, there have been attempts to utilize exosomes as medical food components. Consequently, the application of exosomes is expanding in different fields with increasing research being conducted on their stability and safety. Herein, we introduced the current trends of medical food and the potential utilization of exosomes in them. Moreover, we proposed Medi-Exo, a exosome-based medical food. Furthermore, we comprehensively elucidate various disease aspects between medical food-derived exosomes (Medi-Exo) and therapeutic natural bionanocomposites. This review highlights the therapeutic challenges regarding Medi-Exo and its potential health benefits.
