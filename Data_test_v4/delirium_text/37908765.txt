37908765|a|Background: Distinguishing true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-induced abnormalities (eg, pseudo-progression (PP) after radiotherapy) on conventional MRI scans remains challenging in patients with a glioblastoma. We aimed to establish brain MRI phenotypes of glioblastomas early after treatment by combined analysis of structural and perfusion tumor characteristics and assessed the relation with recurrence rate and overall survival time. Methods: Structural and perfusion MR images of 67 patients at 3 months post-radiotherapy were visually scored by a neuroradiologist. In total 23 parameters were predefined and used for hierarchical clustering analysis. Progression status was assessed based on the clinical course of each patient 9 months after radiotherapy (or latest available). Multivariable Cox regression models were used to determine the association between the phenotypes, recurrence rate, and overall survival. Results: We established 4 subgroups with significantly different tumor MRI characteristics, representing distinct MRI phenotypes of glioblastomas: TP and PP rates did not differ significantly between subgroups. Regression analysis showed that patients in subgroup 1 (characterized by having mostly small and ellipsoid nodular enhancing lesions with some hyper-perfusion) had a significant association with increased mortality at 9 months (HR: 2.6 (CI: 1.1-6.3); P = .03) with a median survival time of 13 months (compared to 22 months of subgroup 2). Conclusions: Our study suggests that distinct MRI phenotypes of glioblastomas at 3 months post-radiotherapy can be indicative of overall survival, but does not aid in differentiating TP from PP. The early prognostic information our method provides might in the future be informative for prognostication of glioblastoma patients.
