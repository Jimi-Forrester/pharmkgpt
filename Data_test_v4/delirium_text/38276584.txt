38276584|t|Silver and Copper Complexes with Ibuprofen and Caffeine-Preparation and Evaluation of Their Selected Biological Effects.
38276584|a|Several organometallic complexes based on more than twenty different metals have already been approved for medical applications. The aim of the presented research was to obtain complexes of silver and copper with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen and xanthine alkaloid caffeine and evaluate selected aspects of their bioactivity and biosafety in terms of their future possible applications. The obtained complexes were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, UV-VIS spectroscopy, conductometry, elemental analysis, and bioassays. Cytotoxicity for normal human cells of the CCD-Co18 cell line was evaluated by determining the IC50 value, with metabolic and morphology assessments. It was observed that complexes containing ibuprofen and caffeine exhibited lower toxicity than those with ibuprofen only. Complexes with copper showed lower toxicity towards healthy human fibroblasts compared to silver-based compounds, with an IC50 above 140 mug mL-1. However, in the silver complexes, the presence of caffeine increased the potency of COX-2 inhibition. Antimicrobial effects against different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains were evaluated by MIC determination with values less than 20 mug mL-1.
