19559078|a|Only a small percentage of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is directly related to familial forms. The etiology of the most abundant, sporadic forms seems to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental compounds are now extensively studied for their possible contribution to neurodegeneration. Chemicals were found which were able to reproduce symptoms of known neurodegenerative diseases, others may either predispose to the onset of neurodegeneration, or exacerbate distinct pathogenic processes of these diseases. In any case, in vitro studies performed with models presenting various degrees of complexity have shown that many environmental compounds have the potential to cause neurodegeneration, through a variety of pathways similar to those described in neurodegenerative diseases. Since the population is exposed to a huge number of potentially neurotoxic compounds, there is an important need for rapid and efficient procedures for hazard evaluation. Xenobiotics elicit a cascade of reactions that, most of the time, involve numerous interactions between the different brain cell types. A reliable in vitro model for the detection of environmental toxins potentially at risk for neurodegenerative diseases should therefore allow maximal cell-cell interactions and multiparametric endpoints determination. The combined use of in vitro models and new analytical approaches using "omics" technologies should help to map toxicity pathways, and advance our understanding of the possible role of xenobiotics in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.
