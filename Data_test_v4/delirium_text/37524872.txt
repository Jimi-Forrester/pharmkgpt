37524872|a|Improving health and delaying aging is the focus of medical research. Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence is closely related to organic aging and the development of aging-related diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). m6A is a common RNA modification that plays an important role in regulating cell biological functions, and ALKBH5 is one of the key m6A demethylases. However, the role of m6A and ALKBH5 in MSC senescence is still unclear. Here, we found that the m6A level was enhanced and ALKBH5 expression was decreased in aging MSCs induced by multiple replications, H2O2 stimulation or UV irradiation. Downregulation of ALKBH5 expression facilitated MSC senescence by enhancing the stability of CYP1B1 mRNA and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, IGF2BP1 was identified as the m6A reader restraining the degradation of m6A-modified CYP1B1 mRNA. Furthermore, Alkbh5 knockout in MSCs aggravated spontaneous OA in mice, and overexpression of Alkbh5 improved the efficacy of MSCs in OA. Overall, this study revealed a novel mechanism of m6A in MSC senescence and identified promising targets to protect against aging and OA.
