28096957|a|OBJECTIVES: Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major risk factors of death globally. One of the most undeniable reasons of CVDs is metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is defined as a complex of diseases including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, obesity, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The use of complementary medicine such as traditional herbal species can be effective in treatment of MetS's complications. Cinnamomum verum (family Lauraceae) is a medicinal global plant which has been used daily by people all over the world. Positive effects of cinnamon in reducing blood pressure, plasma glucose, obesity and ameliorating dyslipidemia which represented in traditional medicine introduced it as probable decreasing MetS's complications agent. The aim of this review was to investigate the mechanisms of C. verum in reducing the MetS's complications and CVDs risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Persian Websites such as www.sid.ir with keywords search of cinnamon, cinnamomum, cinnamaldehyde, atherogenic, hypertension, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidemia have been included in this search. RESULTS: Clinical data and mechanisms of action of C. verum and its active ingredients that have been shown in this review indicated that cinnamon has protective effects against MetS's aspects in various ways. CONCLUSION: The use of this plant can be effective in reducing MetS's complications and its morbidity and mortality.
