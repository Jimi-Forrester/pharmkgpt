35137699|a|Patients with dementia can experience hallucinations and delusions because of their underlying neurodegenerative condition, a syndrome known as dementia-related psychosis. Dementia-related psychosis contributes to morbidity and mortality among patients with dementia and increases the burden on caregivers and the health care system. With no pharmacological treatment currently approved in the United States for this condition, patients are often treated off-label with antipsychotics. Though typical and atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated variable to modest efficacy in dementia-related psychosis, serious safety concerns arise with their use. Accordingly, clinical and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services guidelines recommend trying antipsychotics only when other therapies have failed and encourage treatment discontinuation of antipsychotics after 4 months to assess whether ongoing therapy is needed. Discontinuation of effective antipsychotic treatment, however, may increase the risk for relapse of symptoms and the associated morbidities that accompany relapse. A randomized medication withdrawal clinical trial design allows assessment of relapse risk after discontinuation and can provide initial information on longer-term safety of therapy for dementia-related psychosis. Given the substantial unmet need in this condition, new, well-tolerated therapies that offer acute and sustained reduction of symptoms while also preventing recurrence of symptoms of psychosis are critically needed.
