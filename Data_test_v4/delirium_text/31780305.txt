31780305|t|Structure activity relationship, 6-modified purine riboside analogues to activate hSTING, stimulator of interferon genes.
31780305|a|Twenty-nine nucleoside analogues have been synthesized and evaluated in a cell based assay for their ability to activate the human Stimulator of Interferon Genes (hSTING), a key protein of the innate immune defense. Some 6-O-alkyl nucleoside analogues activate hSTING without associated cytotoxicity. SAR and combination studies were performed to decipher possible activation mechanism. The described nucleoside hSTING activators represent first-in-class modulators of the innate immune defense; a highly relevant target for antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer or Alzheimer's disease treatments and may present advantages over other types of hSTING activators.
