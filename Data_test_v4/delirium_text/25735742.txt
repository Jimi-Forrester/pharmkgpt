25735742|t|Caregiving experiences of family members of persons with dementia in south India.
25735742|a|This study reports on the first phase of an investigation aimed at adapting The Savvy Caregiver program, a successful family caregiving curriculum developed in the United States, for application in South India. Thirty family members caring for a person with dementia were interviewed regarding their experiences as caregivers (CGs). Qualitative interviews were conducted with the family member at a geriatric clinic, while other diagnostic procedures were being carried out with the person with dementia. Findings from the study revealed that although family members understood the term CG, none could identify a word for CG in his or her language. There was little understanding of dementia as an illness. Family CGs reported feeling distressed, overwhelmed, and frustrated with caregiving. Caregivers were interested in an educational program, but many had unrealistic expectations for what they wanted to learn. The findings provide directions for adapting The Savvy Caregiver curriculum for Indian family CGs.
