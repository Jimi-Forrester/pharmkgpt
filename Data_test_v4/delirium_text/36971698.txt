36971698|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of a flexible visitation system in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A randomized, open-label, parallel group clinical trial was conducted. All patients admitted to the ICU of the Lanzhou University Second Hospital from April to June 2022 were enrolled. The enrolled patients were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group according to a computer-generated random sequence table. RESULTS: A total of 410 patients were admitted. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 140 patients were included in the experimental group (flexible visitation group) and 140 in the control group (normal visitation group). The average number of visitation minutes per day between the experimental group and the control group was 24.7 versus 23.9 min (p > 0.05).Among the outcome indicators, delirium occurred in 8 (5.7%) patients in the intervention group and in 24 (17.1%) patients in the control group (p = 0.003). Five complaints (mainly pressure ulcers) were received, with one in the experimental group and the others in the control group. There were 28 cases of nosocomial infection in the experimental group and 29 cases in the control group; therefore, the incidence of nosocomial infection was 20% versus 20.7% (p = 0.882). A total of 280 questionnaires were collected, with a retrieval rate of 100%. The satisfaction of patients in the experimental group and the control group was 98.6% and 92.1%, respectively (p = 0.011). The flexible visiting system reduced the ICU length of stay (LOS). The ICU LOS of the experimental group was 6 versus 8 days for the control group (p = 0.041). However, the flexible visiting system did not reduce the hospital stay (17 vs. 19 days, p = 0.923). CONCLUSION: Conducting a flexible visitation system in ICUs could reduce the incidence of delirium in critically ill patients and improve the quality of nursing care; furthermore, the rate of nosocomial infections was not increased. These findings need to be further verified by a multicentre, large-scale clinical trial.
