34705472|t|A Review of Brain-Targeted Nonviral Gene-Based Therapies for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
34705472|a|Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are difficult to treat owing to the complexity of the brain and the presence of a natural blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major progressive and currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS, which accounts for 60-80% of cases of dementia. The pathophysiology of AD involves the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Additionally, synaptic loss and imbalance of neuronal signaling molecules are characterized as important markers of AD. Existing treatments of AD help in the management of its symptoms and aim toward the maintenance of cognitive functions, behavior, and attenuation of gradual memory loss. Over the past decade, nonviral gene therapy has attracted increasing interest due to its various advantages over its viral counterparts. Moreover, advancements in nonviral gene technology have led to their increasing contributions in clinical trials. However, brain-targeted nonviral gene delivery vectors come across various extracellular and intracellular barriers, limiting their ability to transfer the therapeutic gene into the target cells. Chief barriers to nonviral gene therapy have been discussed briefly in this review. We have also highlighted the rapid advancement of several nonviral gene therapies for AD, which are broadly categorized into physical and chemical methods. These methods aim to modulate Abeta, beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), apolipoprotein E, or neurotrophic factors' expression in the CNS. Overall, this review discusses challenges and recent advancements of nonviral gene therapy for AD.
