39125267|a|The VLCKD is a diet recognized to promote rapid fat mobilization and reduce inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and liver fibrosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate cell-to-cell communication. The aim of the study is to investigate the role of circulating EVs in cell proliferation, ketone bodies, and ROS production in patients on an 8-week VLCKD regimen. Participants were classified as responders (R) or non-responders (NR) to VLCKD treatment based on their fibroscan results. In vitro experiments with the hepatic cell lines HEPA-RG (normal hepatocytes) and LX-2 (stellate cells) were conducted to investigate the effects of circulating EVs on cell viability, ROS production, and ketone body presence. The findings reveal a notable reduction in cell viability in both cell lines when treated with exosomes (EXOs). In contrast, treatment with microvesicles (MVs) did not appear to affect cell viability, which remained unchanged. Additionally, the levels of ketone bodies measured in urine were not consistently correlated with the reduction of fibrosis in responders (R). Similarly, an increase in ketone bodies was observed in non-responders (NR), which was also not aligned with the expected reduction in fibrosis. This inconsistency stands in stark contrast to the levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which exhibited a clear and consistent pattern in accordance with the dietary intervention. Finally, in this preliminary study, ROS has been identified as a potential diet adherence marker for VLCKD patients; the ROS levels reliably follow the progression of the fibrosis response, providing a more accurate reflection of the therapeutic effects.
