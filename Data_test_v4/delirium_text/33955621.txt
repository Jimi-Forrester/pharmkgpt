33955621|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD); their contribution to neurodegeneration and clinical manifestations are critical in understanding preclinical AD. At present, the mechanisms related to Abeta and tau pathogenesis leading to cognitive decline in older adults remain largely unknown. Here, we examined graph theory-based positron emission tomography (PET) analytical approaches, within and between tau and Abeta PET modalities, and tested the effects on cognitive changes in cognitively normal older adults (CN). Particularly, we focused on the network interdigitations of Abeta and tau deposits, along with cognitive test scores in CN at both baseline and 2-year follow-up (FU). We found highly significant Abeta-tau network integrations in AD vulnerable areas, as well as significant associations between those Abeta-tau interdigitations and general cognitive impairment in CN at baseline and FU. Our findings suggest a distinctive contribution of interlinking network relationships between Abeta and tau deposits in heteromodal areas of the human brain. They support a network-based interaction between Abeta and tau accumulations as a key factor for cognitive deterioration in CN prior to dementia.
