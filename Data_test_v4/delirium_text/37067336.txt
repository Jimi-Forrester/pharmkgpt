37067336|t|A patient with heart failure, who is frail: How does this affect therapeutic decisions?
37067336|a|Patients with heart failure (HF) are heterogeneous, not only related to comorbidities but also in the presentation of frailty syndrome. Frailty syndrome also affects patients with HF across the lifespan. Frailty in patients with HF has a significant impact on clinical features, diagnosis, management, adverse medical outcomes and costs. In everyday clinical practice, frail patients with HF require an individualized approach, often imposing the need to modify therapeutic decisions. The aim of this review is to illustrate how frailty and multimorbidity in HF can affect therapeutic decisions. The scientific evidence underlying this publication was obtained from an analysis of papers indexed in the PubMed database. The search was limited to articles published between 1990 and July 2022. The search was limited to full-text papers published in English. The database was searched for relevant MeSH phrases and their combinations and keywords including: "elderly, frail"; "frailty, elderly"; "frail older adults"; "frailty, older adults"; "adult, frail older"; "frailty, heart failure"; "frailty, multimorbidity"; "multimorbidity, heart failure"; "multimorbidity, elderly"; "older adults, cardiovascular diseases". In therapeutic decisions regarding patients with HF, additionally burdened with multimorbidity and frailty, it becomes necessary to individualize the approach in relation to optimization and treatment of coexisting diseases, frailty assessment, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment and in the implementation of invasive procedures in the form of implantable devices or cardiac surgery.
