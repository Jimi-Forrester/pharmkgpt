37351381|a|The changing composition of gut microbiota, much like aging, accompanies people throughout their lives, and the inextricable relationship between both has recently attracted extensive attention as well. Modern medical research has revealed that a series of changes in gut microbiota are involved in the aging process of organisms, which may be because gut microbiota modulates aging-related changes related to innate immunity and cognitive function. At present, there is no definite and effective method to delay aging. However, Nobel laureate Tu Youyou's research on artemisinin has inspired researchers to study the importance of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM, as an ancient alternative medicine, has unique advantages in preventive health care and in treating diseases as it already has formed an independent understanding of the aging system. TCM practitioners believe that the mechanism of aging is mainly deficiency, and pathological states such as blood stasis, qi stagnation and phlegm coagulation can exacerbate the process of aging, which involves a series of organs, including the brain, kidney, heart, liver and spleen. Our current understanding of aging has led us to realise that TCM can indeed make some beneficial changes, such as the improvement of cognitive impairment. However, due to the multi-component and multi-target nature of TCM, the exploration of its mechanism of action has become extremely complex. While analysing the relationship between gut microbiota and aging, this review explores the similarities and differences in treatment methods and mechanisms between TCM and Modern Medicine, in order to explore a new approach that combines TCM and Modern Medicine to regulate gut microbiota, improve immunity and delay aging.
