30906339|t|Long-Term Efficacy of Memantine in Parkinson' Disease Dementia: An 18-Month Prospective Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Preliminary Study.
30906339|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the treatment efficacy of memantine in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) has been reported after several weeks of administration, the long-term effects on brain perfusion and clinical symptoms remain unclear. The current study aimed to follow-up PDD patients after 18 months of memantine treatment using 99mTc hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: A total of 15 patients with PDD and 11 healthy participants were recruited into this study and they were assessed with brain SPECT, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Differences in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between the two groups were evaluated at baseline. After 18 months of memantine administration, changes in brain perfusion, severity of dementia, cognition, and neuropsychiatric disturbances were examined in the patients with PDD. RESULTS: The PDD group showed hypoperfusion in most of the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar areas compared to healthy controls at baseline. At the follow-up, changes in rCBF, CDR (p=0.32), sum of box of CDR (p=0.49), MMSE (p=0.61), GDS (p=0.79), and NPI (p=0.23) were not significant in the PDD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate that memantine may delay the progression of brain perfusion deficits and clinical symptoms of PDD in the long term.
