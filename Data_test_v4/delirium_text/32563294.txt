32563294|t|Maximizing placebo response in neurological clinical practice.
32563294|a|The placebo effect is a widely recognized phenomenon in clinical research, with a negative perception that it could hide the "true" drug effect. In clinical care its positive potential to increase known drug effects has been neglected for too long. The placebo and nocebo responses have been described in many neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, restless leg syndrome, tics, essential tremor, dystonia, functional movement disorders, neuropathic pain, headaches, migraine, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. Knowledge regarding placebo mechanisms and their consequences on clinical outcome have greatly improved over the last two decades. This evolution has led to reconsiderations of the importance of placebo response in the clinic and has given several clues on how to improve it in daily practice. In this chapter, we first illustrate "why," e.g. the reasons (relevance to clinical practice, help in differential diagnosis/treatment of psychogenic movements, clinical impact, proven neurobiological grounds, health economic potential), and "how," e.g. the means (increase patients' knowledge, increase learning, improve patient-doctor relationship, increase Hawthorne effect, increase positive/decrease negative expectations (the Rosenthal effect), personalize placebo response), the placebo should be maximized (and nocebo avoided) in neurological clinical practice. Future studies regarding more specific neurobiological mechanisms will allow a finer tuning of placebo response in clinical practice. The use of placebo in clinical practice raises ethical issues, and a recent expert consensus regarding placebo use in the clinic is a first step to future guidelines necessary to this field.
