38540653|t|Factors Influencing Morbidity and Mortality Rates in Tertiary Intensive Care Units in Turkey: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study.
38540653|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between the prognosis of patients admitted to a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) and the admitted patient population, intensive care conditions, and the workload of intensive care staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study that analyzed data from all tertiary ICUs (a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 59 units per month) of eight training and research hospitals between January 2022 and May 2023. We compared monthly data across hospitals and analyzed factors associated with patient prognosis, including mortality and pressure injuries (PIs). RESULTS: This study analyzed data from 54,312 patients, of whom 51% were male and 58.8% were aged 65 or older. The median age was 69 years. The average number of tertiary ICU beds per unit was 15 +- 6 beds, and the average occupancy rate was 83.57 +- 19.28%. On average, 7 +- 9 pressure injuries (PI) and 10 +- 7 patient deaths per unit per month were reported. The mortality rate (18.66%) determined per unit was similar to the expected rate (15-25%) according to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score. There was a statistically significant difference among hospitals on a monthly basis across various aspects, including bed occupancy rate, length of stay (LOS), number of patients per ICU bed, number of patients per nurse in a shift, rate of patients developing PI, hospitalization rate from the emergency department, hospitalization rate from wards, hospitalization rate from the external center, referral rate, and mortality rate (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although generally reliable in predicting prognosis in tertiary ICUs, the APACHE II scoring system may have limitations when analyzed on a unit-specific basis. ICU-related conditions have an impact on patient prognosis. ICU occupancy rate, work intensity, patient population, and number of working nurses are important factors associated with ICU mortality. In particular, data on the patient population admitted to the unit (emergency patients and patients with a history of malignancy) were most strongly associated with unit mortality.
