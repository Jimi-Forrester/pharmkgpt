34094939|t|Intraoperative B-Mode Ultrasound Guided Surgery and the Extent of Glioblastoma Resection: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
34094939|a|BACKGROUND: Intraoperative MRI and 5-aminolaevulinic acid guided surgery are useful to maximize the extent of glioblastoma resection. Intraoperative ultrasound is used as a time-and cost-effective alternative, but its value has never been assessed in a trial. The goal of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the value of intraoperative B-mode ultrasound guided surgery on the extent of glioblastoma resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, patients of 18 years or older with a newly diagnosed presumed glioblastoma, deemed totally resectable, presenting at the Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) were enrolled and randomized (1:1) into intraoperative B-mode ultrasound guided surgery or resection under standard neuronavigation. The primary outcome of this study was complete contrast-enhancing tumor resection, assessed quantitatively by a blinded neuroradiologist on pre- and post-operative MRI scans. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03531333). RESULTS: We enrolled 50 patients between November 1, 2016 and October 30, 2019. Analysis was done in 23 of 25 (92%) patients in the intraoperative B-mode ultrasound group and 24 of 25 (96%) patients in the standard surgery group. Eight (35%) of 23 patients in the intraoperative B-mode ultrasound group and two (8%) of 24 patients in the standard surgery group underwent complete resection (p=0.036). Baseline characteristics, neurological outcome, functional performance, quality of life, complication rates, overall survival and progression-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative B-mode ultrasound enables complete resection more often than standard surgery without harming patients and can be considered to maximize the extent of glioblastoma resection during surgery.
