38850305|t|Therapeutic potential of Bergenin in the management of neurological-based diseases and disorders.
38850305|a|Originally sourced from plants, Bergenin has been used as a medicinal compound in traditional medicine for centuries, and anecdotal reports suggest a wide range of therapeutic uses. Naturally-occurring and lab-synthesized Bergenin, as well as some of its related compounds, have been shown in in vivo and in vitro studies to alter activity of several enzymes and proteins critical in cellular functioning, including reelin, GSK-3beta, Lingo-1, Ten-4, GP-43, Abeta 1-42, P-tau, SOD1,2, GPx, Glx1, NQO1, HO1, PPAR-gamma, BDNF, VEGF, and STAT6. Additionally, Bergenin alters levels of several cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta. Behavioral and cellular effects of Bergenin have been shown to involve PI3K/Akt, NF-kappaB, PKC, Nrf2, and Sirt1/FOXO3a pathways. These pathways, enzymes, and proteins have been shown to be important in normal neurological functioning, and/or dysfunctions in these pathways and proteins have been shown to be important in several neuro-based disorders or diseases, which suggests that Bergenin could be therapeutic in management of neuropsychiatric conditions or neurological disorders. In preclinical studies, Bergenin has been shown to be useful for the management of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, depression, addiction, epilepsy, insomnia, stroke, and potentially, state control. Our review aims to summarize current evidence supporting the conclusion that Bergenin could play a role in treating various neuro-based disorders and that future studies should be conducted to evaluate the mechanisms by which Bergenin could exert its therapeutic effects.
