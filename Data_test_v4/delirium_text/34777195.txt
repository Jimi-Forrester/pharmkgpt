34777195|t|Alterations in Glycerolipid and Fatty Acid Metabolic Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease Identified by Urinary Metabolic Profiling: A Pilot Study.
34777195|a|An easily accessible and non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is needed. Evidence suggests that metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathophysiology of AD. While urine is a non-invasively collectable biofluid and a good source for metabolomics analysis, it is not yet widely used for this purpose. This small-scale pilot study aimed to examine whether the metabolic profile of urine from AD patients reflects the metabolic dysfunction reported to underlie AD pathology, and to identify metabolites that could distinguish AD patients from cognitively healthy controls. Spot urine of 18 AD patients (AD group) and 18 age- and sex-matched, cognitively normal controls (control group) were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight MS and liquid chromatography-Fourier transform MS were used to cover a larger range of molecules with ionic as well as lipid characteristics. A total of 304 ionic molecules and 81 lipid compounds of 12 lipid classes were identified. Of these, 26 molecules showed significantly different relative concentrations between the AD and control groups (Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). Moreover, orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed significant discrimination between the two groups. Pathway searches using the KEGG database, and pathway enrichment and topology analysis using Metaboanalyst software, suggested alterations in molecules relevant to pathways of glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and caffeine metabolism in AD patients. Further studies of urinary metabolites will contribute to the early detection of AD and understanding of its pathogenesis.
