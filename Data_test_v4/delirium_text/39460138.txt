39460138|a|Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. These diseases are correlated with advancing age and are hence increasingly becoming prevalent in developed countries due to an increasingly aging demographic. Several tools are used to predict and diagnose these diseases, including pathological and genetic tests, radiological scans, and clinical examinations. Artificial intelligence is evolving to artificial general intelligence, which mimics the human learning process. Large language models can use an enormous volume of online and offline resources to gain knowledge and use it to perform different types of tasks. This work presents an understanding of two major neurodegenerative disorders, artificial general intelligence, and the efficacy of using artificial general intelligence in detecting and predicting these neurodegenerative disorders. A detailed discussion on detecting these neurodegenerative diseases using artificial general intelligence by analyzing diagnostic data is presented. An Internet of Things-based ubiquitous monitoring and treatment framework is presented. An outline for future research opportunities based on the challenges in this area is also presented.
