35562946|t|A New Player in Depression: MiRNAs as Modulators of Altered Synaptic Plasticity.
35562946|a|Depression is a psychiatric disorder that presents with a persistent depressed mood as the main clinical feature and is accompanied by cognitive impairment. Changes in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis greatly affect depression. Without genetic changes, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to function by regulating gene expression during the body's adaptation to stress. Studies in recent years have shown that as important regulatory factors in epigenetic mechanisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of depression through the regulation of protein expression. Herein, we review the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated neuroplasticity in depression and discus synaptic structural plasticity, synaptic functional plasticity, and neurogenesis. Furthermore, we found that miRNAs regulate neuroplasticity through several signalling pathways to affect cognitive functions. However, these pathways do not work independently. Therefore, we try to identify synergistic correlations between miRNAs and multiple signalling pathways to broaden the potential pathogenesis of depression. In addition, in the future, dual-function miRNAs (protection/injury) are promising candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of depression, and their regulated genes can potentially be used as target genes for the treatment of depression.
