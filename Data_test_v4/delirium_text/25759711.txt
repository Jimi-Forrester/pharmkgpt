25759711|t|Persistence and Prognostic Implications of Orthostatic Hypotension in Older Individuals with Mild-to-Moderate Dementia.
25759711|a|AIM: To study the course and prognostic implications of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in older individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia. METHODS: Referrals to outpatient clinics specialising in old age psychiatry and geriatric medicine in the counties of Rogaland and Hordaland in western Norway with a first-time diagnosis of mild dementia were consecutively asked for inclusion. A total of 211 participants underwent a comprehensive baseline assessment with annual follow-ups. Patients with OH at both baseline and the 1-year follow-up were classified as having persistent OH. Outcome measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB), and time to death. RESULTS: From baseline to the 4-year follow-up, 30-45% of the participants had OH at each follow-up. In multivariable analysis, persistent OH was not significantly associated with either the longitudinal course of MMSE or CDR-SB scores or survival. CONCLUSIONS: OH was moderately prevalent over 4 years in older individuals with mild dementia, and persistent OH did not predict either cognitive or functional decline or survival.
