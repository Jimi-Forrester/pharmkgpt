36043424|t|A systematic review of quality dementia clinical guidelines for the development of WHO's Package of Interventions for rehabilitation.
36043424|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As part of the WHO Rehabilitation 2030 call for action, the WHO Rehabilitation Programme is developing its Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation (PIR) to support ministries of health around the globe in integrating rehabilitation services into health systems. As a vital step for this PIR development, we conducted a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for dementia to identify interventions for rehabilitation and related evidence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Following WHO Rehabilitation Programme and Cochrane Rehabilitation's methodology, quality CPGs published in English between January 2010 and March 2020 were identified using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, Google Scholar, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Guideline quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (II). RESULTS: Of the 22 CPGs that met the selection criteria, six satisfied the quality evaluation. Three-hundred-thirty rehabilitation related recommendations, were identified, mostly concentrated in the areas of cognition, emotion and carer support. There were many strong interventions, with moderate to high quality evidence that could be easily introduced in routine practice. However, major limitations were found both in the quality of evidence and scope, especially in areas such as education and vocation, community and social life, and lifestyle modifications. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Further rigorous research is needed to build quality evidence in dementia rehabilitation in general, and especially in neglected areas for rehabilitation. Future work should also focus on the development of CPGs for dementia rehabilitation. A multi-pronged approach is needed to achieve Universal Health Coverage for dementia rehabilitation.
