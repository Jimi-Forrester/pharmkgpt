35938670|a|Townships and rural areas endure difficult circumstances such as poverty, unemployment, low educational levels, unstable income sources, socioeconomic deprivation and the lack of transportation. Furthermore, psychosocial issues such as crime, violence and substance abuse are additional contextual factors prevalent within South African townships. There has been a paucity of research focussing on the impact of contextual and socioeconomic conditions on the dementia family caregiver experience. This qualitative study aimed to address this gap. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 family caregivers via purposeful sampling methods. Data analysis using Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) generated four broad themes, namely - (1). Poverty, (2). Crime, Violence and Substance Abuse, (3). Practical Challenges and (4). A Sense of Normalcy. The findings of this study depict the socioeconomic conditions of family caregivers living in Soweto and its impact on dementia caregiving. The majority of the family caregivers in this study were unemployed and identified the financial aspects of caregiving as a significant strain. Beyond financial aspects, practical challenges that some family caregivers reported included spatial constraints and insufficient material resources. Caregivers raised safety concerns due to the dangers that this socioeconomic context posed. However, there was an implied sense of normalcy and a reluctance to identify challenges that caregivers endured. Recommendations for further research and its implications for public health policies and important initiatives to advocate for dementia caregivers and their family members are outlined.
