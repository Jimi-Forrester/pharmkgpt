31424400|t|Cognitive-Motor Integration Performance Is Affected by Sex, APOE Status, and Family History of Dementia.
31424400|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive-motor integration (CMI) involves concurrent thought and action which requires the interaction of large brain networks. Given that early-stage dementia involves neural network dysfunction, deficits in CMI may prove useful for early dementia detection. OBJECTIVE: Our research objective was to investigate sex-related differences in the ability to integrate rules into action. METHODS: Based on family medical history, we recruited male and female participants both with and without dementia risk factors. Participants did not demonstrate cognitive impairment at the time of testing. Participants were tested on four increasingly dissociated visuomotor tasks (eye and hand movements were made in different spatial planes and/or visual feedback was reversed). RESULTS: We observed significantly greater hand movement endpoint error scores and corrective path lengths in at-risk females compared to at-risk males in the most complex CMI condition (plane-change + feedback reversal). Multiple regression analyses revealed both sex and family history as significant predictors of worse performance in a CMI condition requiring visual feedback reversal. Further, the regression analyses provided preliminary evidence that having an APOEe4 allele was a significant predictor of poorer CMI performance in the two plane-change CMI conditions. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that underlying brain networks controlling simultaneous thought and action may differ between the sexes in ways that may be clinically relevant in dementia progression. Preliminary data also suggest an important connection between APOE variant and CMI performance in individuals at risk of developing dementia.
