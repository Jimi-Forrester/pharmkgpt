35203912|a|The emergence of cognitive impairment and dementia in people with Lewy body spectrum disorders (LBS) significantly impacts the quality of life of the individual and their care partner. Coping well with the condition may depend, in part, on the degree of psychological resilience or capacity to 'bounce back' from adversity. We explored resilience in people with Parkinson's disease mild cognitive disorder or dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies, and their care partners, and its relation to outcomes related to their mental well-being and quality of life. This exploratory, cross-sectional study recruited 76 participant-dyads. Resilience, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and relationship satisfaction were evaluated in both members of the dyad. In care partners, care burden and stress were also assessed. Over 70% of both care partners and recipients reported high levels of resilience. Lower resilience in both members of the dyad was associated with higher anxiety and lower quality of life. Additionally, lower resilience in care partners was associated with lower well-being, relationship satisfaction, and higher burden and stress. Resilience in persons with LBS and their care partners is important to consider when assessing mental health, relationship, and care burden outcomes, acting as a focus of intervention to support positive outcomes.
