37083989|t|Post-induction hypotension and intraoperative hypotension as potential separate risk factors for the adverse outcome: a cohort study.
37083989|a|PURPOSE: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is associated with organ hypoperfusion. There are different underlying causes of IOH depending on the phase of surgery. Post-induction hypotension (PIH) and early-intraoperative hypotension tend to be frequently differentiated. We aimed to explore further different phases of IOH and verify whether they are differently associated with postoperative complications. METHODS: Patients undergoing abdominal surgery between October 2018 and July 2019 in a university hospital were screened. Post-induction hypotension was defined as MAP <= 65 mmHg between the induction of anaesthesia and the onset of surgery. Hypotension during surgery (IOH) was defined as MAP <= 65 mmHg occurring between the onset of surgery and its completion. Acute kidney injury, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, delirium, and myocardial infarction were considered as the outcome. RESULTS: We enrolled 508 patients (219 males, median age 62 years). 158 subjects (31.1%) met PIH, 171 (33.7%) met IOH criteria, and 67 (13.2%) patients experienced both. PIH time accounted for 22.8% of the total hypotension time and 29.7% of the IOH time. The IOH time accounted for 5.17% of the total intraoperative time, while PIH for 8.91% of the pre-incision time. Female sex, lower height, body mass and lower pre-induction BP (SBP and MAP) were found to be associated with the incidence of PIH. The negative outcome was observed in 38 (7.5%) patients. Intraoperative MAP <= 65 mmHg, longer duration of the procedure (>= 230 min), chronic arterial hypertension and age were associated with the presence of the outcome (p < 0.01 each). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IOH defined as MAP <= 65 mmHg is relevant to post-operative organ complications, the presence of PIH does not appear to be of such significance. Because cumulative duration of PIH and IOH differs significantly, especially in long-lasting procedures, direct comparison of the influence of PIH and IOH on outcome separately may be biased and should be taken into account in data interpretation. Further research is needed to deeply investigate this phenomenon.
