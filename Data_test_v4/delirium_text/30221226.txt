30221226|t|Chalcones and Five-Membered Heterocyclic Isosteres Bind to Alpha Synuclein Fibrils in Vitro.
30221226|a|A series of chalcone and heterocyclic isosteres, in which the enone moiety was replaced with an isoxazole and pyrazole ring system, was synthesized and their affinities for alpha synuclein (Asyn), amyloid beta (Abeta), and tau fibrils were measured in vitro. The compounds were found to have a modest affinity and selectivity for Asyn versus Abeta fibrils and low affinity for tau fibrils. Insertion of a double bond to increase the extendable surface area resulted in an increase in affinity and improvement in selectivity for Asyn versus Abeta and tau fibrils. The results of this study indicate that compound 11 is a secondary lead compound for structure-activity relationship studies aimed at identifying a suitable compound for positron emission tomography-imaging studies of insoluble Asyn aggregates in Parkinson's disease.
