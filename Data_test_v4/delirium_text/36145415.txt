36145415|t|Increased Levels of C5a in Gingival Crevicular Fluid and Saliva of Patients with Periodontal Disease.
36145415|a|C5a is a powerful complement effector molecule that is considered to be an important proinflammatory mediator in several systemic chronic inflammatory diseases. However, its levels in periodontal diseases are yet to be assessed. We aimed to analyse the secretion of C5a in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva of patients with periodontal disease. Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with stage 3-4 periodontitis and 16 periodontally healthy subjects participated in this study. GCF was collected from sites with the deepest probing depth of each patient, and volume was measured using a Periotron 8000 . One mL of unstimulated saliva was also collected. Samples were analysed using a commercially available ELISA kit. The data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's bivariate testing, and receiver operating characteristic curve. C5a was present in GCF from patients with periodontitis (1.06 +- 0.25 ng/mL) whilst it was undetected in controls. Saliva concentration was also significantly higher in periodontitis (1.82 +- 2.31 ng/mL) than controls (0.60 +- 0.72 ng/mL, p = 0.006). C5a levels were more pronounced in periodontitis in both oral fluids assessed by the present pilot study. These results suggest that the more pronounced levels of C5a in oral fluids from periodontitis patients indicate a potential role of this molecule in this disease pathogenesis, deserving to be better explored in subsequent studies.
