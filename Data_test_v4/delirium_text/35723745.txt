35723745|t|Sulfavant A as the first synthetic TREM2 ligand discloses a homeostatic response of dendritic cells after receptor engagement.
35723745|a|OBJECTIVE: The immune response arises from a fine balance of mechanisms that provide for surveillance, tolerance, and elimination of dangers. Sulfavant A (SULF A) is a sulfolipid with a promising adjuvant activity. Here we studied the mechanism of action of SULF A and addressed the identification of its molecular target in human dendritic cells (hDCs). METHODS: Adjuvant effect and immunological response to SULF A were assessed on DCs derived from human donors. In addition to testing various reporter cells, target identification and downstream signalling was supported by a reverse pharmacology approach based on antibody blocking and gene silencing, crosstalk with TLR pathways, use of human allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. RESULTS: SULF A binds to the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) and initiates an unconventional maturation of hDCs leading to enhanced migration activity and up-regulation of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules without release of conventional cytokines. This response involves the SYK-NFAT axis and is compromised by blockade or gene silencing of TREM2. Activation by SULF A preserved the DC functions to excite the allogeneic T cell response, and increased interleukin-10 release after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. CONCLUSION: SULF A is the first synthetic small molecule that binds to TREM2. The receptor engagement drives differentiation of an unprecedented DC phenotype (homeDCs) that contributes to immune homeostasis without compromising lymphocyte activation and immunogenic response. This mechanism fully supports the adjuvant and immunoregulatory activity of SULF A. We also propose that the biological properties of SULF A can be of interest in various physiopathological mechanisms and therapies involving TREM2.
