32326457|t|Comparative Kinetics of Acetyl- and Butyryl-Cholinesterase Inhibition by Green Tea Catechins Relevance to the Symptomatic Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
32326457|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the apoptosis of cholinergic neurons and the consequent attenuation of acetylcholine mediated neurotransmission, resulting in neurodegeneration. Acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE) are attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of AD since inhibition of these enzymes can be used to restore synaptic concentrations of acetylcholine. Whilst inhibitors for these enzymes such as galantamine and rivastigmine have been approved for use, none are able to halt the progression of AD and are responsible for the production of troublesome side-effects. Efficacious cholinesterase inhibitors have been isolated from natural plant-based compounds with many demonstrating additional benefits beyond cholinesterase inhibition, such as antioxidation and anti-inflammation, which are key parts of AD pathology. In this study, five natural flavan-3-ol (catechin) compounds: ((-)-epicatechin (EC), catechin, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG),) (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), isolated from green tea, were screened for their cholinesterase inhibitory activity using the Ellman assay. The kinetics of inhibition was determined using reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. EGCG was the only compound found to produce statistically significant, competitive inhibition, of both AChE (p < 0.01) and BuChE (p < 0.01) with IC50 values of 0.0148 micromol/mL and 0.0251 micromol/mL respectively. These results, combined with previously identified antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, highlight the potential use of EGCG in the treatment of AD, provided it can be delivered to cholinergic neurons in therapeutic concentrations. Further testing of EGCG in vivo is recommended to fully characterise the pharmacokinetic properties, optimal method of administration and efficacy of this novel plant-based compound.
