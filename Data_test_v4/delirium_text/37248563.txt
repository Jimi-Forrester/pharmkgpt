37248563|a|Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) is a widely distributed serine protease in the human body cleaving proline-containing peptides; however, recent studies suggest that its effects on pathogenic processes underlying neurodegeneration are derived from direct protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and not from its regulation of certain neuropeptide levels. We discovered novel nonpeptidic oxazole-based PREP inhibitors, which deviate from the known structure-activity relationship for PREP inhibitors. These new compounds are effective modulators of the PPIs of PREP, reducing alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) dimerization and enhancing protein phosphatase 2A activity in a concentration-response manner, as well as reducing reactive oxygen species production. From the best performing oxazoles, HUP-55 was selected for in vivo studies. Its brain penetration was evaluated, and it was tested in alphaSyn virus vector-based and alphaSyn transgenic mouse models of Parkinson's disease, where it restored motor impairment and reduced levels of oligomerized alphaSyn in the striatum and substantia nigra.
