34440004|t|Bcl-xL Is Required by Primary Hippocampal Neurons during Development to Support Local Energy Metabolism at Neurites.
34440004|a|B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) is a mitochondrial protein known to inhibit mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathways. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that Bcl-xL is critical in regulating neuronal energy metabolism and has a protective role in pathologies associated with an energy deficit. However, it is less known how Bcl-xL regulates physiological processes of the brain. In this study, we hypothesize that Bcl-xL is required for neurite branching and maturation during neuronal development by improving local energy metabolism. We found that the absence of Bcl-xL in rat primary hippocampal neurons resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction. Specifically, the ATP/ADP ratio was significantly decreased in the neurites of Bcl-xL depleted neurons. We further found that neurons transduced with Bcl-xL shRNA or neurons treated with ABT-263, a pharmacological inhibitor of Bcl-xL, showed impaired mitochondrial motility. Neurons lacking Bcl-xL had significantly decreased anterograde and retrograde movement of mitochondria and an increased stationary mitochondrial population when Bcl-xL was depleted by either means. These mitochondrial defects, including loss of ATP, impaired normal neurite development. Neurons lacking Bcl-xL showed significantly decreased neurite arborization, growth and complexity. Bcl-xL depleted neurons also showed impaired synapse formation. These neurons showed increased intracellular calcium concentration and were more susceptible to excitotoxic challenge. Bcl-xL may support positioning of mitochondria at metabolically demanding regions of neurites like branching points. Our findings suggest a role for Bcl-xL in physiological regulation of neuronal growth and development.
