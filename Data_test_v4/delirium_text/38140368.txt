38140368|t|Metabolite Profiling of Allium hookeri Leaves Using UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS and the Senomorphic Activity of Phenolamides.
38140368|a|The plant Allium hookeri, a member of the Allium genus, has a rich history of culinary and medicinal use. Recent studies have unveiled its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While research on A. hookeri has demonstrated its neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects, the specific bioactive compounds responsible for these effects remain unidentified in prior research. This study utilized an untargeted metabolomic approach, employing HRESI-qTOF MS/MS-based molecular networking, to comprehensively profile the chemical composition of metabolites in A. hookeri and identify new compounds within the plant. As a result, ten compounds, comprising one novel flavonoid (2) and nine known compounds (1 and 3-10), were isolated and identified through NMR analysis. The inhibitory effects of all isolated compounds on the senescent cell-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is pivotal in neuroprotective actions, were evaluated. Biological activity testing revealed N-trans-feruloyltyramine (7) to be the most potent compound, effectively inhibiting SASP markers and contributing to the senomorphic activities of A. hookeri. These findings underscore the potential of phenolamides from A. hookeri as a promising source of bioactive compounds for mitigating senescence-associated diseases.
