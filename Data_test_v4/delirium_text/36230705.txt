36230705|t|Parenchymal Sparing Surgery for Lung Cancer: Focus on Pulmonary Artery Reconstruction.
36230705|a|Reconstruction of the pulmonary artery (PA) associated with lobectomy for the radical resection of lung cancer has been progressively gaining diffusion in lung cancer surgery as a safe and effective therapeutic option that may allow radical resection when lobectomy is not technically feasible, avoiding pneumonectomy. There are some controversial aspects concerning the intraoperative and perioperative management of a sleeve resection with PA reconstruction that may influence the outcome. In the present article, the authors have analyzed some of the main technical and oncological aspects to take stock of what they have learned from their lung-sparing operations experience over time. PA reconstruction may require prosthetic materials including different options with variable cost. A main concern in vascular reconstructive procedures is avoiding tension on the anastomosis. When PA reconstruction is required, appropriate anticoagulation management is crucial. Results from the main literature data confirm the reliability of lobectomy associated with PA reconstruction in terms of perioperative morbidity and long-term survival. Sleeve lobectomy and PA reconstruction can be performed safely and effectively even after induction therapy.
