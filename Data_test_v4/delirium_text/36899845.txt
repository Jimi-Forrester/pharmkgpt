36899845|t|Targeting Underlying Inflammation in Carcinoma Is Essential for the Resolution of Depressiveness.
36899845|a|In modern clinical practice and research on behavioral changes in patients with oncological problems, there are several one-sided approaches to these problems. Strategies for early detection of behavioral changes are considered, but they must take into account the specifics of the localization and phase in the course and treatment of somatic oncological disease. Behavioral changes, in particular, may correlate with systemic proinflammatory changes. In the up-to-date literature, there are a lot of useful pointers on the relationship between carcinoma and inflammation and between depression and inflammation. This review is intended to provide an overview of these similar underlying inflammatory disturbances in both oncological disease and depression. The specificities of acute and chronic inflammation are considered as a basis for causal current and future therapies. Modern therapeutic oncology protocols may also cause transient behavioral changes, so assessment of the quality, quantity, and duration of behavioral symptoms is necessary to prescribe adequate therapy. Conversely, antidepressant properties could be used to ameliorate inflammation. We will attempt to provide some impetus and present some unconventional potential treatment targets related to inflammation. It is certain that only an integrative oncology approach is justifiable in modern patient treatment.
