33927516|t|Delirium Research in India: A Systematic Review.
33927516|a|Delirium is the most common psychiatric diagnoses encountered in patients with various medical-surgical illnesses, in all the treatment set-ups, with relatively higher incidence and prevalence in the intensive care units. As delirium is encountered in multiple specialties, it is important to understand the research on this diagnosis. This study aims to assess the research output involving patients of delirium from India. A comprehensive search was undertaken using Medline (PubMed) and other databases. Search words included were "delirium," "delirious," "delirium tremens" AND "India." No filters were used. Internet and hand searches yielded 305 articles. Out of these articles, 151 had the terms "delirium," "delirious," "delirium tremens" in the title and these were included for the review. Additionally, 14 articles were included for the review, although these did not have these terms in the title, but delirium was one of the major outcome parameters in these studies. Majority of the papers were original articles ( n = 81), and these were followed by, case reports ( n = 58), review articles ( n = 10), letter to the editor (not as case reports but as a communication; n = 13), editorials ( n = 2) and one clinical practice guideline. Most of the original papers have either focused on epidemiology (incidence, prevalence, outcome, etc.), symptom profile, with occasional studies focusing on effectiveness of various pharmacological interventions. There is a dearth of research in the field of delirium from India. There is a lack of studies on biomarkers, evaluation of nonpharmacological interventions, and evaluation of prevention strategies. It is the need of the hour to carry out more studies to further our understanding of delirium in the Indian context.
