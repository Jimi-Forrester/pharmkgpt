24007888|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate changes in the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in nursing facility patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from 2005 to 2010 and to compare these to historical data from 1992 to 1996. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 and prescription claims data from April 1, 2005, through September 30, 2010, were linked and extracted from a large data repository, then compared with a similar data set from 1992 to 1996. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2010 there were 29,429 of 564,401 (5.2%) unique patients with PD. Moderate-to-severe cognitive and functional impairment was present in 66.2% and 60.0% of patients, respectively. Concurrent conditions included Alzheimer's disease (AD) (18.1%), non-AD dementia (50%), depression (53.6%), and anxiety (22.8%). Anti-PD medications were received by 77.3% of patients, with a prevalence of treatment with carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine-agonists (DA), and anticholinergics of 92.5%, 26.5%, and 7.9%, respectively. Use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics was noted in 37.7%, 58.2%, and 46.3% of patients in 2005-2010, respectively. The prevalence of PD was 5.2% in both 2005-2010 and 1992-1996. The majority of patients in both periods exhibited moderate-to-severe cognitive and functional impairment, but the prevalence of AD, non-AD dementia, depression, and anxiety, and corresponding pharmacotherapy, was much greater in the recent time period. The percentage of patients treated with PD medications increased from 44% in 1992-1996 to 77.3% in 2005-2010. CONCLUSION: Important trends in PD characteristics and treatment were observed in nursing facility residents over time. Opportunity exists to optimize pharmacotherapy in this population.
