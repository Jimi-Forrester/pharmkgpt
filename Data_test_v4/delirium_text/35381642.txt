35381642|a|Aluminum is one of the most abundant elements on earth. Aluminum compounds are widely used in food additives, antacids, cooking utensils and so on. Human exposure to aluminum is mainly through diet and drinking water, while excessive intake of aluminum can accumulate in tissues and cause toxic reactions. In the central nervous system, aluminum exposure is closely related to a series of nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Epigenetic modification refers to the regulation of gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, and its regulatory disorders can lead to abnormalities and diseases of the central nervous system. This paper describes the regulation of epigenetics and its components, including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA, in aluminum-induced neurotoxicity, in order to provide insights into the epigenetic mechanism of aluminum-induced neurotoxicity.
