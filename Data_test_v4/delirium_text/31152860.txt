31152860|a|Neuronal apoptosis and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis are major players in cognitive/memory dysfunctions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interferon beta (IFNbeta) is a cytokine with anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective properties on the central nervous system (CNS) cells which specifically affects neural progenitor cells (NPCs) even in the adult brain. In this study, we examined the effect of IFNbeta on memory impairment as well as hippocampal neurogenesis and apoptosis in a rat model of AD. AD model was induced by lentiviral-mediated overexpression of mutant APP in the hippocampus of adult rats. Intranasal (IN) administration of IFNbeta (0.5 mug/kg and 1 mug/kg doses) was started from day 23 after virus injection and continued every other day to the final day of experiments. The expression levels of APP, neurogenesis (Nestin, Ki67, DCX, and Reelin) and apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved-caspase-3 and seladin-1) markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. Moreover, thioflavin T and Nissl stainings were used to assess Abeta plaque levels and neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus, respectively. Our results showed that IFNbeta treatment reduced APP expression and Abeta plaque formation, and concomitantly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits examined in Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, in parallel with reducing apoptosis and neural loss in the hippocampal subfields, IFNbeta decreased ectopic neurogenesis in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the AD rat hippocampus. However, IFNbeta increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus neurogenic niche. Our findings suggest that IFNbeta exerts neuroprotective effects at least partly by inhibition of apoptosis and modulation of neurogenesis. Taken together, IFNbeta can be a promising therapeutic approach to improve cognitive performance in AD-like neurodegenerative context.
