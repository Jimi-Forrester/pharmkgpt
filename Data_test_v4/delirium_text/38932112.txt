38932112|t|Lack of Association of Vascular Risk Factors with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders in cART-Treated Adults Aged >= 50 Years in Tanzania.
38932112|a|HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are highly prevalent in those ageing with HIV. High-income country data suggest that vascular risk factors (VRFs) may be stronger predictors of HAND than HIV-disease severity, but data from sub-Saharan Africa are lacking. We evaluated relationships of VRFs, vascular end-organ damage and HAND in individuals aged >= 50 in Tanzania. c-ART-treated individuals were assessed for HAND using consensus criteria. The prevalence of VRFs and end organ damage markers were measured. The independent associations of VRFs, end organ damage and HAND were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Data were available for 153 individuals (median age 56, 67.3% female). HAND was highly prevalent (66.7%, 25.5% symptomatic) despite well-managed HIV (70.5% virally suppressed). Vascular risk factors included hypertension (34%), obesity (10.5%), hypercholesterolemia (33.3%), diabetes (5.3%) and current smoking (4.6%). End organ damage prevalence ranged from 1.3% (prior myocardial infarction) to 12.5% (left ventricular hypertrophy). Measured VRFs and end organ damage were not independently associated with HAND. The only significant association was lower diastolic BP (p 0.030, OR 0.969 (0.943-0.997). Our results suggest that vascular risk factors are not major drivers of HAND in this setting. Further studies should explore alternative aetiologies such as chronic inflammation.
