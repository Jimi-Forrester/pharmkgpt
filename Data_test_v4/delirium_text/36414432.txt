36414432|t|Targeting stressor-induced dysfunctions in protein-protein interaction networks via epichaperomes.
36414432|a|Diseases are manifestations of complex changes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whereby stressors, genetic, environmental, and combinations thereof, alter molecular interactions and perturb the individual from the level of cells and tissues to the entire organism. Targeting stressor-induced dysfunctions in PPI networks has therefore become a promising but technically challenging frontier in therapeutics discovery. This opinion provides a new framework based upon disrupting epichaperomes - pathological entities that enable dysfunctional rewiring of PPI networks - as a mechanism to revert context-specific PPI network dysfunction to a normative state. We speculate on the implications of recent research in this area for a precision medicine approach to detecting and treating complex diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
