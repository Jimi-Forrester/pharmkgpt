AD has become one of the major threats to people's health and social sustainable development. In order to support the Healthy China Initiative and promote health in China, "Chinese Alzheimer's Disease Blue Book (Simplified Edition)"(refer to as the Blue Book) was compiled by experts and scholars from the National Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University; the National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Health Commission Capacity Building and Continuing Education Center; and the China Population and Development Research Center. The epidemiological characteristics, diagnosis and treatment status, prevention and treatment management of AD and related cognitive disorders in China were systematically reviewed in the Blue Paper, aiming to provide references for the prevention of AD, provide support for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of the disease, and provide a reference for the government to formulate relevant health policies. Specifically, the Blue Book covers the following topics of AD and related cognitive disorders: (1)epidemiology characteristics; (2)economic burden; (3)influencing factors; (4)China Brain Cognitive Health Index; (5) diagnosis status; (6)treatment status; (7)construction of national center for cognitive disorders;(8)community-based prevention and control; (9) AD patients care; (10)public health resources for prevention and control.
