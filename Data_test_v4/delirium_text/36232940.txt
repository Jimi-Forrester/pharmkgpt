36232940|a|Dysregulated brain cholesterol metabolism is one of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a cholesterol metabolite that plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and it is suggested that it contributes to AD-related cognitive deficits. However, the link between 27-OHC and cholesterol homeostasis, and how this relationship relates to AD pathogenesis, remain elusive. Here, 12-month-old ApoE epsilon4 transgenic mice were injected with saline, 27-OHC, 27-OHC synthetase inhibitor (anastrozole, ANS), and 27-OHC+ANS for 21 consecutive days. C57BL/6J mice injected with saline were used as wild-type controls. The indicators of cholesterol metabolism, synaptic structure, amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), and learning and memory abilities were measured. Compared with the wild-type mice, ApoE epsilon4 mice had poor memory and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, damaged brain tissue and synaptic structure, cognitive decline, and higher Abeta1-42 levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Moreover, cholesterol transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) were up-regulated in the cortex after the 27-OHC treatment. The levels of cholesterol metabolism-related indicators in the hippocampus were not consistent with those in the cortex. Additionally, higher serum apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) levels and lower serum ApoE levels were observed in the 27-OHC group. Notably, ANS partially reversed the effects of 27-OHC. In conclusion, the altered cholesterol metabolism induced by 27-OHC was involved in Abeta1-42 deposition and abnormalities in both the brain tissue and synaptic structure, ultimately leading to memory loss in the ApoE epsilon4 transgenic mice.
