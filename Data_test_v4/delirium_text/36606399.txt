36606399|a|BACKGROUND: Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug widely used in Japan for the treatment of schizophrenia. Previous studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of some antipsychotics on sleep variables; however, to our knowledge, the effects of brexpiprazole on sleep architecture have not been examined in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, we aimed to exploratorily investigate the effect of brexpiprazole on sleep variables measured by polysomnography in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: This study included 10 patients with schizophrenia who were originally treated with haloperidol alone. Sleep variables of the participants were measured using polysomnography. After excluding those who did not meet the study criteria, seven patients (five men and two women; mean age [SD], 59.0 [10.0] years) were eligible for further analysis. Polysomnography was repeated at 4 weeks after the participants were prescribed brexpiprazole in addition to haloperidol. We compared the sleep architecture of the participants, measured using polysomnography, before and after taking brexpiprazole. RESULTS: Add-on brexpiprazole significantly prolonged rapid eye movement latency, increased the duration and percentage of stage N2 and stage N3 sleep (min, %), and decreased the duration and percentage of stage rapid eye movement sleep (min, %) at a significance level of nominal p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Although not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, the present results showed that add-on brexpiprazole could alter the sleep architecture of patients with schizophrenia. Future studies are warranted to replicate these findings and to further investigate the beneficial influence of brexpiprazole on sleep.
