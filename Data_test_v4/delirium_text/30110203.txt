30110203|t|Erucamide from Radish Leaves Has an Inhibitory Effect Against Acetylcholinesterase and Prevents Memory Deficit Induced by Trimethyltin.
30110203|a|In this study, we investigated a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that was isolated from radish leaf (Raphanus sativus L.) extracts. Through sequential fractionation of radish leaf extract, the active constituent was identified as cis-13-docosenamide (erucamide). To validate the potency, erucamide derived from radish leaves was supplemented in diets and then fed to trimethyltin (TMT)-exposed mice. Specifically, mice had free access to a control diet or diets containing different concentrations of erucamide for 3 weeks, followed by an injection of TMT (2.5 mg/kg body weight). Our results showed that pretreatment of mice with erucamide (20 and 40 mg/kg body weight per day) significantly attenuated the TMT-induced learning and memory deficits that were assessed by Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. These findings suggest that radish leaves, and possibly its isolated erucamide, may have preventive effects against memory deficits related to Alzheimer's disease by modulation of cholinergic functions.
