39085956|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that severely affects cognitive functions and social behaviors, leading to a significant decline in an individual's quality of life. Auditory processing deficits often precede the clinical symptoms of AD, prompting interest in auditory-based interventions as potential treatments. This scoping review aimed to compile the existing evidence on active and passive auditory-based interventions for individuals with AD and its prodromal stages. METHOD AND RESULTS: This scoping review followed Arksey and O'Malley's five-step framework to identify the existing evidence on auditory-based interventions for AD. Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase) were used to search for studies on auditory stimulation techniques to treat cognitive decline in AD patients. In total, 14 studies were included in the analysis. Seven studies explored active auditory stimulation techniques, such as the Brain Fitness Program (BrainHQ), aiming to improve cognitive function in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The other seven studies focused on passive auditory stimulation, often combined with other sensory stimuli such as light or tactile inputs. Passive stimulation studies have focused mainly on Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory Stimulation (GENUS). The intervention frequency and duration varied across studies, ranging from one session lasting 8 h to a year. Both active and passive auditory stimulation showed potential for enhancing cognitive function in individuals with AD. CONCLUSION: The literature suggests that auditory stimulation may positively influence cortical wiring and enhance cognitive abilities. Multimodal interventions that combine auditory stimulation with other sensory or behavioural approaches could yield more substantial effects on global cognition. However, the study design, intervention characteristics and outcome measures varied across studies, underscoring the necessity for standardised reporting. Well-designed studies using standard cognitive assessment protocols are recommended.
