39628555|t|The correlation between severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and severe multi-organ dysfunction after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
39628555|a|Background: The current research aimed to demonstrate the independent association between preoperative severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) and severe multi-organ dysfunction after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB), which may further indicate the relationship between severe ACAS and adverse 30-day postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing OPCAB. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective observational study including patients without a history of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIA) (asymptomatic), who underwent for an isolated OPCAB in the center for operative treatment of coronary artery disease of Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 2020 to December 2021. All enrolled patients underwent carotid artery ultrasound prior to OPCAB. The information was extracted independently by two authors of the study from the medical records. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results: A total of 562 patients met the inclusion criteria for the current study. 63 (11.2%) suffered from severe ACAS. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) maximum in the severe ACAS group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe ACAS group (9.76 +- 3.03 vs. 7.75 +- 2.96, p < 0.0001), and a higher proportion of patients in the severe ACAS group exhibited severe multi-organ dysfunction (44.4% vs. 14.0%, p < 0.0001). In addition, severe ACAS was related to an increased rate of 30-day postoperative major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs), including a 30-day postoperative stroke. Severe ACAS was associated with an elevated risk of delirium, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The results of the multivariate analysis demonstrated that severe ACAS may be independently associated with severe multi-organ dysfunction (OR, 7.37, 95% CI 4.80-14.30, p < 0.0001) after OPCAB. Also, severe ACAS may be independently associated with 30-day postoperative stroke (OR, 2.83, 95% CI 1.03-7.75, p = 0,043). Conclusions: Severe ACAS was independently associated with severe multi-organ dysfunction after OPCAB, which may be associated further with an increased rate of 30-day postoperative mortality and complications. This study highlights: (1) the importance of personalized assessment for potential advantages and disadvantages in prognosis of severe ACAS patients undergoing OPCAB with carotid endarterectomy; (2) the role of multi-organ parameters, especially cardio-cerebral factors, should be emphasized during the process of severe ACAS management.
