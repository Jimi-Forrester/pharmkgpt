14607954|t|IL-4 down-regulates lipopolysaccharide-induced formyl peptide receptor 2 in murine microglial cells by inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
14607954|a|Microglial cells actively participate in proinflammatory responses in the CNS. Upon stimulation with the bacterial LPS, microglial cells express a functional formyl peptide receptor 2 which mediates the chemotactic and activating effects of a variety of polypeptide agonists including amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42)), a critical pathogenic agent in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we found that LPS-induced expression and function of formyl peptide receptor 2 in microglial cells was markedly inhibited by IL-4, a Th2-type cytokine. Our effort to elucidate the mechanistic basis revealed that IL-4 attenuated LPS-stimulated activation of NF-kappaB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the effect of IL-4 was associated with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway-dependent increase in serine/threonine phosphatase activity. These results suggest that IL-4 may play an important role in the maintenance of homeostasis of CNS and in the regulation of the disease process characterized by microglial activation in response to proinflammatory stimulants.
