37525347|t|Knowledge and Practice Behaviors Toward the Care of the Dying Among Chinese Oncology Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Survey.
37525347|a|The quality of care provided to patients with cancer at the end of their lives remains unsatisfactory, especially during their last days and hours of life. This study aimed to investigate knowledge and practice behaviors of oncology nurses in relation to the care of the dying and to analyze the influencing factors. A convenience sample of 222 oncology nurses was recruited from 14 hospitals in Beijing, China, in January 2022. These nurses completed an online survey that included a demographic and work characteristics questionnaire and knowledge and practice behavior questionnaires regarding the care needs of dying cancer patients. The self-perceived knowledge and practice behavior of oncology nurses toward the care of the dying were found to be moderate. However, their understanding of airway management, restlessness, and delirium management was insufficient. In addition, their ability to effectively communicate recommendations for discontinuing unnecessary procedures, medications, treatments, and monitoring was inadequate. Nurses' previous end-of-life care education and experience of caring for dying patients influenced their knowledge. Nurses' practice settings, experience of caring for dying patients, and their knowledge were key factors in shaping their behaviors. Providing targeted continuing education for nurses in hospital settings and exploring the nursing pathway may be important ways to bridge their knowledge gap and enhance their practice behaviors toward caring for dying patients.
