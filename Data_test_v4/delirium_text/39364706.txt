39364706|t|Genome-Wide Profiling of H3K27ac Identifies TDO2 as a Pivotal Therapeutic Target in Metabolic Associated Steatohepatitis Liver Disease.
39364706|a|H3K27ac has been widely recognized as a representative epigenetic marker of active enhancer, while its regulatory mechanisms in pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remain elusive. Here, a genome-wide comparative study on H3K27ac activities and transcriptome profiling in high fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD model is performed. A significantly enhanced H3K27ac density with abundant alterations of regulatory transcriptome is observed in MASLD rats. Based on integrative analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, TDO2 is identified as a critical contributor for abnormal lipid accumulation, transcriptionally activated by YY1-promoted H3K27ac. Furthermore, TDO2 depletion effectively protects against hepatic steatosis. In terms of mechanisms, TDO2 activates NF-kappaB pathway to promote macrophages M1 polarization, representing a crucial event in MASLD progression. A bovine serum albumin nanoparticle is fabricated to provide sustained release of Allopurinol (NPs-Allo) for TDO2 inhibition, possessing excellent biocompatibility and desired targeting capacity. Venous injection of NPs-Allo robustly alleviates HFD-induced metabolic disorders. This study reveals the pivotal role of TDO2 and its underlying mechanisms in pathogenesis of MASLD epigenetically and genetically. Targeting H3K27ac-TDO2-NF-kappaB axis may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of abnormal lipid accumulation and pave the way for developing novel strategies for MASLD prevention and treatment.
