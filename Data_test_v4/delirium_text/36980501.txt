36980501|t|Menopausal Changes in the Microbiome-A Review Focused on the Genitourinary Microbiome.
36980501|a|A balanced interaction between the host and its microbiome is crucial to health. Research regarding the significance of the gut and vaginal microbiomes in female health is substantial. However, less data regarding the urinary microbiome are available. Interactions between the gut, vaginal, and urinary microbiomes are also currently being researched. Hormone-induced dysbiosis after menopause is believed to have effects on physical changes and health consequences. Postmenopausal changes in the gut microbiome are associated with increased short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen sulfide levels. Increased vaginal pH caused by reduced estrogen alters the vaginal microbiome, resulting in reduced levels of Lactobacillus. Such changes influence the vaginal structure and functions, contributing to the onset of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. A dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome is associated with urgency and urinary incontinence and also related to interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and neuropathic bladder. As these diseases commonly affect postmenopausal women, hormone-induced changes in the microbiome may play a role. Menopause increases the alpha diversity of the urinary microbiome and lowers the percentage of Lactobacillus in urine, and such changes precede recurrent cystitis. More research regarding the effects of changes in the urinary microbiome due to menopause on urinary tract diseases is needed.
