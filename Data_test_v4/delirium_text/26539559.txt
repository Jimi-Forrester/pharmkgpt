26539559|a|The reduction of brain amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides by anti-Abeta antibodies is one of the possible therapies for Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported that the Abeta peptide vaccine including the T-cell epitope of diphtheria-tetanus combined toxoid (DT) induced anti-Abeta antibodies, and the prior immunization with conventional DT vaccine enhanced the immunogenicity of the peptide. Cynomolgus monkeys were given the peptide vaccine subcutaneously in combination with the prior DT vaccination. Vaccination with a similar regimen was also performed on guinea pigs. The peptide vaccine induced anti-Abeta antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys and guinea pigs without chemical adjuvants, and excessive immune responses were not observed. Those antibodies could preferentially recognize Abeta 40, and Abeta 42 compared to Abeta fibrils. The levels of serum anti-Abeta antibodies and plasma Abeta peptides increased in both animals and decreased the brain Abeta 40 level of guinea pigs. The peptide vaccine could induce a similar binding profile of anti-Abeta antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys and guinea pigs. The peptide vaccination could be expected to reduce the brain Abeta peptides and their toxic effects via clearance of Abeta peptides by generated antibodies.
