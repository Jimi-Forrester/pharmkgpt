36803215|a|INTRODUCTION: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to analyze the current literature to evaluate neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values among critically ill patients who develop delirium as compared to those who do not. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were used to conduct a systematic search for relevant publications published before June 12, 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment. Because a significant level of heterogeneity was found, we used the random-effects model to generate pooled effects. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies including 11,579 critically ill patients, of whom 2439 were diagnosed with delirium, were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with the non-delirious group, the delirious group's NLR levels were significantly higher (WMD = 2.14; CI 95% = 1.48-2.80, p < 0.01). In the subgroup analysis according to the type of critical condition, the NLR levels in patients of delirious group were significantly more than those of non-delirious group in studies on POD, PSD and PCD (WMD = 1.14, CI 95% = 0.38-1.91, p < 0.01, WMD = 1.38, CI 95% = 1.04-1.72, p < 0.001, and WMD = 4.22, CI 95% = 3.47-4.98, p < 0.001, respectively). However, compared with the non-delirious group, the delirious group's PLR levels were not significantly different (WMD = 1.74; CI 95% = -12.39-15.86, p = 0.80). CONCLUSION: Our findings support NLR to be a promising biomarker that can be readily integrated into clinical settings to aid in the prediction and prevention of delirium.
