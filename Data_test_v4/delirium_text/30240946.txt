30240946|a|The assembly of Tau into abundant beta-sheet-rich filaments characterizes human tauopathies. A pathological pathway leading from monomeric to filamentous Tau is believed to be at the heart of these diseases. However, in Drosophila models of Tauopathy, neurodegeneration has been observed in the absence of abundant Tau filaments. Here we investigated the role of Tau assembly into beta-sheets by expressing wild-type and Delta306-311 human Tau-383 in the retina and brain of Drosophila. We analyzed both lines for eye abnormalities, brain vacuolization, Tau phosphorylation and assembly, as well as climbing activity and survival. Flies expressing wild-type Tau-383 showed MC-1 staining, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neurodegeneration. By contrast, flies expressing Delta306-311 Tau-383 had less MC-1 staining, reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation, and no detectable neurodegeneration. Their climbing ability and lifespan were similar to those of nontransgenic flies. Fluorescence spectroscopy after addition of Thioflavin T, a dye that interacts with beta-sheets, showed no signal when Delta306-311 Tau-383 was incubated with heparin. These findings demonstrate that the assembly of Tau into beta-sheets is necessary for neurodegeneration.
