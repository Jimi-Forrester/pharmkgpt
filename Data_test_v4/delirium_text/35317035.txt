35317035|t|Frequency of Prescribing and Administering Premedication in Paediatric Surgical Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital: An Observational Study.
35317035|a|INTRODUCTION:  Preoperative period is a stressful event, especially for paediatric patients undergoing surgery. Stress may lead to the development of perioperative maladaptive behaviour, activation of stress responses, and susceptibility to postoperative infections. To alleviate preoperative stress, the use of a multimodal approach including preoperative pharmacological premedication in the ward is recommended. We conducted an observational study to determine the frequency of prescribing and administering premedication in paediatric surgical patients. METHODS: This three-month retrospective observational study was conducted in the main operating room of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from October to December 2014. It included all paediatric patients (aged 1-16 years) coming for elective surgery. Patients' preoperative forms and medical records were reviewed, and data recorded for written orders of premedication and the timing of administration of the premedication drug in the inpatient ward/surgical day care ward. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: This study included 125 paediatric patients. Premedication was not prescribed to 40% (50/125) patients. In these patients, drug and dose were properly mentioned in 98.7% (74/75) of cases while the route and time of administration were not mentioned in 26.6% and 12% prescription orders, respectively. The premedication drug was administered in 67 out of 75 patients (89.3%) by ward nurses as per prescription. The administration of premedication was documented in 95.5% patients, but the time was missing in 46.3% of cases. CONCLUSION: A significant number of patients were not prescribed preoperative premedication by the anaesthetist. Moreover, the route and timing of administration of drug were not mentioned especially in cases when premedication was prescribed in the wards.
