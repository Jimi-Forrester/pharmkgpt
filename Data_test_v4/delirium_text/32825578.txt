32825578|t|Uptake and Fate of Extracellular Membrane Vesicles: Nucleoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Late Endosomes as a New Gate to Intercellular Communication.
32825578|a|Extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) are emerging as new vehicles in intercellular communication, but how the biological information contained in EVs is shared between cells remains elusive. Several mechanisms have been described to explain their release from donor cells and the initial step of their uptake by recipient cells, which triggers a cellular response. Yet, the intracellular routes and subcellular fate of EV content upon internalization remain poorly characterized. This is particularly true for EV-associated proteins and nucleic acids that shuttle to the nucleus of host cells. In this review, we will describe and discuss the release of EVs from donor cells, their uptake by recipient cells, and the fate of their cargoes, focusing on a novel intracellular route wherein small GTPase Rab7+ late endosomes containing endocytosed EVs enter into nuclear envelope invaginations and deliver their cargo components to the nucleoplasm of recipient cells. A tripartite protein complex composed of (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAP-A), oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein-3 (ORP3), and Rab7 is essential for the transfer of EV-derived components to the nuclear compartment by orchestrating the particular localization of late endosomes in the nucleoplasmic reticulum.
