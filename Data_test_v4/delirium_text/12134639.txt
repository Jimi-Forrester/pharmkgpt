12134639|t|[Proteins and mutations: a new vision (molecular) of neurodegenerative diseases].
12134639|a|Neurodegenerative diseases have long been considered to be poorly defined, misunderstood, and inadequately treated. In recent years, research on Alzheimer's disease has led to numerous advances that have improved our understanding of this form of dementia and also of the entire category of neurodegenerative diseases. It now appears that numerous neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system correspond to the aggregation of specific proteins: beta-amyloid in Alzheimer disease, tau protein in Alzheimer disease, fronto-temporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson disease and Lewy body dementia, PrP protein in prion diseases, SOD in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyglutamine expansions in Huntington's disease and other diseases, etc. It is remarkable that in all these cases mutations have been identified for genes coding for these proteins and able to cause the disease and, moreover, that the introduction of the corresponding gene into transgenic mice (or other transgenic animals) has made it possible to create animal models of these conditions. This suggests that the proteins in question play a determinative role in the pathogenesis of these diseases and are not simply consequences of it. Neurodegenerative diseases are proteinopathies. But they are also networkopathies because the neuronal proteins are organized in functional networks. We must also note that all these diseases are associated with the process of aging, for they do not appear in the young. This fact suggests that the anomaly (genetic or otherwise) concerning a given protein does not suffice by itself to induce the disease process. Many observations suggest that the additional event involved, common to all neurodegenerative conditions, may be the intervention of free radicals. We thus propose here the theory that the diversity of neurodegenerative diseases is explained by the combination of two pathogenic events: one specific and associated with the aggregation of a particular protein in the nervous system, the other, non-specific and associated with aging and with the production and harmful actions of free radicals. This unified interpretation leads directly to treatment hypotheses: the development of drugs capable either of inhibiting the production or aggregation of proteins specifically implicated in diverse diseases (or promoting their elimination) or of inhibiting the production or action of free radicals in the nervous system. The former should target one of these various diseases, and the latter should act on a wide range of diseases. The two approaches may conceivably be combined.
