23233176|a|Hip fractures remain one of the most devastating injuries in the elderly. Early prediction of outcome following hip fracture potentially results in more efficient health care. The aims of this study were to explore predictors of ambulation status at hospital discharge in patients >=65 years of age operated on for fracture of the hip, and to investigate the impact of ambulation status at hospital discharge on 1-year mortality after hip fracture. We studied 344 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture during a 12 month period. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore predictive factors for ambulatory status at discharge, and 1-year mortality adjusted on important baseline variables. Cumulative 1-year mortality was significantly lower for patients in the ambulatory group when compared to patients in the non-ambulatory group. Patients who were older, had severe cognitive impairment, lower functional level before injury, and in whom postoperative delirium and pressure ulcers occurred had a higher chance of not recovering their gait ability at hospital discharge, and being dead 1 year after hip fracture. Inability to walk at hospital discharge and presence of delirium are independent predictors of 1-year mortality. Every effort should be made to assure early mobilisation after hip fracture surgery, and prevention, prompt recognition and treatment of postoperative complications is important in order to facilitate better short-and long-term outcome.
