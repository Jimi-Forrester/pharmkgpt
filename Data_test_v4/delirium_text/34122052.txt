34122052|a|Biological aging is a complex process featured by declined function of cells and tissues, including those of the immune system. As a consequence, aging affects the expression and development of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells, which can be seen in their sum as the autoimmunome of an individual. In this study we analyzed whether sets of autoimmune features are associated with specific phenotypes which form autoimmunomic signatures related to age and neurodegenerative diseases. The autoantibody profile data of healthy subjects and patients from the GEO database was used to explore autoimmunomic signatures of aging and three neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Our results demonstrate that the autoimmunomic signature of aging is featured by an undulated increase of IgG autoantibodies associated with learning and behavior and a consistent increase of IgG autoantibodies related to ribosome and translation, and the autoimmunomic signature of aging are also associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, Differential Expression-Sliding Window Analysis (DE-SWAN) identified three waves of changes of autoantibodies during aging at an age of 30, 50, and 62 years, respectively. Furthermore, IgG autoantibodies, in particular those against ribosomal proteins, could be used as prediction markers for aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this study for the first time uncovers comprehensive autoimmunomic signatures for aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
