38605812|a|Viral vector gene therapy has immense promise for treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although adeno-associated virus vectors (AAVs) have had success, their small packaging capacity limits their utility to treat the root cause of many CNS disorders. Adenoviral vectors (Ad) have tremendous potential for CNS gene therapy approaches. Currently, the most common vectors utilize the Group C Ad5 serotype capsid proteins, which rely on the Coxsackievirus-Adenovirus receptor (CAR) to infect cells. However, these Ad5 vectors are unable to transduce many neuronal cell types that are dysfunctional in many CNS disorders. The human CD46 (hCD46) receptor is widely expressed throughout the human CNS and is the primary attachment receptor for many Ad serotypes. Therefore, to overcome the current limitations of Ad vectors to treat CNS disorders, we created chimeric first generation Ad vectors that utilize the hCD46 receptor. Using a "humanized" hCD46 mouse model, we demonstrate these Ad vectors transduce cerebellar cell types, including Purkinje cells, that are refractory to Ad5 transduction. Since Ad vector transduction properties are dependent on their capsid proteins, these chimeric first generation Ad vectors open new avenues for high-capacity helper-dependent adenovirus (HdAd) gene therapy approaches for cerebellar disorders and multiple neurological disorders.
