38064358|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are highly prevalent conditions in middle-aged women that severely impair quality of life. Recent evidence suggests the existence of an intimate cross-talk between the heart and the brain, resulting from a complex network of neurohumoral circuits. From a pathophysiological perspective, the higher prevalence of AD in women may be explained, at least in part, by sex-related differences in the incidence/prevalence of CVD. Notably, the autonomic nervous system, the main heart-brain axis physiological orchestrator, has been suggested to play a role in the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in middle-aged women because of decreases in oestrogen-related signalling during transition into menopause. Despite its overt relevance for public health, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested. Accordingly, in this review, we aim to provide up to date evidence supporting how changes in circulating oestrogen levels during transition to menopause may trigger autonomic dysfunction, thus promoting cardiovascular and cognitive decline in women. A main focus on the effects of oestrogen-mediated signalling at CNS structures related to autonomic regulation is provided, particularly on the role of oestrogens in sympathoexcitation. Improving the understanding of the contribution of the autonomic nervous system on the development, maintenance and/or progression of both cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction during the transition to menopause should help improve the clinical management of elderly women, with the outcome being an improved life quality during the natural ageing process.
