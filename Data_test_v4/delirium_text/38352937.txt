38352937|a|Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a polygenic disease with intricate genetic interactions contributing to quantitative pathogenesis across multiple factors. The principal pathogenic genes of CCM, specifically KRIT1, CCM2, and PDCD10, have been reported, accompanied by a growing wealth of genetic data related to mutations. Furthermore, numerous other molecules associated with CCM have been unearthed. However, tackling such massive volumes of unstructured data remains challenging until the advent of advanced large language models. In this study, we developed an automated analytical pipeline specialized in single nucleotide variants (SNVs) related biomedical text analysis called BRLM. To facilitate this, BioBERT was employed to vectorize the rich information of SNVs, while a deep residue network was used to discriminate the classes of the SNVs. BRLM was initially constructed on mutations from 12 different types of TCGA cancers, achieving an accuracy exceeding 99%. It was further examined for CCM mutations in familial sequencing data analysis, highlighting an upstream master regulator gene fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). With multi-omics characterization and validation in biological function, FGF1 demonstrated to play a significant role in the development of CCMs, which proved the effectiveness of our model. The BRLM web server is available at http://1.117.230.196.
