28478439|t|Cerebrovascular Lesions in Mixed Neurodegenerative Dementia: A Neuropathological and Magnetic Resonance Study.
28478439|a|BACKGROUND: In elderly brains of demented patients, Alzheimer and Lewy body pathology (LBP) are frequently associated. Cortical microinfarcts (CoMIs) are more observed in Lewy body disease, even in the absence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The present neuropathological and 7.0-tesla MRI studies investigate whether CoMIs are also more frequent in mixed neurodegenerative dementia syndromes. SUMMARY: Both examinations revealed that CoMIs are increased to different degrees in mixed dementia syndromes according to the severity of the LBP. They were mainly associated with a trend of older age and arterial hypertension in the patients with the most severe LBP. Messages: The increased number of CoMIs in mixed dementia syndromes with LBP is mainly due to the associated cerebrovascular pathology, even in the absence of CAA.
