31410384|a|The human brain is a dynamic networked system that continually reconfigures its functional connectivity patterns over time. Thus, developing approaches able to adequately detect fast brain dynamics is critical. Of particular interest are the methods that analyze the modular structure of brain networks, that is, the presence of clusters of regions that are densely interconnected. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to identify fast modular states that dynamically fluctuate over time during rest and task. We started by demonstrating the feasibility and relevance of this framework using simulated data. Compared with other methods, our algorithm was able to identify the simulated networks with high temporal and spatial accuracies. We further applied the proposed framework on MEG data recorded during a finger movement task, identifying modular states linking somatosensory and primary motor regions. The algorithm was also performed on dense-EEG data recorded during a picture naming task, revealing the subsecond transition between several modular states that relate to visual processing, semantic processing, and language. Next, we tested our method on a dataset of resting-state dense-EEG signals recorded from 124 patients with Parkinson's disease. Results disclosed brain modular states that differentiate cognitively intact patients, patients with moderate cognitive deficits, and patients with severe cognitive deficits. Our new approach complements classical methods, offering a new way to track the brain modular states, in healthy subjects and patients, on an adequate task-specific timescale.
