38345436|t|Aspongopyrimidine A, a N-Peralkylated Histidine Zwitterion from Aspongopus chinensis against Alzheimer's Disease Targeting MAPRE3.
38345436|a|Aspongopyrimidine A (1), a hexa-1,3-diene-histidine-hexanoic acid adduct featuring a 4,5-dihydro-2H-10lambda4-imidazo[5,1-f]pyrrolo[2,1-b]pyrimidine motif, was isolated from the insect Aspongopus chinensis. The structure was clarified by spectroscopic and computational methods and X-ray diffraction. Peralkylation of N-atoms in histidine by two C6 units makes 1 an inner salt with a 5/6/5 tricyclic system. Biological evaluation found that 1 exerts activity against Alzheimer's disease targeting MAPRE3 through a chemical proteomics approach. This study revealed unusual modifications of amino acids as the fundamental units of protein.
