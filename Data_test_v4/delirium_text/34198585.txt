34198585|t|Density Functional Theory and Molecular Docking Investigations of the Chemical and Antibacterial Activities for 1-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one.
34198585|a|The present investigation informs a descriptive study of 1-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) -3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one compound, by using density functional theory at B3LYP method with 6-311G** basis set. The oxygen atoms and pi-system revealed a high chemical reactivity for the title compound as electron donor spots and active sites for an electrophilic attack. Quantum chemical parameters such as hardness (eta), softness (S), electronegativity (chi), and electrophilicity (omega) were yielded as descriptors for the molecule's chemical behavior. The optimized molecular structure was obtained, and the experimental data were matched with geometrical analysis values describing the molecule's stable structure. The computed FT-IR and Raman vibrational frequencies were in good agreement with those observed experimentally. In a molecular docking study, the inhibitory potential of the studied molecule was evaluated against the penicillin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The carbonyl group in the molecule was shown to play a significant role in antibacterial activity, four bonds were formed by the carbonyl group with the key protein of the bacteria (three favorable hydrogen bonds plus one van der Waals bond) out of six interactions. The strong antibacterial activity was also indicated by the calculated high binding energy (-7.40 kcal/mol).
