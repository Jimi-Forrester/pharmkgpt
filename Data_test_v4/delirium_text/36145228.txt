36145228|a|In recent years, scientific interest in the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) as a complementary approach to the standard cancer therapy has grown, in particular against those of the central nervous system (CNS). In metabolic terms, there are the following differences between healthy and neoplastic cells: neoplastic cells divert their metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), they alter the normal mitochondrial functioning, and they use mainly certain amino acids for their own metabolic needs, to gain an advantage over healthy cells and to lead to a pro-oncogenetic effect. Several works in literature speculate which are the molecular targets of KD used against cancer. The following different mechanisms of action will be explored in this review: metabolic, inflammatory, oncogenic and oncosuppressive, ROS, and epigenetic modulation. Preclinical and clinical studies on the use of KD in CNS tumors have also increased in recent years. An interesting hypothesis emerged from the studies about the possible use of a ketogenic diet as a combination therapy along with chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of cancer. Currently, however, clinical data are still very limited but encouraging, so we need further studies to definitively validate or disprove the role of KD in fighting against cancer.
