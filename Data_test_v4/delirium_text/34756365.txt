People with dementia were significantly and disproportionally affected at the height of the pandemic in England. Community pharmacies in England continued to operate during the pandemic but had to adjust the way they provided key healthcare services. The impact of these changes on the provision of medication services to people with dementia is underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of the community pharmacy team in supporting people with dementia and their family carers with the management of medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An interpretivist/constructivist research paradigm was used; semi-structured one-to-one telephone interviews were conducted with any member of the community pharmacy team who had been involved in providing medication services to people with dementia in England before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment took place between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen participants were interviewed with equal numbers of qualified pharmacists and non-pharmacist staff. Participants were in their role for an average of 4.5 years. The analysis of interviews generated three themes: 1) key interactions curtailed due to COVID-19 restrictions, 2) utilising resources within and outside of the pharmacy to provide tailored services for people with dementia, and 3) the interplay between professional duty and personal values underpinned decisions to provide medication services. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided a unique and important first insights to our understanding of how the community pharmacy team in England supported people with dementia and their family carers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These insights provide opportunities for reflection by individuals, healthcare teams, healthcare organisations, policy makers and the public, in an international context, to enable long-term planning, investment and implementation of strategies beyond the current pandemic.
