38226011|t|A novel adjustable PHBV basement film for enhancing the efficacy of glaucoma surgery by inhibiting scar formation.
38226011|a|Trabeculectomy is the primary surgical approach used to treat glaucoma, but scarring of the filtering passage (filtering bleb) after surgery often leads to treatment failure. To address this issue, we have developed a drug release system called RSG/Pd@ZIF-8 PHBV film. This system enables the sustained release of an anti-fibrosis drug, aiming to prevent scarring. In vitro, the film has the function of continuous Rosiglitazone (RSG) release, with accelerated release after laser irradiation. The antibacterial experiments revealed that the film exhibited antibacterial rates of 87.0 % against E.coli and 97.1 % against S.aureus, respectively. Moreover, we confirmed its efficacy in a rabbit eye model undergoing trabeculectomy. After implantation of the film, we observed a prolonged postoperative period for reducing intraocular pressure (IOP), increased survival rate of filtering blebs, and improved long-term surgical outcomes in vivo. Additionally, the film exhibited excellent biosafety. In summary, the designed sustained-release film in this study possesses the aforementioned functionalities, allowing for the regulation of anti-scarring drug release without causing harm post-surgery. This personalized and precise anti-scarring strategy represents a significant advancement.
