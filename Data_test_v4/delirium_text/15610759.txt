15610759|a|The ageing process precipitates dramatic alterations in the physiology of all organisms, including reduced cellular function, compromised resistance to stress and pathological agents, and increased likelihood of developing age-related diseases. Among the most characteristic pathologies associated with old age are numerous late-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. In addition to stroke, which also inflicts loss of neuronal cells, these conditions account for ever-increasing debilitation among the elderly. Recent studies in model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which offer the prowess of sophisticated genetic approaches, have uncovered significant, novel aspects of the molecular mechanisms that underlie both neurodegeneration and the ageing process. These advances hold promise that the intimate link between the aged state and the manifestation of several neurodegenerative diseases will be deciphered. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which ageing interfaces with, and influences, the progression of neurodegeneration.
