25553453|t|Amyloid beta-protein and lipid rafts: focused on biogenesis and catabolism.
25553453|a|Cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is thought to play a key role in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three secretases (beta-, gamma-, and alpha-secretase) are proteases that control the production of Abeta from amyloid precursor protein. Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains termed 'lipid rafts' are involved in the biogenesis and accumulation of Abeta as well as Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity. gamma-Secretase is enriched in lipid rafts, which are considered an important site for Abeta generation. Additionally, Abeta-degrading peptidases located in lipid rafts, such as neprilysin, appear to play a role in Abeta catabolism. This mini-review focuses on the roles of lipid rafts in the biogenesis and catabolism of Abeta, covering recent research on the relationship between lipid rafts and the three secretases or Abeta-degrading peptidases. Furthermore, the significance of lipid rafts in Abeta aggregation and neurotoxicity is briefly summarized.
