37701704|t|Outpatient hybrid endoscopic submucosal dissection with SOUTEN for early gastric cancer, followed by endoscopic suturing of the mucosal defect: A case report.
37701704|a|BACKGROUND: Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is becoming more common for early gastric cancer, it requires more advanced techniques and a longer treatment duration than endoscopic mucosal resection. Hybrid ESD using a multifunctional snare (SOUTEN) has been reported to be effective for colorectal lesions, as it can reduce treatment duration. Endoscopic suturing of post-ESD mucosal defects has been reported to reduce the incidence of ESD-related complications. CASE SUMMARY: This study reports outpatient hybrid ESD for early gastric cancer using SOUTEN, followed by endoscopic suturing of post-ESD mucosal defects in an 86-year-old man. On referral for ESD, a 10-mm flat, depressed lesion was found on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum, the depth of which was expected to be mucosal. Given his history of delirium, we performed outpatient endoscopic treatment. The procedure used was hybrid ESD using SOUTEN to reduce the duration of treatment and endoscopic suturing of post-ESD mucosal ESD defects to reduce complications. The procedure time was 62 min and the lesion was completely resected based on histopathological examination, with no reported postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: This safe and useful procedure may be especially important for outpatient endoscopic treatment.
