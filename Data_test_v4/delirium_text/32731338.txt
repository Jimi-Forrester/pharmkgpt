32731338|t|Bibliometric Analysis of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research from 1999 to 2019.
32731338|a|Research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has increased over the past two decades. However, few studies have statistically analyzed these publications. In this work, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of studies on CTE to track research trends and highlight current research hotspots. Relevant original articles were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database between 1999 and 2019. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to perform analysis and visualization of scientific productivity and emerging trends. Our results show that the publications related to CTE dramatically increased from four publications in 1999 to 160 publications in 2019. The United States dominated this field with 732 publications (75.934%), followed by Canada with 88 publications (9.129%). Most of related publications were published in the journals with a focus on molecular biology, immunology, neurology, sports and ophthalmology, as represented by the dual-map overlay. A total of 11 major clusters were explored based on the reference co-citation analysis. In addition, three predominant research topics were summarized by clustering high-frequency keywords: epidemiological, clinical and pathological studies. The research frontiers were the diagnosis of diseases using new neuroimaging techniques, and the investigation of the molecular mechanism of tau aggregation. This study provides researchers with valuable guidance in the selection of research topics.
