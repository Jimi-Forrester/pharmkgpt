33044305|t|Tailoring Research Recruitment for Acute Care Settings: Recommendations from People with Dementia and their Caregivers.
33044305|a|BACKGROUND: There is a pressing need to increase enrollment and representation in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) research. Current recruitment approaches focus largely on clinic and community settings, with minimal engagement of acute care environments despite their broad use across diverse populations. The objectives of this study were to examine views, preferences, and recommendations regarding acute care-based ADRD research recruitment among persons with dementia and their caregivers. METHODS: The authors conducted semistructured interviews with recently hospitalized persons with dementia (N=3) and family caregivers (N=28). Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: All participants endorsed acute care as an appropriate time for recruitment into ADRD research studies and identified important elements of an appropriately tailored recruitment approach and an interpersonally effective research staff. Participants emphasized that this approach should consider the acute care context with respect to participant situation, uncertainty, and timing. Participant suggestions informed the design of a 5-step process to guide ADRD research recruitment in the context of acute care. DISCUSSION: Findings provide valuable insights from people with dementia and their caregivers regarding opportunities for research engagement surrounding acute care and can inform expanded recruitment in these settings.
