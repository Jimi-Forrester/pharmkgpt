38566308|t|Evaluating the validity and reliability of the Korean version of Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Cognition.
38566308|a|Objective: The Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) was developed to screen for cognition in PD. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the SCOPA-cog. Methods: We recruited 129 PD patients from 31 clinics with movement disorders in South Korea. The original version of the SCOPA-cognition was translated into Korean using the translation-retranslation method. The test-rest method with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were used to assess reliability. The Spearman's Rank correlation analysis with Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Korean version (MOCA-K) and Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) were used to assess concurrent validity. Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.797, and the ICC was 0.887. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed a significant correlation with the K-MMSE and MOCA-K scores (r = 0.546 and r = 0.683, respectively). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that K-SCOPA-Cog exhibits good reliability and validity.
