35329007|t|Brain Functional Network and Amino Acid Metabolism Association in Females with Subclinical Depression.
35329007|a|This study aimed to investigate the association between complex brain functional networks and the metabolites in urine in subclinical depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from 78 female college students, including 40 with subclinical depression (ScD) and 38 healthy controls (HC). The phase delay index was utilized to construct functional connectivity networks and quantify the topological properties of brain networks using graph theory. Meanwhile, the urine of all participants was collected for non-targeted LC-MS metabolic analysis to screen differential metabolites. The global efficiency was significantly increased in the alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 bands, while the characteristic path length of beta-1 and beta-2 and the clustering coefficient of beta-2 were decreased in the ScD group. The severity of depression was negatively correlated with the level of cortisone (p = 0.016, r = -0.40). The metabolic pathways, including phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan biosynthesis, and nitrogen metabolism, were disturbed in the ScD group. The three metabolic pathways were negatively correlated (p = 0.014, r = -0.493) with the global efficiency of the brain network of the beta-2 band, whereas they were positively correlated (p = 0.014, r = 0.493) with the characteristic path length of the beta-2 band. They were mainly associated with low levels of L-phenylalanine, and the highest correlation sparsity was 0.11. The disturbance of phenylalanine metabolism and the phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine biosynthesis pathways cause depressive symptoms and changes in functional brain networks. The decrease in the L-phenylalanine level may be related to the randomization trend of the beta-1 frequency brain functional network.
