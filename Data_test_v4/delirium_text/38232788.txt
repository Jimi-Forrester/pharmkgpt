38232788|t|14-Week exercise training modifies the DNA methylation levels at gene sites in non-Alzheimer's disease women aged 50 to 70 years.
38232788|a|Exercise training emerges as a key strategy in lifestyle modification, capable of reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to risk factors such as age, family history, genetics and low level of education associated with AD. We aim to analyze the effect of a 14-week combined exercise training (CT) on the methylation of genes associated with AD in non-alzheimer's disease women. CT sessions lasted 60 min, occurring three times a week for 14 weeks. Forty non-Alzheimer's disease women aged 50 to 70 years (60.7 +- 4.1 years) with a mean height of 1.6 +- 0.1 m, mean weight of 73.12 +- 9.0 kg and a mean body mass index of 29.69 +- 3.5 kg/m2, underwent two physical assessments: pre and post the 14 weeks. DNA methylation assays utilized the EPIC Infinium Methylation BeadChip from Illumina. We observed that 14 weeks of CT led to reductions in systolic (p = 0.001) and diastolic (p = 0.017) blood pressure and improved motor skills post-intervention. Among 25 genes linked to AD, CT induced differentially methylated sites in 12 genes, predominantly showing hypomethylated sites (negative beta values). Interestingly, despite hypomethylated sites, some genes exhibited hypermethylated sites (positive beta values), such as ABCA7, BDNF, and WWOX. A 14-week CT regimen was adequate to induce differential methylation in 12 CE-related genes in healthy older women, alongside improvements in motor skills and blood pressure. In conclusion, this study suggest that combined training can be a strategy to improve physical fitness in older individuals, especially able to induce methylation alterations in genes sites related to development of AD. It is important to highlight that training should act as protective factor in older adults.
