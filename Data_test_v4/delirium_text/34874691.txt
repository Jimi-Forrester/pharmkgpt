34874691|a|The self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) generates cytotoxic oligomers linked to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As many fundamental molecular pathways that control Abeta aggregation are yet to be unraveled, an important strategy to control Abeta cytotoxicity is the development of bioactive synthetic nanotools capable of interacting with the heterogeneous ensemble of Abeta species and remodel them into noncytotoxic forms. Herein, the synthesis of nanosized, functional gallic acid (Ga)-based dendrimers with a precise number of Ga at their surface is described. It is shown that these Ga-terminated dendrimers interact by H-bonding with monomeric/oligomeric Abeta species at their Glu, Ala, and Asp residues, promoting their remodeling into noncytotoxic aggregates in a process controlled by the Ga units. The multivalent presentation of Ga on the dendrimer surface enhances their ability to interact with Abeta, inhibiting the primary and secondary nucleation of Abeta fibrillization and disrupting the Abeta preformed fibrils.
