11336614|t|Review of rivastigmine and its clinical applications in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
11336614|a|Rivastigmine (Exelontrade mark, Novartis) is a novel intermediate-acting reversible and non-competitive carbamate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that was recently introduced for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical studies have shown that rivastigmine has many similarities to other currently available cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and some important differences. The drug has been evaluated for this use in two well designed, published, adequately powered, Phase III, 26 week clinical trials that included a total of more than 1500 rivastigmine and 700 placebo recipients. Most of these patients had concomitant disorders that were being treated with numerous other drugs. These studies indicate that rivastigmine (6 - 12 mg/day) usually produces cognitive, global and functional changes that indicate significantly less deterioration than was observed with placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, with higher doses producing more benefits. Rivastigmine is beneficial in all three domains (namely cognition, daily activities and behaviour) of AD. Data on long-term efficacy support continued benefits of rivastigmine beyond 6 months. Rivastigmine is generally well-tolerated with no requirement for routine electrocardiogram (ECG) or blood monitoring. Rivastigmine causes adverse events that are generally those expected from a ChEI and mainly involve gastrointestinal system. They are usually mild-to-moderate, of short duration and responsive to dosage reduction. They occur mostly during the dosage titration phase and decrease during the maintenance phase. Clinically significant drug-drug interactions are unlikely. The consistent efficacy in treating all three domains (cognition, daily functioning and behaviour) and good tolerability, particularly with slow titration, makes rivastigmine a good first-line ChEI therapy for the treatment of AD. Therapeutic dose range is 6 - 12 mg/day. Rivastigmine should be started at 1.5 mg b.i.d. with meals and increased at 2 - 4 week intervals to achieve the highest tolerated dose.
