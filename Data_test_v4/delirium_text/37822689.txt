37822689|t|Pericarditis of Polyarteritis Nodosa.
37822689|a|Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare systemic vasculitis characterised by necrotising inflammation of medium-sized arteries. PAN can affect patients of any age, gender, or ethnic background. Its highest incidence is in the fifth-sixth decade of life, with a slight male-to-female predilection. PAN can be idiopathic or secondary to a multitude of systemic conditions, such as infection, haematological malignancy, or autoinflammatory disorders. PAN has a broad spectrum of possible clinical manifestations the most common being constitutional symptoms, such as fever and myalgia. While cardiac involvement is well-described and is a common cause of mortality, it is exceedingly uncommon as the initial presentation. Below, we describe a case of a female in her 60s who presented with pericarditis as the first manifestation of PAN.
