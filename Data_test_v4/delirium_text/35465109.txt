35465109|t|Probiotics: The Next Dietary Strategy against Brain Aging.
35465109|a|Owing to their long history of safe use, probiotic microorganisms, typically from the genus Lactobacillus, have long been recognized, especially in traditional and fermented food industries. Although conventionally used for dairy, meat, and vegetable fermentation, the use of probiotics in health foods, supplements, and nutraceuticals has gradually increased. Over the past two decades, the importance of probiotics in improving gut health and immunity as well as alleviating metabolic diseases has been recognized. The new concept of a gut-heart-brain axis has led to the development of various innovations and strategies related to the introduction of probiotics in food and diet. Probiotics influence gut microbiota profiles, inflammation, and disorders and directly impact brain neurotransmitter pathways. As brain health often declines with age, the concept of probiotics being beneficial for the aging brain has also gained much momentum and emphasis in both research and product development. In this review, the concept of the aging brain, different in vivo aging models, and various aging-related benefits of probiotics are discussed.
