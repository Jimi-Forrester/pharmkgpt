33656585|a|PURPOSE: To identify complications of surgical tracheostomies in otorhinolaryngologic patients and adjust our processes to be properly prepared in the future. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively all surgical tracheostomies (n = 255) performed by otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons at Helsinki University Hospital between Jan 2014 and Feb 2017. Patient demographics, surgical details, surgical and medical complications, and tracheostomy-related mortality were recorded from the hospital charts. Risk factors for complications were assessed. RESULTS: Altogether, 55 (22%) complications were identified in 39 (15%) patients, with pneumonia, accidental decannulation, and bleeding being the most common. No patient or surgery-related factor reached significance in overall complication risk factor analysis. Medical complications were more common after elective tracheostomies compared to emergency procedures (10.6% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.05). Majority of complications (78%) were classified as mild or moderate according to Clavien-Dindo. Only 2 (0.8%) tracheostomy-related deaths were recorded. CONCLUSION: In otorhinolaryngologists service, severe complications and tracheostomy-related deaths are very rare. Reducing their prevalence even further with careful planning is possible.
