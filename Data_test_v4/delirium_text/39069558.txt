39069558|t|Helical superstructures between amyloid and collagen in cardiac fibrils from a patient with AL amyloidosis.
39069558|a|Systemic light chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL) is a disease where organs are damaged by an overload of a misfolded patient-specific antibody-derived LC, secreted by an abnormal B cell clone. The high LC concentration in the blood leads to amyloid deposition at organ sites. Indeed, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revealed unique amyloid folds for heart-derived fibrils taken from different patients. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of heart-derived AL amyloid (AL59) from another patient with severe cardiac involvement. The double-layered structure displays a u-shaped core that is closed by a beta-arc lid and extended by a straight tail. Noteworthy, the fibril harbours an extended constant domain fragment, thus ruling out the variable domain as sole amyloid building block. Surprisingly, the fibrils were abundantly concatenated with a proteinaceous polymer, here identified as collagen VI (COLVI) by immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) and mass-spectrometry. Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) showed how COLVI wraps around the amyloid forming a helical superstructure, likely stabilizing and protecting the fibrils from clearance. Thus, here we report structural evidence of interactions between amyloid and collagen, potentially signifying a distinct pathophysiological mechanism of amyloid deposits.
