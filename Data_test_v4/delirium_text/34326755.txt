34326755|t|Neuropsychiatric Aspects in a Patient Diagnosed with Frontotemporal Dementia: Clinical Case of Low Incidence and Prevalence Disease in Colombia.
34326755|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neuropsychiatric pathology characterized by dysfunctions in the frontal lobe of the brain, especially in planning, execution, and inhibition tasks, with an inability to make decisions and handle different sequences, also affecting the temporal lobe. The patient presents alterations to store, consolidate, and recall information. These neurocognitive deficits are accompanied by neurobehavioral disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy that contribute to the worsening of the quality of life, with a high impact on the individual, social, and family level. To identify the neurobehavioral disorders and neurocognitive deterioration that present a patient diagnosed with FTD: clinical case of low incidence and prevalence disease in Colombia. A 40-year-old man, with progressive deterioration of his immediate verbal memory, low verbal fluency, aberrant motor behavior, sexual impulsivity, alterations in his executive functions, especially in planning tasks, decision-making, and inhibition was found to have a lesser degree of affectation in his visuospatial functioning and visuoconstructive abilities. It was found that the patient presents a severe dysexecutive syndrome associated with a clinical picture of FTD, correlated with an inability to process and recall information, accompanied by disorders such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. It is necessary to generate a functional neurorehabilitation plan that aims to improve the quality of life in these patients. In the same way, it is necessary to create new lines of research and intervention that have the purpose to create a greater field of heuristics or new questions in this type of neurodegenerative pathologies.
