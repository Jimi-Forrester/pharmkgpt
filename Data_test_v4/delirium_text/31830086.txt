31830086|t|Plasmacytoid dendritic cell and myeloid dendritic cell function in ageing: A comparison between elderly and young adult women.
31830086|a|Ageing is associated with a changing immune system, leading to inflammageing (increased levels of inflammation markers in serum) and immunosenescence (reduced immune cells and reduced responses towards pathogens). This results in reduced vaccination responses and increased infections in elderly. Much is known about the adaptive immune system upon ageing, but less is known about the innate immune system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare innate immune function of Toll like receptor (TLR)-mediated responses between elderly and young adult women. To this end, elderly and young adult women were compared to study the effect of ageing on the relative prevalence and reactivity to TLR-mediated responses of myeloid- and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDC, pDC). In addition, TLR expression and inflammatory markers in serum were investigated. Elderly women had reduced numbers of circulating pDCs. In addition, pDCs and mDCs of elderly women responded differently towards TLR stimulation, especially TLR7/8 mediated stimulation was reduced, compared to young adults. In serum, markers involved in inflammation were generally increased in elderly. In conclusion, this study confirms and extends the knowledge about immunosenescence and inflammageing on innate immunity in elderly women.
