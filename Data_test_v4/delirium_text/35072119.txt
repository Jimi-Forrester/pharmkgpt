35072119|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple efforts have been taken across the world to bridge gaps in evidence and provide recommendations for dementia care and caregiver support during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to review the available literature on measures used to alleviate the negative impacts of the pandemic on dementia care. METHODS: We searched three databases: PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO to identify studies that described strategies that were recommended or taken to provide care and support to persons with dementia and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We included a total of 37 papers, originating from high, middle and low-income countries. We also included 6 papers exploring safety of COVID-19 vaccinations. Infection prevention recommendations predominantly involved providing consistent reminders to persons with dementia to engage in infection prevention measures and included measures to restrict wandering in long-term care settings to reduce spread of infection. Medical care included tele and video consultations to maintain and monitor clinical stability. Guidance for continuing rehabilitation activities for persons with dementia through remotely conducted cognitive stimulating activities, physical exercises and environmental modifications were further highlighted by multiple studies/articles. In addition, strategies to support caregivers were also advised and included teleconsultations and psycho-educational programs. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed gaps in health and social care systems across the world, but has also revealed the enduring dedication of clinicians, expert groups and dementia support organizations to modify and adapt existing dementia care services to meet the needs of persons with dementia and their caregivers during periods of emergency.
