21368863|a|The triple-transgenic Alzheimer (3 x Tg-AD) mouse expresses mutant PS1(M146V), APP(swe), and tau(P301L) transgenes and progressively develops plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with a temporal- and region-specific profile that resembles the neuropathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we used proteomic approaches such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to investigate the alterations in protein expression occurring in the brain and cerebellum of 3 x Tg-AD and presenilin-1 (PS1) knock-in mice (animals that do not develop Abeta- or tau-dependent pathology nor cognitive decline and were used as control). Finally, using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis we evaluated novel networks and molecular pathways involved in this AD model. We identified several differentially expressed spots and analysis of 3 x Tg-AD brains showed a significant downregulation of synaptic proteins that are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, storage and release, as well as a set of proteins that are associated with cytoskeleton assembly and energy metabolism. Interestingly, in the cerebellum, a structure not affected by AD, we found an upregulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and protein catabolism. Our findings help to unravel the pathogenic brain mechanisms set in motion by mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and hyperphosphorylated tau. These data also reveal cerebellar pathways that may be important to counteract the pathogenic actions of Abeta and tau, and ultimately offer novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
