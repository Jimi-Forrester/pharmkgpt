37250694|t|A review on multiple sclerosis prognostic findings from imaging, inflammation, and mental health studies.
37250694|a|Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is commonly used to detect where chronic and active lesions are in multiple sclerosis (MS). MRI is also extensively used as a tool to calculate and extrapolate brain health by way of volumetric analysis or advanced imaging techniques. In MS patients, psychiatric symptoms are common comorbidities, with depression being the main one. Even though these symptoms are a major determinant of quality of life in MS, they are often overlooked and undertreated. There has been evidence of bidirectional interactions between the course of MS and comorbid psychiatric symptoms. In order to mitigate disability progression in MS, treating psychiatric comorbidities should be investigated and optimized. New research for the prediction of disease states or phenotypes of disability have advanced, primarily due to new technologies and a better understanding of the aging brain.
