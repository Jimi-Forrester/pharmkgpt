30365242|t|Postoperative behavioral changes in Chinese children undergoing hypospadias repair surgery: A prospective cohort study.
30365242|a|BACKGROUND: The perioperative period can be psychologically challenging, and children may exhibit behavioral changes following surgical anesthesia. It is unknown whether children in China have additional risk factors associated with negative behavioral changes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of behavioral changes in children after hypospadias repair surgery and to identify potential risk factors associated with negative behavioral changes. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 177 children aged 2-12 years scheduled for hypospadias repair surgery from 2016 to 2017 was studied. The primary outcome was the incidence of behavioral changes on postoperative days 14 and 30 evaluated with the Post-Hospitalization Behavioral Questionnaire. Data collected included demographic data, anesthesia details, procedure details, admission details, child anxiety, child temperament, pain, and emergence delirium. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with postoperative negative behavioral changes. RESULTS: A total of 60.5% (107/177) of children exhibited negative postoperative behavioral changes on day 14 and 46.5% (79/170) exhibited changes on day 30 after the surgery. Approximately 2.3% (4/177) and 2.4% (4/170) of children showed improved behavior on postoperative days 14 and 30, respectively. The frequency of temper tantrums changed the most. The logistic regression results suggested that a younger age (odds ratio: 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.96), emotional temperament (odds ratio: 1.1; 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.2) and maternal education (odds ratio: 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.5) were associated with negative postoperative behavioral changes on day 14. On day 30, a younger age (odds ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.98) was the only factor associated with negative postoperative behavioral changes. CONCLUSION: For children undergoing hypospadias repair surgery in our institution, approximately three in five showed postoperative behavioral changes. In addition to a younger age and a higher maternal education, an emotional temperament is associated with a high incidence of negative postoperative behavioral changes.
