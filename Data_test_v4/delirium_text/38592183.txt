38592183|t|Total Muscle Area and Visceral Adipose Tissue Measurements for Frailty Assessment in TAVR Patients.
38592183|a|Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment option for severe aortic valve stenosis. Pre-TAVR assessments, extending beyond anatomy, include evaluating frailty. Potential frailty parameters in pre-TAVR computed tomography (CT) scans are not fully explored but could contribute to a comprehensive frailty assessment. The primary objective was to investigate the impact of total muscle area (TMA) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as frailty parameters on 5-year all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVR. Methods: Between 01/2017 and 12/2018, consecutive TAVR patients undergoing CT scans enabling TMA and VAT measurements were included. Results: A total of 500 patients qualified for combined TMA and VAT analysis. Age was not associated with a higher risk of 5-year mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.998-1.049; p = 0.069). Body surface area normalized TMA (nTMA) was significantly associated with 5-year, all-cause mortality (HR 0.927, 95% CI: 0.927-0.997; p = 0.033), while VAT had no effect (HR 1.002, 95% CI: 0.99-1.015; p = 0.7). The effect of nTMA on 5-year, all-cause mortality was gender dependent: the protective effect of higher nTMA was found in male patients (pinteraction: sex x nTMA = 0.007). Conclusions: Normalized total muscle area derived from a routine CT scan before transcatheter aortic valve replacement complements frailty assessment in patients undergoing TAVR.
