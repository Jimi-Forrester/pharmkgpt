35813998|t|Modeling Neurodegenerative Diseases Using In Vitro Compartmentalized Microfluidic Devices.
35813998|a|The human brain is a complex organ composed of many different types of cells interconnected to create an organized system able to efficiently process information. Dysregulation of this delicately balanced system can lead to the development of neurological disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). To investigate the functionality of human brain physiology and pathophysiology, the scientific community has been generated various research models, from genetically modified animals to two- and three-dimensional cell culture for several decades. These models have, however, certain limitations that impede the precise study of pathophysiological features of neurodegeneration, thus hindering therapeutical research and drug development. Compartmentalized microfluidic devices provide in vitro minimalistic environments to accurately reproduce neural circuits allowing the characterization of the human central nervous system. Brain-on-chip (BoC) is allowing our capability to improve neurodegeneration models on the molecular and cellular mechanism aspects behind the progression of these troubles. This review aims to summarize and discuss the latest advancements of microfluidic models for the investigations of common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
