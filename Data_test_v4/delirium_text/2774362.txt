2774362|t|Delirium in the surgical patient.
2774362|a|Delirium is a common and often unrecognized syndrome in hospitalized surgical patients. It can be caused by many different physical abnormalities, which are potentially correctable. Frequently, several etiologies coexist. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Delirium might be recognized (and its associated serious physical disorders corrected) earlier and more frequently if the diagnosis is considered whenever a patient has mental or behavioral abnormalities.
