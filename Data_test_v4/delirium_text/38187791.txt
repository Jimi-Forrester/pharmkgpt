38187791|t|Vitamin B6: a scoping review for Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2023.
38187791|a|Pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (PLP) is the main form of vitamin B6 in animal tissue and functions as a coenzyme for more than 160 different enzymatic reactions in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and neurotransmitters. Estimated dietary intake of vitamin B6 and plasma PLP values differ a lot between studies, something which may be due to variable use of supplements, variations in dietary assessment and analytical methods. These factors make it difficult to achieve precise data for setting a correct recommended intake of vitamin B6. In addition, a plasma PLP concentration of 30 nmol/L is considered to be sufficient and the current recommendations for vitamin B6 intake is based on this concept. However, the metabolic marker for vitamin B6 status, HK ratio (HKr), starts to increase already when plasma PLP falls below 100 nmol/L and increases more steeply below 50 nmol/L, indicating biochemical deficiency. Consequently, a plasma PLP concentration of 30 nmol/L, may be too low as a marker for an adequate vitamin B6 status.
