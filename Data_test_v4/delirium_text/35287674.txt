This study analysed untargeted metabolomics combined with proteomics of serum from patients with sepsis to reveal the underlying pathological mechanisms involved in sepsis. METHODS: A total of 63 patients with sepsis and 43 normal controls were enrolled from a prospective multicentre cohort. The biological functions of the metabolome were assessed by coexpression network analysis. A molecular network based on metabolomics and proteomics data was constructed to investigate the key molecules. RESULTS: Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of amino acid metabolism, which regulates inflammation and immunity, in patients with sepsis. Seventy-three differentially expressed metabolites ( log2 fold change  > 1.5, adjusted P value < 0.05 and variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 1.5) that could predict sepsis were identified. External validation of the hub metabolites was consistent with the derivation results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.81-0.96/0.62-1.00). The pentose phosphate pathway was found to be related to sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Phenylalanine metabolism was associated with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. The key molecular alterations of the multiomics network in sepsis compared to normal controls implicate acute inflammatory response, platelet degranulation, myeloid cell activation involved in immune response and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and arginine biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated analysis of untargeted metabolomics and proteomics revealed characteristic metabolite and protein alterations in sepsis, which were mainly involved in inflammation-related pathways and amino acid metabolism. This study depicted the pathological characteristics and pathways involved in sepsis and potential therapeutic targets.
