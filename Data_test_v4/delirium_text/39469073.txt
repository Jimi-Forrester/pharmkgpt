Traditional sleep monitoring methods like polysomnography (PSG) are complex and often impractical for long-term use in clinical settings. Target: This study aimed to explore the utility of the Bispectral Index (BIS) as a more practical alternative for monitoring sleep patterns in DoC patients. Methods: We conducted simultaneous PSG and BIS monitoring on 38 DoC patients (19 UWS and 19 MCS). The study focused on analyzing sleep timing distribution, the effectiveness of BIS in differentiating sleep stages, and its correlation with consciousness levels. Results: Our findings revealed that DoC patients exhibited irregular and fragmented sleep patterns, necessitating extended monitoring periods. The BIS effectively differentiated various sleep stages, with significant differences in BIS values observed across these stages. However, BIS values did not show significant differences between UWS and MCS patients, indicating that BIS primarily indicates wakefulness rather than cognitive awareness. DoC patients have disturbed sleep-wake cycles that require prolonged monitoring. BIS can well distinguish sleep stages in DoC patients, and the distribution of values is similar to that of normal subjects. However, BIS could not distinguish the level of consciousness of DoC patients. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of BIS as a practical tool for long-term sleep monitoring in DoC patients, offering a less intrusive alternative to traditional methods.
