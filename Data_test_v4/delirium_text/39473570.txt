39473570|t|A Step Toward an NIR-Emitting ESIPT Probe for Smart Zn2+ Sensing in Different Environments.
39473570|a|Current sensors for Zn2+ detection are largely based on the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism, which can effectively change the fluorescence intensity, without inducing a significant spectral shift. By coupling the PET mechanism with an excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), a near-infrared fluorescent sensor was developed for Zn2+ detection. Upon binding to the Zn2+ cation, the sensor was able to generate two well-separated emission bands (lambdaem   540 and 770 nm), whose ratio was quite sensitive to the probe's environments. The finding offers an advanced tool for in vitro and in vivo imaging of the Zn2+ cation, which is desirable for future discovery of the biological functions of zinc.
