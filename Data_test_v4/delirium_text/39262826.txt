39262826|t|Neurophysiological patterns reflecting vulnerability to delirium subtypes: a resting-state EEG and event-related potential study.
39262826|a|Delirium is a common and acute neurocognitive disorder in older adults associated with increased risk of dementia and death. Understanding the interaction between brain vulnerability and acute stressors is key to delirium pathophysiology, but the neurophysiology of delirium vulnerability is not well defined. This study aimed to identify pre-operative resting-state EEG and event-related potential markers of incident delirium and its subtypes in older adults undergoing elective cardiac procedures. This prospective observational study included 58 older participants (mean age = 75.6 years, SD = 7.1; 46 male/12 female); COVID-19 restrictions limited recruitment. Baseline assessments were conducted in the weeks before elective cardiac procedures and included a 4-min resting-state EEG recording (2-min eyes open and 2-min eyes closed), a 5-min frequency auditory oddball paradigm recording, and cognitive and depression examinations. Periodic peak power, peak frequency and bandwidth measures, and aperiodic offsets and exponents were derived from resting-state EEG data. Event-related potentials were measured as mean component amplitudes (first positive component, first negative component, early third positive component, and mismatch negativity) following standard and deviant auditory stimuli. Incident delirium occurred in 21 participants: 10 hypoactive, 6 mixed, and 5 hyperactive. Incident hyperactive delirium was associated with higher pre-operative eyes open (P = 0.045, d = 1.0) and closed (P = 0.036, d = 1.0) aperiodic offsets. Incident mixed delirium was associated with significantly larger pre-operative first positive component amplitudes to deviants (P = 0.037, d = 1.0) and larger third positive component amplitudes to standards (P = 0.025, d = 1.0) and deviants (P = 0.041, d = 0.9). Other statistically non-significant but moderate-to-large effects were observed in relation to all subtypes. We report evidence of neurophysiological markers of delirium risk weeks prior to elective cardiac procedures in older adults. Despite being underpowered due to COVID-19-related recruitment impacts, these findings indicate pre-operative dysfunction in neural excitation/inhibition balance associated with different delirium subtypes and warrant further investigation on a larger scale.
