30627274|t|Obstructive Sleep Apnea Screening in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: Missed Opportunities for Early Diagnosis.
30627274|a|BACKGROUND: "There is a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). There is also strong evidence that proper OSA management can reduce AF recurrence." Polysomnography is the gold standard for OSA diagnosis, but screening tests, such as STOP-BANG, have been successful in identifying patients at risk for OSA. Our study assesses screening rates for OSA in patients with persistent AF, and willingness of patients at increased risk for OSA towards further diagnostic evaluation. METHODS: A total of 254 persistent AF patients were surveyed regarding prior screening for OSA, and if previously unscreened, assessed with STOP-BANG. Prior cardioversions and willingness to undergo further workup was also recorded. Patients at risk for OSA were given educational brochures. Subjects with diagnosis of OSA were asked about their compliance with positive airway pressure therapy. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of AF patients were never screened for OSA; 75% unscreened participants (95% CI: 68-81%) were at high risk for OSA. Patients with previous hospitalizations or electrical cardioversions were more frequently screened for OSA (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, respectively). Forty-three percent of high-risk individuals had a BMI < 30. Among patients at risk for OSA (score >= 3), the majority (n = 99, 79%) were interested in follow-up with a sleep study (n = 93, 74%). CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a strong OSA-associated risk for AF, which is amenable to intervention, most patients with persistent AF are not assessed for OSA. Simple to use screening questionnaires are sensitive and can reliably identify patients at high risk for OSA, reserving costlier and somewhat inconvenient nocturnal polysomnography to only those at risk. We hope our study will help to push the AF and OSA connection into the spotlight in the primary care of patients with AF.
