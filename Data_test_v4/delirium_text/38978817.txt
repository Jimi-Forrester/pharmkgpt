38978817|t|The evolution of mammalian Rem2: unraveling the impact of purifying selection and coevolution on protein function, and implications for human disorders.
38978817|a|Rad And Gem-Like GTP-Binding Protein 2 (Rem2), a member of the RGK family of Ras-like GTPases, is implicated in Huntington's disease and Long QT Syndrome and is highly expressed in the brain and endocrine cells. We examine the evolutionary history of Rem2 identified in various mammalian species, focusing on the role of purifying selection and coevolution in shaping its sequence and protein structural constraints. Our analysis of Rem2 sequences across 175 mammalian species found evidence for strong purifying selection in 70% of non-invariant codon sites which is characteristic of essential proteins that play critical roles in biological processes and is consistent with Rem2's role in the regulation of neuronal development and function. We inferred epistatic effects in 50 pairs of codon sites in Rem2, some of which are predicted to have deleterious effects on human health. Additionally, we reconstructed the ancestral evolutionary history of mammalian Rem2 using protein structure prediction of extinct and extant sequences which revealed the dynamics of how substitutions that change the gene sequence of Rem2 can impact protein structure in variable regions while maintaining core functional mechanisms. By understanding the selective pressures, protein- and gene - interactions that have shaped the sequence and structure of the Rem2 protein, we gain a stronger understanding of its biological and functional constraints.
