39476270|a|OBJECTIVE: This review aims to formulate the most current, evidence-based recommendations regarding complication avoidance, rehabilitation, pain therapy and palliative care for patients with metastatic spine tumors. METHODS: A systematic literature search in PubMed and MEDLINE, and was performed from 2013 to 2023 using the search terms "complications" + "spine metastases", "spine metastases" + + "rehabilitation", "spine metastases" + "pain therapy" + "palliative care". Screening criteria resulted in 35, 15 and 56 studies respectively that were analyzed. Using the Delphi method and two rounds of voting at two separate international meetings, nine members of the WFNS (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies) Spine Committee generated nine final consensus statements. RESULTS: Preoperative assessment for complications following surgery in patients with metastatic spine tumors should include estimation of Karnofsky score, site of primary tumor, number of spinal and visceral metastasis, ASA score and preoperative Hb (Hemoglobin) value. Complication risk factors are age > 65 years, preoperative ASA score of 3 and 4 and greater operative blood loss. Pain management using WHO analgesic concept and early mobilization are needed, starting with non-opioids, weak opioids followed by strong opioids. Morphine is the first choice for moderate to severe pain whereas IV-PCA may be used for severe breakthrough pain with monitoring. Use of bisphosphonates is considered in cases of non-localized pain and not accessible radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These nine final consensus statements provide current, evidence-based guidelines on complication avoidance, rehabilitation, pain therapy and palliative care for patients with spinal metastases.
