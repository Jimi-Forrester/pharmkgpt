7711494|a|The authors examined relationships between quantified EEG (qEEG) variables and neuropsychological performance in 54 consecutive patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients were studied with qEEG and a neuropsychological battery that assessed memory, attention, verbal functions, set-shifting abilities, and procedural learning. More severe memory, attention, and verbal deficits were significantly correlated with lower alpha relative power, and increased theta relative power was significantly correlated with poor set-shifting abilities. No qEEG variables were significantly correlated with the procedural learning task. These correlations between deficits in specific cognitive domains and qEEG bands suggest that qEEG may have an important role in the investigation of the cognitive deficits in AD.
