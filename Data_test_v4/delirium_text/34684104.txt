34684104|t|Investigation of the Factors Affecting Quality of Life in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease in Terms of Patients and Caregivers.
34684104|a|Background and Objectives: As with other chronic diseases with limited medical treatment, the most important goal of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment is to provide a better quality of life (QoL). The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the QoL of patients with mild to moderate AD in terms of patients and caregivers. Materials and Methods: Seventy-three home-dwelling patients with AD and their caregivers participated in this prospective, cross-sectional study. The patients were asked about their cognition, depression and a self-rating part of a QoL questionnaire. The caregivers were asked about their patients' sociodemographic information, sleepiness, activities of daily living and a proxy rating part of a QoL questionnaire. Results: The self-rated QoL was higher than that provided by the proxy rating. Cognition (p = 0.02), sleepiness (p < 0.01) and depression (p = 0.03) were correlated with the self-rated QoL, while the patient's independence level in activities of daily living was correlated with the proxy-rated QoL (p < 0.05). In regard to predicting QoL according to linear regression analysis, the following were statistically significant: depression was for total score, depression and cognition were for the self-rating and instrumental activities of daily living was for the proxy rating (p < 0.01). Conclusions: While individual factors such as psychology are an important determinant of QoL for patients with AD, objective conditions such as the independence of the patient in daily life are important for the caregiver. While evaluating the quality of life of AD patients, it is important to remember that patients and caregivers have different priorities, and the priorities of both should be taken into account when planning a treatment program.
