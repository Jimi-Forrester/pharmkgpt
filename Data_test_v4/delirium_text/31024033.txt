31024033|a|Manganese (Mn) is an essential element, but in humans, chronic and/or acute exposure to this metal can lead to neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinsonism and Parkinson's Disease by unclear mechanisms. To better understand the effects that exposure to Mn2+ exert on eukaryotic cell biology, we exposed a non-essential deletion library of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a sub-inhibitory concentration of Mn2+ followed by targeted functional analyses of the positive hits. This screen produced a set of 43 sensitive deletion mutants that were enriched for genes associated with protein biosynthesis. Our follow-up investigations demonstrated that Mn reduced total rRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner and decreased expression of a beta-galactosidase reporter gene. This was subsequently supported by analysis of ribosome profiles that suggested Mn-induced toxicity was associated with a reduction in formation of active ribosomes on the mRNAs. Altogether, these findings contribute to the current understanding of the mechanism of Mn-triggered cytotoxicity. Lastly, using the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database, we revealed that Mn shared certain similarities in toxicological mechanisms with neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.
