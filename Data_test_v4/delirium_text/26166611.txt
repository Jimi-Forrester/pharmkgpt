26166611|t|The Innate Immunity in Alzheimer Disease- Relevance to Pathogenesis and Therapy.
26166611|a|The genetic, cellular, and molecular changes associated with Alzheimer disease provide evidence of immune and inflammatory processes involvement in its pathogenesis. These are supported by epidemiological studies, which show some benefit of long-term use of NSAID. The hypothesis that AD is in fact an immunologically mediated and even inflammatory pathological process may be in fact scientifically intriguing. There are several obstacles that suggest the need for more complex view, in the process of targeting inflammation and immunity in AD. In our previous studies we proposed a reliable methodology to assess innate immunity in Alzheimer patients and controls. The methodology is based on the phenomenon of human leukocytes being resistant to viral infection. The unspecific character of the resistance, dependent on interferons and tumor necrosis factor, and occurrence in cells ex vivo indicate that an in vivo mechanism of innate immunity may be involved. The above mentioned resistance could be estimated in a test based on peripheral blood leukocytes infection by vesicular stomachs virus.
