31998013|t|Goal-directed fluid therapy using transoesophageal echocardiographic inferior venacaval index in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction undergoing major cytoreductive surgery: A clinical trial.
31998013|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aims to trans oesophageal echo cardiographically (TOE) measure inferior venacava diameter (IVCD) during inspiration and expiration in poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) patients undergoing cytoreductive oncosurgery, to ascertain if any correlation exists between, caval index (DeltaIVCD), and stroke volume variation (SVV), and to compare DeltaIVCD-guided versus SVV-guided fluid therapy. METHODS: In this prospective, parallel group, interventional study, seventy American Society of Anesthesiologists-III patients, aged 30-75 years, weighing 40-90 kg, with LVEF <=40% undergoing cytoreductive surgery were included and randomised to group-D (DeltaIVCD-guided fluid therapy) and group-S (SVV-guided fluid therapy). Patients with oesophageal lesions were excluded. After standard endotracheal anaesthesia, arterial and internal jugular vein catheters were placed. A TOE probe was inserted in the interventional group-D. Quantification of IVCD respiratory variations was done. Heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2), mean arterial pressure, end tidal carbondioxide (EtCO2), central venous pressure, SVV, IVCD, and urine output (UO) were recorded every 30 min. Post-operative arterial blood gas analysis, lung-ultrasound, chest-radiograph, and serum creatinine were done. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pearson's correlation coefficient as measure of strength of linear relationship, calculation of regression equation, and unpaired t-test for normally distributed continuous variables were used. RESULTS: A positive correlation between DeltaIVCD and SVV (r = 0.751) was observed. A regression equation was obtained for SVV (SVV = [0.317 x DeltaIVCD] + 5.877). Serum lactate, estimated glomerular filtration rate, HR, and UO were within normal limits in group-D. There was no pulmonary oedema. CONCLUSION: DeltaIVCD-guided intravenous fluid therapy is valuable in low LVEF patients where tight fluid control is essential and any fluid overload may precipitate cardiac failure.
