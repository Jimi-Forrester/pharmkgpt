26830653|t|Age-dependent inverse correlations in CSF and plasma amyloid-beta(1-42) concentrations prior to amyloid plaque deposition in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice.
26830653|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a critical role as a biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In addition to its diagnostic potential in the brain, recent studies have suggested that changes of Abeta level in the plasma can possibly indicate AD onset. In this study, we found that plasma Abeta(1-42) concentration increases with age, while the concentration of Abeta(1-42) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) decreases in APPswe, PS1M146V and TauP301L transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, if measurements were made before formation of ThS-positive plaques in the brain. Our data suggests that there is an inverse correlations between the plasma and CSF Abeta(1-42) levels until plaques form in transgenic mice's brains and that the plasma Abeta concentration possesses the diagnostic potential as a biomarker for diagnosis of early AD stages.
