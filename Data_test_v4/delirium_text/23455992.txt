23455992|a|A highly selective, rapid, inexpensive, simple, and immunocytochemical compatible fluorescence staining method for Alzheimer's disease hallmark lesions applicable to sections of human specimens embedded in paraffin is described. Human necropsy material was fixed in buffered formalin, sectioned at 10 mum, mounted on slides, deparaffinized, and partially hydrated (70% ethanol). After partial hydration, sections were stained for 10 min in a solution of 0.2% Congo red in 70% isopropanol. After washing in 70% isopropanol and rehydration, auto-fluorescence of sections were quenched (optional) and processed for immunocytochemistry (optional). Finally, sections were mounted in an adequate mounting medium. Amyloid deposits appear pink at light microscopy and all Alzheimer's disease hallmark lesions appear orange or red under fluorescence microscopy using blue or green exciting light, respectively. The present method can be used in combination with all pre- or post-immunocytochemical techniques.
