38923244|t|Development of a New Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Radioligand Targeting RIPK1 in the Brain and Characterization in Alzheimer's Disease.
38923244|a|Targeting receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as a promising therapeutic stratagem for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). A positron emission tomography (PET) probe enabling brain RIPK1 imaging can provide a powerful tool to unveil the neuropathology associated with RIPK1. Herein, the development of a new PET radioligand, [11C]CNY-10 is reported, which may enable brain RIPK1 imaging. [11C]CNY-10 is radiosynthesized with a high radiochemical yield (41.8%) and molar activity (305 GBq/micromol). [11C]CNY-10 is characterized by PET imaging in rodents and a non-human primate, demonstrating good brain penetration, binding specificity, and a suitable clearance kinetic profile. It is performed autoradiography of [11C]CNY-10 in human AD and healthy control postmortem brain tissues, which shows strong radiosignal in AD brains higher than healthy controls. Subsequently, it is conducted further characterization of RIPK1 in AD using [11C]CNY-10-based PET studies in combination with immunohistochemistry leveraging the 5xFAD mouse model. It is found that AD mice revealed RIPK1 brain signal significantly higher than WT control mice and that RIPK1 is closely related to amyloid plaques in the brain. The studies enable further translational studies of [11C]CNY-10 for AD and potentially other RIPK1-related human studies.
