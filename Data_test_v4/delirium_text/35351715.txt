35351715|a|OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide an insight into the life of survivors of critical COVID-19 in China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey and qualitative interviews among intensive care unit survivors of critical COVID-19 between November and December 2020 in Wuhan, China. Eligible participants were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L and the Short Form 36-Item Survey, and invited to participate in a semistructured face-to-face interview. Descriptive analyses and phenomenological approach were adopted to analyse quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. RESULTS: Of 10 survivors who completed the questionnaire, 8 participated in the interview. The mean scores+-SD of EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level utility and EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale were 0.88+-0.15 and 80.9+-14.2, respectively. The qualitative interview identified four themes, namely poor physical health, post-traumatic stress, social stigma and family support. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 survivors continue fighting physical and psychological impacts. Despite strong family support, these patients are struggling with social stigma. It is a long, challenging journey to recovery for patients and society.
