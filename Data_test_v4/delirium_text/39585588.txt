39585588|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIO) offers a less traumatic resection for cancer patients resulting in improved quality of life. Concerns about the oncological efficacy of the procedure and potential impact on survival may have limited its wider adoption. This study reports survival outcomes fifteen years after patients underwent a total MIO for esophageal cancer. METHODS: A single-centre analysis of survival outcomes was conducted on all patients who underwent MIO between 2004 and 2010 and had completed at least 15-years follow-up. Actual overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The pattern of association of patient factors with survival was assessed with the Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients underwent resection, with 4 (3.3%) in-patient deaths. With a median follow-up time of 15.2 years, the median OS was 41 months. At 15-years there were 20 survivors (17.1%), with numbers at 10 and 5 years being 34 (29.1%) and 45 (38.5%) respectively. Median DFS was 27 months, with 19 (16.2%) patient disease free at 15 years, and 32 (27.4%) and 38 (32.5%) at 10 and 5 years respectively. Predictors of poor survival were the intracorporeal fashioning of the gastric conduit, perioperative blood transfusions, advanced disease stage and recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Long term survival outcomes following MIO support its increasing recognition as the standard of care as for curative resection in esophageal cancer.
