37929898|a|INTRODUCTION: in the last decades, a significant increase in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been observed. Currently, there are no effective pharmacological treatments available, which makes preventive measures particularly important. OBJECTIVE: to analyze the available scientific evidence on nutritional and dietary factors and their association with AD prevention. METHODS: a review of nutritional and dietary factors related to the prevention of AD was conducted. RESULTS: several dietary components have been positively associated with AD prevention, including intake of complex carbohydrates, fiber, omega-3, plant-based proteins, vitamins (folates, choline, vitamin D, C, B6 and B9), zinc, some bioactive compounds such as flavonols and probiotics. Following the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) y Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets has been associated with a lower risk of developing the disease. CONCLUSION: nutrition may have a protective role against AD, although further studies are needed in this regard.
