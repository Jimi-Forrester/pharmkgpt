20197608|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) in the hippocampus of rats with Alzheimer's disease(AD), and to determine the effect of butylphthalide on them and its significance. METHODS: Sixty male adult rats were randomly divided into a model group, a Butylphthalide group, and a control group. AD models were established by injecting beta-amyloid protein 1-42 into the hippocampus of rats. Sixty days later,the rats were sacrificed and both sides of the hippocampus were sectioned for immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Positive cells of GFAP in the hippocampus of the model group increased and the expression of VEGF decreased statistically, compared with the control group(P<0.01). The positive cells of GFAP in the hippocampus of the butylphthalide group decreased and the expression of VEGF increased significantly, compared with the model group(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Butylphthalide may protect the neuron-vascular unit of the hippocampus of Alzheimer model rats by inhibiting the expression of GFAP and increasing the expression of VEGF.
