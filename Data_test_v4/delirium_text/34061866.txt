34061866|t|Sleeping pattern and activities of daily living modulate protein expression in AMD.
34061866|a|Degeneration of macular photoreceptors is a prominent characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which leads to devastating and irreversible vision loss in the elderly population. In this exploratory study, the contribution of environmental factors on the progression of AMD pathology by probing the expression of candidate proteins was analyzed. Four hundred and sixty four participants were recruited in the study comprising of AMD (n = 277) and controls (n = 187). Genetics related data was analyzed to demonstrate the activities of daily living (ADL) by using regression analysis and statistical modeling, including contrast estimate, multinomial regression analysis in AMD progression. Regression analysis revealed contribution of smoking, alcohol, and sleeping hours on AMD by altered expression of IER-3, HTRA1, B3GALTL, LIPC and TIMP3 as compared to normal levels. Contrast estimate supports the gender polarization phenomenon in AMD by significant decreased expression of SLC16A8 and LIPC in control population which was found to be unaltered in AMD patients. The smoking, food habits and duration of night sleeping hours also contributed in AMD progression as evident from multinomial regression analysis. Predicted model (prediction estimate = 86.7%) also indicated the crucial role of night sleeping hours along with the decreased expression of TIMP-3, IER3 and SLC16A8. Results revealed an unambiguous role of environmental factors in AMD progression mediated by various regulatory proteins which might result in intermittent AMD phenotypes and possibly influence the outcome of anti-VEGF treatment.
