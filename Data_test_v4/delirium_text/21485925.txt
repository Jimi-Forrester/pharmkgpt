21485925|a|This article presents the results of a retrospective analysis of anesthesia care and perioperative outcomes in children up to 2 years of age who underwent strabismus surgery during a five-year period at the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital. We reviewed the charts of 74 children to determine perioperative outcomes--namely discomfort, emergence agitation/delirium, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).We found that although PONV was not an issue in this age group, as it was with older children, discomfort and emergence agitation/delirium do need to be considered during their care.
