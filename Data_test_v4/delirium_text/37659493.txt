37659493|a|One of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the pervasiveness of AD being considerable, the rates of both diagnosis and therapy are comparatively less and still lacking. For the treatment of AD, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists (Memantine) have received clinical approval. The approved drugs are only capable of mitigating the symptoms; however, halting the progression of the disease remains a matter of substantial concern. MicroRNAs (also known as miRs or microRNAs) are a subclass of non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules that target mRNAs to control the expression of genes in certain tissues. Deregulation of expression and function of miRs results in neurodegeneration-like AD pathogenesis including Abeta aggregation, hyper-phosphorylation of Tau-protein, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis are the hallmarks of AD characterized by cognitive deterioration and learning disabilities. According to the research, numerous miRs have considerably different expression patterns in AD patients compared to healthy people. Because of these genes, miRs are effective diagnostic and therapeutic agents in the management of this fatal condition. This review will look at the clinical and preclinical data of miR-related potential diagnostics and therapeutic agents by various techniques (miR-Antagonists or Inhibitors, miR-Agonists or Mimics, miR-Sponges, and miR-Antisense Oligonucleotide) target to specific pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders.
