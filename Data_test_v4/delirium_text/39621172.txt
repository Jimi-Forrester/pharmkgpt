39621172|a|PURPOSE: The aims were to assess whether vitamin D deficiency influenced mortality risk and length of acute hospital stay in patients presenting with a hip fracture. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken including all patients aged over 50 years that were admitted with a hip fracture to a single centre during a 24-month period. Serum vitamin D levels on admission, patient demographics, perioperative variables and mortality were collected. Cox regression analysis was utilised to determine the independent association between serum vitamin D levels and patient mortality. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1510 patients with a mean age of 81.3 years and 1107 (71.4%) were female. 876 (58.0%) were vitamin D deficient (< 50 nmol/l). The median follow up was 405 (IQR 249 to 610) days. During follow-up there were 464 deaths (30.7%). Vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.53, P = 0.022). Male sex (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.01, P < 0.001) was also associated with a higher mortality risk. Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with length of hospital stay (median difference 0 days, P = 0.207). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with increased mortality in hip fracture patients, though this finding may be influenced by lack of comprehensive adjustment for comorbidity. While the value of routine serum vitamin D measurement is debated, supplementation during hospital stays is important to reduce falls and fracture risks associated with deficiency.
