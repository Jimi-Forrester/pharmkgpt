19008069|t|[Bradycardia induced by galantamine].
19008069|a|An 80-year-old man had to be operated for cutaneous neoplasia. Local anaesthesia with sedation was required. Preoperative examination revealed a pronounced albeit asymptomatic bradycardia. Electrocardiogram showed a complete atrioventricular block. Use of a pacemaker was discussed. Finally, surgery was performed uneventfully after transient reversal of the anticholinesterasic effects of galantamine administered in Alzheimer's disease control over several hours with atropine.
