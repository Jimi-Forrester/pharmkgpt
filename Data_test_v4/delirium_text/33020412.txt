33020412|a|To date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative condition that affects memory, language, and behavior. AD is characterized by neuroinflammation, accumulation of brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles, increased neuronal apoptosis, and loss of synaptic function. Promoting regular exercise and a diet containing polyphenols are effective non-pharmacological approaches that prevent the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we measured various conformational toxic species of Abeta and markers of inflammation, apoptosis, endolysosomal degradation, and neuroprotection after 5 months of exercise training (ET), resveratrol (Resv) treatment, or combination treatment in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. Our main results indicate that Resv decreased neuroinflammation and accumulation of Abeta oligomers, increased levels of neurotrophins, synaptic markers, silent information regulator, and decreased markers of apoptosis, autophagy, endolysosomal degradation and ubiquitination in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. ET improved some markers related to neuroprotection, but when combined with Resv treatment, the benefits achieved were as effective as Resv treatment alone. Our results show that the neuroprotective effects of Resv, ET or Resv and ET are associated with reduced toxicity of Abeta oligomers, suppression of neuronal autophagy, decreased apoptosis, and upregulation of key growth-related proteins.
