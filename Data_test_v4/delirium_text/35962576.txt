35962576|a|The master epigenetic regulator lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300/CBP plays a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. Recent evidence has shown that in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression level and function of p300/CBP are severely compromised, leading to altered gene expression causing pathological conditions. Here, we show that p300/CBP activation by a small-molecule TTK21, conjugated to carbon nanosphere (CSP) ameliorates Abeta-impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation, theta burst stimulation, and synaptic tagging/capture (STC). This functional rescue was correlated with CSP-TTK21-induced changes in transcription and translation. Mechanistically, we observed that the expression of a large number of synaptic plasticity- and memory-related genes was rescued, presumably by the restoration of p300/CBP mediated acetylation. Collectively, these results suggest that small-molecule activators of p300/CBP could be a potential therapeutic molecule for neurodegenerative diseases like AD.
