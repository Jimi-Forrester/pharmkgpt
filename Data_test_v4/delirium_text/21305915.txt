21305915|t|Datura stramonium intake: a report on three cases.
21305915|a|This article describes three cases of Datura stramonium intake on two nonconsecutive days. In the first case, the patient took a small amount of D. stramonium seeds without showing any symptoms of intoxication. The other two patients had taken a considerable amount of seeds and reported a sudden surge in strength and energy, with some aggressive compulsion towards their peers. They showed delirium as well as confusion and disorientation. The absence of any specific legislation makes D. stramonium a tempting alternative to other psychoactive substances. Thus, it is extremely important to be able to recognize its symptoms so as to be able to diagnose any signs of intoxication properly.
