19501713|t|Neuroimaging of cognitive impairments in vascular disease.
19501713|a|Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is increasingly recognized as a common cause of cognitive impairment and dementia, alone or in conjunction with other neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease. The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has been proposed as an umbrella term to recognize the broad spectrum of cognitive changes associated with vascular pathology, mainly characterized by executive impairment together with particular noncognitive features.
