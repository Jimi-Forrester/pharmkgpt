38003965|a|Background: Remimazolam besylate, a newly developed drug, is linked to various anaphylaxis cases. We present a case of remimazolam anaphylaxis confirmed using a provocation test. Case: A 51-year-old female patient was scheduled for humeral pinning. General anesthesia was induced using remimazolam, rocuronium, and remifentanil. After tracheal intubation, the patient experienced decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and a systemic rash. Epinephrine was administered repeatedly, and the patient's vital signs stabilized. Acute phase tryptase levels were within normal limits. After four weeks, intradermal test results were negative. When remimazolam was administered intravenously for the provocation test, facial swelling, flushing, and coughing occurred, which improved with epinephrine. The culprit drug was identified as remimazolam using a provocation test. Conclusions: When anaphylaxis occurs during anesthesia induction, remimazolam should not be ruled out as the causative drug. If the skin test result for remimazolam is negative, a provocation test should be considered. The provocation test should be initiated cautiously at a low dose under careful patient monitoring.
