37998701|a|Because subjective cognitive decline (SCD) manifests before the clinical and irreversible onset of dementia, efforts to address SCD are imperative for the early identification and prevention of dementia. For people who actually experience SCD, having a usual source of care may be an important catalyst for addressing memory issues. This study investigates the relationship between having a usual source of care and the discussion of SCD with healthcare providers, while taking into account racial and ethnic differences. The pooled 2019-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 47 states in the U.S. was used. The sample included 7900 individuals aged 50 and older who reported significant cognitive decline. Using logistic regression with state-level clustering, we found that those with a usual source of healthcare were almost twice as more likely to discuss memory loss with a healthcare provider. In order to test for the multiplicative effects, we included an interaction term between each race category and having a primary care provider (PCP). There was a significant interaction effect between Hispanic ethnicity and having a PCP (OR = 0.25, p < 0.05). While non-Hispanic respondents who had a PCP had a higher probability of discussing memory issues with a healthcare provider (42% vs. 25%), Hispanic respondents with a PCP were less likely to discuss their memory loss with a healthcare provider (36% vs. 49%). The study adds to the growing literature on the vital role of the primary care service in provision of service to those with cognitive decline, while revealing ethnic disparity in memory-loss-related communication with healthcare providers in a primary care setting.
