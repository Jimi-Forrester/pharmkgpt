38823487|t|Does resistance training in older adults lead to structural brain changes associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's dementia? A narrative review.
38823487|a|Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's Disease (AD), has links to several modifiable risk factors, especially physical inactivity. When considering the relationship between physcial activity and dementia risk, cognitive benefits are generally attributed to aerobic exercise, with resistance exercise (RE) receiving less attention. This review aims to address this gap by evaluating the impact of RE on brain structures and cognitive deficits associated with AD. Drawing insights from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) utilizing structural neuroimaging, the specific influence of RE on AD-affected brain structures and their correlation with cognitive function are discussed. Preliminary findings suggest that RE induces structural brain changes in older adults that could reduce the risk of AD or mitigate AD progression. Importantly, the impacts of RE appear to follow a dose-response effect, reversing pathological structural changes and improving associated cognitive functions if performed at least twice per week for at least six months, with greatest effects in those already experiencing some element of cognitive decline. While more research is eagerly awaited, this review contributes insights into the potential benefits of RE for cognitive health in the context of AD-related changes in brain structure and function.
