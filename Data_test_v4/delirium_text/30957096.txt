30957096|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with abnormal glucose metabolism, inflammation and greater oxidative stress in the brain, each of which may contribute uniquely and perhaps synergistically to HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) risk. The ketogenic (i.e., low carbohydrate) diet provides the brain with a highly efficient mitochondrial fuel and is associated with improved cognitive performance in older adults with impaired neurocognitive functioning secondary to ageing, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease; however, whether these cognitive gains are generalizable to older adults with HAND is unknown. Thus, the process and cognitive outcomes of the first participant randomized to the intervention and to the control group were investigated in this case-comparison study. To our knowledge, this is first report to establish the plausibility of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for HAND.
