19051657|t|How accurate are primary care referral letters for presumed acute stroke?
19051657|a|The introduction of thrombolysis for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke has increased the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis. Research has shown a high rate of misdiagnosis of acute stroke in the community by paramedics and primary care doctors (PCDs). In this study, referral letters for presumed acute stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) were audited to assess the diagnostic accuracy of PCDs and the quality of the referral letters. In 30% of cases, the diagnosis of stroke was correct. Important stroke mimics included sepsis, delirium and functional disorders. PCDs may benefit from a stroke recognition tool to increase diagnostic accuracy.
