25962230|a|Caring for a patient with dementia who lives at home, sometimes alone, presents a constant challenge for general practitioners. This article uses a clinical vignette to explore the initiation of medical care and treatment in an elderly patient with dementia. We specifically address how to inform the patient and family of the initial diagnosis and important issues to discuss from the start. We also examine issues such as delirium, medication adjustments, behavioral difficulties, feeding, and treatment of associated pathologies such as hypertension and diabetes.
