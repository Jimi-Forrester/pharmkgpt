37085218|a|Although respiratory manifestations are the most common driver of hospitalization, SARS-CoV-2 infection has a wide range of manifestations, including multisystem organ failure in severe cases. This review discusses the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes of nonpulmonary organ dysfunction from SARS-CoV2, including renal, liver, cardiac, neurologic, and coagulation system dysfunction. At this time, management largely focuses on supportive care practices that are applicable regardless of the cause of organ injury.
