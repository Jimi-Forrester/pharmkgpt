36879635|a|Introduction: the purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19-related deaths in Tunisia notified at the ONMNE (National Observatory of New and emerging Diseases) between 2nd March 2020 and 28th February 2021 and to compare COVID-19-related deaths recorded in Tunisia with the international data. Methods: we conducted a national prospective longitudinal descriptive study of data collected from the National Surveillance System of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the ONMNE, Ministry of Health. All COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Tunisia between March 2020 and February 2021 were included in this study. Data were collected from hospitals, municipalities and regional health departments. Death notifications were collected from multiple data sources (triangulation): The Regional Directorate of Basic Health Care, the ShocRoom (Strategic Health Operations Center), public and private health facilities, the Crisis Unit of the Presidency of the Government, the Directorate for Hygiene and Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment, as part of the follow-up of confirmed cases by the ONMNE team, positive RT-PCR / TDR post mortem results. Results: during this study, 8051 deaths were recorded, corresponding to a proportional mortality of 10.4%. The median age was 73 years, with an interquartile range of 17 years. Sex-ratio (M/F) was 1.8. The crude death rate was 69.1/100 000 inhabitants and fatality rate was 3.5%. The analysis of the epidemic curve showed 2 peaks of deaths on 29th October 2020 and 22nd January 2021, with 70 and 86 deaths notified respectively. The spatial distribution of mortality showed that the southern Tunisian region had the highest mortality rate. Patients aged 65 and over were most affected (73.7% of cases) with a crude mortality rate of 570.9/100,000 inhabitants and a fatality rate of 13.7%. Conclusion: prevention strategy based on public health measures must be reinforced by the rapid deployment of anti-COVID-19 vaccination, especially for people at risk of death.
