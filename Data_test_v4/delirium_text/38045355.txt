38045355|a|Efforts to find disease modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have met with limited success in part because the focus has been on testing drugs that target a specific pathogenic mechanism. Multiple pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Hence, the probability of more effective treatment for AD is likely increased by using an intervention that targets more than one pathway. The naturally occurring peptide GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine), as a GHK-Cu complex, supports angiogenesis, remodeling, and tissue repair, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and has been shown to improve cognitive performance in aging mice. In order to test GHK-Cu as a neurotherapeutic for AD, male and female 5xFAD transgenic mice on the C57BL/6 background at 4 months of age were given 15 mg/kg GHK-Cu intranasally 3 times per week for 3 months until 7 months of age. Results showed that intranasal GHK-Cu treatment delayed cognitive impairment, reduced amyloid plaques, and lowered inflammation levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These observations suggest additional studies are warranted to investigate the potential of GHK-Cu peptide as a promising treatment for AD.
