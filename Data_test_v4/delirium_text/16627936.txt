16627936|t|The management of agitation in demented patients with propranolol.
16627936|a|Congress and the FDA have strongly suggested that tranquilizers and antipsychotics not be used in agitated demented frail elderly patients. The medical profession has not moved away from the tradition of antipsychotic sedation of such patients. Use of 'modern second generation low dose' antipsychotics continue to be the standard of care. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker with good penetration of the CNS, is a reasonable and safe alternative to sedatives and antipsychotics. Anti-dementia drugs are complementary to propranolol. A case study which contrasts the two pharmacologic approaches is detailed. A method of estimating delirium-agitation risk in dementia patients (DRN method) is described.
