38916221|a|BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety (PA) is common in children and has detrimental effects on surgical outcome. Strategies based on virtual reality (VR) have recently been introduced to address this problem. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the usefulness of a virtual reality educational program (VREP) for reducing preoperative anxiety in elective low-complexity paediatric surgery. DESIGN: Randomised clinical trial. SETTING: Single tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Between January 2019 and June 2022. PATIENTS: Children aged 3-13 years of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II, scheduled for elective low-complexity surgery were enrolled in the study. INTERVENTION: Children were randomised into a control group (received oral/written information about the anaesthetic-surgical process, and patients and their parents remained in a playroom waiting for the surgery) or VREP (viewed a VR-based educational video on the surgical process, 7-10 days prior to surgery) using the MATLAB application. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: PA using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) during separation from parents. RESULTS: In total, 241 children aged 3-12 years of age were studied (120 patients with VREP and 121 controls). Randomisation eliminated the differences between the groups, except for a greater male presence in the VREP group (83.3% vs. 71.1%; P  = 0.023). The mYPAS yielded was lower in the VREP group (29.2% vs. 83.5%; P  < 0.001). Sex did not influence VREP-mediated decrease in PA ( P  < 0.001). In turn, VREP patients were more cooperative (Induction Compliance Checklist [ICC] score 0 points vs. 2 points; P  < 0.001) during anaesthesia induction, presented less delirium (Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium [PAED] score 1 point vs. 3 points; P  = 0.001) on leaving the recovery room, and experienced less pain upon arrival in the hospital ward (Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale: 0-points vs. 1 point; P  < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The VREP-based prevention strategy reduced preoperative anxiety in children undergoing elective low-complexity surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03578393.
