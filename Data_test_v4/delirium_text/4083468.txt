4083468|t|[Increased tendency to seizures as affected by long-term infusions of etomidate in delirium tremens].
4083468|a|A report is given on the clinical trial of the ultra-short-acting hypnotic etomidate for treatment of withdrawal delirium with special reference to delirium tremens. Severe and disturbing side-effects such as myoclonic movements or seizures with equivalent EEG changes compelled discontinuance of the therapy in five of seven patients. The activation of epileptogenic activity in the treatment of delirium tremens by etomidate long-term-infusions and the lack of international experience in this field do not support the use of etomidate as an anticonvulsive agent.
