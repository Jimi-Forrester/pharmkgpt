38274422|a|Objective: To construct and validate nomogram models that predict the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Elderly patients (>=65y) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the hospital were included. We used the 3-min diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method for delirium diagnosis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistical regression analysis was performed to explore potential independent influencing factors of delirium. A predict model visualized by nomogram was constructed based on the confirmed variables. The predictive accuracy and clinical value of the model were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The data of 311 elderly patients were analyzed, of whom 73 (23.47%) patients were diagnosed with delirium. Three independent influencing factors of delirium were confirmed: age (OR1.16,1.11-1.22), Glomerular filtration rate (OR 0.98,0.97-0.99), platelet-large cell ratio (1.06,1.02-1.10). These parameters were used to create a nomogram to predict the development of delirium, which showed good predictive accuracy confirmed by the ROC curves (AUC 0.82,0.76-0.88). Conclusion: We construct a credible nomogram to predict the development of delirium in elderly patients with Non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our finding may be useful to physicians in early prevention and treatment of delirium.
