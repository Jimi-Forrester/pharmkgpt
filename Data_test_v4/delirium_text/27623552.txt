27623552|t|Exploring Delirium's Heterogeneity: Association Between Arousal Subtypes at Initial Presentation and 6-Month Mortality in Older Emergency Department Patients.
27623552|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine how delirium subtyped by level of arousal at initial presentation affects 6-month mortality. DESIGN: This was a preplanned secondary analysis of two prospective cohort studies. SETTING: Academic tertiary care emergency department (ED). PARTICIPANTS: 1,084 ED patients who were 65 years old or older. MEASUREMENTS: At the time of enrollment, trained research personnel performed the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and the Richmond Agitation Sedation Score to determine delirium and level of arousal, respectively. Patients were categorized as having no delirium, delirium with normal arousal, delirium with decreased arousal, or delirium with increased arousal. Death was ascertained by medical record review and the Social Security Death Index. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to analyze the association between delirium arousal subtypes and 6-month mortality. RESULTS: Delirium with normal arousal was the only subtype that was significantly associated with increased 6-month mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-7.4) compared with the no delirium group after adjusting for confounders. The HRs for delirium with decreased and increased arousal were 1.4 (95% CI: 0.9-2.1) and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.3-5.4), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Delirious ED patients with normal arousal at initial presentation had a threefold increased hazard of death within 6 months compared with patients without delirium. There was a trend towards increased hazard of death in delirious ED patients with decreased arousal, but this relationship did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that subtyping delirium by arousal may have prognostic value but requires confirmation with a larger study.
