37908310|a|Recent studies suggest that pleiotropic effects may explain the genetic architecture of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We conducted a comprehensive gene-centric pleiotropic association analysis for ten CVDs using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to identify pleiotropic genes and pathways that may underlie multiple CVDs. We found shared genetic mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of CVDs, with over two-thirds of the diseases exhibiting common genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Significant positive genetic correlations were observed in more than half of paired CVDs. Additionally, we investigated the pleiotropic genes shared between different CVDs, as well as their functional pathways and distribution in different tissues. Moreover, six hub genes, including ALDH2, XPO1, HSPA1L, ESR2, WDR12, and RAB1A, as well as 26 targeted potential drugs, were identified. Our study provides further evidence for the pleiotropic effects of genetic variants on CVDs and highlights the importance of considering pleiotropy in genetic association studies.
