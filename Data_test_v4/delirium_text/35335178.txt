35335178|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease. In our previous study, we found that amber-a fossilized plant resin-can protect cells from apoptosis by decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we focused on the effect of amber on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell apoptosis in the human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y (one model for PD). Initially, we determined the protective effect of amber on the PD model. We found that amber extract has a protective effect against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell apoptosis. The decrease in ROS, cleaved caspase-3, pERK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) protein levels confirmed that amber extract decreases apoptosis via the ROS-mediated ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, we determined the effects of amber extract on autophagy. The results showed that amber extract increased the levels of LC3II and Beclin-1, suggesting that amber extract can protect neuronal cells against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cell apoptosis by promoting autophagy.
