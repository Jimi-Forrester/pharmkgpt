37667179|a|PURPOSE: Transfusing red blood cells promptly corrects anemia and improves tissue oxygenation in around 40% of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) after major surgical operations. This study's goal is to investigate how blood transfusions affect the mortality rates of patients after major surgery who are hospitalized in the ICU. METHODS: Retrospective research was done on recently hospitalized patients who had major procedures in the ICU between October 2020 and February 2022 at the Huanggang Central Hospital of Yangtze University, China. The patients' prognoses at three months were used to classify them as either survivors or deceased. Patient demographic information, laboratory results, and blood transfusion histories were acquired, and the outcomes of the two groups were compared based on the differences. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the prognosis of surgical disease patients first admitted to the ICU. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive power of each risk factor. The relationship between transfusion frequency, transfusion modality, and patient outcome was examined using Spearman's correlation analysis. RESULTS: Data from 384 patients was included in the research; of them, 214 (or 55.7%) died within three months of their first stay in the ICU. The death group had higher scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) than the survival group did (all P < 0.05); the death group also had lower scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, platelet distribution width, and blood transfusion ratio. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.654 (1.281-1.989), a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.440 (1.207-1.701), and a P value of 0.05 for death in patients undergoing major surgery who were hospitalized to the intensive care unit (ICU). Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.836, 0.799, and 0.871, respectively, and 95% CIs of 0.796-0.875, 0.755-0.842, and 0.837-0.904, respectively, all P0.05, had significant predictive value for patients initially admitted to the ICU and for APACHE II score > = 12 points, SOFA score > = 6, and blood transfusion. When all three indicators were used jointly to predict a patient's prognosis after major surgery, the accuracy increased to 86.4% (sensitivity) and 100% (specificity). There was a negative correlation between the number of blood transfusions a patient had and their outcome (r = 0.605, P < 0.001) and death (r = 0.698, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A higher initial ICU APACHE II score, SOFA score, and a number of blood transfusions were associated with improved survival for patients undergoing major surgical operations. Patients' death rates have increased with the increase in the frequency and variety of blood transfusions.
