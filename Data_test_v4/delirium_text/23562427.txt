23562427|a|BACKGROUND: Microbleeds have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), although it is unclear whether they occur in atypical presentations of AD, such as the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA). We aimed to assess the presence and clinical correlates of microbleeds in lvPPA. METHODS: Thirteen lvPPA subjects underwent 3T T2*-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography imaging. Microbleeds were identified on manual review and assigned a regional location. Total and regional white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden was measured. RESULTS: Microbleeds were observed in four lvPPA subjects (31%), most commonly in the frontal lobe. Subjects with microbleeds were older, more likely female, and had a greater burden of WMH than those without microbleeds. The regional distribution of microbleeds did not match the regional distribution of WMH. All cases were PiB positive. CONCLUSIONS: Microbleeds occur in approximately one third of subjects with lvPPA, with older women at the highest risk.
