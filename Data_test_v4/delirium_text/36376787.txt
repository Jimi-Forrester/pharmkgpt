36376787|t|Spanish version of the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale: translation and cross-cultural adaptation.
36376787|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) is a mental disturbance in children during recovery from general anaesthesia. The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is the only validated scale that assesses ED in paediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia. The aim of this study was the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the PAED scale into Spanish (Chile).  METHODS: A five-stage translation and cross-cultural adaptation process was carried out. The reliability of the Spanish version of the PAED scale was evaluated in paediatric patients independently by a set of two raters (anaesthesiologists or postanaesthesia care unit nurses) in the postanaesthetic period after major outpatient surgery. ED was defined by a cut-off level of >= 10 points on the PAED scale.  RESULTS: The PAED scale was evaluated in 353 consecutive children. Patients had a mean age of 7.4 +- 3.22 years. The preoperative ASA Physical Status class was 62%, 37%, and 1% (ASA class I, II and III, respectively). The distribution of patients by service was as follows: 45% of patients underwent paediatric surgery; 33% underwent otorhinolaryngological surgery; 11% underwent orthopaedic surgery; 10% underwent ophthalmological surgery; and 1% underwent other types of surgery. The interrater agreement ranged from 96.9% to 97.9%, with Kappa values ranging from 0.59 to 0.79. The Cronbach's alpha value was 0.91. The ED global incidence was 9.1% and was higher in the younger age groups (3-10 years). CONCLUSIONS: The translated and cross-culturally adapted Spanish version of the PAED scale is a reliable instrument to measure ED in the postanaesthetic period in Chilean children.
