37706414|a|Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of perioperative dexmedetomidine (DEX) application on stress response, post-operative pain and prognosis in patients undergoing gynaecologic laparoscopy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and sixty-eight patients admitted for gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery from May 2020 to November 2022 were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into pre-operative DEX group (n = 56), intraoperative DEX group (n = 56) and post-operative DEX group (n = 56) according to the application of DEX in the perioperative period. The visual analogue scale (VAS), time awake, extubation time, pneumoperitoneum time, post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay time and Richmond agitation-sedation scale score (RASS) were recorded. Results: Patients in both the pre-operative and intraoperative DEX groups had substantially shorter wakeup and extubation times than those in the post-operative DEX group. Patients in the pre-operative DEX group had considerably shorter wakeup and extubation times than those in the intraoperative DEX group, and their pneumoperitoneum time was significantly shorter than that of the post-operative DEX group (P < 0.001). The RASS scores of the pre-operative DEX group and intraoperative DEX group were significantly lower than those of the post-operative DEX group at 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after surgery. Meanwhile, at all time periods, the RASS scores of patients in the pre-operative DEX group were considerably lower than those in the intraoperative DEX group (P < 0.01). The VAS scores of patients in the pre-operative DEX group and intraoperative DEX group were evidently lower than those in the post-operative DEX group at 0.5 h, 2 h and 12 h postoperatively, and the VAS scores of patients in the pre-operative DEX group were markedly lower than those in the intraoperative DEX group (P < 0.001). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in the pre-operative DEX group than in the intraoperative DEX group and the post-operative DEX group at 0-2 h, >2-12 h and >12-24 h postoperatively (P < 0.001). The incidence of nausea and vomiting in the intraoperative DEX group was significantly lower than that in the post-operative DEX group from 0 to 2 h after surgery (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions was not significantly different amongst the three groups of patients (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Pre-operative and intraoperative application of DEX can help reduce post-operative pain and stress responses, help patients recover quickly after surgery and improve patient prognosis, especially the pre-operative application of DEX.
