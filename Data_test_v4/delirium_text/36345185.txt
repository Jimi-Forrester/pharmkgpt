36345185|t|The effect of surgical technique on cognitive function in elderly patients with hip fractures: Proximal femoral nailing versus hemiarthroplasty.
36345185|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the effects of hemiarthroplasty (HA) and proximal femoral nailing (PFN) on postoperative cognitive function in elderly adults with hip fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 2021 and January 2022, a total of 49 patients (28 males, 21 females; mean age: 78.1+-9.4 years; range, 65 to 96 years) presented with a proximal femoral fracture were included. The patients were divided into two groups based on the type of surgical technique used. Group 1 consisted of 23 patients who underwent cemented HA, while Group 2 consisted of 26 patients who underwent osteosynthesis with a PFN. Preoperatively (24 h before surgery), within the first week (Days 4 to 7), and at one month following surgery, the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) was applied. RESULTS: The surgery side and duration of surgery were not significantly different between the two groups (p>0.05); however, the length of hospital stay and estimated blood loss were significantly different (p<0.001) in favor of Group 2. When the decline in MMSE scores from preoperative to postoperative was assessed, it was shown that group 2 had a lesser decrease. CONCLUSION: Patients with hip fractures who underwent PFN surgery experienced less postoperative cognitive impairment than those who underwent HA surgery.
