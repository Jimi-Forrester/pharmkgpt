33907005|a|Traumatic brain injury is a sudden trauma or blow on the head, and severe traumatic brain injury is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. The acute and chronic consequences following traumatic brain injury can lead to progressive secondary neurodegenerative changes and cognitive dysfunction. To date, there is no effective pharmaceutical products for the treatment to reduce secondary damage after brain injury. The discovery of extracellular vesicles has attracted considerable scientific attention due to their role in cell-to-cell communication. Extracellular vesicles have shown their potential to carry not only biological molecules but also as a drug delivery vehicle. As a carrier of molecular information, extracellular vesicles have been involved in physiological functions as well as in the modulation of immune responses. Here, we aim to provide new insights into the contrasting role of extracellular vesicles in the propagation of inflammatory responses after brain injury. As a carrier of pro-inflammatory molecules, their role as functional mediators in the pathophysiology of brain injury is discussed, addressing the inhibition of the extracellular vesicle pathway as an anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective approach to improve the outcome of both acute and chronic inflammation following brain injury. Here, we summarize therapeutic strategies to diminish the risk the neurodegeneration post brain injury and propose that neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitors could be used as potentially useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain injury associated neuroinflammation.
