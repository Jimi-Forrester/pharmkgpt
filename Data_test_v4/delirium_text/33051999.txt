33051999|a|OBJECTIVE: We developed interim guidance for the care of patients with cognitive impairment in hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A Guidance Committee and Readers Group were recruited. The content was identified by the Committee and content-specific subgroups, resulting in a draft document, which was sent to the Readers for review. People with dementia and care partners were involved in all aspects of the process. RESULTS: Infection control measures can lead to an escalation of distress. In an environment where visiting bans are applied to care partners/advocates, hospitals need to ensure care partners can continue to provide decision-making support. Health-care professionals can proactively engage care partners using videoconferencing technologies. Developing models of care that proactively support best practice can minimise the risk of delirium, mitigate escalating symptoms and guide the use of non-pharmacological, pharmacological (start low, go slow) or physical restraint in managing behavioural and psychological symptoms.
