38956664|t|Effect of esketamine combined with dexmedetomidine on delirium in sedation for mechanically ventilated ICU patients: protocol for a nested substudy within a randomized controlled trial.
38956664|a|BACKGROUND: Use of sedatives and analgesics is associated with the occurrence of delirium in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine reduces the occurrence of delirium but may cause hypotension, bradycardia, and insufficient sedation. This substudy aims to determine whether the combination of esketamine with dexmedetomidine can reduce the side effects and risk of delirium than dexmedetomidine alone in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, active-controlled, superiority trial will be conducted at The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. A total of 134 mechanically ventilated patients will be recruited and randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine alone or esketamine combined with dexmedetomidine, until extubation or for a maximum of 14 days. The primary outcome is the occurrence of delirium, while the second outcomes include the number of delirium-free days; subtype, severity, and duration of delirium; time to first onset of delirium; total dose of vasopressors and antipsychotics; duration of mechanical ventilation; ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS); accidental extubation, re-intubation, re-admission; and mortality in the ICU at 14 and 28 days. DISCUSSION: There is an urgent need for a new combination regimen of dexmedetomidine due to its evident side effects. The combination of esketamine and dexmedetomidine has been applied throughout the perioperative period. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the effects of this regimen on delirium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. This substudy will evaluate the effects of the combination of esketamine and dexmedetomidine in reducing the risk of delirium for mechanically ventilated patients in ICU, thus providing evidence of this combination to improve the short-term prognosis. The study protocol has obtained approval from the Medical Ethics Committee (ID: 2022-SR-450). TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05466708, registered on 20 July 2022.
