23732905|a|Immunization with synthetic, preaggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) was the first treatment approach able to dramatically reduce brain Abeta pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models. For the development of a safe vaccine, we investigated whether 4Abeta1-15 (four tandem repeats of GPGPG-linked Abeta1-15 sequences) had therapeutic effects in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice model of AD. We described the production of anti-Abeta antibodies in APP/PS1 mice immunized with 4Abeta1-15 mixed with MF59 adjuvant. The anti-Abeta antibody concentrations were increased which bound to AD plaques, markedly reduced Abeta pathology in transgenic AD mice and levels of intracerebral Abeta (soluble and insoluble), whereas increased serum Abeta levels. Immunization via 4Abeta1-15 (mainly of the IgG1 Class) may induce a non-inflammatory Th2 reaction. Immunohistochemistry analysis of MHC Class II and CD45 revealed that microglial cells were in a less activated state. Of note, 4Abeta1-15-immunized mice showed improved acquisition of memory compared with controls in a reference-memory Morris water-maze behavior test. The data identify the novel immunogen 4Abeta1-15 as a promising new tool for AD immunotherapy.
