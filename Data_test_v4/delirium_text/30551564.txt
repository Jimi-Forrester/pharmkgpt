30551564|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, which is accompanied by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Although a number of trials to treat AD are in progress, there are no drugs available that inhibit the progression of AD. As the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is considered to be the major pathology of AD, inhibition of Abeta aggregation could be an effective strategy for AD treatment. Jowiseungchungtang (JWS) is a traditional oriental herbal formulation that has been shown to improve cognitive function in patients or animal models with dementia. However, there are no reports examining the effects of JWS on Abeta aggregation. Thus, we investigated whether JWS could protect against both Abeta aggregates and Abeta-mediated pathology such as neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and impaired adult neurogenesis in 5 five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (5XFAD) mice, an animal model for AD. In an in vitro thioflavin T assay, JWS showed a remarkable anti-Abeta aggregation effect. Histochemical analysis indicated that JWS had inhibitory effects on Abeta aggregation, Abeta-induced pathologies, and improved adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest the therapeutic possibility of JWS for AD targeting Abeta aggregation, Abeta-mediated neurodegeneration, and impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
