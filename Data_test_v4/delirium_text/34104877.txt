34104877|t|CryoEM reveals BIN1 (isoform 8) does not bind to single actin filaments in vitro.
34104877|a|Cells change their appearance by a concerted action of the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. The machinery that bends the membrane includes Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins. Recently BAR domain proteins garnered attention as actin regulators, either by recruiting actin regulating proteins or through binding to actin directly. BIN1 (an important protein in Alzheimer's Disease, heart disease and cancer) is one of the few BAR proteins that bind to actin directly. Here, we imaged a complex of BIN1 and actin with cryoEM. Our results reveal that BIN1 cannot be found on single actin filaments.
