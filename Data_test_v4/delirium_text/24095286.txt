24095286|a|CONTEXT: Palliative care consult services have emerged as an excellent resource for physicians seeking help with patients' symptoms. Symptoms include those of a psychiatric nature (e.g., depression, anxiety, delirium); however, little information is known about whether palliative care services include psychiatric input as part of multidisciplinary teams. OBJECTIVES: To explore 1) the current level of collaboration between psychiatrists and palliative care consult services across the U.S. and 2) the factors that support or restrict such involvement. METHODS: A national survey was developed and distributed electronically to program directors identified in the National Palliative Care Registry maintained by the Center to Advance Palliative Care. Analyses examined trends in psychiatry involvement with hospital-based palliative care teams. RESULTS: The survey had a 59% response rate, with final analyses including surveys completed by 260 palliative care program directors (67% inclusion rate from total respondents). Seventy-two percent of respondents reported some form of involvement with a psychiatrist on their palliative care service, with only 10% of those identifying a psychiatrist as a full- or part-time member of the team. Most respondents reported that they would like psychiatrists to be more involved with the palliative care services (71%). Secondary analyses of qualitative responses identified common impediments to increased psychiatry involvement, which included financial constraints, provider interest, and perceived disciplinary disconnect. CONCLUSION: There are shared objectives between psychiatry and palliative care; however, currently, co-involvement on treatment teams is quite limited. Future research is needed to identify ways to facilitate the interface of palliative care and psychiatry.
