19246911|a|BACKGROUND: To provide preliminary validation data on a self- or informant-report multidimensional questionnaire of symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disorders. METHODS: Participants from 2 trials (n = 125), the Arizona APOE Cohort and the Arizona Alzheimer's Disease Center, completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Neurodegenerative Symptoms questionnaire (MANS) and other related measures. RESULTS: Measures of central tendency are provided for the sample as a whole and by cognitive status. Internal consistency of the MANS is excellent (alpha = 0.98). Factor analysis suggests 4 factors. Correlational analyses support the construct validity of the MANS with moderate to high (r = 0.54-0.87) correlations between the MANS and measures of mood, cognition and daily functioning. CONCLUSION: Results provide initial support for the MANS as a brief measure that is a reliable and valid indicator of cognitive, personality, functional and motor symptoms potentially related to neurodegenerative etiologies. Further research with the MANS is warranted.
