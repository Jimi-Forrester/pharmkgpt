37780924|a|Key Clinical Message: Disorder of consciousness can lead to irreversible sequelae without proper intervention. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance in patients with disorder of consciousness. Abstract: Disorder of consciousness (DOC) has various etiologies. Here, we report a case in which DOC following general anesthesia was suspected as being due to the first episode of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). An elderly man in his 80s underwent uneventful tumor resection surgery under general anesthesia for extramammary Paget's disease. After the procedure, he regained consciousness following anesthesia discontinuation and was extubated. Soon after extubation, however, although his respiratory status remained stable, his level of consciousness deteriorated to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of E1V1M1. Head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans indicated no abnormal findings. Subsequently, involuntary movements were noted in his left upper limb. Suspecting an epilepsy episode, diazepam was administered, leading to an improvement in the level of consciousness (GCS: E4V5M6). Based on the improvement in consciousness after diazepam administration, we strongly suspected NCSE.
