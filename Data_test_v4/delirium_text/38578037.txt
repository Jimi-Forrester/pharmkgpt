38578037|a|BACKGROUND: High neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with poor prognosis in ischemic stroke. However, the role of NLR in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is controversial. Herein, we evaluated the value of NLR in identifying CSVD and its relationship with the common imaging markers of CSVD. METHODS: A total of 667 patients were enrolled in this study, including 368 in the CSVD group and 299 in the non-CSVD group. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging data were collected. The relationship of NLR with CSVD and common imaging markers of CSVD were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive value of NLR was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: NLR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.929, 95% confidence interval [CI] =  1.599-2.327, p < .001) was an independent risk factor for CSVD. NLR was also independently associated with moderate to severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (OR = 2.136, 95% CI = 1.768-2.580, p < .001), moderate to severe periventricular WMH (OR = 2.138, 95% CI = 1.771-2.579, p < .001), and moderate to severe deep WMH (OR = 1.654, 95% CI = 1.438-1.902, p < .001), moderately to severely enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) (OR = 1.248, 95% CI = 1.110-1.402, p < .001), moderately to severely EPVS in the basal ganglia (OR = 1.136, 95% CI = 1.012-1.275, p = .030), and moderately to severely EPVS in the centrum semiovale (OR = 1.140, 95% CI = 1.027-1.266, p = .014). However, NLR was not statistically significantly associated with lacune. The optimal cutoff point of NLR in predicting CSVD was 2.47, with sensitivity and specificity of 84.2% and 66.9%, respectively (p < .01). The diagnostic effect was maximized when NLR was combined with other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: NLR is an independent risk factor for CSVD and is independently associated with common imaging markers of CSVD. NLR may serve as a valid and convenient biomarker for assessing CSVD.
