32053979|a|Amyloid beta42 (Abeta42), a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived extracellularly from Abeta precursor protein (APP) following the latter's cleavage by beta-secretase, but not alpha-secretase. Protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) activation is known to increase alpha-secretase activity, thereby suppressing Abeta production. Since Abeta42 oligomer formation causes potent neurotoxicity, APP modulation by PKC ligands is a promising strategy for AD treatment. Although bryostatin-1 (bryo-1) is a leading compound for this strategy, its limited natural availability and the difficulty of its total synthesis impedes further research. To address this limitation, Irie and colleagues have developed a new PKC activator with few side effects, 10-Me-Aplog-1, (1), which decreased Abeta42 in the conditioned medium of rat primary cerebral cortex cells. These results are associated with increased alpha-secretase but not PKCepsilon-dependent Abeta-degrading enzyme. The amount of neuronal embryonic lethal abnormal vision (nELAV), a known beta-secretase stabilizer, was reduced by treatment with 1. Notably, 1 prevented the formation of intracellular toxic oligomers. Furthermore, 1 suppressed toxic oligomerization within human iPS-derived neurons such as bryo-1. Given that 1 was not neurotoxic toward either cell line, these findings suggest that 1 is a potential drug lead for AD therapy.
