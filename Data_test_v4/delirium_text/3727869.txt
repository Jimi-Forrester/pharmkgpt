3727869|t|[Sleep polygraphic studies in the preliminary stages of delirium tremens].
3727869|a|On the basis of sleep-polygraphic examinations of twelve alcoholics over a period of six days is given on the sleep behaviour during alcohol withdrawal. The study showed the withdrawal symptoms described in the literature, such as withdrawal insomnia, REM rebound and persisting shortening of the deep sleep time, in ten patients whereas in two cases the examinations had to be interrupted in the third night because of a withdrawal delirium. In these cases, however, an almost 100 per cent REM occurrence was seen from the first night. The significance of these findings with respect to an early prediction of the outbreak of the delirium and for the pathogenesis of the delirium in general is discussed.
