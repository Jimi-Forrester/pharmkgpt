33251779|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (PNP) and its related serum metabolites in de novo patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). PNP is a type of frequent comorbidity in PD. Although the administration of levodopa has been described as a presumptive risk factor in its development, few studies have explored its effect on unmedicated PD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 105 drug-naive de novo PD patients. A standardized nerve conduction study (NCS) technique was used to evaluate motor or sensory neuropathy. We analyzed serologic tests including metabolic markers of vitamin B12, homocysteine (Hcy), and uric acid (UA). RESULTS: We found abnormal nerve conduction velocity findings in 24 out of 105 total patients. Among them, 20 patients showed a type of combined motor-sensory, while three were a type of pure sensory and one was a pure motor. Nine patients had carpal tunnel syndrome. PD with PNP group demonstrated higher serum levels of Hcy and UA compared to PD without PNP group. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated a potential role of Hcy and UA on PNP in de novo patients with PD. These results suggest the contribution of the inherent metabolic pathway in deterioration of the peripheral nervous system in PD.
