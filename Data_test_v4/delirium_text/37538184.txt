37538184|a|Silkworm pupa (bombyx mori) protein (SPP) is a potential therapeutic bioactive substance that has anti-tumor activity against breast, liver, and gastric cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor effect of SPP on colon cancer nude mice. Using a subcutaneous tumor formation method, we validated the therapeutic effect of SPP on colon cancer nude mice in vivo. Results showed that SPP was cytotoxic to tumor cells. SPP could protect the liver of the nude mice by lowering hepatic oxidative stress and regulating serum inflammation levels by decreasing TNF-alpha and IL-2 levels while in-creasing INF-gamma levels. In addition, diminished Ki-67 protein, enhanced cleaved caspase-3 protein, di-minished Vimentin, enhanced E-cadherin. These findings suggested that SPP's antitumor activity may be achieved by reducing inflammation, inhibiting tumor proliferation and metastasis, and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. In the future, SPP could be used as an anticancer drug, potentially providing a new source of drugs for the treatment of colon cancer.
