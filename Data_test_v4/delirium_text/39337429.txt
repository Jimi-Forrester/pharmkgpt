39337429|t|Insights into the Role of microRNAs as Clinical Tools for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and as Therapeutic Targets in Alzheimer's Disease.
39337429|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a diverse group of neurological disorders characterized by alterations in the structure and function of the central nervous system. Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by impaired memory and cognitive abilities, is the most prevalent type of senile dementia. Loss of synapses, intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and extracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plaques are the hallmarks of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules that bind to the 3' and 5' untranslated regions of target genes to cause post-transcriptional gene silencing. The brain expresses over 70% of all experimentally detected miRNAs, and these miRNAs are crucial for synaptic function and particular signals during memory formation. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs play a role in AD pathogenesis and we provide an overview of the role of miRNAs in synapse formation, Abeta synthesis, tau protein accumulation, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-associated AD pathogenesis. We further summarize and discuss the role of miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD detection and differentiation between early- and late-stage AD, based on recent research. In conclusion, altered expression of miRNAs in the brain and peripheral circulation demonstrates their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in AD.
