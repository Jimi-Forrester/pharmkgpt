36133644|a|Inorganic nanomaterials (NMs) have shown potential application in tumor-targeting theranostics, owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Some living cells in nature can absorb surrounding ions in the environment and then convert them into nanomaterials after a series of intracellular/extracellular biochemical reactions. Inspired by that, a variety of living cells have been used as biofactories to produce metallic/metallic alloy NMs, metalloid NMs, oxide NMs and chalcogenide NMs, which are usually automatically capped with biomolecules originating from the living cells, benefitting their tumor-targeting applications. In this review, we summarize the biosynthesis of inorganic nanomaterials in different types of living cells including bacteria, fungi, plant cells and animal cells, accompanied by their application in tumor-targeting theranostics. The mechanisms involving inorganic-ion bioreduction and detoxification as well as biomineralization are emphasized. Based on the mechanisms, we describe the size and morphology control of the products via the modulation of precursor ion concentration, pH, temperature, and incubation time, as well as cell metabolism by a genetic engineering strategy. The strengths and weaknesses of these biosynthetic processes are compared in terms of the controllability, scalability and cooperativity during applications. Future research in this area will add to the diversity of available inorganic nanomaterials as well as their quality and biosafety.
