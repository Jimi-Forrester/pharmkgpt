38732259|t|Exploring the Role of Apigenin in Neuroinflammation: Insights and Implications.
38732259|a|Neuroinflammation, a hallmark of various central nervous system disorders, is often associated with oxidative stress and neuronal or oligodendrocyte cell death. It is therefore very interesting to target neuroinflammation pharmacologically. One therapeutic option is the use of nutraceuticals, particularly apigenin. Apigenin is present in plants: vegetables (parsley, celery, onions), fruits (oranges), herbs (chamomile, thyme, oregano, basil), and some beverages (tea, beer, and wine). This review explores the potential of apigenin as an anti-inflammatory agent across diverse neurological conditions (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), cancer, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive and memory disorders, and toxicity related to trace metals and other chemicals. Drawing upon major studies, we summarize apigenin's multifaceted effects and underlying mechanisms in neuroinflammation. Our review underscores apigenin's therapeutic promise and calls for further investigation into its clinical applications.
