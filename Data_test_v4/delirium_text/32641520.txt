METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 40 patients with CAA, 22 with AD, 27 with MCI, and 25 healthy controls. Each participant underwent a visual fMRI task using a contrast-reversing checkerboard stimulus. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were used to compare visual cortex neuronal activity in 83 participants. General linear models using least-squares means, adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Tukey test, were used to estimate mean blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal change during the task and VEP differences between groups. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and hypertension, estimated mean BOLD response amplitude was as follows: CAA 1.88% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60%-2.15%), AD 2.26% (1.91%-2.61%), MCI 2.15% (1.84%-2.46%), and control 2.65% (2.29%-3.00%). Only patients with CAA differed from controls (p = 0.01). In the subset with VEPs, group was not associated with prolonged latencies or lower amplitudes. Lower BOLD amplitude response was associated with higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes in CAA (for each 0.1% lower BOLD response amplitude, the WMH volume was 9.2% higher, 95% CI 6.0%-12.4%) but not other groups (p = 0.002 for interaction) when controlling for age and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Mean visual BOLD response amplitude was lowest in participants with CAA compared to controls, without differences in VEP latencies and amplitudes. This suggests that the impaired visual BOLD response is due to reduced vascular reactivity in CAA. In contrast to participants with CAA, the visual BOLD response amplitude did not differ between those with AD or MCI and controls.
