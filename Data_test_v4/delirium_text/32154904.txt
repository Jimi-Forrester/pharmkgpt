32154904|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. As many as 250,000 people in Sweden will have a dementia disease in 2050. The >>amyloid cascade hypothesis<< is a common model which explains how beta-amyloid affects the function of the nerve cells. Alzheimer's disease has a long-lasting course and can present in typical and atypical forms. CSF analyses for >>core AD CSF biomarkers<< and synaptic proteins have been available for clinical diagnostics. PET scanning can detect either beta-amyloid or tau aggregates in the brain of living humans. Current Alzheimer's disease therapy is based on two classes of cognition-enhancing drugs: acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and NMDA-receptor antagonist, which delays cognitive decline in most patients. The latest clinical development of potential therapy for Alzheimer's is active or passive immunotherapy against brain beta-amyloid and tau, where several studies have shown varying but promising treatment effects. Non-pharmacological interventions in patients with AD aim to delay the loss of mental abilities, helping people to be independent in everyday life for as long as possible, and to increase their well-being and quality of life.
