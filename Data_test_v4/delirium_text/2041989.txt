2041989|a|Memory disorders in elderly can be related to various conditions. The concept of "Age-Associated Memory Impairement" is grounded on a age-related memory deficit in memory testing associated with a memory complaint which is considered as the subjective manifestation of the memory deficit. Actually, memory deficit in objective testing and memory complaints do not appear correlated. Impairment in memory performance is mostly related to neurobiologic brain changes associated with aging or Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, memory complaints are more related to psychosocial factors. However, clinical data and qualitative analysis of the memory disturbances are requested to understand the precise significance of memory deficits in objective testing.
