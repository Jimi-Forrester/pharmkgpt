27499625|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the major risk factors for the development of delirium in patients at a single general hospital by comparison with a control group. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 260 delirium patients and 77 control patients. We investigated age, sex, and risk factors for delirium in the total delirium group (n=260), the delirium medical subgroup (n=142), and the delirium surgical subgroup (n=118). Logistic regression analysis adjusting for age and sex was performed to identify the odds ratio. RESULTS: The mean age and the percentage of males were significantly higher in the delirium group compared with the control group (68.9 vs 54.3 years and 70% vs 41.6%, respectively). Risk factors for the delirium group were lower plasma albumin, hypertension, mechanical ventilation, and antipsychotic drug use. Plasma sodium level and hypertension were important risk factors for the delirium medical subgroup. Stroke history, hypertension, ICU care, and medication were important risk factors for the delirium surgical subgroup. CONCLUSION: Lower plasma albumin, hypertension, mechanical ventilation, and antipsychotic drug use are important risk factors for delirium.
