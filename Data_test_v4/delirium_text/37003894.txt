37003894|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is dangerous and a predictor of poor patient outcomes. We have previously reported the utility of the bispectral EEG (BSEEG) with a novel algorithm for the detection of delirium and prediction of patient outcomes including mortality. The present study employed a normalized BSEEG (nBSEEG) score to integrate the previous cohorts to combine their data to investigate the prediction of patient outcomes. We also aimed to test if the BSEEG method can be applicable regardless of age, and independent of delirium motor subtypes. METHODS: We calculated nBSEEG score from raw BSEEG data in each cohort and classified patients into BSEEG-positive and BSEEG-negative groups. We used log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models to predict 90-day and 1-year outcomes for the BSEEG-positive and -negative groups in all subjects and motor subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 1,077 subjects, the BSEEG-positive group showed significantly higher 90-day (hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.16-1.52] and 1-year (hazard ratio 1.22 [95% CI 1.06-1.40] mortality rates than the negative group after adjustment for covariates such as age, sex, CCI, and delirium status. Among patients with different motor subtypes of delirium, the hypoactive group showed significantly higher 90-day (hazard ratio 1.41 [95% CI 1.12-1.76] and 1-year mortality rates (hazard ratio 1.32 [95% CI 1.05-1.67], which remained significant after adjustment for the same covariates. CONCLUSION: We found that the BSEEG method is capable of capturing patients at high mortality risk.
