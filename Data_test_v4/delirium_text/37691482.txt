37691482|t|Nutritional status and the risk of sarcopenia in the elderly.
37691482|a|Aim: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and its associated factors in community-dwelling older adults at risk of malnutrition based on the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), and Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). Materials and methods: The study participants were 345 adults aged >65 years who visited Geriatric Internal Medicine outpatient clinics. The study included people without acute illness for whom the risk of malnutrition could be assessed and appropriate measurements taken. At the baseline visit, participants' data and measurements were gathered. The primary data included sociodemographic details, anthropometric measurements, malnutrition screening tests, and functional assessments. Results: The participants' mean age was 76.21 +- 5.59 years, and 57.1% were men (n = 197). The prevalence rate of sarcopenia was 45.5%. Compared to individuals without sarcopenia, those with it were older; had lower MNA, PNI, and GNRI scores; and had lower muscle mass, muscle strength, and lower leg circumferences (p <0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found that sarcopenia, advanced age, male sex, high risk of malnutrition, calf circumference, and a low PNI score were all significantly associated with a low GNRI score (p <0.001). Conclusion: Sarcopenia was significantly associated with advanced age, male sex, and high risk of malnutrition. Patients' nutritional and functional status should always be assessed for therapeutic interventions and lifestyle changes.
