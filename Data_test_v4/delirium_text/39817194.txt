39817194|a|INTRODUCTION: Age-associated depletion in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) concentrations has been implicated in metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. Supplementation with NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), offers a potential therapeutic avenue against neurodegenerative pathologies in aging, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias. A crossover, double-blind, randomized placebo (PBO) controlled trial was conducted to test the safety and efficacy of 8 weeks' active treatment with NR (1 g/day) on cognition and plasma AD biomarkers in older adults with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: The primary efficacy outcome was the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Secondary outcomes included plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Exploratory outcomes included Lumosity gameplay (z-scores) for cognition and step counts from wearables. Mixed model for repeated measures was used for between-group comparisons; paired t-tests were used for within-individual comparisons. RESULTS: Forty-six participants aged over 55 were randomized to NR-PBO or PBO-NR groups; 41 completed baseline visits, and 37 completed the trial. NR supplementation was safe and well tolerated with no differences in adverse events reported between NR and PBO treatment phases. For the between-group comparison, there was a 7% reduction in pTau217 concentrations after taking NR, while an 18% increase with PBO (p = 0.02). No significant between-group differences were observed for RBANS, other plasma biomarkers(GFAP and NfL), Lumosity gameplay scores or step counts. For the within-individual comparison, pTau217 concentrations significantly decreased during the NR phase compared to the PBO (p = 0.02), while step counts significantly increased during the NR phase than PBO (p = 0.04). DISCUSSION: Eight weeks NR supplementation is safe and lowered pTau217 concentrations but did not alter cognition as measured by conventional or novel digital assessments. Further research is warranted to validate NR's efficacy in altering pathological brain aging processes. Highlights: The integrated study design combines a two-arm parallel trial with a crossover phase, offering the opportunity to enhance sample size for within-individual analysis and assess carryover effects.NR is safe but did not alter cognition as measured by multi-modal assessments in SCD/MCI.For between-group comparison, pTau217 levels decreased with NR and increased with PBO at 8-week follow-up.For within-individual comparison, step counts increased after NR and decreased after PBO.A larger, longer study with pharmacodynamic and pathophysiological biomarkers is needed to assess NR's disease-modifying effects.
