35637657|t|Clinical Factors Associated with Serum Magnesium Concentration in Patients Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis: A Single-Center Observational Study.
35637657|a|Purpose: Magnesium (Mg) is an essential element that is associated with various physiological functions, such as maintenance of blood pressure, muscle contraction, and nerve function. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, hypomagnesemia is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. However, in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), clinical factors associated with Mg have not been fully investigated. Patients and Methods: Clinical factors including anthropometric data, comorbidities, laboratory data, medications, and dialysis methods were collected from the medical records of patients undergoing PD. The associations of these factors with the serum Mg concentration were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Sixty patients undergoing PD were investigated. The univariate analysis showed that the serum Mg concentration was significantly associated with treatment by hybrid PD (daily PD + once-weekly hemodialysis) (beta = 0.264, P = 0.04), administration of phosphate binders (beta = 0.294, P = 0.02), the serum C-reactive protein concentration (beta = -0.318, P = 0.01), the serum potassium (K) concentration (beta = 0.451, P < 0.01), and the serum intact parathormone concentration (beta = -0.333, P = 0.01). The multivariate analysis using these factors showed an independent association between the serum Mg and K concentrations (beta = 0.333, P = 0.01). Conclusion: The serum Mg concentration was independently associated with the serum K concentration in patients undergoing PD.
