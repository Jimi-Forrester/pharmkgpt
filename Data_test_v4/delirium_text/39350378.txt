Investigation on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the prodromal and transitional stage between normal aging and AD, serves as a key in diagnosing and slowing down the progression of AD. Numerous effects have been made up to date, however, the attentional mechanisms under different external emotion stimuli in MCI and AD are still unexplored in deep. OBJECTIVE: To further explore the attentional mechanisms under different external emotion stimuli in both MCI and AD patients. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/MEASUREMENTS: In 51 healthy volunteers (Controls, 24 males and 27 females), 52 MCI (19 males and 33 females), and 47 AD (15 males and 32 females) patients, we administered the visual oddball event-related potentials (ERPs) under three types of external emotional stimuli: Neutral, Happiness and Sadness, in which the components N1, P2, N2 and P3 as well as the abnormal cortical activations corresponding to the significant ERP differences in the three groups were observed. RESULTS: Under all three external emotions, in AD patients, N2 and P3 latencies were significantly prolonged compared to both Controls and MCI. In addition, under Happiness, in MCI, P3 latencies were significantly delayed compared to Controls. Meanwhile, under both Happiness and Sadness, in AD patients, P3 amplitudes were significantly decreased compared to Controls and MCI, respectively. During N2 time window, under Neutral emotion, significant hypoactivation in the right superior temporal gyrus was found in AD patients compared to Controls, and under Happiness, the activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus was significantly attenuated in MCI compared to Controls. Under Sadness, in AD patients, the activation of the right superior frontal gyrus was significantly decreased compared to MCI. During P3 time window, under both Happiness and Sadness, when AD patients compared to MCI, the significantly attenuated activations were located in the right fusiform gyrus and the right middle occipital gyrus, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated visual attentional deficits under external emotional stimuli in both MCI and AD patients, highlighting the function of Happiness for early detecting MCI, in which the P3 latency and the hypoactivation of right inferior frontal gyrus during N2 time window can be early signs. The current study sheds further light of attentional mechanisms in MCI and AD patients, and indicates the value of emotional processing in the early detection of cognitive dysfunction.
