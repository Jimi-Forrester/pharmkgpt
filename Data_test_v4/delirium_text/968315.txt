968315|t|[Catecholaminergic axons in the human cerebral cortex. Observation by histofluorescence of cerebral biopsies in 2 cases of Alzheimer's disease].
968315|a|Catecholamine axons have been visualized in human cerebral cortex obtained during routine neurosurgical operations. The fluorescence histochemical method of Lindvall et al. was used, slightly modified (calcium-deprived buffer, glyoxylic acid fixation followed by formaldehyde vapours exposition). The frontal cortex was more richely provided with catecholamine terminals than the parietal cortex. Two general types of axon morphology are evident. The most frequent is thin and sinous, sometimes forming clews, or loose basket-like arrangement around presumed nerve cells. The other one is moniliform and demonstrates spherical evenly-spaced varicosities. They look like, respectively, the well characterized dopaminergic and noradrenergic axons of the rat cerebral cortex. In two cases of Alzheimer's disease, noradrenergic-like fibers were missing and voluminous green-fluorescent varicosities, sometimes in obvious connection with typical axons, were observed in the proximity of senile plaques.
