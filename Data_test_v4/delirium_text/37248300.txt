37248300|a|An unresolved question for the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology is why a significant percentage of amyloid-beta (Abeta)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals do not develop detectable downstream tau pathology and, consequently, clinical deterioration. In vitro evidence suggests that reactive astrocytes unleash Abeta effects in pathological tau phosphorylation. Here, in a biomarker study across three cohorts (n = 1,016), we tested whether astrocyte reactivity modulates the association of Abeta with tau phosphorylation in CU individuals. We found that Abeta was associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau only in individuals positive for astrocyte reactivity (Ast+). Cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography analyses revealed an AD-like pattern of tau tangle accumulation as a function of Abeta only in CU Ast+ individuals. Our findings suggest astrocyte reactivity as an important upstream event linking Abeta with initial tau pathology, which may have implications for the biological definition of preclinical AD and for selecting CU individuals for clinical trials.
