35868668|t|Clinical Features of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Older Adults.
35868668|a|Covid-19 clinical presentation is extremely heterogenous, especially in older patients due to the possible presence of atypical symptoms, such as delirium, hyporexia and falls. The clinical characteristics at onset are influenced by the presence of common health-related conditions in older people, such as comorbidity, disability and frailty, and not simply by chronological age. Few studies investigated the tendency of Covid-19 symptoms to aggregate in cluster and the use of cluster approach might better describe the clinical complexity of the acute disease. Concerning the prognostic significance of Covid-19 clinical presentation in older people, the available literature still provides discordant results.
