36072893|t|Brain Donation Decisions as Disease Specific Behaviors: An Elucidation of the Donation Process in the Context of Essential Tremor.
36072893|a|Brain donation is a challenging process, comprising four sequential stages: (1) the brain donation decision, (2) pre-mortem arrangements and follow up, (3) specimen collection and (4) tissue processing. It is important to understand the factors that are pertinent to each stage. Currently, there is extensive information on factors that involve donor's personal and cultural backgrounds and how these could affect the process. However, little is known about disease-specific factors that influence the process. The Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository was established in 2003, and after nearly 20 years of collecting essential tremor (ET) brain tissue, we are well-positioned to discuss the brain donation process from a disease-specific standpoint. In the current manuscript, we discuss ET disease-specific factors that influence the first two stages of the brain donation process. We center our discussion around three points: (1) factors that influence the patient's decision to donate, (2) the involvement of next of kin in the donation, and (3) the rationale for enrolling patients prospectively and evaluating them longitudinally before the anatomical gift takes place. This discussion shares our understanding of the background from which our repository operates and may be of value for other brain banks that study similar neurodegenerative diseases.
