Our team has recently developed a novel humanized ACE2 mouse model (hACE2ki) designed explicitly for long-COVID/PASC research. This model exhibits human ACE2 expression in tissue and cell-specific patterns akin to mouse Ace2. When we exposed young adult hACE2ki mice (6 weeks old) to various SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including WA, Delta, and Omicron, at a dose of 5 x 105 PFU/mouse via nasal instillation, the mice demonstrated distinctive phenotypes characterized by differences in viral load in the lung, trachea, and nasal turbinate, weight loss, and changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Notably, no mortality was observed in this age group. Further, to assess the model's relevance for long-COVID studies, we investigated tau protein pathologies, which are linked to Alzheimer's disease, in the brains of these mice post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings revealed the accumulation and longitudinal propagation of tau, confirming the potential of our hACE2ki mouse model for preclinical studies of long-COVID.
