29720594|a|We present a quantitative study of different molecular iron forms found in the temporal cortex of Alzheimer (AD) patients. Applying the methodology we developed in our previous work, we quantify the concentrations of non-heme Fe(III) by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), magnetite/maghemite and ferrihydrite by SQUID magnetometry, together with the MRI transverse relaxation rate [Formula: see text], to obtain a systematic view of molecular iron in the temporal cortex. Significantly higher values of [Formula: see text], a larger concentration of ferrihydrite, and a larger magnetic moment of magnetite/maghemite particles are found in the brain of AD patients. Moreover, we found correlations between the concentration of the iron detected by EPR, the concentration of the ferrihydrite mineral and the average iron loading of ferritin. We discuss these findings in the framework of iron dis-homeostasis, which has been proposed to occur in the brain of AD patients.
