38446754|t|Correlation of preoperative frailty with postoperative delirium and one-year mortality in Chinese geriatric patients undergoing noncardiac surgery: Study protocol for a prospective observational cohort study.
38446754|a|BACKGROUND: To Frailty is associated with postoperative delirium (POD) but is rarely assessed in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. In this study, the correlation between preoperative frailty and POD, one-year mortality will be investigated in noncardiac Chinese geriatric surgery patients. METHODS: This study is a prospective, observational, cohort study conducted at a single center with Chinese geriatric patients. Patients who undergo noncardiac surgery and are older than 70 years will be included. A total of 536 noncardiac surgery patients will be recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University for this study. The Barthel Index (BI) rating will be used to assess the patient's ability to carry out everyday activities on the 1st preoperative day. The modified frailty index (mFI) will be used to assess frailty. Patients in the nonfrailty group will have an mFI < 0.21, and patients in the frailty group will have an mFI >= 0.21. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD. Three-Minute Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium (3D-CAM) will be conducted twice daily during the 1st-7th postoperative days, or just before discharge. The secondary outcomes will include one-year mortality, in-hospital cardiopulmonary events, infections, acute renal injury, and cerebrovascular events. DISCUSSION: This study will clarify the correlation of preoperative frailty with POD and one-year all-cause mortality in Chinese geriatric patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Can preoperative frailty predict POD or one-year mortality? In the face of China's serious aging social problems, this result may have important clinical value for the surgical treatment of geriatric patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials. Gov on 12 January 2022 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05189678).
