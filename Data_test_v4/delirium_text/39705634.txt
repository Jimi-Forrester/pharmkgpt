39705634|t|Anti-IgLON5 Disease 10 Years Later: What We Know and What We Do Not Know.
39705634|a|Anti-IgLON5 disease was identified 10 years ago, thanks to the discovery of IgLON5 antibodies and the joint effort of specialists in sleep medicine, neuroimmunology, and neuropathology. Without this collaboration, it would have been impossible to untangle fundamental aspects of this disease. After the seminal description in 2014, today there is growing evidence that most patients present a chronic progressive course with gait instability, abnormal movements, bulbar dysfunction, and a sleep disorder characterized by nonrapid eye movement and REM parasomnias, and obstructive sleep apnea with stridor. Unlike other autoimmune encephalitides, the response to immunotherapy is suboptimal. Neuropathologic studies in patients with a prolonged clinical course showed a novel 3-repeat and 4-repeat neuronal tauopathy mainly involving the hypothalamus and tegmentum of the brainstem. The absence of tau deposits in the brain of patients who died early, the demonstration that IgLON5 antibodies cause an irreversible decrease in cell-surface levels of IgLON5, and a disorganization of the neuronal cytoskeleton suggest that the disease is primarily autoimmune and the tauopathy a secondary event. After a decade, we now know the disease much better, but important issues still need to be addressed. We have to gather more information on the natural course of the disease, develop better treatments, and identify robust predictors of outcome. More basic research is needed on the physiology of IgLON5, how antibodies disrupt its function, and the downstream effects leading to neurodegeneration. Finally, better designed passive transfer and active immunization models are needed to confirm the pathogenic effect of IgLON5 antibodies.
