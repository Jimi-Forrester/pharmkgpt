31749677|t|The Role of Brain Glycogen in Supporting Physiological Function.
31749677|a|Glycogen is present in the mammalian brain but occurs at concentrations so low it is unlikely to act as a conventional energy reserve. Glycogen has the intriguing feature of being located exclusively in astrocytes, but its presence benefits neurones, suggesting that glycogen is metabolized to a conduit that is transported between the glia and neural elements. In the rodent optic nerve model glycogen supports axon conduction in the form of lactate to supplement axonal metabolism during aglycemia, hypoglycemia and during periods of increased energy demand under normoglycemic conditions. In the hippocampus glycogen plays a vital role in supplying the neurones with lactate during memory formation. The physiological processes that glycogen supports, such as learning and memory, imply an inclusive and vital role in supporting physiological brain functions.
