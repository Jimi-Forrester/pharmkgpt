24729983|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify brain atrophy from structural-MRI and cerebral blood flow(CBF) patterns from arterial spin labeling perfusion-MRI that are best predictors of the Abeta-burden, measured as composite 18F-AV45-PET uptake, in individuals with early mild cognitive impairment(MCI). Furthermore, to assess the relative importance of imaging modalities in classification of Abeta+/Abeta- early mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: Sixty-seven ADNI-GO/2 participants with early-MCI were included. Voxel-wise anatomical shape variation measures were computed by estimating the initial diffeomorphic mapping momenta from an unbiased control template. CBF measures normalized to average motor cortex CBF were mapped onto the template space. Using partial least squares regression, we identified the structural and CBF signatures of Abeta after accounting for normal cofounding effects of age, sex, and education. RESULTS: 18F-AV45-positive early-MCIs could be identified with 83% classification accuracy, 87% positive predictive value, and 84% negative predictive value by multidisciplinary classifiers combining demographics data, ApoE epsilon4-genotype, and a multimodal MRI-based Abeta score. INTERPRETATION: Multimodal-MRI can be used to predict the amyloid status of early-MCI individuals. MRI is a very attractive candidate for the identification of inexpensive and non-invasive surrogate biomarkers of Abeta deposition. Our approach is expected to have value for the identification of individuals likely to be Abeta+ in circumstances where cost or logistical problems prevent Abeta detection using cerebrospinal fluid analysis or Abeta-PET. This can also be used in clinical settings and clinical trials, aiding subject recruitment and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Imputation of the Abeta-positivity status could also complement Abeta-PET by identifying individuals who would benefit the most from this assessment.
