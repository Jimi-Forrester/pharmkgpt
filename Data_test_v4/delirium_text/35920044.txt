35920044|t|An Individualized Recovery Task Checklist Which Served as an Educational Instrument in a Critically Ill and Intubated COVID-19 Patient.
35920044|a|This case involves a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and massive pulmonary embolism requiring mechanical ventilation. His clinical course was complicated by delirium likely triggered by his critical illness and failed initial extubation, isolation from family, and escalating fear and desperation. In hopeful preparation for subsequent successful extubation, a unique approach was taken to decrease the risk of panic, delirium, and decompensation leading to reintubation. As a means of orienting him to his treatment pathway and to provide encouragement for continued recovery, an impromptu patient-directed checklist was constructed. The recovery checklist, written in simplified language, outlined the stages of severe illness that the patient had overcome after his emergent intubation. The list also outlined the tasks he needed to complete prior to hospital discharge. Unexpectedly, the checklist received a great deal of engagement from both the patient and medical team and played an important role in this patient's successful recovery and rehabilitation.
