26409005|a|Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is increasingly recognised as a source of perioperative morbidity and mortality. We describe a patient with severe OSA who developed transient contrast encephalopathy after elective coiling of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Contrast extravasation led to cerebral oedema, seizures and delirium, which eventually completely resolved. OSA is known to be associated with a proinflammatory state that leads to hypertension, impaired endothelial repair capacity and endothelial dysfunction. Further studies are needed to clarify whether OSA increases the risk of endovascular procedures.
