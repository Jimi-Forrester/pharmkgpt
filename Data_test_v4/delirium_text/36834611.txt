36834611|a|Increasing evidence suggests that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays an important role in physiological processes in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in cellular metabolism and repair. Cellular damage caused by acute brain injury and long-term neurodegenerative disorders is associated with alterations of these metabolic processes leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. PPARgamma agonists have demonstrated the potential to be effective treatments for CNS diseases in preclinical models, but to date, most drugs have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials of neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The most likely explanation for this lack of efficacy is the insufficient brain exposure of these PPARgamma agonists. Leriglitazone is a novel, blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant PPARgamma agonist that is being developed to treat CNS diseases. Here, we review the main roles of PPARgamma in physiology and pathophysiology in the CNS, describe the mechanism of action of PPARgamma agonists, and discuss the evidence supporting the use of leriglitazone to treat CNS diseases.
