32129139|t|To What Extent Does Clinically Assisted Nutrition and Hydration Have a Role in the Care of Dying People?
32129139|a|The question over whether to administer clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) to a dying patient is controversial, with much debate concerning this sensitive issue. The administration of CANH poses clinical and ethical dilemmas, with supporting and opposing views. Proposed positive effects of CANH include preventing thirst, delirium, hypercalcemia, and opioid toxicity. However, CANH has been shown to increase the risk of aspiration, pressure ulcers, infections, and hospital admissions as well as potentially causing discomfort to the patient. Guidance from several national bodies generally advises that the risks and burdens of CANH outweigh the benefits in the dying patient. However, an individualized approach is needed, and the patient's wishes regarding CANH need consideration if they have capacity and can communicate. Otherwise, sensitive discussions are required with the family, enquiring about the patient's prior wishes if there is no advanced care plan and acting in the patient's best interests. The ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice need to be applied being mindful of any cultural and religious beliefs and potential misperceptions.
