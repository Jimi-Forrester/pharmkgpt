37181013|a|Background: At present, minimally invasive surgery is often used in paediatric patients as a day surgery to promote rapid post-operative recovery. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) Patients recovery in the hospital or at home after surgery may differ in terms of recovery quality and circadian rhythm status because of sleep disruption; however, this remains unknown. Pediatric patients usually unable to explain their feelings effectively, and objective indicators to measure recovery situation in different environments are promising. This study was conducted to compare the impact of in-hospital and at-home postoperative recovery quality (primary outcome) and circadian rhythm (as measured via the salivary melatonin level) (secondary outcome) in preschool-age patients. Methods: This was a cohort, non-randomized and exploratory observational study. A total of 61 children aged 4 to 6 years who were scheduled to receive adenotonsillectomy were recruited and assigned to recover either in the hospital (Hospital group) or at home (Home group) after surgery. There were no differences in the patient characteristics and perioperative variables between the Hospital and Home groups at baseline. They received the treatment and anesthesia in the same way. The patients' preoperative and up to 28 days post-surgery OSA-18 questionnaires were harvested. Moreover, their pre- and post-surgery salivary melatonin concentrations, body temperature, three-night postoperative sleep diaries, pain scales, emergence agitation, and other adverse effects were recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in the postoperative recovery quality, as assessed by the OSA-18 questionnaire, body temperature, sleep quality, pain scales, and other adverse events (such as respiratory depression, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting) between the two groups. The preoperative morning saliva melatonin secretion was decreased in both groups on the first postoperative morning (P<0.05), while a significantly greater decrease was found in the Home group on postoperative day 1 (P<0.05) and day 2 (P<0.05). Conclusions: The postoperative recovery quality of preschool kids in the hospital is as good as at home based on OSA-18 evaluation scale. However, the clinical importance of the significant decrease in morning saliva melatonin levels with at-home postoperative recovery remains unknown and warrants further study.
