36711767|t|Predictive Models and Features of Patient Mortality across Dementia Types.
36711767|a|Dementia care is challenging due to the divergent trajectories in disease progression and outcomes. Predictive models are needed to identify patients at risk of near-term mortality. Here, we developed machine learning models predicting survival using a dataset of 45,275 unique participants and 163,782 visit records from the U.S. National Alzheimera$ s Coordinating Center (NACC). Our models achieved an AUC-ROC of over 0.82 utilizing nine parsimonious features for all one-, three-, five-, and ten-year thresholds. The trained models mainly consisted of dementia-related predictors such as specific neuropsychological tests and were minimally affected by other age-related causes of death, e.g., stroke and cardiovascular conditions. Notably, stratified analyses revealed shared and distinct predictors of mortality across eight dementia types. Unsupervised clustering of mortality predictors grouped vascular dementia with depression and Lewy body dementia with frontotemporal lobar dementia. This study demonstrates the feasibility of flagging dementia patients at risk of mortality for personalized clinical management.
