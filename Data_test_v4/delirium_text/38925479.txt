38925479|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a formidable challenge in modern medicine, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, cognitive decline, and memory impairment. Despite extensive research, effective therapeutic strategies remain elusive. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties of curcumin, found in turmeric, have demonstrated promise. The poor bioavailability and rapid systemic clearance of this drug limit its clinical application. This comprehensive review explores the potential of curcumin-loaded polymeric nanomaterials as an innovative therapeutic avenue for AD. It delves into the preparation and characteristics of diverse polymeric nanomaterial platforms, including liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles. Emphasis is placed on how these platforms enhance curcumin's bioavailability and enable targeted delivery to the brain, addressing critical challenges in AD treatment. Mechanistic insights reveal how these nanomaterials modulate key AD pathological processes, including amyloid-beta aggregation, tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. The review also highlighted the preclinical studies demonstrate reduced amyloid-beta plaques and neuroinflammation, alongside improved cognitive function, while clinical trials show promise in enhancing curcumin's bioavailability and efficacy in AD. Additionally, it addresses the challenges of clinical translation, such as regulatory issues, large-scale production, and long-term stability. By synthesizing recent advancements, this review underscores the potential of curcumin-loaded polymeric nanomaterials to offer a novel and effective therapeutic approach for AD, aiming to guide future research and development in this field.
