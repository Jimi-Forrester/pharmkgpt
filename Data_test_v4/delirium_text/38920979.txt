38920979|t|Succinimide Derivatives as Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors-In Silico and In Vitro Studies.
38920979|a|We studied the effect of succinimide derivatives on acetylcholinesterase activity due to the interest in compounds that influence this enzyme's activity, which could help treat memory issues more effectively. The following parameters were established for this purpose based on kinetic investigations of the enzyme in the presence of succinimide derivatives: the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, the maximum rate, the inhibition constant, and the Michaelis-Menten constant. Furthermore, computational analyses were performed to determine the energy required for succinimide derivatives to dock with the enzyme's active site. The outcomes acquired in this manner demonstrated that all compounds inhibited acetylcholinesterase in a competitive manner. The values of the docking energy parameters corroborated the kinetic parameter values, which indicated discernible, albeit slight, variations in the inhibitory intensity among the various derivatives.
