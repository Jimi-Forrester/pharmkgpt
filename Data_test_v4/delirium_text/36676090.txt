36676090|t|Newly Synthesized Creatine Derivatives as Potential Neuroprotective and Antioxidant Agents on In Vitro Models of Parkinson's Disease.
36676090|a|Oxidative stress is one of the key factors responsible for many diseases-neurodegenerative (Parkinson and Alzheimer) diseases, diabetes, atherosclerosis, etc. Creatine, a natural amino acid derivative, is capable of exerting mild, direct antioxidant activity in cultured mammalian cells acutely injured with an array of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating compounds. The aim of the study was in vitro (on isolated rat brain sub-cellular fractions-synaptosomes, mitochondria and microsomes) evaluation of newly synthetized creatine derivatives for possible antioxidant and neuroprotective activity. The synaptosomes and mitochondria were obtained by multiple centrifugations with Percoll, while microsomes-only by multiple centrifugations. Varying models of oxidative stress were used to study the possible antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of the respective compounds: on synaptosomes-6-hydroxydopamine; on mitochondria-tert-butyl hydroperoxide; and on microsomes-iron/ascorbate (non-enzyme-induced lipid peroxidation). Administered alone, creatine derivatives and creatine (at concentration 38 microM) revealed neurotoxic and pro-oxidant effects on isolated rat brain subcellular fractions (synaptosomes, mitochondria and microsomes). In models of 6-hydroxydopamine (on synaptosomes), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (on mitochondria) and iron/ascorbate (on microsomes)-induced oxidative stress, the derivatives showed neuroprotective and antioxidant effects. These effects may be due to the preservation of the reduced glutathione level, ROS scavenging and membranes' stabilizers against free radicals. Thus, they play a role in the antioxidative defense system and have a promising potential as therapeutic neuroprotective agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, connected with oxidative stress, such as Parkinson's disease.
