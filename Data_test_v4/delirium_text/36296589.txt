36296589|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the compounds produced by non-enzymatic glycation of proteins, which are involved in diabetic-related complications. To investigate the potential anti-glycation activity of Myriocin (Myr), a fungal metabolite of Cordyceps, the effect of Myr on the formation of AGEs resulted from the glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the interaction between Myr and BSA were studied by multiple spectroscopic techniques and computational simulations. We found that Myr inhibited the formation of AGEs at the end stage of glycation reaction and exhibited strong anti-fibrillation activity. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that Myr quenched the fluorescence of BSA in a static process, with the possible formation of a complex (approximate molar ratio of 1:1). The binding between BSA and Myr mainly depended on van der Waals interaction, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond. The synchronous fluorescence and UV-visible (UV-vis) spectra results indicated that the conformation of BSA altered in the presence of Myr. The fluorescent probe displacement experiments and molecular docking suggested that Myr primarily bound to binding site 1 (subdomain IIA) of BSA. These findings demonstrate that Myr is a potential anti-glycation agent and provide a theoretical basis for the further functional research of Myr in the prevention and treatment of AGEs-related diseases.
