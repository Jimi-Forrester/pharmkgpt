30285275|t|A Comprehensive Overview of the Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Clobazam.
30285275|a|Clobazam (CLB) is a 1,5-benzodiazepine that has been widely used as an anxiolytic and antiseizure drug (ASD) since it was first synthesized over 50 years ago. CLB was approved in the United States in 2011 as adjunctive therapy for seizures in patients >=2 years old with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. CLB pharmacokinetics (PK) have been studied in single- and multiple-dose administrations in healthy subjects. Salient features include high bioavailability, linear PK, and negligible effects from coadministration of other ASDs. CLB is highly and extensively absorbed, with little effect from food; time to maximum plasma concentration is 0.5 to 4 hours following the dose. After CLB doses of 20 to 40 mg/day, the volume of distribution is 99 to 120 L, with oral clearance ranging from 1.9 to 2.3 L/h. CLB is lipophilic and distributes throughout the body after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP3A, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6, and its main active metabolite is N-desmethylclobazam. The half-life of CLB after a single oral dose ranges from 36 to 42 hours; the half-life of N-desmethylclobazam ranges from 59 to 74 hours. The metabolites of CLB are primarily excreted renally. Population PK modeling using data from healthy subjects and patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome indicates that race, sex, age, weight, and renal function do not influence CLB PK. As CLB has been extensively studied since the 1970s, this review is meant to provide a consolidated and comprehensive resource on CLB PK for both prescribers and scientists alike.
