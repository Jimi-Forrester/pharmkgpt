29618902|t|Screening of Human Proteins for Fluoride and Aluminum Binding.
29618902|a|Previous studies showed that prolonged exposure to fluoride (F-) and aluminum (Al3+) ions is associated with numerous diseases including neurological disorders. They don't have any known biological function. But they can bind with proteins that interact with ions similar to them. Such unwanted interactions affect the normal biological function of the target proteins, as well as their downstream protein-protein interactions. Several studies show the detrimental effects posed by them including Alzheimer's disease. However, their target proteins have never been reported. Here, we have screened for the human protein targets subjected to F- and Al3+ interactions by using data-driven prediction tools. We have identified 20 different proteins that directly bind with them (10 interact with fluoride and 10 with aluminum). In addition, protein-protein interaction has been explored to find the proteins that indirectly interact with F- and Al3+. We have found 86 indirect targets for F- and 90 for Al3+. Furthermore, 19 common protein targets have been identified, including proteins (9 out of 19) associated with neurodegenerative disorders. However, wet lab experiments are beyond our scopes to validate the binding networks. Additional studies must be warranted.
