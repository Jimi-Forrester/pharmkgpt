31823082|t|Distal bypass with a varicose vein graft for critical limb ischemia: report of a case.
31823082|a|BACKGROUND: A saphenous vein complicated with varicose veins is generally thought to be unsuitable for bypass grafting. CASE PRESENTATION: A patient who developed sepsis due to lower limb gangrene was successfully treated by endovascular treatment and bypass surgery using a varicose vein graft. There were no complications, such as occlusion or aneurysm, of the varicose vein graft during the 2-year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: We herein report a case in which bypass surgery with a varicose vein graft was used to avoid major amputation of the lower limb, and the patient recovered markedly from sepsis. If there are no other appropriate autologous veins for revascularization of lower limb gangrene, a varicose vein graft may be useful as a conduit for bypass surgery at risk of graft infection.
