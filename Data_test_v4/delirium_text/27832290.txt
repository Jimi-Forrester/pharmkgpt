27832290|t|Sorting receptor SORLA: cellular mechanisms and implications for disease.
27832290|a|Sorting-related receptor with A-type repeats (SORLA) is an intracellular sorting receptor that directs cargo proteins, such as kinases, phosphatases, and signaling receptors, to their correct location within the cell. The activity of SORLA assures proper function of cells and tissues, and receptor dysfunction is the underlying cause of common human malignancies, including Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern sorting of SORLA and its cargo in multiple cell types, and why genetic defects in this receptor results in devastating diseases.
