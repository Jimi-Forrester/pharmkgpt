38201948|t|Association between Anxiety Status and Hydration Status in Spanish University Students.
38201948|a|Anxiety disorders are a very common psychiatric pathology among young university students, and the strategies for its mitigation are limited to the consumption of anxiolytic substances. Adequate hydration is essential for staying healthy, as water is the main component of the human body and of several physiological processes. A state of dehydration, in addition to a negative water balance, has serious consequences on health status. We aimed to determine the association between the degree of anxiety and the level of hydration in Spanish university students. A cross-sectional, observational research study with a sample of 65 female university students was conducted. Over 90% of the study population shows anxiety levels above the 95th percentile. The individuals with anxiety above the 95th percentile showed a negative water balance. The consumption of coffee and herbal teas shows correlations with state anxiety and trait anxiety.
