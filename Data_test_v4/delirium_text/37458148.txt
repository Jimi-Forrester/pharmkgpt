37458148|a|BACKGROUND: Prebiotics is a relatively neglected area in cancer research, despite evidence suggesting that it plays a key role in suppressing tumour growth and improving immune function. RECENT FINDINGS: Including prebiotics in the diet has been shown to strengthen the immune system and can better slow down or prevent the growth of tumours. It has also been strongly indicated in various scientific studies that prebiotics can contribute to the sustenance of a healthy microbiome, which in turn plays an important role in increasing the effectiveness and reducing the side effects of cancer treatments. CONCLUSION: In the present review article we highlight the mechanisms by which prebiotics like inulin, fructooligosaccharide (FOS), beta-glucan, pectin, and xylooligosaccharide (XOS) function. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of incorporating prebiotics during cancer therapy to improvise gut health and prevent/reverse the damage caused to patients due to chemotherapy has also been elaborated.
