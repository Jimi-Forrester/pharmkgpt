38787367|t|Sensitivity of substrate translocation in chaperone-mediated autophagy to Alzheimer's disease progression.
38787367|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder marked by abnormal protein accumulation and resulting proteotoxicity. This study examines Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA), particularly substrate translocation into lysosomes, in AD. The study observes: (1) Increased substrate translocation activity into lysosomes, vital for CMA, aligns with AD progression, highlighted by gene upregulation and more efficient substrate delivery. (2) This CMA phase strongly correlates with AD's clinical symptoms; more proteotoxicity links to worse dementia, underscoring the need for active degradation. (3) Proteins like GFAP and LAMP2A, when upregulated, almost certainly indicate AD risk, marking this process as a significant AD biomarker. Based on these observations, this study proposes the following hypothesis: As AD progresses, the aggregation of pathogenic proteins increases, the process of substrate entry into lysosomes via CMA becomes active. The genes associated with this process exhibit heightened sensitivity to AD. This conclusion stems from an analysis of over 10,000 genes and 363 patients using two AI methodologies. These methodologies were instrumental in identifying genes highly sensitive to AD and in mapping the molecular networks that respond to the disease, thereby highlighting the significance of this critical phase of CMA.
