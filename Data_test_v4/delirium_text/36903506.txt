36903506|t|Anti-Alzheimer's Natural Products Derived from Plant Endophytic Fungi.
36903506|a|Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia worldwide and seriously affects patients' daily tasks. Plant endophytic fungi are known for providing novel and unique secondary metabolites with diverse activities. This review focuses primarily on the published research regarding anti-Alzheimer's natural products derived from endophytic fungi between 2002 and 2022. Following a thorough review of the literature, 468 compounds with anti-Alzheimer's-related activities are reviewed and classified based on their structural skeletons, primarily including alkaloids, peptides, polyketides, terpenoids, and sterides. The classification, occurrences, and bioactivities of these natural products from endophytic fungi are summarized in detail. Our results provide a reference on endophytic fungi natural products that may assist in the development of new anti-Alzheimer's compounds.
