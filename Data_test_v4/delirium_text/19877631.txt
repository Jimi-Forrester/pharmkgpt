19877631|a|Our design of bifunctional metal chelators as chemical probes and potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the incorporation of a metal binding moiety into structural frameworks of Abeta aggregate-imaging agents. Using this strategy, two compounds 2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-8-ol (1) and N(1),N(1)-dimethyl-N(4)-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)benzene-1,4-diamine (2) were prepared and characterized. The bifunctionality for metal chelation and Abeta interaction of 1 and 2 was verified by spectroscopic methods. Furthermore, the reactivity of 1 and 2 with Cu(II)-associated Abeta aggregates was investigated. The modulation of Cu(II)-triggered Abeta aggregation by 1 and 2 was found to be more effective than that by the known metal chelating agents CQ, EDTA, and phen. These studies suggest a new class of multifunctional molecules for the development of chemical tools to unravel metal-associated events in AD and potential therapeutic agents for metal-ion chelation therapy.
