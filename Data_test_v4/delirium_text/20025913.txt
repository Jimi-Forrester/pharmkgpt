20025913|a|OBJECTIVE: The recently developed global synchronization index (GSI) quantifies synchronization between neuronal signals at multiple sites. This study explored the clinical significance of the GSI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. METHODS: Electroencephalograms were recorded from 25 AD patients and 22 age-matched healthy normal controls (NC). GSI values were computed both across the entire frequency band and separately in the delta, theta, alpha, beta1, beta2, beta3, and gamma bands. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) were used to assess the symptom severity. RESULTS: GSI values in the beta1, beta2, beta3, and gamma bands were significantly lower in AD patients than in NC. GSI values in the beta and gamma bands were positively correlated with the MMSE scores in all participants (AD and NC). In AD patients, GSI values were negatively correlated with MMSE scores in the delta bands, but positively correlated in the beta1 and gamma band. Also, GSI values were positively correlated with CDR scores in the delta bands, but negatively correlated in the gamma band. CONCLUSIONS: GSI values of mainly high-frequency bands were significantly lower in AD patients than in NC, they were significantly correlated with scores on symptom severity scales. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that GSI values are a useful biological correlate of cognitive decline in AD patients.
