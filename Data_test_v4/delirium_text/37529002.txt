37529002|t|MTHFR C677T mutation affects adipogenic differentiation abilities of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
37529002|a|The effects of 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) viability, morphology, physiology and differentiation capacity were investigated in this study. For this purpose, primary hBM-MSCs with wild type (WT, C/C), heterozygote (HTZ, C/T) and homozygote (HMZ, T/T) for the MTHFR gene were obtained with ethical committee permission and donor informed. Mutations were detected using RFLP and Sanger sequencing methods from genomic DNA isolated from cells, colonization properties were investigated by CFU-F test and proliferative differences were investigated by MTT test. Adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation were induced to study changes in their differentiation potentials, and the results were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Graphpad Prism. A total of 13 donors were screened and there were no differences in the hBM-MSC markers and in vitro morphologies of the cells. While there were significant differences between WT and HTZ as a result of the CFU-F test, there were no significant differences in the MTT test after 24 and 48 h. As a result of differentiation tests, it was found that adipogenic differentiation was significantly more in HMZ cells than WT cells. Osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation results did not give statistically significant results. As a result of these experiments, adipogenic differentiation was found to be affected by the MTHFR genotype in hBM-MSCs.
