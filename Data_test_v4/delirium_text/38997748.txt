38997748|a|BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold the potential for elucidating the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and serve as biomarkers. Notably, the comparative and longitudinal alterations in the protein profiles of EVs in serum (sEVs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; cEVs) of sporadic ALS (SALS) patients remain uncharted. Ropinirole hydrochloride (ROPI; dopamine D2 receptor [D2R] agonist), a new anti-ALS drug candidate identified through induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based drug discovery, has been suggested to inhibit ALS disease progression in the Ropinirole Hydrochloride Remedy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ROPALS) trial, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Therefore, we tried to reveal longitudinal changes with disease progression and the effects of ROPI on protein profiles of EVs. METHODS: We collected serum and CSF at fixed intervals from ten controls and from 20 SALS patients participating in the ROPALS trial. Comprehensive proteomic analysis of EVs, extracted from these samples, was conducted using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (LC/MS). Furthermore, we generated iPSC-derived astrocytes (iPasts) and performed RNA sequencing on astrocytes with or without ROPI treatment. RESULTS: The findings revealed notable disparities yet high congruity in sEVs and cEVs protein profiles concerning disease status, time and ROPI administration. In SALS, both sEVs and cEVs presented elevated levels of inflammation-related proteins but reduced levels associated with unfolded protein response (UPR). These results mirrored the longitudinal changes after disease onset and correlated with the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) at sampling time, suggesting a link to the onset and progression of SALS. ROPI appeared to counteract these changes, attenuating inflammation-related protein levels and boosting those tied to UPR in SALS, proposing an anti-ALS impact on EV protein profiles. Reverse translational research using iPasts indicated that these changes may partly reflect the DRD2-dependent neuroinflammatory inhibitory effects of ROPI. We have also identified biomarkers that predict diagnosis and disease progression by machine learning-driven biomarker search. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited sample size, this study pioneers in reporting time-series proteomic alterations in serum and CSF EVs from SALS patients, offering comprehensive insights into SALS pathogenesis, ROPI-induced changes, and potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers.
