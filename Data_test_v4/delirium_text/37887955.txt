37887955|t|Dextrin-Based Adsorbents Synthesized via a Sustainable Approach for the Removal of Salicylic Acid from Water.
37887955|a|Pharmaceuticals such as salicylic acid are commonly detected in wastewater and surface waters, increasing concern for possible harmful effects on humans and the environment. Their difficult removal via conventional treatments raised the need for improved strategies, among which the development of bioderived adsorbents gained interest because of their sustainability and circularity. In this work, biobased cross-linked adsorbents, synthesized via a sustainable approach from starch derivatives, namely beta-cyclodextrins and maltodextrins, were at first characterized via FTIR-ATR, TGA, SEM, and elemental analysis, showing hydrophilic granular morphologies endowed with specific interaction sites and thermal stabilities higher than 300  C. Subsequently, adsorption tests were carried out, aiming to assess the capabilities of such polymers on the removal of salicylic acid, as a case study, from water. Batch tests showed rapid kinetics of adsorption with a removal of salicylic acid higher than 90% and a maximum adsorption capacity of 17 mg/g. Accordingly, continuous fixed bed adsorption tests confirmed the good interaction between the polymers and salicylic acid, while the recycling of the adsorbents was successfully performed up to four cycles of use.
