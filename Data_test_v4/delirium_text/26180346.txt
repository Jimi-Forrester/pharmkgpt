26180346|a|[Purpose] This study investigated how participation in a recreation program influences electroencephalogram changes in the demented elderly. [Subjects] Fourteen patients were included in the experimental group and 18 in the control group. [Methods] They had no regular exercise habits, and walked independently, and scored 11-23 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and thus had no apraxia and could communicate. To empirically verify changes in electroencephalograms of the demented elderly for depression, sleep disorder, and life quality through their participation in the therapeutic recreation program, male and female citizens >65 years old at a geriatric hospital were included. The experimental group attended therapeutic recreation programs regularly for 3 months and control group did not. [Results] Electroencephalogram values were higher in the experimental than in the control group, demonstrating that the therapeutic recreation program enhances electroencephalogram values. However, post-program electroencephalograms between the two groups showed minor differences for all variables, except for the anti-stress index and brain quotient. [Conclusion] The therapeutic recreation program caused changes in brain activation, and this method revealed the relation between the activity program and emotion via the anti-stress index.
