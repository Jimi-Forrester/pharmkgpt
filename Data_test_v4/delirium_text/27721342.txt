27721342|a|Label claims of vitamin E succinate and polyphenolic nutraceuticals are assessed. A validated HPLC method was utilized to assess vitamin E succinate products. Three novel LC/MS methods were used to assess the polyphenols, pterostilbene, phloretin, and myricetin, in dietary supplements. The amount of vitamin E succinate varied from 0-130% of the stated label content with two products containing vitamin E acetate rather than vitamin E succinate. Expected polyphenols were found in 7 of the 8 supplement products. None of the polyphenol supplements contained content within 100-120% of label claims. The present study indicates a lack of uniformity in nutraceutical products.
