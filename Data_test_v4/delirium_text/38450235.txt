38450235|a|Precision nutrition and nutrigenomics are emerging in the development of therapies for multiple diseases. The ketogenic diet (KD) is the most widely used clinical diet, providing high fat, low carbohydrate, and adequate protein. KD produces ketones and alters the metabolism of patients. Growing evidence suggests that KD has therapeutic effects in a wide range of neuronal diseases including epilepsy, neurodegeneration, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Although KD is considered to be a low-side-effect diet treatment, its therapeutic mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. Also, its induced keto-response among different populations has not been elucidated. Understanding the ketone metabolism in health and disease is critical for the development of KD-associated therapeutics and synergistic therapy under any physiological background. Here, we review the current advances and known heterogeneity of the KD response and discuss the prospects for KD therapy from a precision nutrition perspective.
