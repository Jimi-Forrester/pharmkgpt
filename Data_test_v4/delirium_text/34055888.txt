34055888|a|Recent advances in sequencing technologies and the discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have provided new insights in the molecular pathogenesis of cancers. Several studies have implicated the role of ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and recently discovered circular RNAs (circRNAs) in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs are highly stable and closed-loop RNA molecules. It has been established that circRNAs regulate gene expression by controlling the functions of miRNAs and RNA-binding protein (RBP) or by translating into proteins. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis is associated with human diseases, such as cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. In this study, we explored the interaction among circRNAs, miRNAs, and their target genes in various cancers using state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools. We identified differentially expressed circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs on multiple cancers from publicly available data. Furthermore, we identified many crucial drivers and tumor suppressor genes in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis in various cancers. Together, this study data provide a deeper understanding of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory mechanisms in cancers.
