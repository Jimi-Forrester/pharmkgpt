36852640|t|Resting-state functional alterations in patients with brain arteriovenous malformations involving language areas.
36852640|a|Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may involve language areas but usually do not lead to aphasia. This study evaluated resting-state functional alterations and investigated the language reorganization mechanism in AVM patients. Thirty-nine patients with AVMs involving language areas and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. The AVM patients were categorized into three subgroups according to lesion location: the frontal (15 patients), temporal (14 patients), and parietal subgroups (10 patients). All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach was applied to analyze rs-fMRI data. Language abilities were normal in all participants based on the Western Aphasia Battery. Compared with those of healthy subjects, ALFF values significantly increased (FDR corrected p < .01) in the anterior part of the right putamen in the frontal AVM subgroup, in the posterior part of the right inferior and middle temporal gyrus in the temporal AVM subgroup, and in the inferior lateral part of the left cerebellar hemisphere (lobule VIII) and the right inferior parietal lobule in the parietal AVM subgroup. Functional annotation using Neurosynth indicated that the ALFF t-map was only significantly positively associated with the language-related domain (FDR corrected p < .01). In patients with AVMs involving the language cortex, language network reorganization occurs to maintain normal language abilities. The brain areas recruited into the reorganized language network were located in the right cerebral and left cerebellar hemispheres, both of which are nondominant hemispheres. Differences in lesion location led to distinct reorganization patterns.
