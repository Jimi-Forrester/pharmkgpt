37443557|t|Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Applied to Model Speech and Language in Parkinson's Disease.
37443557|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world, and it is characterized by the production of different motor and non-motor symptoms which negatively affect speech and language production. For decades, the research community has been working on methodologies to automatically model these biomarkers to detect and monitor the disease; however, although speech impairments have been widely explored, language remains underexplored despite being a valuable source of information, especially to assess cognitive impairments associated with non-motor symptoms. This study proposes the automatic assessment of PD patients using different methodologies to model speech and language biomarkers. One-dimensional and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), along with pre-trained models such as Wav2Vec 2.0, BERT, and BETO, were considered to classify PD patients vs. Healthy Control (HC) subjects. The first approach consisted of modeling speech and language independently. Then, the best representations from each modality were combined following early, joint, and late fusion strategies. The results show that the speech modality yielded an accuracy of up to 88%, thus outperforming all language representations, including the multi-modal approach. These results suggest that speech representations better discriminate PD patients and HC subjects than language representations. When analyzing the fusion strategies, we observed that changes in the time span of the multi-modal representation could produce a significant loss of information in the speech modality, which was likely linked to a decrease in accuracy in the multi-modal experiments. Further experiments are necessary to validate this claim with other fusion methods using different time spans.
