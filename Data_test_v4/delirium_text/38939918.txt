38939918|t|NUAK: never underestimate a kinase.
38939918|a|NUAK1 and NUAK2 belong to a family of kinases related to the catalytic alpha-subunits of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complexes. Despite canonical activation by the tumour suppressor kinase LKB1, both NUAKs exhibit a spectrum of activities that favour tumour development and progression. Here, we review similarities in structure and function of the NUAKs, their regulation at gene, transcript and protein level, and discuss their phosphorylation of specific downstream targets in the context of the signal transduction pathways and biological activities regulated by each or both NUAKs.
