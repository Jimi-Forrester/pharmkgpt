38248286|t|Pathophysiology to Risk Factor and Therapeutics to Treatment Strategies on Epilepsy.
38248286|a|Epilepsy represents a condition in which abnormal neuronal discharges or the hyperexcitability of neurons occur with synchronicity, presenting a significant public health challenge. Prognostic factors, such as etiology, electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, the type and number of seizures before treatment, as well as the initial unsatisfactory effects of medications, are important considerations. Although there are several third-generation antiepileptic drugs currently available, their multiple side effects can negatively affect patient quality of life. The inheritance and etiology of epilepsy are complex, involving multiple underlying genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Different neurotransmitters play crucial roles in maintaining the normal physiology of different neurons. Dysregulations in neurotransmission, due to abnormal transmitter levels or changes in their receptors, can result in seizures. In this review, we address the roles played by various neurotransmitters and their receptors in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Furthermore, we extensively explore the neurological mechanisms involved in the development and progression of epilepsy, along with its risk factors. Furthermore, we highlight the new therapeutic targets, along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies currently employed in the treatment of epileptic syndromes, including drug interventions employed in clinical trials related to epilepsy.
