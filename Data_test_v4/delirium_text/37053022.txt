37053022|t|Upregulation of RasGRF1 ameliorates spatial cognitive dysfunction in mice after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.
37053022|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-mediated cognitive impairment is a serious problem worldwide. However, given its complexity, the underlying mechanisms by which CCH induces cognitive dysfunction remain unclear, resulting in a lack of effective treatments. In this study, we aimed to determine whether changes in the expression of RasGRF1, an important protein associated with cognition and synaptic plasticity, underlie the associated impairments in cognition after CCH. We found that RasGRF1 levels markedly decreased following CCH. Through prediction and validation studies, we observed that miRNA-323-3p was upregulated after CCH and could bind to the 3'-untranslated region of Rasgrf1 mRNA and regulate its expression in vitro. Moreover, the inhibition of miRNA-323-3p upregulated Rasgrf1 expression in the hippocampus after CCH, which was reversed by Rasgrf1 siRNA. This suggests that miRNA-323-3p is an important regulator of Rasgrf1. The Morris water maze and Y maze tests showed that miRNA-323-3p inhibition and Rasgrf1 upregulation improved spatial learning and memory, and electrophysiological measurements revealed deficits in long-term potentiation after CCH that were reversed by Rasgrf1 upregulation. Dendritic spine density and mature mushroom spine density were also improved after miRNA-323-3p inhibition and Rasgrf1 upregulation. Furthermore, Rasgrf1 upregulation by miRNA-323-3p inhibition improved dendritic spine density and mature mushroom spine density and ameliorated the deterioration of synapses and postsynaptic density. Overall, RasGRF1 regulation attenuated cognitive impairment, helped maintain structural and functional synaptic plasticity, and prevented synapse deterioration after CCH. These results suggest that Rasgrf1 downregulation by miRNA-323-3p plays an important role in cognitive impairment after CCH. Thus, RasGRF1 and miRNA-323-3p may represent potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairment after CCH.
