35975086|a|Iron is the main substance for maintaining life. Real-time determination of ferric ion (Fe3+) in living cells is of great significance for understanding the relationship of Fe3+ concentration changes with various physiological and pathological processes. Fluorescent probes are suitable for the detection of trace metal ions in cells due to their low toxicity and high sensitivity. In this work, a boron-dipyrromethene-based fluorescent probe (BODIPY-CL) for selective detection of Fe3+ was synthesized. The fluorescence emission of BODIPY-CL was determined at 516 nm. In a pH range of 1 to 10, the probe BODIPY-CL exhibits a quenching response to Fe3+. Meanwhile, BODIPY-CL showed a highly selective response to Fe3+ compared with 16 kinds of metal ions. The stoichiometry ratio of BODIPY-CL bound to Fe3+ was nearly 2 : 1. The fluorescence quenching response obtained by the sensor was linear with the Fe3+ concentration in the range of 0-400 muM, and the detection limit was 2.9 muM. BODIPY-CL was successfully applied to image Fe3+ in cells. This study provides a promising fluorescent imaging probe for further research on the physiological and pathological effects of Fe3+.
