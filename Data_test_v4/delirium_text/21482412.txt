21482412|t|SUMO and its role in human diseases.
21482412|a|The covalent attachment of small ubiquition-like modifier (SUMO) polypeptides, or sumoylation, is an important regulator of the functional properties of many proteins. Among these are many proteins implicated in human diseases including cancer and Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases, as well as spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The results of two more recent studies identify two additional human disease-associated proteins that are sumoylated, amyloid precursor protein (APP), and lamin A. APP sumoylation modulates Abeta peptide levels, suggesting a potential role in Alzheimer's disease, and decreased lamin A sumoylation due to mutations near its SUMO site has been implicated in causing some forms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy.
