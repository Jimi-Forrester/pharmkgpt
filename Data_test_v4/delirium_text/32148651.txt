32148651|t|Antioxidant and Antigenotoxic Potential of Infundibulicybe geotropa Mushroom Collected from Northwestern Turkey.
32148651|a|Infundibulicybe geotropa (Bull.) Harmaja is an edible mushroom found in Bolu province in northwestern Turkey. The chemical composition and bioactivity of these mushrooms has not been previously investigated. We examined the phenolic composition, elemental content, and antioxidant and antigenotoxic effects of methanol extracts of fruiting bodies. The phenolic compounds in the fungal samples were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and element content was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI) were determined using the commercially available Rel assay kit. The antigenotoxic effects of the extract were determined using the MTT assay to assess cell viability and the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay). The total phenolic content (ppm) of I. geotropa was found to be catechin (361 +- 2.31), clorogenic acid (553.54 +- 5.06), and coumaric acid (9.93 +- 0.25). The TAS, TOS, and OSI of the extract were 1.854 +- 0.051 mmol/L, 30.385 +- 0.399 mumol/L, and 1.639 +- 0.067, respectively. The elemental levels were within "normal" range. In HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells, the extract (100 and 200 mug/ml) showed no genotoxic potential and ameliorated hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced oxidative DNA damage. I. geotropa may be considered a good nutrient due to its phenolic constituents and antioxidant potential.
