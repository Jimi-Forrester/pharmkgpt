32825726|t|A Probeless Capacitive Biosensor for Direct Detection of Amyloid Beta 1-42 in Human Serum Based on an Interdigitated Chain-Shaped Electrode.
32825726|a|Amyloid beta (abeta) 1-42, a peptide that is 1-42 amino acids long, is a major component of senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Abeta detection has become an essential antecedence to predict the declining mental abilities of patients. In this paper, a probeless capacitive biosensor for the non-Faradaic detection of abeta 1-42 peptide was developed by immobilizing a specific anti-abeta antibody onto a self-assembled monolayer functionalized interdigitated chain-shaped electrode (anti-abeta/SAM/ICE). The novelty and difference of this article from previous studies is the direct detection of abeta peptide with no redox probe ((Fe(CN)6)3-/4-), which can avoid the denaturation of the protein caused by the metallization (binding of abeta to metal ion Fe which is presented in the redox couple). The direct detection of abeta with no redox probe is performed by non-Faradaic capacitive measurement, which is greatly different from the Faradaic measurement of the charge transfer resistance of the redox probe. The detection of various abeta 1-42 peptide concentrations in human serum (HS) was performed by measuring the relative change in electrode interfacial capacitance due to the specific antibody-abeta binding. Capacitance change in the anti-abeta/SAM/ICE biosensor showed a linear detection range between 10 pg mL-1 and 104 pg mL-1, and a detection limit of 7.5 pg mL-1 in HS, which was much lower than the limit of detection for CSF abeta 1-42 (~500 pg mL-1) and other biosensors. The small dissociation constant Kd of the antibody-antigen interaction was also found to be 0.016 nM in HS, indicating the high binding affinity of the anti-abeta/SAM/ICE biosensor in the recognizing of abeta 1-42. Thus, the developed sensor can be used for label-free and direct measurement of abeta 1-42 peptide and for point-of-care diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease without redox probe.
