35163455|t|A Transcriptome Analysis of mRNAs and Long Non-Coding RNAs in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
35163455|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The number of cases of PD is expected to double by 2030, representing a heavy burden on the healthcare system. Clinical symptoms include the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, which leads to striatal dopamine deficiency and, subsequently, causes motor dysfunction. Certainly, the study of the transcriptome of the various RNAs plays a crucial role in the study of this neurodegenerative disease. In fact, the aim of this study was to evaluate the transcriptome in a cohort of subjects with PD compared with a control cohort. In particular we focused on mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), using the Illumina NextSeq 550 DX System. Differential expression analysis revealed 716 transcripts with padj <= 0.05; among these, 630 were mRNA (coding protein), lncRNA, and MT_tRNA. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA, Qiagen) was used to perform the functional and pathway analysis. The highest statistically significant pathways were: IL-15 signaling, B cell receptor signaling, systemic lupus erythematosus in B cell signaling pathway, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, and melatonin degradation II. Our findings further reinforce the important roles of mitochondria and lncRNA in PD and, in parallel, further support the concept of inverse comorbidity between PD and some cancers.
