35808999|a|Glial cell activation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. During HIV infection, neuroinflammation is associated with cognitive impairment, even during sustained long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy. However, the cellular subsets contributing to neuronal damage in the CNS during HIV infection remain unclear. Using post-mortem brain samples from eight HIV patients and eight non-neurological disease controls, we identify a subset of CNS phagocytes highly enriched in LGALS3, CTSB, GPNMB and HLA-DR, a signature identified in the context of ageing and neurodegeneration. In HIV patients, the presence of this phagocyte phenotype was associated with synaptic stripping, suggesting an involvement in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Taken together, our findings elucidate some of the molecular signatures adopted by CNS phagocytes in HIV-positive patients and contribute to the understanding of how HIV might pave the way to other forms of cognitive decline in ageing HIV patient populations.
