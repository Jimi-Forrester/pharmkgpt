32645849|t|Adenosine and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors Are Present in Blood Serum and Exosomes from SAMP8 Mice: Modulation by Aging and Resveratrol.
32645849|a|Adenosine (ARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are modulated in the brain of SAMP8 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present work, it is shown the presence of ARs and mGluRs in blood serum and derived exosomes from SAMP8 mice as well as its possible modulation by aging and resveratrol (RSV) consumption. In blood serum, adenosine A1 and A2A receptors remained unaltered from 5 to 7 months of age. However, an age-related decrease in adenosine level was observed, while 5'-Nucleotidase activity was not modulated. Regarding the glutamatergic system, it was observed a decrease in mGluR5 density and glutamate levels in older mice. In addition, dietary RSV supplementation caused an age-dependent modulation in both adenosinergic and glutamatergic systems. These GPCRs were also found in blood serum-derived exosomes, which might suggest that these receptors could be released into circulation via exosomes. Interestingly, changes elicited by age and RSV supplementation on mGluR5 density, and adenosine and glutamate levels were similar to that detected in whole-brain. Therefore, we might suggest that the quantification of these receptors, and their corresponding endogenous ligands, in blood serum could have predictive value for early diagnosis in combination with other distinctive hallmarks of AD.
