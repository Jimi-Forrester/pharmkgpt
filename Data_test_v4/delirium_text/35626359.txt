35626359|t|Plasma microRNAs as a Potential Biomarker for Identification of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
35626359|a|Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the second most common Parkinsonian disorder with complex etiology. The underlying molecular mechanism of PSP pathogenesis remains unclear. The present study aims to find the feasibility of using plasma miRNAs as novel biomarkers. Plasma-focused qPCR panels were used for microRNA profiling and identified differentially expressed microRNAs in PSP compared to controls. The DIANA-miRPath v3.0 was used to perform KEGG pathway analysis. We then confirmed the expression of selected candidates by RT-qPCR and their clinical utility was assessed by ROC analysis. Profiling data revealed 28 differentially expressed microRNAs in PSP. Five overexpressed miRNAs were selected for further analysis. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed 48 high-risk pathways. The study revealed that as a single marker-miR-19b-3p, miR-33a-5p, miR-130b-3p, miR-136-3p, and miR-210-3p had a specificity of 64.71%, 82.35%, 68.75%, 82.35%, and 70.59% at sensitivity 77.78%, 77.78%, 66.67%, 73.33%, and 66.67%, respectively. The result suggests that circulating plasma miRNAs were altered in PSP compared to control. The findings of this study may provide potential biomarkers and pathways associated with PSP. Further large-scale validation studies are required to confirm the same.
