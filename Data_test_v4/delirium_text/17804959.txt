17804959|t|Coated-platelets are higher in amnestic versus nonamnestic patients with mild cognitive impairment.
17804959|a|Coated-platelets, a subset of platelets produced by coactivation with both collagen and thrombin, retain intact amyloid precursor protein on their surface. We analyzed blood samples from 66 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (36 amnestic and 30 nonamnestic) for coated-platelet production. Coated-platelet levels were significantly higher in amnestic compared with nonamnestic patients (P=0.037). These findings support the hypothesis that coated-platelets may be linked to the requisite alteration in amyloid precursor protein metabolism that occurs in Alzheimer disease.
