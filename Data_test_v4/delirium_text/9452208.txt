9452208|t|Neuronal DNA damage precedes tangle formation and is associated with up-regulation of nitrotyrosine in Alzheimer's disease brain.
9452208|a|The relationship of neuronal DNA damage to tangle-bearing neurons and nitrotyrosine (NT) expression, a neurochemical marker of oxidative damage mediated by peroxynitrite, was examined in visual cortex of AD patients. Many terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive neurons were detected and the majority (93%) of these TdT-labeled neurons lacked evidence of tangle formation. NT expression was elevated in AD cases and most TdT-labeled nuclei also showed strong NT immunoreactivity. These data suggest the hypothesis that the neurons with DNA damage in the absence of tangle formation may degenerate by tangle-independent mechanisms and that oxidative damage may contribute to such mechanisms in AD.
