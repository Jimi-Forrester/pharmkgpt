30376576|a|The mechanism underlying the role of Hsp70s in toxicity associated with intracellular accumulation of toxic protein inclusions is under intense investigation. In current study, we examined the roles of all different isoforms of yeast cytosolic Ssa Hsp70 on alpha-synuclein mediated cellular toxicity. The study showed that yeast cells expressing stress-inducible Ssa3 or Ssa4 as sole Ssa Hsp70 isoforms, reduced alpha-synuclein toxicity better than those expressing a constitutive counterpart. The protective effect of stress-inducible Ssa Hsp70s was not alpha-syn specific, but more general to other inclusion forming proteins such as polyQ. We show that the protective effect is not by induction of a general stress response in Ssa3 cells rather by promoting alpha-synuclein degradation through autophagy. The present study revealed that effect of Hsp70s was isoform dependent, and that autophagy protects Ssa3 cells from the deleterious effects of toxic protein inclusions.
