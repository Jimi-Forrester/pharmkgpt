32276479|t|Kynurenic Acid Levels are Increased in the CSF of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
32276479|a|Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a product of the tryptophan (TRP) metabolism via the kynurenine pathway (KP). This pathway is activated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer s disease (AD). KYNA is primarily produced by astrocytes and is considered neuroprotective. Thus, altered KYNA levels may suggest an inflammatory response. Very recently, significant increases in KYNA levels were reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients compared with normal controls. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of KYNA in CSF for the classification of patients with AD, cognitively healthy controls, and patients with a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Averaged KYNA concentration in CSF was higher in patients with AD when compared with healthy subjects and with all the other differentially diagnosed groups. There were no significant differences in KYNA levels in CSF between any other neurodegenerative groups and controls. These results suggest a specific increase in KYNA concentration in CSF from AD patients not seen in other neurodegenerative diseases.
