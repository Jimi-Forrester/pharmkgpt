35371728|t|Effect of Vertical and Lateral Offset Restoration on Clinical Outcomes in Intracapsular and Extracapsular Hip Fractures Undergoing Hemiarthroplasty.
35371728|a|Objective We aimed to investigate whether there is a change in the postoperative lateral and vertical femoral offset (FO) in patients who underwent bipolar straight stem hemiarthroplasty (SSHA) and calcar stem hemiarthroplasty (CRHA) and whether this change makes a difference in the comparison of both groups. Material and methods This study included 109 patients who met these criteria. Patients are divided into two groups according to treatment methods. There were 58 patients (group 1) who underwent SSHA due to intracapsular (AO type 31-B neck and 31-C head fracture) femur fracture, and there were 51 patients (group 2) who underwent CRHA due to extracapsular (AO type 31-A intertrochanteric) femur fracture. We analyzed femoral vertical and lateral femoral offset, Wiberg angle, and head-neck angle difference in both groups. Results The median age was significantly higher in the CRHA group (p=0.042). The Harris hip score (HHS) was significantly higher in the SSHA group (p=0.023). The femoral offset difference was 5 mm in the SSHA group, while it was significantly lower (-6 mm) in the CRHA group (p<0.001). The Wiberg angle difference did not differ significantly between patient groups (p=0.214). The limb length difference was found to be similar in both surgical groups (p=0.483). Conclusions The study results show that there was no negative correlation between clinical and radiological outcomes in the SSHA group, whereas there was a negative correlation between clinical and radiological outcomes in the CRHA group. It is very difficult to control vertical and lateral offset reconstruction, especially in extracapsular hip fractures reconstructed by hemiarthroplasty. Deficiencies in lateral and vertical stabilization restoration may be associated with poor clinical outcomes in CRHA patients. Orthopedic surgeries should be performed carefully when restoring leg length and femoral offset, especially calcar replacement hemiarthroplasties.
