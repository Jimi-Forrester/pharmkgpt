31031902|t|Curcumin-Loaded BSA Nanoparticles Protect More Efficiently Than Natural Curcumin Against Scopolamine-Induced Memory Retrieval Deficit.
31031902|a|INTRODUCTION: There is evidence indicating that the rate of AD is lower in curry consuming populations. Then, there is an effort to elucidate if curcumin -as the main ingredient of turmeric-might affect the process of AD. However, in clinical trials of AD, a six-month curcumin treatment failed to show any progress, which might be attributable to its low bioavailability. In this line, a recent human study revealed that a more bioavailable solid lipid curcumin enhances cognition in aged adults. By the application of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), the current study aimed at converting curcumin to nano sizes and assessing its protective effects against scopolamine-induced passive avoidance memory retrieval deficit. METHODS: Nanocurcumin was prepared via dissolution method. Male NMRI mice (20-25 g body weight) were used. The effective doses of nanocurcumin were selected according to the initial pilot test. The mice were treated with nanocurcumin 15 or 20 mg/kg/p.o or distilled water for 10 days. The animals were habituated and trained in passive avoidance apparatus on the day 10. The retention test was performed 24 hours later. Scopolamine (1 mg/kg/i.p.) or saline was injected 30 minutes before memory retention trial. RESULTS: The findings indicated that nanocurcumin in doses 15 or 20 mg/kg/p.o prevented the retrieval deficit induced by scopolamine while natural curcumin in its equivalent doses did not have such an effect. Furthermore, nanocurcumin by itself improved memory retention comparing with the control group. CONCLUSION: These findings implied that the potential anti-amnesic effects of curcumin might be observed by producing and using its nanoformulation form.
