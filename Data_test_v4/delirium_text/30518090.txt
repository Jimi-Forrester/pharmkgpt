30518090|t|The Biological Significance and Regulatory Mechanism of c-Myc Binding Protein 1 (MBP-1).
30518090|a|Alternatively translated from the ENO gene and expressed in an array of vertebrate and plant tissues, c-Myc binding protein 1 (MBP-1) participates in the regulation of growth in organisms, their development and their environmental responses. As a transcriptional repressor of multiple proto-oncogenes, vertebrate MBP-1 interacts with other cellular factors to attenuate the proliferation and metastasis of lung, breast, esophageal, gastric, bone, prostrate, colorectal, and cervical cancer cells. Due to its tumor-suppressive property, MBP-1 and its downstream targets have been investigated as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for various cancers. In plants, MBP-1 plays an integral role in regulating growth and development, fertility and abiotic stress responses. A better understanding of the functions and regulatory factors of MBP-1 in plants may advance current efforts to maximize plant resistance against drought, high salinity, low temperature, and oxidative stress, thus optimizing land use and crop yields. In this review article, we summarize the research advances in biological functions and mechanistic pathways underlying MBP-1, describe our current knowledge of the ENO product and propose future research directions on vertebrate health as well as plant growth, development and abiotic stress responses.
