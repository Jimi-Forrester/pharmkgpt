19187555|t|Molecular mechanisms of traumatic brain injury: the missing link in management.
19187555|a| Head injury is common, sometimes requires intensive care unit admission, and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. A gap still remains in the understanding of the molecular mechanism of this condition. This review is aimed at providing a general overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury to a busy clinician. It will encompass the pathophysiology in traumatic brain injury including apoptosis, the role of molecules and genes, and a brief mention of possible pharmacological therapies.
