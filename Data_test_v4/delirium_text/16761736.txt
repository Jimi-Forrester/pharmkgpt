16761736|a|Dementia is characterized clinically by progressive cognitive decline, often with impairment of memory. The pathology of dementias is either focal as with infarcts in Vascular Dementia or diffuse as typified by Alzheimer's disease. In many cases of Alzheimer's disease there is a mixture of focal infarcts and diffuse changes. Diffuse pathology in dementias comprises mainly intracellular and extracellular protein deposits. Intracellular inclusions are of tau protein (Alzheimer's disease; and some frontotemporal dementias), alpha-synuclein (Dementia with Lewy bodies) and huntingtin (Huntington's disease). Soluble and insoluble peptides also accumulate in the extracellular spaces of brain parenchyma in dementias with diffuse pathology, mainly amyloid-beta (Abeta) in parenchymal plaques and in artery walls as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Alzheimer's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies). Insoluble prion protein (PrP) is deposited in brain parenchyma in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other insoluble amyloid peptides accumulate in brain and vessel walls infamilial dementias. The pattern of extracellular deposits in brain and artery walls suggests that there is a failure of elimination of peptides, such as Abeta along perivascular interstitial fluid drainage pathways ("lymphatics") from the aged brain and in Alzheimer's disease. Such failure may be due to reduced pulsations as arteries stiffen with age and cerebrovascular disease. Immunization against Abeta removes insoluble deposits of Abeta from brain parenchyma and may allow improved clearance of soluble Abeta. Reducing cerebrovascular disease and facilitating elimination of Abeta along perivascular drainage routes may offer long-term preventative measuresfor both Vascular Dementia and for Alzheimer's disease.
