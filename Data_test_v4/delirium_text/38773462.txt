38773462|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) results in brain injury, which is primarily caused by inflammation. Ac2-26 protects against ischemic or hemorrhage brain injury. The present study was to explore the effect and mechanism of Ac2-26 on brain injury in CPB rats. METHODS: Forty-eight rats were randomized into sham, CPB, Ac, Ac/AKT1, Ac/GSK3betai and Ac/AKT1/GSK3betaa groups. Rats in sham group only received anesthesia and in the other groups received standard CPB surgery. Rats in the sham and CPB groups received saline, and rats in the Ac, Ac/AKT1, Ac/GSK3betai and Ac/AKT1/GSK3betaa groups received Ac2-26 immediately after CPB. Rats in the Ac/AKT1, Ac/GSK3betai and Ac/AKT1/GSK3betaa groups were injected with shRNA, inhibitor and agonist of GSK3beta respectively. The neurological function score, brain edema and histological score were evaluated. The neuronal survival and hippocampal pyroptosis were assessed. The cytokines, activity of NF-kappaB, S100 calcium-binding protein beta(S100beta) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and oxidative were tested. The NLRP3, cleaved-caspase-1 and cleaved-gadermin D (GSDMD) in the brain were also detected. RESULTS: Compared to the sham group, all indicators were aggravated in rats that underwent CPB. Compared to the CPB group, Ac2-26 significantly improved neurological scores and brain edema and ameliorated pathological injury. Ac2-26 reduced the local and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress response and promoted neuronal survival. Ac2-26 reduced hippocampal pyroptosis and decreased pyroptotic proteins in brain tissue. The protection of Ac2-26 was notably lessened by shRNA and inhibitor of GSK3beta. The agonist of GSK3beta recovered the protection of Ac2-26 in presence of shRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Ac2-26 significantly improved neurological function, reduced brain injury via regulating inflammation, oxidative stress response and pyroptosis after CPB. The protective effect of Ac2-26 primarily depended on AKT1/ GSK3beta pathway.
