37488840|t|Are TrkB receptor agonists the right tool to fulfill the promises for a therapeutic value of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor?
37488840|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling via its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B regulates several crucial physiological processes. It has been shown to act in the brain, promoting neuronal survival, growth, and plasticity as well as in the rest of the body where it is involved in regulating for instance aspects of the metabolism. Due to its crucial and very pleiotropic activity, reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and alterations in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling have been found to be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological diseases. However, because of its poor bioavailability and pharmacological properties, brain-derived neurotrophic factor itself has a very low therapeutic value. Moreover, the concomitant binding of exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor to the p75 neurotrophin receptor has the potential to elicit several unwanted and deleterious side effects. Therefore, developing tools and approaches to specifically promote tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling has become an important goal of translational research. Among the newly developed tools are different categories of tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor agonist molecules. In this review, we give a comprehensive description of the different tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor agonist drugs developed so far and of the results of their application in animal models of several neurological diseases. Moreover, we discuss the main benefits of tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor agonists, concentrating especially on the new tropomyosin receptor kinase B agonist antibodies. The benefits observed both in vitro and in vivo upon application of tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor agonist drugs seem to predominantly depend on their general neuroprotective activity and their ability to promote neuronal plasticity. Moreover, tropomyosin receptor kinase B agonist antibodies have been shown to specifically bind the tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor and not p75 neurotrophin receptor. Therefore, while, based on the current knowledge, the tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor agonists do not seem to have the potential to reverse the disease pathology per se, promoting brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling still has a very high therapeutic relevance.
