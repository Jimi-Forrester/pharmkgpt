20480421|t|Validation of the Brazilian version of the quality of life scale for patients with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers (QOL-AD).
20480421|a|Quality of life (QOL) has been extensively studied in clinical trials and in research on chronic degenerative diseases and dementia. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity of the Brazilian version of the QOL scale in Alzheimer's disease (AD; QOL-AD). The QOL-AD was administered to 60 patients with mild or moderate AD and to their caregivers. The construct validation was accomplished through correlations amongst total scores of patients' and caregivers' reports on patients' quality of life (PQOL and C-PQOL, respectively), and data related to cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, functional performance, behavioral disturbances and a generic instrument of quality of life (WHOQOL-brief), as well as correlation of total score of caregivers' reports on their own quality of life (CQOL) with the measurements cited above, QOL-AD patient reports, and depressive symptoms. The reliability was high for PQOL, C-PQOL, and CQOL versions (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80, 0.83, and 0.86, respectively). We observed significant correlations in the construct validity of all three versions regarding the variables associated with the disease and also with WHOQOL-brief. The scale took, on average, six min for each version. The results indicate reliability and construct validity of the Brazilian version of the QOL-AD in the studied sample.
