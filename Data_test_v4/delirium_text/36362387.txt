36362387|t|Intersection of the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor, GPR19, with the Aging Process.
36362387|a|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the most functionally diverse classes of transmembrane proteins. GPCRs and their associated signaling systems have been linked to nearly every physiological process. They also constitute nearly 40% of the current pharmacopeia as direct targets of remedial therapies. Hence, their place as a functional nexus in the interface between physiological and pathophysiological processes suggests that GPCRs may play a central role in the generation of nearly all types of human disease. Perhaps one mechanism through which GPCRs can mediate this pivotal function is through the control of the molecular aging process. It is now appreciated that, indeed, many human disorders/diseases are induced by GPCR signaling processes linked to pathological aging. Here we discuss one such novel member of the GPCR family, GPR19, that may represent an important new target for novel remedial strategies for the aging process. The molecular signaling pathways (metabolic control, circadian rhythm regulation and stress responsiveness) associated with this recently characterized receptor suggest an important role in aging-related disease etiology.
