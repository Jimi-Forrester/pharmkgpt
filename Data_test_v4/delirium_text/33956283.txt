33956283|t|Platelet aggregometry for hip fracture surgery in patients treated with clopidogrel: a pilot study.
33956283|a|Surgery for hip fractures should be performed within 48 h from patient's admission. However, several factors including chronic antiplatelet therapy could delay operation. Among the totality of patients taking clopidogrel, up to 30% are resistant to the drug and have a normal platelets reactivity. We propose thromboelastography (TEG) with an ADP Platelet Mapping assay kit to assess platelet aggregation, a safe tool that could help to avoid surgery delay in those patients treated with antiplatelet therapy. A patient's blood sample was collected for aggregometry. If MA-ADP and platelets aggregation (%) were within normal values, the patient was fit for immediate surgery with neuraxial anesthesia and ultrasound-guided nerve block. If one of the two parameters or both were deranged, a mortality risk assessment was estimated. In the low risk category, the patients waited till normalization of the parameters, whereas in the high-risk group a general anesthesia and peripheral antalgic block was carried out. Nine patients were enrolled. Four of them showed normal aggregometry and surgery was performed within 24 h from admission. Two patients were classified as high mortality risk and surgery was carried out under general anesthesia. Three patients awaited operation till normalization of parameters. No peri or post-operative complications were reported. An aggregometry-guided protocol can safely expedite hip fracture surgery in patients taking clopidogrel. Nonetheless, in presence of a normal platelets function, clinician can opt for a neuraxial instead of general anesthesia reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction.Trial registration: prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04642209; date of registration: 23rd November 2020).
