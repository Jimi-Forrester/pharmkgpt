30534345|t|Miro1 - the missing link to peroxisome motility.
30534345|a|Peroxisomes are ubiquitous, highly dynamic, multifunctional compartments in eukaryotic cells, which perform key roles in cellular lipid metabolism and redox balance. Like other membrane-bound organelles, peroxisomes must move in the cellular landscape to perform localized functions, interact with other organelles and to properly distribute during cell division. However, our current knowledge of peroxisome motility in mammalian cells is still very limited. Recently, three independent studies have identified Miro1 as a regulator of peroxisome motility in mammalian cells. In these studies, the authors show that Miro1 is targeted to peroxisomes in several cell lines, in a process that relies on its interaction with the peroxisomal chaperone Pex19. Interestingly, however, different conclusions are drawn about which Miro1 isoforms are targeted to peroxisomes, how it interacts with Pex19 and most importantly, the type of motility Miro1 is regulating.
