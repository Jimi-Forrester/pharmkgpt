20921874|a|Impaired awareness of cognitive deficits is a common symptom of dementia, but its prognostic importance in people with cognitive impairment-no dementia (CIND) is uncertain. In this study, we examined whether community volunteers with CIND and reduced awareness had worse cognitive performance and cognitive decline over 18 months than CIND participants with intact awareness or healthy controls. We recruited 92 participants with CIND and 91 healthy controls with their respective informants. We used discrepancy scores (informant minus participant) on the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia and Dysexecutive Questionnaire to ascertain participants' awareness of their cognitive performance. The main cognitive outcome variable was the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale: Cognitive Section. Bivariate correlations showed no relationship between the awareness measures and cognitive performance or decline. Overall, CIND participants' ratings of cognitive deficits correlated significantly with their Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale: Cognitive Section score after 18-months (for Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia, r=0.45, P <0.001) and showed a stronger relationship with cognitive performance than informant ratings. These results indicate that reduced awareness of deficit may be uncommon in community volunteer samples with CIND. In addition, self-report of cognitive complaints may be at least as useful as informant report when screening community-dwelling older adults at risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
