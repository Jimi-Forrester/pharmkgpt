39917635|t|Brain health: A concern for anaesthesiologists and intensivists.
39917635|a|Damage to the brain can have disastrous and long-lasting consequences. The European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) is aware of the importance of taking good care of the brain, both of patients and of anaesthesia and intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, and has organised a complete learning track on brain health to bring this concern to the attention of practitioners. This learning track included an online Focus Meeting on Brain Health (November 25, 2023). We here provide readers with a digest of the information that was delivered during that meeting in an opinion paper driven by the authors' own reading of the literature. It is divided according to the meeting's sessions, including how to improve the health of an injured brain, how to keep a young or old brain healthy, how to keep a healthy adult brain unimpaired, how monitoring can impact brain health in the operating room and in the intensive care unit, and how to keep the anaesthesia and ICU caregivers' brain healthy. Each part is a brief and focused summary. The main delivered messages are that the management of injured brain patients involves an adequate choice of sedation, adequate brain monitoring, and focused attention to specific points depending on the underlying pathology; that several measures can be undertaken to protect the brain of the very young needing anaesthesia; that it is possible to detect older patients at risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorders, and that dedicated perioperative management by a multidisciplinary expert team may improve their outcomes; that apparently healthy adult brains may suffer during anaesthesia; that the electroencephalogram may track peri-operative brain dysfunction, and that female patients should be given special care in this respect; that multimodal brain monitoring helps to detect pathological processes and to maintain brain homeostasis; and that burnout in anaesthesiologists can be effectively fought using personal, organisational, managerial and legal approaches.
