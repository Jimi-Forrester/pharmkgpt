39079370|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed whether neuropathological markers of AD in the preclinical and prodromal stages are associated with polysomnographic changes and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, case-control study of older adults (>=60 years) without relevant clinical and psychiatric comorbidities selected randomly from a cohort of individuals without dementia in a tertiary university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. They underwent neuropsychological evaluation for clinical diagnosis and were allocated into two samples: cognitively unimpaired (CU) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Also, they underwent PET-PiB to determine the amyloid profile and all-night in-lab polysomnography. For each sample, we compared polysomnographic parameters according to the amyloid profile (A+ vs A-). RESULTS: We allocated 67 participants (mean age 73 years, SD 10,1), 70 % females, 14 +- 5 years of education, into two samples: CU (n = 28, 42.4 %) and MCI (n = 39, 57.6 %). In the CU sample, the group A+ (n = 9) showed worse sleep parameters than A- (n = 19) (lower total sleep time (p = 0.007), and sleep efficiency (p = 0.005); higher sleep onset latency (p = 0.025), wake time after sleep onset (p = 0.011), and arousal index (AI) (p = 0.007)), and changes in sleep structure: higher %N1 (p = 0.005), and lower %REM (p = 0.006). In the MCI sample, MCI A-had higher AI (p = 0.013), respiratory disturbance index (p = 0.025, controlled for age), and higher rates of severe OSA than A+. DISCUSSION: The amyloid profile was associated with polysomnographic markers of worse sleep quality in individuals with preclinical AD but not with prodromal AD, probably due to the higher frequencies of severe OSA.
