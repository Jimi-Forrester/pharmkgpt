35216882|t|A multi-disciplinary rehabilitation approach for people surviving severe COVID-19-a case series and literature review.
35216882|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused tremendous casualties and morbidities worldwide. Multisystem manifestations, including muscle weakness, dyspnea, cognitive decline, dysphagia, and dysarthria are frequently reported among critically ill patients. The resultant activity limitations and participation restrictions call for an organized and multidisciplinary approach to rehabilitation. Taiwan had a rapid surge in community infection cases from May to July 2021, and our team established a team-based approach in response to the rehabilitation needs for the in-patients, especially the critically-ill group. METHODS: We built a core treatment team and established a referral pathway for critically ill patients with COVID-19 based on a multidisciplinary approach. The care process and outcomes of a case series of patients who received in-patient rehabilitation after medical stabilization were presented. RESULTS: Our clinical care module was established according to interim World Health Organization guidance and current research and demonstrated a high degree of feasibility. Five patients with multiple impairments received in-patient rehabilitation and experienced significant functional improvement. We documented improvements in motor function, swallowing function, and activities of daily living after the rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Our clinical experience suggests considerable benefits can be obtained from a well-organized and multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach for severe COVID-19 patients.
