26896709|t|Systematic diversification of benzylidene heterocycles yields novel inhibitor scaffolds selective for Dyrk1A, Clk1 and CK2.
26896709|a|The dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) has gathered much interest as a pharmacological target in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it plays a role in malignant brain tumors as well. As both diseases are multi-factorial, further protein kinases, such as Clk1 and CK2, were proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis. We designed a new class of alpha-benzylidene-gamma-butyrolactone inhibitors that showed low micromolar potencies against Dyrk1A and/or Clk1 and a good selectivity profile among the most frequently reported off-target kinases. A systematic replacement of the heterocyclic moiety gave access to further inhibitor classes with interesting selectivity profiles, demonstrating that the benzylidene heterocycles provide a versatile tool box for developing inhibitors of the CMGC kinase family members Dyr1A/1B, Clk1/4 and CK2. Efficacy for the inhibition of Dyrk1A-mediated tau phosphorylation was demonstrated in a cell-based assay. Multi-targeted but not non-specific kinase inhibitors were also obtained, that co-inhibited the lipid kinases PI3Kalpha/gamma. These compounds were shown to inhibit the proliferation of U87MG cells in the low micromolar range. Based on the molecular properties, the inhibitors described here hold promise for CNS activity.
