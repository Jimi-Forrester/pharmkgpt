28621737|a|The Guan-Xin-Shu-Tong capsule (GXSTC) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that is used for the treatment of coronary heart disease. Despite its common use in China, basic pharmacological research on its active components is limited. A comprehensive analytical method using quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/MS), specifically with the Triple TOF 5600 platform, was developed to characterize the compounds in the GXSTC powder itself (in vitro) as well as the active components in healthy and heart disease model rats after its oral administration (in vivo). The 5600 platform was operated in both positive and negative ion modes, before the raw data were processed using the extracted ion chromatography (EIC), mass defect filtering (MDF) and fragment filtering (FF) techniques. With the aid of reference compounds for retention time and fragment ion comparisons, 18 compounds were unambiguously identified in vitro. An additional 56 other compounds were tentatively characterized using the accurate quasi-molecular ion mass and Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation pattern strategies. Among them, 30 compounds were characterized based on the MDF and FF approaches. Normal rats in addition to hyperlipidemic (HL) and acute blood stasis (ABS) model rats were given a single oral dose of GXSTC solution for subsequent blood analysis at 1 and 2 h after administration. A total of 24 prototypecomponents and 20 metabolites derived from GXSTC were differentially detected across the three animal groups, including the absence of four phase II phenolic acid metabolites in the ABS group and the presence of three diterpenoid-related metabolites exclusive to the HL group. The use of reference compounds as well as the mass defect and fragment-filtering strategies were critical to identify GXSTC compounds in vitro and in vivo. This can be used for further quality control and pharmacological studies aimed at characterizing the active and potential beneficial compounds of this ancient medicine.
