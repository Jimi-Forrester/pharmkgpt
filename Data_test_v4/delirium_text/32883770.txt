32883770|t|Early-onset dementia: key issues using a relationship-centred care approach.
32883770|a|People with early-onset dementia have a potential risk of being marginalised with respect to care and social support as a result of the blame and stigma associated with their condition, and because they have reduced access to treatment options and postdiagnostic care. The limited use of community services and the resulting psychological implications are two key issues facing the group and their caregivers. Early diagnosis, behavioural therapies such as talking therapy, meaningful Montessori activities and friendly community services tailored to meet the needs of people with early-onset dementia are relationship-centred care approaches that could be implemented in practice, using the 'Senses Framework' to promote an enriched supportive environment of care with zero tolerance for marginalisation and discriminatory tendencies. Support for caregivers is invaluable in controlling behavioural changes in people with early-onset dementia. A combined approach involving pharmacological and behavioural interventions could be used in severe mood and behavioural changes.
