30834309|t|Frontiers in Probing Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers with Fluorescent Small Molecules.
30834309|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The pathogenesis of the disease is associated with aggregated amyloid-beta, hyperphosphorylated tau, a high level of metal ions, abnormal enzyme activities, and reactive astrocytes. This outlook gives an overview of fluorescent small molecules targeting AD biomarkers for ex vivo and in vivo imaging. These chemical imaging probes are categorized based on the potential biomarkers, and their pros and cons are discussed. Guidelines for designing new sensing strategies as well as the desirable properties to be pursued for AD fluorescence imaging are also provided.
