32961928|t|Metabolomic Profiling in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Biomarker Discovery.
32961928|a|There is no specific test for diagnosing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a disabling autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Instead, diagnosis relies on ruling out other related disorders with overlapping clinical symptoms. An urgency for NMOSD biomarker discovery is underscored by adverse responses to treatment following misdiagnosis and poor prognosis following the delayed onset of treatment. Pathogenic autoantibiotics that target the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) contribute to NMOSD pathology. The importance of early diagnosis between AQP4-Ab+ NMOSD, MOG-Ab+ NMOSD, AQP4-Ab- MOG-Ab- NMOSD, and related disorders cannot be overemphasized. Here, we provide a comprehensive data collection and analysis of the currently known metabolomic perturbations and related proteomic outcomes of NMOSD. We highlight short chain fatty acids, lipoproteins, amino acids, and lactate as candidate diagnostic biomarkers. Although the application of metabolomic profiling to individual NMOSD patient care shows promise, more research is needed.
