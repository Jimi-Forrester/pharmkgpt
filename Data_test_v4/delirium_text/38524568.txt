38524568|a|Introduction: The improvement in oxygenation after helmet application in hypoxemic patients may be explained by the alveolar recruitment obtained with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or by the administration of a more accurate inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO2). We have designed the "ZEEP-PEEP test", capable to distinguish between the FiO2-related or PEEP-related oxygenation improvement. Our primary aim was to describe the use of this test during helmet CPAP to assess the oxygenation improvement attributable to PEEP application. Material and methods: We performed a prospective physiological study including adult critically ill patients. Respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were recorded before helmet application (PRE step), after helmet application without PEEP (ZEEP step) and after the application of the PEEP valve (PEEP step), while maintaining a constant FiO2. We defined as "PEEP responders" patients showing a PaO2/FiO2 ratio improvement >=10% after PEEP application. Results: 93 patients were enrolled. Compared to the PRE step, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly improved during helmet CPAP both at ZEEP and PEEP step (189 +- 55, 219 +- 74 and 241 +- 82 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.01). Both PEEP responders (41%) and non-responders showed a significant improvement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio after the application of helmet at ZEEP, PEEP responders also showed a significant improvement of oxygenation after PEEP application (208 +- 70 vs 267 +- 85, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Helmet CPAP improved oxygenation. This improvement was not only due to the PEEP effect, but also to the increase of the effective inspired FiO2. Performing the ZEEP-PEEP test may help to identify patients who benefit from PEEP.
