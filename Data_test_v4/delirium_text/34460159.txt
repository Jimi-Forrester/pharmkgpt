34460159|a|OBJECTIVE: To search for objective diagnostic criteria for the development of delirium tremens (DT) based on physiological and metabolic parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The total number of patients was 506, including 393 patients with DT and 113 patients with uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome (UAWS). Twenty clinical and metabolic indicators were analyzed statistically using comparison of means, logistic regression and ROC-analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia and tachycardia are most prognostically significant indicators, changes in which are observed in the development of DT. These indicators can serve as the basis for objective diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome complicated by delirium.
