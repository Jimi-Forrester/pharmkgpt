39345543|a|Enhancing protein O-GlcNAcylation by pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is explored as a strategy to decrease tau and amyloid-beta phosphorylation, aggregation, and pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is still more to be learned about the impact of enhancing global protein O-GlcNAcylation, which is important for understanding the mechanistic path of using OGA inhibition to treat AD. In this study, we investigated the acute effect of pharmacologically increasing O-GlcNAc levels, using OGA inhibitor Thiamet G (TG), on normal mouse brains. We hypothesized that the transcritome signature in respones to TG treatment provides a comprehensive view of the effect of OGA inhibition. We sacrificed the mice and dissected their brains after 3 hours of saline or 50 mg/kg TG treatment, and then performed mRNA sequencing using NovaSeq PE 150 (n=5 each group). We identified 1,234 significant differentially expressed genes with TG versus saline treatment. Functional enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes identified several upregulated pathways, including genes normally down in AD. Among the downregulated pathways were the cell adhesion pathway as well as genes normally up in AD and aging. When comparing acute to chronic TG treatment, protein autophosphorylation and kinase activity pathways were upregulated, whereas cell adhesion and astrocyte markers were downregulated in both datasets. Interestingly, mitochondrial genes and genes normally down in AD were up in acute treatment and down in chronic treatment. Data from this analysis will enable the evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the potential benefits of OGA inhibition in the treatment of AD. In particular, although OGA inhibitors are promising to treat AD, their downstream chronic effects related to bioenergetics may be a limiting factor. Abstract Figure:
