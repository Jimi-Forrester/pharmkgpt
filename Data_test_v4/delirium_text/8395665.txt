8395665|t|Screening for the APP codon 670/671 mutations in Alzheimer's disease.
8395665|a|A mutation at codons 670 and 671 of exon 16 of the amyloid precursor protein has recently been identified as a cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Using restriction enzyme digestion, screening failed to reveal the occurrence of this mutation in 43 families with early onset, 31 families with late onset, 30 cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease or 30 clinically normal individuals.
