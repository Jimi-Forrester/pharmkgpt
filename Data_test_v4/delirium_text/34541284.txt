34541284|a|INTRODUCTION: Large studies on cognitive profiles of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD-MCI) compared to Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) are rare. METHODS: Data from two multicenter cohort studies in AD and PD were merged using a unified base rate approach for the MCI diagnosis. Cognitive profiles were compared using scores derived from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease battery. RESULTS: Patients with AD-MCI showed lower standardized scores on all memory test scores and a language test. Patients with PD-MCI showed lower standardized scores in a set-shifting measure as an executive task. A cross-validated logistic regression with test scores as predictors was able to classify 72% of patients correctly to AD-MCI versus PD-MCI. DISCUSSION: The applied test battery successfully discriminated between AD-MCI and PD-MCI. Neuropsychological test batteries in clinical practice should always include a broad spectrum of cognitive domains to capture any cognitive changes.
