38422003|t|A cluster-randomized controlled trial of a nurse-led artificial intelligence assisted prevention and management for delirium (AI-AntiDelirium) on delirium in intensive care unit: Study protocol.
38422003|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication among intensive care unit (ICU) patients that is linked to negative clinical outcomes. However, adherence to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS guidelines), which recommend the use of the ABCDEF bundle, is sub-optimal in routine clinical care. To address this issue, AI-AntiDelirium, a nurse-led artificial intelligence-assisted prevention and management tool for delirium, was developed by our research team. Our pilot study yielded positive findings regarding the use of AI-AntiDelirium in preventing patient ICU delirium and improving activities of daily living and increasing intervention adherence by health care staff. METHODS: The proposed large-scale pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, cluster randomized controlled study will assess the impact of AI-AntiDelirium on the incidence of ICU delirium and delirium-related outcomes. Six ICUs in two tertiary hospitals in China will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an AI-AntiDelirium or a PADIS guidelines group. A target sample size of 1,452 ICU patients aged 50 years and older treated in the ICU for at least 24 hours will be included. The primary outcome evaluated will be the incidence of ICU delirium and the secondary outcomes will be the duration of ICU delirium, length of ICU and hospital stay, ICU and in-hospital mortality rates, patient cognitive function, patient activities of daily living, and ICU nurse adherence to the ABCDEF bundle. DISCUSSION: If this large-scale trial provides evidence of the effectiveness of AI-AntiDelirium, an artificial intelligence-assisted system tool, in decreasing the incidence of ICU delirium, length of ICU and hospital stay, ICU and in-hospital mortality rates, patient cognitive function, and patient activities of daily living while increasing ICU nurse adherence to the ABCDEF bundle, it will have a profound impact on the management of ICU delirium in both research and clinical practice.
