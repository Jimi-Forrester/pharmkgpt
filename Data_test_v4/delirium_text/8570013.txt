8570013|a|The effect of systemic and local administration of metrifonate (MTF), a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEl) on extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) was investigated in the rat cortex by using transcortical microdialysis. Metrifonate (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, s.c.) increased ACh levels in a dose-dependent manner above the baseline. Two consecutive administrations (80 mg/kg) enhanced ACh levels producing two similar patterns of elevation. A significant increase in NE was also seen at 80 mg/kg. Systemic administration (20 mg/kg) of MTF produced a significant increase of DA levels. Local cortical perfusion of MTF through the probe caused a significant but slow increase of ACh as well as an increase of NE levels. Compared to NE, the elevation of DA was more rapid and more long-lasting. The cortical levels of 5-HT were not modified by MTF given by either route. These results support the concept of MTF being a potential drug for treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD).
