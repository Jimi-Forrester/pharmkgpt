32663030|t|Tracking Internal and Global Diffusive Dynamics During Protein Aggregation by High-Resolution Neutron Spectroscopy.
32663030|a|Proteins can misfold and form either amorphous or organized aggregates with different morphologies and features. Aggregates of amyloid nature are pathological hallmarks in so-called protein conformational diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Evidence prevails that the transient early phases of the reaction determine the aggregate morphology and toxicity. As a consequence, real-time monitoring of protein aggregation is of utmost importance. Here, we employed time-resolved neutron backscattering spectroscopy to follow center-of-mass self-diffusion and nano- to picosecond internal dynamics of lysozyme during aggregation into a specific beta-sheet rich superstructure, called particulates, formed at the isoelectric point of the protein. Particulate formation is found to be a one-step process, and protein internal dynamics, to remain unchanged during the entire aggregation process. The time-resolved neutron backscattering spectroscopy approach developed here, in combination with standard kinetics assays, provides a unifying framework in which dynamics and conformational transitions can be related to the different aggregation pathways.
