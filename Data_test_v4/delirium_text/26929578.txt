26929578|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is an international public health problem since ancient days. The condition is predominantly more severe in developing countries like India where, life is more sedentary due to the even changing lifestyles in this fast-paced global scenario. Thespesia populnea is widely used in the ayurvedic system of medicine for treatment of diabetes mellitus in India for years. The aim of this work is to explore the anti-diabetic activity of the isolated compound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sesquiterpene isolated from hexane fraction of bark of T. populnea modified synthetically then identified by using analytical techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance spectra for confirmation and the anti-diabetic activity was evaluated by anti-hyperglycemic, hypoglycemic potential. RESULT: In the present work, we have studied the anti-hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic activity of the vanadium complex in glucose loaded and normal animals were shown significantly decreased in plasma blood glucose level. The results derived from preclinical studies confirm the potential of new sesquiterpene. CONCLUSION: The findings could provide evidence regarding the anti-diabetic potential of T. populnea by lowering blood glucose level. SUMMARY: Thespesia populnea is widely used in the ayurvedic system of medicine for treatment of diabetes in India. Present study aimed to explore the anti diabetic potential of isolated compound. Isolation of sesquiterpene from hexane fraction of bark of Thespesia populnea and modified synthetically then authenticated by using analytical techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance spectra for confirmation. The modified complex was further assessed for its anti diabetic property in glucose loaded rats. Vanadium complex demonstrated significant reduction in plasma blood glucose level in glucose loaded animals. The results derived from preclinical studies confirm the potential of new sesquiterpene. The present findings conclude that anti diabetic potential of Thespesia populnea could be due to lowering blood glucose level by acting on PPAR-gamma receptor.
