The purpose is to explore their bidirectional association, underpinned by common pathological processes such as aging, genetic factors, inflammation, and estrogen deficiency. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances have shown promise in treating both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis by targeting disease-specific proteins and bone metabolism regulators. Monoclonal antibodies against beta-amyloid and tau for AD, as well as RANKL and sclerostin for osteoporosis, have displayed therapeutic potential. Additionally, ongoing research has identified neuroinflammatory genes shared between AD and osteoporosis, offering insight into the interconnected inflammatory mechanisms. This knowledge opens avenues for innovative dual-purpose therapies that could address both conditions, potentially revolutionizing treatment approaches for AD and osteoporosis simultaneously. This review underscores the potential for groundbreaking advancements in early diagnosis and treatment by unraveling the intricate connection between AD and bone health. It advocates for a holistic, patient-centered approach to medical care that considers both cognitive and bone health, ultimately aiming to enhance the overall well-being of individuals affected by these conditions. This review article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts designed to determine the utility of using artificial intelligence for writing scientific reviews.
