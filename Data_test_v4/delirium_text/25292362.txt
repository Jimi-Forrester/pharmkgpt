25292362|a|Our previous study demonstrated that an olfactory bulbectomy in rats induced short-term, multifaceted, devastating Alzheimer's-like effects, which included cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, hyperthermia, and increased levels of homocysteine and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A. In addition, the rats exhibited an increase in the hyperphosphorylation of brain Tau proteins and in the number of neurofibrillary tangles. Here, we examined the long-term effects of the surgery and found that olfactory bulbectomy also rendered the rats to become anemic with brain iron overload. Additionally, a significant reduction in the membrane fluidity index in frontal cortex synaptosomes was found. Treatment with a mixture of n - 3/n - 6 of fatty acids restored the unwanted effect. The beneficial effects of fatty acids are mediated via the effects of fatty acids on the neuronal membrane structure and fluidity. These findings are similar to Alzheimer's symptoms, which suggest this model can be used as an animal model for Alzheimer's disease. We recommend using this model to scan potential new anti-Alzheimer's drugs.
