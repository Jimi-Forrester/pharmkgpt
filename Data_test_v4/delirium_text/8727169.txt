8727169|a|Aggressive behavior is thought to be pervasive among and devastating to demented patients and their caregivers. This study investigated the prevalence of physical aggression in demented inpatients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Additionally, the characteristics and psychiatric symptoms that may be associated with aggression were tested. Forty-seven patients with probable AD were included in this study. Physical aggression was reported in 27 (57.4%) of the patients. These patients were older, had a later onset of dementia, and had a higher prevalence of misidentification, activity disturbances, and day/night disturbance. The relationship between these factors and physical aggression needs further clarification, which may help provide effective predictors and treatment of the aggressive behavior.
