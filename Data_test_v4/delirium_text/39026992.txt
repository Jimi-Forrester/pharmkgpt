39026992|t|ACOT7, a candidate and novel serum biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.
39026992|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common fatal neurodegenerative disease among the elderly worldwide, characterized by memory and cognitive impairment. The identification of biomarkers for AD is crucial and urgent to facilitate the diagnosis and intervention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of acyl-Coenzyme A thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) as a serum biomarker for the prediction of AD. In our study, we observed a significant increase in ACOT7 expression in patients (n = 366) with AD and animal (n = 8-12) models of AD, compared to the control group. A significant negative correlation was found between ACOT7 levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (r = -0.85; p < 0.001). The analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for ACOT7 was 0.83 (95% confidence intervals: 0.80-0.86). The optimal cut-off point of 62.5 pg./mL was selected with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy of serum ACOT7 for AD was 77% (95% confidence intervals: 72-82%), with a sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence intervals: 75-84%) and a specificity of 74% (95% confidence intervals: 69-79%). Moreover, the ROC analysis showed that the AUC of Abeta42/40 ratio is 0.70, and the diagnostic accuracy was 72%, with 69% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Compared with the AD traditional marker Abeta42/40 ratio, ACOT7 shows better superiority as a new serum candidate biomarker of AD. By suppressing the ACOT7 gene, our study provides evidence of the involvement of ACOT7 in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in alterations in the expression levels of Abeta42, BACE1 and betaCTF. ACOT7 has the ability to modulate the amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism, while it does not have an impact on the non-amyloidogenic pathway. In conclusion, the findings of our study suggest that serum ACOT7 may serve as a promising and non-invasive biomarker for AD.
