Based on the implementation of major social distancing measures, March 6, 2020, was set as a cutoff time point to categorize aggressive events into pre-COVID and post-COVID groups. Data was analyzed using Chi-square tests and general linear modeling. The p-value was set at <=0.05. RESULTS: After the implementation of social distancing measures, there was a decrease in the absolute number of inpatient aggressive events from 15.0/week to 12.6/week (mean difference: 2.4/week, p=0.032). However, this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in hospital census. There was a decrease in the proportion of seven-day and 14-day post-admission aggressive events by 5.4% and 12.1%, respectively. Concurrently, there was a 4.9% increase in recurrent aggression. Emergency psychiatric medication administration and the use of physical restraint decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous results, this study reports a decrease in the incidence of inpatient aggression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures can be utilized as a tool to decrease the incidence of inpatient aggression and the use of physical restraints.
