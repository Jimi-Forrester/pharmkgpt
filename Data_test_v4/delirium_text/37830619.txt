37830619|t|UCHL1 Regulates Radiation Lung Injury via Sphingosine Kinase-1.
37830619|a|GADD45a is a gene we previously reported as a mediator of responses to acute lung injury. GADD45a-/- mice express decreased Akt and increased Akt ubiquitination due to the reduced expression of UCHL1 (ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme, while GADD45a-/- mice have increased their susceptibility to radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). Separately, we have reported a role for sphingolipids in RILI, evidenced by the increased RILI susceptibility of SphK1-/- (sphingosine kinase 1) mice. A mechanistic link between UCHL1 and sphingolipid signaling in RILI is suggested by the known polyubiquitination of SphK1. Thus, we hypothesized that the regulation of SphK1 ubiquitination by UCHL1 mediates RILI. Initially, human lung endothelial cells (EC) subjected to radiation demonstrated a significant upregulation of UCHL1 and SphK1. The ubiquitination of EC SphK1 after radiation was confirmed via the immunoprecipitation of SphK1 and Western blotting for ubiquitin. Further, EC transfected with siRNA specifically for UCHL1 or pretreated with LDN-5744, as a UCHL1 inhibitor, prior to radiation were noted to have decreased ubiquitinated SphK1 in both conditions. Further, the inhibition of UCHL1 attenuated sphingolipid-mediated EC barrier enhancement was measured by transendothelial electrical resistance. Finally, LDN pretreatment significantly augmented murine RILI severity. Our data support the fact that the regulation of SphK1 expression after radiation is mediated by UCHL1. The modulation of UCHL1 affecting sphingolipid signaling may represent a novel RILI therapeutic strategy.
