2025423|a|A German family with 21 members affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) was studied clinically and genetically. The diagnosis was histologically verified in three affected family members. Ancestors were traced through seven generations to a couple residing in East-Westfalia during the middle of the 19th century. Dementia was often accompanied by extrapyramidal features and myoclonus. No cases of Down syndrome or hematologic malignancy occurred in this family. Clinical manifestations, temporal progression, neurological testing, and neuropathological features do not differ from the more common sporadic form of AD. The inheritance pattern is most consistent with autosomal-dominant transmission.
