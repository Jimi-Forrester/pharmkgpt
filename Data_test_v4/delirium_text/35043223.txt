35043223|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) share pathological and clinical similarities while differing in the timing and severity of motor cognitive and visual impairment. Previous EEG studies found abnormal neural oscillations in PD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease, however, the electrophysiological signature of clinical symptoms is still unclear. We assessed the specificity of event-related oscillations in distinguishing between cognitive, motor and visual involvement in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. METHODS: EEG was recorded during a visual oddball task in 30 PD, 28 DLB, 30 MCI patients and 32 age-matched healthy controls. Target and non-target event-related power were examined in the time-frequency domain using complex Morlet wavelet convolution and compared within and between the study groups. RESULTS: MCI (z = - 1.8, p = 0.04, Cohen's d = - 0.5) and DLB (z = - 3.1, p < 0.001, d = - 1.0) patients showed decreased delta-band target event-related synchronization compared to participants with normal cognition. PD (z = 1.6, p = 0.05, d = 0.5) and DLB (z = 2.7, p < 0.01, d = 0.9) patients showed decreased beta suppression compared to MCI patients and controls. DLB patients with visual hallucinations (VH) showed decreased early-alpha suppression (z = 2.08, p = 0.019, d = 3.19, AUC = 1.0 +- 0.0) compared to DLB-VH-. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased event-related delta-band synchronization, reflecting a decline in information processing ability, was characteristic of cognitive impairment due to any cause. Decreased event-related beta suppression, reflecting impaired execution of motor action, was specific to PD and DLB. Decreased event-related early-alpha suppression was characteristic of the presence of VH in DLB. These findings show that specific oscillations may reflect specific clinical symptoms, being a marker of network dysfunction.
