31523435|t|Phenolic acid phenethylesters and their corresponding ketones: Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and stability in human blood and HepaRG cells.
31523435|a|5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalyzes the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, potent lipid mediators involved in inflammatory diseases, and both 5-LO and the leukotrienes are validated therapeutic targets. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is an effective inhibitor of 5-LO and leukotriene biosynthesis but is susceptible to hydrolysis by esterases. In this study a number of CAPE analogues were synthesized with modifications to the caffeoyl moiety and the replacement of the ester linkage with a ketone. Several new molecules showed better inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis than CAPE in isolated human neutrophils and in whole blood with IC50 values in the nanomolar (290-520 nmol/L) and low micromolar (1.0-2.3 micromol/L) ranges, respectively. Sinapic acid and 2,5-dihydroxy derivatives were more stable than CAPE in whole blood, and ketone analogues were degraded more slowly in HepaRG hepatocyte cultures than esters. All compounds underwent modification consistent with glucuronidation in HepaRG cultures as determined using LC-MS/MS analysis, though the modified sinapoyl ketone (10) retained 50% of its inhibitory activity after up to one hour of incubation. This study has identified at least one CAPE analogue, compound 10, that shows favorable properties that warrant further in vivo investigation as an antiinflammatory compound.
