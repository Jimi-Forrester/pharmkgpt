38933674|a|Aim: The anticholinergic properties of medications are associated with poorer cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Numerous scales have been developed to assess anticholinergic burden and yet, there is no consensus indicating which anticholinergic burden scale is more relevant for patients with schizophrenia. We aimed to identify valid scales for estimating the risk of iatrogenic cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Methods: We identified 27 scales in a literature review. The responses to neuropsychological tests of 839 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in the FACE-SZ database were collected between 2010 and 2021. We estimated the association between objective global cognitive performance and the 27 scales, the number of psychotropic drugs, and chlorpromazine and lorazepam equivalents in bivariable regressions in a cross-sectional design. We then adjusted the bivariable models with covariates: the predictors significantly associated with cognitive performance in multiple linear regressions were considered to have good concurrent validity to assess cognitive performance. Results: Eight scales, the number of psychotropic drugs, and drug equivalents were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. The number of psychotropic drugs, the most convenient predictor to compute, was associated with worse executive function (Standardized beta = -0.12, p = .004) and reasoning (Standardized beta = -0.08, p = .037). Conclusion: Anticholinergic burden, the number of psychotropic drugs, and drug equivalents were weakly associated with cognition, thus suggesting that cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is explained by factors other than medication. The number of psychotropic drugs was the most parsimonious method to assess the risk of iatrogenic cognitive impairment.
