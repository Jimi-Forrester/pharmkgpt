28677119|a|Extracellular ATP plays important roles in coordinating the activities of astrocytes and neurons, and aberrant signalling is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In rodents, ATP stimulates opening of Ca2+ -permeable channels formed by P2X receptor subunits in the plasma membrane. It is widely assumed, but not verified, that P2X receptors also evoke Ca2+ signals in human astrocytes. Here, we directly assess this hypothesis. We showed that cultured foetal cortical human astrocytes express mRNA for several P2X receptor subunits (P2X4 , P2X5 , P2X6 ) and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (P2Y1 , P2Y2 , P2Y6 , P2Y11 ). In these astrocytes, ATP stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through IP3 receptors and store-operated Ca2+ entry. These responses were entirely mediated by P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors. Agonists of P2X receptors did not evoke Ca2+ signals, and nor did ATP when Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and store-operated Ca2+ entry were inhibited. We conclude that ATP-evoked Ca2+ signals in cultured human foetal astrocytes are entirely mediated by P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors, with no contribution from P2X receptors.
