30927497|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders (VASCOG) criteria for vascular cognitive disorders were published in 2014, but their concurrent and predictive validity have not been examined. METHODS: Participants (N = 165, aged 49-86 years) were from Sydney Stroke Study, a longitudinal study of post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia. Diagnoses using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke - Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN), the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), criteria for vascular dementia (VaD) were made by consensus at multidisciplinary case conferences. Diagnoses for mild vascular cognitive disorder (mVCD) and VaD using VASCOG, DSM-5 and the Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS) criteria were made by two study authors. Agreement levels between criteria sets were examined using Cohen's kappa (kappa). The ability of VaD diagnoses to predict mortality over 10 years and of mVCD to predict dementia over 5 years was investigated. RESULTS: The VASCOG criteria yielded rates of mVCD slightly lower than for DSM-5 and VICCCS. VaD rates were similar for all criteria, although slightly lower for DSM-IV. Agreement between the VASCOG, VICCCS and DSM-5 criteria was excellent for VaD and mVCD (kappa = 0.83-1.0), but lower for VaD between VASCOG and the other criteria (kappa = 0.47-0.63). VaD-based mortality predictions were similar for the VASCOG, VICCCS and DSM-5 criteria, and higher than those for other criteria. The prediction of incident dementia within 5 years from mVCD was slightly lower with VASCOG criteria than with DSM-5 and VICCCS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The VASCOG criteria have greater sensitivity, modest concurrent validity and better predictive validity than older criteria for VaD, but are comparable to DSM-5 and VICCCS criteria. Their operationalization and inclusion of a mild VCD category make them useful for clinical and research applications.
