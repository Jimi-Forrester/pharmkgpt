In turn, COVID-19 could trigger mental disease relapse. Vaccinations lead to a reduction of infections and the prevention of severe courses. This work aims to survey the willingness of individuals with affective disorders to get vaccinated and concerns about vaccinations. METHODS: An online study (April-May 2021) assessed the current infection and vaccination rate amongst individuals with affective disorder in Austria by surveying attitudes towards the vaccination, the willingness to get vaccinated soon and possible reasons for decision. The analyses included 59 individuals with affective disorders and 59 healthy controls, matched for sex and age. RESULTS: There was an overall high willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Individuals with affective disorders were more skeptical about vaccinations in general but there was no significant difference between the groups in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. In both groups reasons for waiting were mainly fears of acute and/or long-term side effects and the fast development of the vaccines. LIMITATIONS: It was a cross sectional design. Due to the online design, no objective rating of current psychopathological symptoms was assessed. Willingness to get vaccinated in general and against COVID-19 in particular were self-created variables, whereas item statistics and factor analysis were conducted. DISCUSSION: Because of the higher risk for individuals with affective disorders, preventive strategies like vaccinating should be promoted in this group. It is important to help individuals with AD to overcome barriers such as negative beliefs and concerns about acute and/or long-term side effects.
