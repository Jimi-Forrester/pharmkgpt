35624949|t|Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Enhances Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early/Mid Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
35624949|a|Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) i a non-invasive brain stimulation which is considered to have the potential to improve cognitive impairment in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, previous studies have been controversial on the therapeutic effect of tDCS. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of tDCS on cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and mild-to-moderate AD. Five databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, were searched with relative terms to extract the cognitive function changes measured by an objective cognitive scale in the included studies. The meta-analysis results showed that, compared with sham tDCS treatment, the overall cognitive function of patients with AD and MCI was significantly improved (weighted mean difference = 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 1.66; p = 0.004) after tDCS treatment, but the behavioral symptoms, recognition memory function, attention and executive function were not significantly improved. The subgroup analysis showed that the treatment would be more efficacious if the temporal-lobe-related brain areas were stimulated, the number of stimulations was greater than or equal to 10 and the current density was 2.5 mA/cm2. Among them, AD patients benefited more than MCI patients. No cognitive improvement was observed in patients with MCI or AD at different follow-up times after treatment. Our meta-analysis provided important evidence for the cognitive enhancement of tDCS in patients with MCI and mild-to-moderate AD and discussed its underlying mechanisms.
