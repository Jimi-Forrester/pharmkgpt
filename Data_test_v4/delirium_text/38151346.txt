38151346|a|Extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau are the predominant pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence demonstrates a critical role of a variety of small GTPases, namely Ras-related proteins (Rabs), in the pathogenesis of AD. As crucial regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, alteration in Rab protein expression and function represents one of the primary factors contributing to the abnormal membrane trafficking in AD. Additionally, the Rab GTPases are also involved in the development of Abeta, tau and other pathological changes associated with AD. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review on the primary functions of multiple Rab proteins and their involvement in the pathogenesis of AD.
