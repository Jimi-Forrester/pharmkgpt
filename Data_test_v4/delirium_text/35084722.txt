35084722|t|The New Frontier of Perioperative Cognitive Medicine for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.
35084722|a|This is a review of preoperative cognitive assessment and other healthcare gaps in the care of older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) who have elected surgery with anesthesia. It summarizes concerns regarding ADRD perioperative healthcare, perioperative cognitive, and neuronal domains of vulnerability. It also offers a plan for phased preoperative cognitive screening and perioperative cognitive intervention opportunities. An argument is made for why medical professionals in the perioperative setting need fundamental training in cognitive-behavioral principles, an understanding of neurodegenerative diseases of aging, and an appreciation of the immediate and long-term medical risks for such patients undergoing anesthesia. The author's goal is to encourage readers to consider perioperative cognitive medicine as a new frontier for generating evidence-based care approaches for at-risk older adults with neurodegenerative disorders who require procedures with anesthesia.
