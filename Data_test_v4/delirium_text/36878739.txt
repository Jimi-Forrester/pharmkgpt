36878739|a|INTRODUCTION: Electronic health record (EHR) usability, defined as the extent to which the system can be used to complete tasks, can influence patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between EHR usability and postsurgical outcomes of older adults with dementia including 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of linked American Hospital Association, Medicare claims data, and nurse survey data was conducted using logistic regression and negative binominal models. RESULTS: The dementia population who received care in hospitals with better EHR usability were less likely to die within 30 days of their admission following surgery compared to hospitals with poorer EHR usability (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.91, p = 0.001). EHR usability was not associated with readmission or LOS. DISCUSSION: Better nurse reported EHR usability has the potential to reduce mortality rates among older adults with dementia in hospitals.
