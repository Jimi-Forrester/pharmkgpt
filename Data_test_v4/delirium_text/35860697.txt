35860697|t|Neurovascular Coupling in Type 2 Diabetes With Cognitive Decline. A Narrative Review of Neuroimaging Findings and Their Pathophysiological Implications.
35860697|a|Type 2 diabetes causes substantial long-term damage in several organs including the brain. Cognitive decline is receiving increased attention as diabetes has been established as an independent risk factor along with the identification of several other pathophysiological mechanisms. Early detection of detrimental changes in cerebral blood flow regulation may represent a useful clinical marker for development of cognitive decline for at-risk persons. Technically, reliable evaluation of neurovascular coupling is possible with several caveats but needs further development before it is clinically convenient. Different modalities including ultrasound, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance are used preclinically to shed light on the many influences on vascular supply to the brain. In this narrative review, we focus on the complex link between type 2 diabetes, cognition, and neurovascular coupling and discuss how the disease-related pathology changes neurovascular coupling in the brain from the organ to the cellular level. Different modalities and their respective pitfalls are covered, and future directions suggested.
