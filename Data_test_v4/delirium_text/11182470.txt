11182470|a|Decreased levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 is a diagnostic marker of Alzheimer's disease. To clarify the biological basis of this marker, the physiological alterations of CSF Abeta40 and Abeta42 by aging were studied. CSF samples from 92 normal subjects between 8 and 89 years old were measured using a specific ELISA for Abeta40 and Abeta42(43). High concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42(43) in the young group, under 29 years old, changed to be at low concentrations in the adult group between 30 and 59 years old. Subsequently, the levels increased again with age. Third order regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the levels of Abeta40 and age (Y = - 169 X(3) + 3.1X(2)- 0.02X + 4135; P < 0.034) and between the levels of Abeta42(43) and age (Y = - 46 X(3) + 0.9 X(2)- 0.005X + 992; P < 0.005). The levels of CSF Abeta40 and Abeta42(43) were physiologically regulated to show a U-shaped natural course in normal aging. These findings suggested that the physiological increase of Abeta42(43) over 59 years of age is selectively inhibited in Alzheimer's disease.
