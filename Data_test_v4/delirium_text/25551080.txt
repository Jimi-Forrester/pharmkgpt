25551080|t|Acute thrombotic occlusion of left internal jugular vein compressed by bypass graft for thoracic endovascular aortic repair debranching procedure.
25551080|a|Thoracic endovascular aortic repair has become a widespread alternative treatment option for thoracic aortic aneurysm. The debranching of arch vessels may be required to provide an acceptable landing zone for an endovascular stent graft. We report a case where the bypass graft used in the thoracic endovascular aortic repair procedure compressed the left internal jugular vein, causing acute thrombotic occlusion.
