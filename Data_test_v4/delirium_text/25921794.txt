25921794|t|Kinetic analysis of IgG antibodies to beta-amyloid oligomers with surface plasmon resonance.
25921794|a|Surface plasmon resonance was used to investigate the kinetics, affinity, and specificity of binding between anti-Abeta (beta-amyloid) IgG antibodies and oligomeric Abeta. Two factors were needed to accurately characterize the IgG binding kinetics. First, a bivalent model was necessary to properly fit the kinetic association and dissociation sensograms. Second, a high concentration of IgG was necessary to overcome a significant mass transport limitation that existed regardless of oligomer density on the sensor surface. Using high IgG concentrations and bivalent fits, consistent kinetic parameters were found at varying sensor surface ligand densities. A comparison of binding specificity, affinity, and kinetic flux between monoclonal and natural human anti-Abeta IgG antibodies revealed the following findings. First, monoclonal antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 single-site binding affinity is similar between Abeta oligomers and monomers. Second, natural human anti-Abeta IgG binding readily binds Abeta oligomers but does not bind monomers. Third, natural human anti-Abeta IgG binds Abeta oligomers with a higher affinity and kinetic flux than 6E10 and 4G8. Both the current analytical methodology and antibody binding profiles are important for advances in antibody drug development and kinetic biomarker applications for Alzheimer's disease.
