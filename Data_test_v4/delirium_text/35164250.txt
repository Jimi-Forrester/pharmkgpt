35164250|a|It is not easy to find data in the scientific literature on the quantitative content of individual phytochemicals. It is possible to find groups of compounds and even individual compounds rather easily, but it is not known what their concentration is in cultivated or wild plants. Therefore, the subject of this study was to determine the content of individual compounds in the new Paulownia species, Oxytree, developed in a biotechnology laboratory in 2008 at La Mancha University in Spain. Six secondary metabolites were isolated, and their chemical structure was confirmed by spectral methods. An analytical method was developed, which was then used to determine the content of individual compounds in leaves, twigs, flowers and fruits of Paulownia Clon in Vitro 112 . No flavonoids were found in twigs and fruits of Oxytree, while the highest phenylethanoid glycosides were found in twigs. In this study, we also focused on biological properties (anticoagulant or procoagulant) of extract and four fractions (A-D) of different chemical composition from Paulownia Clon in Vitro 112 leaves using whole human blood. These properties were determined based on the thrombus-formation analysis system (T-TAS), which imitates in vivo conditions to assess whole blood thrombogenecity. We observed that three fractions (A, C and D) from leaves decrease AUC10 measured by T-TAS. In addition, fraction D rich in triterpenoids showed the strongest anticoagulant activity. However, in order to clarify the exact mechanism of action of the active substances present in this plant, studies closer to physiological conditions, i.e., in vivo studies, should be performed, which will also allow to determine the effects of their long-term effects.
