34497432|a|The gut microbiome is a complex microbial community, recognized for its potential role in physiology, health, and disease. The available evidence supports the role of gut dysbiosis in pancreatic disorders, including acute pancreatitis (AP). In AP, the presence of gut barrier damage resulting in increased mucosal permeability may lead to translocation of intestinal bacteria, necrosis of pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue, and infection, often accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Preserving gut microbial homeostasis may reduce the systemic effects of AP. A growing body of evidence suggests the possible involvement of the gut microbiome in various pancreatic diseases, including AP. This review discusses the possible role of the gut microbiome in AP. It highlights AP treatment and supplementation with prebiotics, synbiotics, and probiotics to maintain gastrointestinal microbial balance and effectively reduce hospitalization, morbidity and mortality in an early phase. It also addresses novel therapeutic areas in the gut microbiome, personalized treatment, and provides a roadmap of human microbial contributions to AP that have potential clinical benefit.
