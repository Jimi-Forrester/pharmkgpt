30043115|t|18F-florbetaben whole-body PET/MRI for evaluation of systemic amyloid deposition.
30043115|a|BACKGROUND: Florbetaben, a 18F-labeled stilbene derivative (Neuraceq , formerly known as BAY-949172), is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical developed to visualize beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Here, we report a pilot study evaluating patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis for systemic extent of disease. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled nine patients, 61-86 year old (mean +- SD 69.4 +- 8.6), referred from the cardiac amyloid clinic. First, dynamic imaging of the heart was acquired immediately after injection of 222-318.2 MBq (mean +- SD 270.1 +- 33.3) of 18F-florbetaben using the GE SIGNA PET/MRI. This was followed by a whole-body PET/MRI scan 60-146.4 min (mean +- SD 98 +- 33.4) after injection. Cardiac MRI sequences included ECG-triggered cine SSFP, T2-weighted, and late gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Whole-body MRI sequences included MRAC and axial T1-weighted imaging. RESULTS: High early uptake and delayed high uptake in the left ventricle correlated with amyloid deposition in five patients, while low uptake on early and delayed cardiac imaging was noted in four patients. Cardiac function measurements were successfully obtained in all participants. Areas of increased abnormal 18F-florbetaben accumulation were noted on delayed whole-body imaging in the bone marrow (seven patients), stomach (diffuse in five patients and focal in one patient), brain (five patients), salivary glands (three patients), tongue (three patients), spleen (three patients), skeletal muscles (three patients), ocular muscles (two patients), thyroid (two patients), pleura (two patients), kidneys (two patients), and lungs (two patients). CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body 18F-florbetaben PET/MRI is promising for localization of systemic amyloid deposition. This technique may provide important structural and functional information regarding the organs involved by disease, with potential to guide biopsy and evaluate response to treatment.
