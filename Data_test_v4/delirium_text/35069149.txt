35069149|t|Altered Structural and Functional MRI Connectivity in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Related Cognitive Impairment: A Review.
35069149|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with cognitive impairment in many domains. There are several pieces of evidence that changes in neuronal neuropathies and metabolism have been observed in T2DM. Structural and functional MRI shows that abnormal connections and synchronization occur in T2DM brain circuits and related networks. Neuroplasticity and energy metabolism appear to be principal effector systems, which may be related to amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, although there is no unified explanation that includes the complex etiology of T2DM with cognitive impairment. Herein, we assume that cognitive impairment in diabetes may lead to abnormalities in neuroplasticity and energy metabolism in the brain, and those reflected to MRI structural connectivity and functional connectivity, respectively.
