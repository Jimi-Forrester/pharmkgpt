30423197|t|Hospital-Associated Complications of Older People: A Proposed Multicomponent Outcome for Acute Care.
30423197|a|OBJECTIVES: To propose a new multicomponent measure of hospital-associated complications of older people (HAC-OP) and evaluate its validity in a large hospital sample. DESIGN: Observational study using baseline (pre-intervention) data from the Collaboration for Hospitalised Elders Reducing the Impact of Stays in Hospital cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Acute medical and surgical wards in 4 hospitals in Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older (mean age 76, 48% female) with a hospital stay of 72 hours or longer (N=434). MEASUREMENTS: We developed a multicomponent measure including 5 well-recognized hospital-associated complications of older people: hospital-associated delirium, functional decline, incontinence, falls, and pressure injuries. To evaluate construct validity, we examined associations with common risk factors (aged >=75, functional impairment, cognitive impairment, history of falls). To evaluate predictive validity, we examined the association between length of stay, facility discharge, and 6-month mortality and any HAC-OP and total number of HAC-OP. RESULTS: Overall, 192 (44%) participants had 1 or more HAC-OP during their admission. Any HAC-OP was strongly associated with the proposed shared risk factors, and there was a strong and graded association between HAC-OP and length of stay (9.1+-7.4 days for any HAC-OP vs 6.8 +-4.1 days with none, p < .001), facility discharge (59/192 (31%) vs 27/242 (11%), p < .001) and 6-month mortality (26/192 (14%) vs 17/242 (7%), p = .02). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of construct and predictive validity of the proposed measure of HAC-OP as a potential outcome measure for research investigating and improving hospital care of older people.
