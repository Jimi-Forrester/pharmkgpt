9605480|t|Alteration of myo-inositol monophosphatase in Alzheimer's disease brains.
9605480|a|myo-Inositol monophosphatase (E.C.3.1.3.25) catalyzes the hydrolysis of myo-inositol 1-phosphate in the presence of Mg2+ at a physiologic pH to form free myo-inositol, maintaining a supply that represents the precursor for inositol phospholipid second messenger signaling systems. In the present study the activity and protein level of myo-inositol monophosphatase were investigated in samples from normal human and Alzheimer's disease (AD) postmortem brains. The separation profile on Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography revealed one major form of myo-inositol monophosphatase in crude extracts from both normal human and AD brains. In AD brains myo-inositol monophosphatase activity and its protein level were significantly higher than in control brains. The activity of myo-inositol monophosphatase per enzyme molecule was similar in control and AD brains. These results suggest that myo-inositol monophosphatase is upregulated in AD, probably reflecting compensatory mechanisms concerned with phospholipid metabolism.
