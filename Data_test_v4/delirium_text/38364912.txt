38364912|t|Unveiling the future: Advancements in MRI imaging for neurodegenerative disorders.
38364912|a|Neurodegenerative disorders represent a significant and growing global health challenge, necessitating continuous advancements in diagnostic tools for accurate and early detection. This work explores the recent progress in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques and their application in the realm of neurodegenerative disorders. The introductory section provides a comprehensive overview of the study's background, significance, and objectives. Recognizing the current challenges associated with conventional MRI, the manuscript delves into advanced imaging techniques such as high-resolution structural imaging (HR-MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission tomography-MRI (PET-MRI) fusion. Each technique is critically examined regarding its potential to address theranostic limitations and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the underlying pathology. A substantial portion of the work is dedicated to exploring the applications of advanced MRI in specific neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In addressing the future landscape, the manuscript examines technological advances, including the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in neuroimaging. The conclusion summarizes key findings, outlines implications for future research, and underscores the importance of these advancements in reshaping our understanding and approach to neurodegenerative disorders.
