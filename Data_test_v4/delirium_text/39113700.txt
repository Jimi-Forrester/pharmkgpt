39113700|t|Single-cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Ferroptosis as The Most Enriched Programmed Cell Death Process in Hemorrhage Stroke-induced Oligodendrocyte-mediated White Matter Injury.
39113700|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe stroke subtype with limited therapeutic options. Programmed cell death (PCD) is crucial for immunological balance, and includes necroptosis, pyroptosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necrosis. However, the distinctions between these programmed cell death modalities after ICH remain to be further investigated. We used single-cell transcriptome (single-cell RNA sequencing) and spatial transcriptome (spatial RNA sequencing) techniques to investigate PCD-related gene expression trends in the rat brain following hemorrhagic stroke. Ferroptosis was the main PCD process after ICH, and primarily affected mature oligodendrocytes. Its onset occurred as early as 1 hour post-ICH, peaking at 24 hours post-ICH. Additionally, ferroptosis-related genes were distributed in the hippocampus and choroid plexus. We also elucidated a specific interaction between lipocalin-2 (LCN2)-positive microglia and oligodendrocytes that was mediated by the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1)/CSF1 receptor pathway, leading to ferroptosis induction in oligodendrocytes and subsequent neurological deficits. In conclusion, our study highlights ferroptosis as the primary PCD mechanism, emerging as early as 1 hour post-ICH. Early therapeutic intervention via the suppression of microglial LCN2 expression may alleviate ferroptosis-induced damage in oligodendrocytes and associated neurological deficits, thus offering a promising neuroprotective strategy following ICH.
