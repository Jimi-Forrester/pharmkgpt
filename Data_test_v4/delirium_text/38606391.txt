38606391|t|Acoustic and Text Features Analysis for Adult ADHD Screening: A Data-Driven Approach Utilizing DIVA Interview.
38606391|a|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly seen in childhood that leads to behavioural changes in social development and communication patterns, often continues into undiagnosed adulthood due to a global shortage of psychiatrists, resulting in delayed diagnoses with lasting consequences on individual's well-being and the societal impact. Recently, machine learning methodologies have been incorporated into healthcare systems to facilitate the diagnosis and enhance the potential prediction of treatment outcomes for mental health conditions. In ADHD detection, the previous research focused on utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which require costly equipment and trained personnel for data collection. In recent years, speech and text modalities have garnered increasing attention due to their cost-effectiveness and non-wearable sensing in data collection. In this research, conducted in collaboration with the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, we gathered audio data from both ADHD patients and normal controls based on the clinically popular Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA). Subsequently, we transformed the speech data into text modalities through the utilization of the Google Cloud Speech API. We extracted both acoustic and text features from the data, encompassing traditional acoustic features (e.g., MFCC), specialized feature sets (e.g., eGeMAPS), as well as deep-learned linguistic and semantic features derived from pre-trained deep learning models. These features are employed in conjunction with a support vector machine for ADHD classification, yielding promising outcomes in the utilization of audio and text data for effective adult ADHD screening. Clinical impact: This research introduces a transformative approach in ADHD diagnosis, employing speech and text analysis to facilitate early and more accessible detection, particularly beneficial in areas with limited psychiatric resources. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: The successful application of machine learning techniques in analyzing audio and text data for ADHD screening represents a significant advancement in mental health diagnostics, paving the way for its integration into clinical settings and potentially improving patient outcomes on a broader scale.
