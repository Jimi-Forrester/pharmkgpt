35155747|t|Socio-Ecologic Perspective: Barriers Complicating Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Mitigation.
35155747|a|Objective:Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a phenomenon whereby survivors of an intensive care unit (ICU) admission subsequently experience issues with physical, cognitive, or mental health status persisting beyond the acute hospitalization. Risk factors for developing PICS include prolonged mechanical ventilation with sedation and immobility. PICS is a devastating illness that negatively alters the life path of many individuals with tremendous economic impact. Methods: This qualitative study employed a grounded theory approach to understand the systemic barriers blocking mitigation and treatment of PICS in all seven ICUs across Essex County, New Jersey (NJ) through semi-scripted interviews conducted with 11 members of the healthcare teams with at least one from each site. Thematic analysis was performed with open, axial, and selective coding. Results: Applying socio-ecologic viewpoint to data illustrate significant barriers on both an interpersonal and organizational level that decrease the operationalization of PICS mitigation measures as identified by healthcare providers. Of those interviewed, eight (73%) were physicians and the remaining were nurses. Significant thematic issues included understanding the risk factors of PICS but feeling powerless to institute mitigation efforts; experiencing lack of enthusiasm due to the absence of institutionalized mitigation protocols; noting frustration about closing the gap between academic recommendations and the ability to operationalize these appropriately; and feeling unable to effectuate meaningful change. Conclusion: Providing education to the target population and healthcare provider stakeholders regarding the barriers against PICS mitigation can alter the status quo.
