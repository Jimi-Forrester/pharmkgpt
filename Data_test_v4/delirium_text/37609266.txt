37609266|t|Crystal Structure of Histone Deacetylase 6 Complexed with ( R )-Lipoic Acid, an Essential Cofactor in Central Carbon Metabolism.
37609266|a|The enzyme cofactor ( R )-lipoic acid plays a critical role in central carbon metabolism due to its catalytic function in the generation of acetyl-CoA, which links glycolysis with the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This cofactor is also essential for the generation of succinyl CoA within the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the biological functions of ( R )-lipoic acid extend beyond metabolism owing to its facile redox chemistry. Most recently, the reduced form of ( R )-lipoic acid, ( R )-dihydrolipoic acid, has been shown to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs) with selectivity for the inhibition of HDAC6. Here, we report the 2.4 A-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the HDAC6-( R )-dihydrolipoic acid complex, and we report a dissociation constant (K D ) of 350 nM for this complex as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The crystal structure illuminates key affinity determinants in the enzyme active site, including thiolate-Zn 2+ coordination and S-pi interactions in the F583-F643 aromatic crevice. This study provides the first visualization of the connection between HDAC function and the biological response to oxidative stress: the dithiol moiety of ( R )-dihydrolipoic acid can serve as a redox-regulated pharmacophore capable of simultaneously targeting the catalytic Zn 2+ ion and the aromatic crevice in the active site of HDAC6.
