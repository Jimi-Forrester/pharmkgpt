38393067|t|Influence of Nutrient Deprivation on the Antioxidant Capacity and Chemical Profile of Two Diatoms from Genus Chaetoceros.
38393067|a|The limited availability of phosphate, nitrogen and silicon in the growth media affects the growth, cellular processes, and metabolism of diatoms. Silicon deficiency primarily affects diatom morphology, while phosphate deficiency reduces the production of nucleic acids and phospholipids. Differences in pigment and protein composition are mainly due to nitrogen deficiency. In this study, Chaetoceros socialis and Chaetoceros costatus were cultured under phosphate, nitrogen, and silicon deprivation conditions. The diatom biomass was collected during the stationary growth phase and extracted with 70% ethanol under ultrasonication. The chemical profiles of the extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry with electrospray ionisation (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS), while the antioxidant capacity was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. Pigments, fatty acids, sterols, and derivatives were detected in both species. The total phenolic content in the extracts ranged from 46.25 +- 1.08 to 89.38 +- 6.21 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L and from 29.58 +- 1.08 to 54.17 +- 1.18 mg GAE/L. for C. costatus and C. socialis, respectively. Antioxidant activity was higher in C. costatus extracts, especially those obtained from nitrogen-deprived media. The results of this study contribute to the existing knowledge and the ongoing efforts to overcome application and commercialization barriers of microalgae for wide-ranging potential in different industries.
