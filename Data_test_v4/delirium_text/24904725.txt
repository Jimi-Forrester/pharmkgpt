24904725|a|OBJECTIVES: Bacopa monnieri (BM), a traditional ayurvedic medicine, is a well-known memory enhancer. We have explored the role of BM against decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE-209)-induced alterations in neonate and young female mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were orally administered with B. monnieri at the doses of 40, 80 or 120 mg/kg body weight along with PBDE-209 (20 mg/kg body weight) from postnatal day (PND) 3-10. Levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were measured at both ages. The correct choices and reference/working memory errors of young mice were evaluated by Morris water and radial arm maze. RESULTS: The results showed that BM at the dose of 120 mg/kg significantly (P<0.05) restored the levels of oxidants and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in frontal cortex and hippocampus of neonates against PBDE-209-induced toxicity. CONCLUSION: BM plays a neuroprotective role against PBDE-209-induced alterations in oxidative status.
