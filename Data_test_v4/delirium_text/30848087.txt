30848087|t|The internal link of serum steroid hormones levels in insomnia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease rats: Is there an effective way to distinguish among these three diseases based on potential biomarkers?
30848087|a|Insomnia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease are all neurodegenerative diseases and are associated with the levels of steroid hormones. To investigate the internal connection and difference of steroid hormones among these three diseases and distinguish them from the perspective of biomarkers, an easy, quick, and efficient high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated to determine six steroid hormones simultaneously in rat serum. The separation was accomplished on a SHIM-PACK XR-ODS chromatographic column with 0.1% v/v formic acid and methanol as the mobile phase and the detection was performed with electrospray ionization source in the positive ion mode. Based on the concentrations of steroid hormones, all the groups could be distinguished obviously from each other by using partial least square discriminant analysis. Meanwhile, 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, and cortisol were identified as potential biomarkers and 100% of samples were classified correctly by Bayes' discriminant function. These biomarkers were further screened by one-way analysis of variance and cortisol was significantly different among all these groups. Bayes' discriminant function was also built by cortisol and the classification accuracy was 87.2%. This workflow including determination of steroid hormones and discrimination among three neurological diseases would provide a basis for further clinical studies.
