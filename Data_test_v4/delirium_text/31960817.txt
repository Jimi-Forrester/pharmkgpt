31960817|a|Neurocognitive dysfunction is a common postoperative complication, especially in older adult patients. Fingolimod (FTY720) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that has been found to be neuroprotective in several animal models of central nervous system disease. However, few reports have examined whether FTY720 could mitigate postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we investigated whether FTY720 could prevent postoperative neurocognitive impairment in mice subjected to D-galactose-induced aging. We induced an accelerated model of aging by administering an intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose. Subsequently, we performed a partial hepatolobectomy under sevoflurane anesthesia. FTY720 (1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 3 hours before and 24 hours after anesthesia and surgery. Our results indicated that anesthesia and surgery significantly impaired spatial memory in the Y-maze test 6 hours after surgery. We also found that problem solving ability and long-term memory in the puzzle box test on postoperative days 2-4 were significantly improved by FTY720 treatment. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot assay demonstrated that FTY720 significantly inhibited microglial activation in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice 6 hours and 3 days after anesthesia, and down-regulated the expression of synaptic-related proteins postsynaptic density protein 95 and GluR2 in the hippocampus. These results indicate that FTY720 improved postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction in mice subjected to D-galactose-induced aging. This study was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University of China (approval No. LLSC (LA) 2016-025) on September 27, 2016.
