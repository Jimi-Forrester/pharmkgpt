2680009|a|Since the discovery of a significant depletion of acetylcholine in discrete areas of the brain of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease, attempts at symptomatic therapy have concentrated on acetylcholine supplementation, an approach that is based upon the efficacy of dopaminergic supplementation therapy for Parkinson's disease. Choline, then lecithin, used orally, failed to improve symptoms but the hypothesis that long-term choline supplementation might stabilize the course of Alzheimer's disease remains to be tested. Nerve growth factor may also offer that possibility. Bethanechol administered intracerebroventricularly did not help when a fixed dose was used but individual titration of more selective muscarinic agonists may prove more effective. In this article we report that tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA), given together with highly concentrated lecithin, appears to bring improvement in cognition and in functional autonomy using the Mini Mental State and the Rapid Disability Rating Scale-2 respectively, without change in behavior as reflected by the Behave-AD. Double-blind cross-over studies are in progress to establish its efficacy. Improvement in study design and means of assessment of cognition, functional autonomy and behavior have been made possible by these drug trials.
