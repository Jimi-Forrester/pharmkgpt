38168196|t|Dysregulation of innate immune signaling in animal models of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
38168196|a|Background: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by hypomorphic loss of function in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. SMA presents across broad spectrum of disease severity. Unfortunately, vertebrate models of intermediate SMA have been difficult to generate and are thus unable to address key aspects of disease etiology. To address these issues, we developed a Drosophila model system that recapitulates the full range of SMA severity, allowing studies of pre-onset biology as well as late-stage disease processes. Results: Here, we carried out transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of mild and intermediate Drosophila models of SMA to elucidate molecules and pathways that contribute to the disease. Using this approach, we elaborated a role for the SMN complex in the regulation of innate immune signaling. We find that mutation or tissue-specific depletion of SMN induces hyperactivation of the Immune Deficiency (IMD) and Toll pathways, leading to overexpression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and ectopic formation of melanotic masses in the absence of an external challenge. Furthermore, knockdown of downstream targets of these signaling pathways reduced melanotic mass formation caused by SMN loss. Importantly, we identify SMN as a negative regulator of an ubiquitylation complex that includes Traf6, Bendless and Diap2, and plays a pivotal role in several signaling networks. Conclusions: In alignment with recent research on other neurodegenerative diseases, these findings suggest that hyperactivation of innate immunity contributes to SMA pathology. This work not only provides compelling evidence that hyperactive innate immune signaling is a primary effect of SMN depletion, but it also suggests that the SMN complex plays a regulatory role in this process in vivo. In summary, immune dysfunction in SMA is a consequence of reduced SMN levels and is driven by cellular and molecular mechanisms that are conserved between insects and mammals.
