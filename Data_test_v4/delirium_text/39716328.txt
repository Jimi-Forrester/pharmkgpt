39716328|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between anti-diabetic agents and the risks of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Literature retrieval was conducted in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrial.gov between January 1995 and October 2024. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with T2D, which intercompared anti-diabetic agents or compared them with placebo, and reported the incidence of dementia were included. Conventional and network meta-analyses of these studies were implemented. Results were exhibited as the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 41 observational studies (3,307,483 participants) and 23 RCTs (155,443 participants) were included. In the network meta-analysis of observational studies, compared with non-users, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) (OR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.45 to 0.69), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) (OR = 0.58, 95%CI, 0.46 to 0.73), thiazolidinedione (TZD) (OR = 0.68, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.81) and metformin (OR = 0.89, 95%CI, 0.80 to 0.99) treatments were all associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) evaluation conferred a rank order as SGLT-2i > GLP-1RA > TZD > dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) > metformin > alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) > glucokinase activator (GKA) > sulfonylureas > glinides > insulin in terms of the cognitive benefits. Meanwhile, compared with non-users, SGLT-2i (OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.62), GLP-1RA (OR = 0.54, 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.96) and DPP-4i (OR = 0.73, 95%CI, 0.57 to 0.93) were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease while a lower risk of vascular dementia was observed in patients receiving SGLT-2i (OR = 0.42, 95%CI, 0.22 to 0.80) and TZD (OR = 0.52, 95%CI, 0.36 to 0.75) treatment. In the network meta-analysis of RCTs, the risks of dementia were comparable among anti-diabetic agents and placebo. CONCLUSION: Compared with non-users, SGLT-2i, GLP-1RA, TZD and metformin were associated with the reduced risk of dementia in patients with T2D. SGLT-2i, and GLP-1RA may serve as the optimal choice to improve the cognitive prognosis in patients with T2D.
