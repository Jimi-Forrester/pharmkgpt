1647634|t|[Objective criteria of the severity of the alcohol abstinence syndrome and delirium].
1647634|a|Overall 467 male patients suffering from stage II and stage II-III chronic alcoholism were examined. Of these, 80 patients (17.1%) were with the abstinent syndrome, 66 (14.1%) had the abstinent convulsive syndrome, 251 (53.8%) were with alcoholic delirium and 80 (14.9%) making up a control group were in a state of remission. Noticeable disorders were revealed in enzymatic activity of the liver (hyperfermentemia) coupled with characteristic changes in proteolytic activity. The degree of disorders in enzymic function of the liver and of the proteolytic system correlates with the severity of the psychopathological syndrome, which suggests the existence of the common component underlying the development of the pathogenetic mechanism in abstinent patients and in those with alcoholic delirium. The alcoholic abstinent syndrome and delirium are stages of the common pathological process.
