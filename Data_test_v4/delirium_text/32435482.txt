METHODS: Data from 195 patients were retrospectively analysed and applied to three models of interest: the Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, the Age-Adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity. The performance of these models was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve as well as logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 83 years and 69% were women. Ten percent of patients were deceased by 30 days, 25% at 6 months and 31% at 12 months post-operatively. While there was no statistically significant difference between the models, the Age-Adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index had the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for within 30 day and 12 month mortality, while the Nottingham Hip Fracture Score was largest for 6-month mortality. There was no evidence to suggest that the models were selecting a specific subgroup of our population, therefore, no indication was present to suggest that using multiple models would improve mortality prediction. CONCLUSIONS: While there was no statistically significant difference in mortality prediction, the Nottingham Hip Fracture Score is perhaps the best suited clinically, due to its ease of implementation. Larger prospective data collection across a variety of sites and its role in guiding clinical management remains an area of interest.
