35860850|t|Brain-immune interaction mechanisms: Implications for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.
35860850|a|OBJECTIVES: Cognitive dysfunction has been identified as a major symptom of a series of psychiatric disorders. Multidisciplinary studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is monitored by a two-way interaction between the neural and immune systems. However, the specific mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in immune response and brain immune remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review, we summarized the relevant research to uncover our comprehension of the brain-immune interaction mechanisms underlying cognitive decline. RESULTS: The pathophysiological mechanisms of brain-immune interactions in psychiatric-based cognitive dysfunction involve several specific immune molecules and their associated signaling pathways, impairments in neural and synaptic plasticity, and the potential neuro-immunological mechanism of stress. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, this review may provide a better theoretical basis for integrative therapeutic considerations for psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction.
