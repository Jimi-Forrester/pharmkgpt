36056839|a|Dementia is a global health concern owing to its complexity, which also poses a great challenge to pharmaceutical scientists and neuroscientists. The global dementia prevalence is approximately 47 million, which may increase by three times by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. AD is a severe age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by short-term memory loss, aphasia, mood imbalance, and executive function. The etiology of AD is still unknown, and the exact origin of the disease is still under investigation. Aggregation of Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques or neurotoxic Abetao oligomers outside the neuron is the most common cause of AD development. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by beta secretase and gamma secretase produces abnormal Abeta monomers. This aggregation of Abeta and NFT is promoted by various genes like BACE1, ADAM10, PIN1, GSK-3, APOE, PPARalpha, etc. Identification of these genes can discover several therapeutic targets that can be useful in studying pathogenesis and underlying treatments. Melatonin modulates the activities of these genes, thereby reducing Abeta production and increasing its clearance. Melatonin also reduces the expression of APP by attenuating cAMP, thereby enhancing the non-amyloidogenic process. Present communication explored and discussed the neuroprotective role of melatonin against Abeta-dependent AD pathogenesis. The manuscript also discussed potential molecular and genetic mechanisms of melatonin in the production and clearance of Abeta that could ameliorate neurotoxicity.
