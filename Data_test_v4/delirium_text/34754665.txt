34754665|t|Acute COVID-19 Cerebellitis: A Rare Neurological Manifestation of COVID-19 Infection.
34754665|a|The COVID-19 virus is well known to cause respiratory tract infections but several non-respiratory presentations and post-infectious complications have been well reported since its origin. With this case report, we present a rare manifestation of COVID-19 infection that presented as acute cerebellitis. This is a case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male patient who presented with altered mental status and ataxia. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection about five days prior to presenting to the hospital. Neurological exam was consistent with cerebellar symptoms like broad bases gait, truncal ataxia and subsequent imaging revealed white matter degeneration and edema of the cerebellar hemispheres. The symptoms completely resolved following treatment of ongoing COVID-19 infection with corticosteroids and intravenous remdesivir. With this case report, we intend to discuss the available literature regarding the clinical manifestations, management, and prognosis of COVID-19-induced cerebellitis.
