33329128|a|Background: Several studies had examined the association between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism and methamphetamine (METH) use disorder, whereas the results were conflicting. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to achieve a pooled effect size of the association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and METH use disorder. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to July, 2020. All relevant studies on the relationship of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and METH addiction were retrieved. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated in the dominant, recessive, co-dominant, and allele model to appraise the association. Results: Seven case-control studies with a total of 2,204 subjects (956 METH-dependent cases and 1,248 healthy controls) were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed a significant correlation between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and METH dependence in overall population under different genetic models. However, subgroup analysis indicated that the association only existed in Han Chinese but not in other Asian populations. Conclusion: Although the current data indicate that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism might be a potential genetic factor for METH use disorder, more researches are needed to prove its role in different populations.
