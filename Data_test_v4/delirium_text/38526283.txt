38526283|a|JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202419110-00027/figure1/v/2024-03-08T184507Z/r/image-tiff Amyloid-beta-induced neuronal cell death contributes to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Citri Reticulatae Semen has diverse beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, however, the effect of Citri Reticulatae Semen on Alzheimer's disease remains unelucidated. In the current study, the anti-apoptotic and autophagic roles of Citri Reticulatae Semen extract on amyloid-beta-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells were first investigated. Citri Reticulatae Semen extract protected PC12 cells from amyloid-beta-induced apoptosis by attenuating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio via activation of autophagy. In addition, Citri Reticulatae Semen extract was confirmed to bind amyloid-beta as revealed by biolayer interferometry in vitro, and suppress amyloid-beta-induced pathology such as paralysis, in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. Moreover, genetically defective Caenorhabditis elegans further confirmed that the neuroprotective effect of Citri Reticulatae Semen extract was autophagy-dependent. Most importantly, Citri Reticulatae Semen extract was confirmed to improve cognitive impairment, neuronal injury and amyloid-beta burden in 3xTg Alzheimer's disease mice. As revealed by both in vitro and in vivo models, these results suggest that Citri Reticulatae Semen extract is a potential natural therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease via its neuroprotective autophagic effects.
