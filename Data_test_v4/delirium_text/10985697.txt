10985697|a|Some pathological similarities between Alzheimer's disease and muscle diseases with rimmed vacuoles (RV) have been pointed out. For example, several pathological hallmark proteins have been reported to be immunopositive in the lesions of both diseases. Since apoptotic processes or primary DNA damage are suggested to play a role in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease, we examined DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and single-strand breaks (SSB) in the muscle biopsy specimens of several diseases, including muscle diseases with RV. Although no DSB-positive myonuclei were detected in any muscles examined, the number of SSB-positive myonuclei markedly increased in the muscles from cases with polymyositis and muscle diseases with RV. In polymyositis, SSB-positive myonuclei were observed in regenerating fibers and muscle fibers in the vicinity of inflammatory infiltrates, suggesting that the increase of SSB is due to muscle fiber regeneration following necrosis and inflammation. In muscle diseases with RV, however, SSB-positive myonuclei were observed in small angulated fibers and in morphologically normal fibers, regardless of necrosis, regeneration or inflammation. These findings suggest that muscle diseases with RV may share a common pathological process involving DNA damage.
