28643795|t|The genomic landscape of tuberous sclerosis complex.
28643795|a|Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease causing multisystem growth of benign tumours and other hamartomatous lesions, which leads to diverse and debilitating clinical symptoms. Patients are born with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and somatic inactivation of wild-type alleles drives MTOR activation; however, second hits to TSC1/TSC2 are not always observed. Here, we present the genomic landscape of TSC hamartomas. We determine that TSC lesions contain a low somatic mutational burden relative to carcinomas, a subset feature large-scale chromosomal aberrations, and highly conserved molecular signatures for each type exist. Analysis of the molecular signatures coupled with computational approaches reveals unique aspects of cellular heterogeneity and cell origin. Using immune data sets, we identify significant neuroinflammation in TSC-associated brain tumours. Taken together, this molecular catalogue of TSC serves as a resource into the origin of these hamartomas and provides a framework that unifies genomic and transcriptomic dimensions for complex tumours.
