37282582|t|Tau Positron Emission Tomography and Neurocognitive Function Among Former Professional American-Style Football Players.
37282582|a|American-style football (ASF) players experience repetitive head impacts which may result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change (CTE-NC). At present, a definitive diagnosis of CTE-NC requires the identification of localized hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) after death via immunohistochemistry. Some studies suggest that positron emission tomography (PET) with the radiotracer (18F)-Flortaucipir (FTP) may be capable of detecting p-Tau and thus establishing a diagnosis of CTE-NC among living former ASF players. To assess associations between FTP, football exposure, and objective neuropsychological measures among former professional ASF players, we conducted a study that compared former professional ASF players to age-matched male control participants without repetitive head impact exposure. Former ASF players and male controls underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and PET using FTP for p-Tau and [11C]-PiB for amyloid-beta. Former players underwent neuropsychological testing. ASF exposure was quantified as age at first exposure, professional career duration, concussion signs and symptoms burden, and total years of any football play. Neuropsychological testing included measures of memory, executive functioning, and depression symptom severity. P-Tau was quantified as FTP standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) and [11C]-PiB by distribution volume ratios (DVR) using cerebellar grey matter as the reference region. There were no significant differences in [18F]-FTP uptake among former ASF players (N=27, age=50+-7 years) compared to control participants (N=11, age=55+-4 years), nor did any participant have significant amyloid-beta burden. Among ASF participants, there were no associations between objective measures of neurocognitive functioning and [18F]-FTP uptake. However, there was a marginally significant difference between [18F]-FTP uptake isolated to the entorhinal cortex among players in age-, position-, and race-adjusted models (p=0.05) which may represent an area of future investigation. The absence of increased [18F]-FTP uptake in brain regions previously implicated in CTE among former professional ASF players compared to controls questions the utility of [18F]-FTP PET for clinical evaluation in this population.
