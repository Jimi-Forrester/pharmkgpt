37109156|t|Cardiovascular and Neurological Complications of COVID-19: A Narrative Review.
37109156|a|A novel coronavirus emerged in China in late 2019 as a disease named coronavirus disease 2019. This pathogen was initially identified as causing a respiratory syndrome, but later, it was found that COVID-19 could also affect other body systems, such as the neurological and cardiovascular systems. For didactic purposes, cardiovascular and neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 have been classified in three different groups: acute complications, late complications, and post-vaccine complications. Therefore, the following study has the goal to summarize and disseminate the present knowledge about the cardiovascular and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 based on the latest and most up-to-date data available and, thus, promote more prepared medical care for these conditions as the medical team is updated. Based on what is brought on this revision and its understanding, the medical service becomes more aware of the causal relationship between some conditions and COVID-19 and can better prepare for the most prevalent conditions to associate and, consequently, to treat patients earlier. Therefore, there is a chance of better prognoses in this context and the need to increase the number of studies about complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection for a better understanding of other associated conditions.
