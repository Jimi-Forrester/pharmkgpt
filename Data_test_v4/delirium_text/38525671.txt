METHODS: Retrospective clinical-pathologic study of 282 participants with Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and known TDP-43 status. We evaluated item-level performance on the 60-item BNT for first and last available assessment. We fit cross-sectional negative binomial count models that assessed total number of incorrect items, number correct of responses with phonemic cue (reflecting retrieval difficulties), and number of "I don't know" (IDK) responses (suggestive of loss of word knowledge) at both assessments. Models included TDP-43 status and adjusted for sex, age, education, years from test to death, and ADNC severity. Models that evaluated the last assessment adjusted for number of prior BNT exposures. RESULTS: 43% were TDP-43+. The TDP-43+ group had worse performance on BNT total score at first (p = .01) and last assessments (p = .01). At first assessment, TDP-43+ individuals had an estimated 29% (CI: 7%-56%) higher mean number of incorrect items after adjusting for covariates, and a 51% (CI: 15%-98%) higher number of IDK responses compared to TDP-43-. At last assessment, compared to TDP-43-, the TDP-43+ group on average missed 31% (CI: 6%-62%; p = .01) more items and had 33% more IDK responses (CI: 1% fewer to 78% more; p = .06). CONCLUSIONS: An important component of poorer performance on the BNT in participants who are TDP-43+ is having loss of word knowledge versus retrieval difficulties.
