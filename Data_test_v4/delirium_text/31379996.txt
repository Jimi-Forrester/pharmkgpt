Recently, increasing interest has been focused on anti-lipidemic function of herbal medicines, especially Zingiber officinale (known as ginger), in diabetes. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of ginger on some players involved in cholesterol homeostasis of Central Nervous System (CNS) among diabetic patients remains unclear. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of ginger on brain regulation of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) and Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), which provides a rational model for understanding brain dyslipidemia mechanisms associated with diabetes. METHODS: Brains of rats were isolated from four groups: control, non-treated diabetic, and treated diabetic groups receiving 200 or 400 mg/kg of hydroalcoholic extracts of ginger for eight weeks. HMG-CoA reductase and CYP46A1 levels in brain homogenates were determined by western-blot technique. RESULTS: Ginger root extract caused a significant decrease in HMG-CoA reductase and an increase in CYP46A1 levels in treated diabetic groups compared to diabetic control. In comparison to diabetic group, these effects were more remarkable with 400 mg/kg concentration of ginger extract. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that ginger extract has a regulatory effect on proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis in CNS by a significant down- and up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and CYP46A1 levels, respectively. It can be suggested that adding ginger to daily diet of diabetic patients has useful effects and may ameliorate diabetes complications.
