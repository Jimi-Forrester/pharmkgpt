32994493|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the main genetic cause of intellectual disability due to triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21). Although there is no treatment for intellectual disability, environmental enrichment (EE) and the administration of green tea extracts containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) improve cognition in mouse models and individuals with DS. Using proteome, and phosphoproteome analysis in the hippocampi of a DS mouse model (Ts65Dn), we investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of green tea extracts, EE and their combination. Our results revealed disturbances in cognitive-related (synaptic proteins, neuronal projection, neuron development, microtubule), GTPase/kinase activity and chromatin proteins. Green tea extracts, EE, and their combination restored more than 70% of the phosphoprotein deregulation in Ts65Dn, and induced possible compensatory effects. Our downstream analyses indicate that re-establishment of a proper epigenetic state and rescue of the kinome deregulation may contribute to the cognitive rescue induced by green tea extracts.
