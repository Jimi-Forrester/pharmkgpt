32885023|t|Clearance of amyloid-beta with bispecific antibody constructs bound to erythrocytes.
32885023|a|We propose use of bispecific monoclonal antibody (mAb) complexes bound to erythrocytes to redress the lack of efficacy of anti-amyloid beta mAbs in Alzheimer's disease treatment. Our paradigm leverages erythrocyte complement receptor 1 to promote rapid and quantitative removal of amyloid beta from the circulation, and its subsequent removal from the brain as well.
