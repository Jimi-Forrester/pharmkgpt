25474763|t|The role of religious coping and race in Alzheimer's disease caregiving.
25474763|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are one of the most critical public health problems in elderly population. Using baseline data from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) II study, this study examined the relationship between religious coping, burden appraisal, depression, and race among 211 African American, 220 White, and 211 Hispanic caregivers, using structural equation modeling (SEM). Caregiver burden appraisal mediated the effect of religious coping on depression with higher religious coping resulting in lowering caregiver burden appraisal and thereby reducing depression. The results also showed that religious coping mediation model was best supported by African Americans. Greater understanding of religious coping and its role in the caregiving process helps researchers discover better ways to assist racially diverse caregivers in dealing with burdens of AD caregiving.
