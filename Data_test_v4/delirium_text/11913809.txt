11913809|a|Both the numbers of children undergoing day case surgery and the type of procedures performed in this way are increasing. This expansion will only be beneficial if anaesthesia and surgery are provided with minimal post-operative morbidity e.g. postoperative delirium or nausea and vomiting. The choice of anaesthetic technique is considered critical to optimizing the service provided to patients and for this reason much research has addressed this question. This review considers the effect of anaesthetic technique on postoperative outcome in paediatric day case surgery. The outcome measures reviewed by this article are induction of anaesthesia, effects on the cardiovascular system, recovery from anaesthesia and postoperative nausea and vomiting. In each section both quantitative and qualitative outcome measures are discussed. Comparisons are made between sevoflurane and halothane, sevoflurane and propofol, propofol and halothane, desflurane and halothane and the presence or absence of nitrous oxide.
