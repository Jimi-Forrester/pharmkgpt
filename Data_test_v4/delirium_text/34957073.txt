34957073|a|Carcinogenesis is a major concern that severely affects the human population. Owing to persistent demand for novel therapies to treat and prohibit this lethal disease, research interest among scientists is drawing its huge focus toward natural products, as they have minimum toxicity comparable with existing treatment methods. The plants produce secondary metabolites, which are known to have the anticancer potential for clinical drug development. Furthermore, the use of nanocarriers could boost the solubility and stability of phytocompounds to obtain site-targeting delivery. The identification of potential phytochemicals in natural compounds would be beneficial for the synthesis of biocompatible nanoemulsions. The present study aimed to investigate the potential cytotoxicity of ethanol extracts of Hibiscus syriacus and Cinnamomum loureirii Nees plant parts on human skin melanoma (G361) and lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Importantly, biochemical analysis results showed the presence of high phenol (50-55 microgGAE/mg) and flavonoids [42-45 microg quercetin equivalents (QE)/mg] contents with good antioxidant activity (40-58%) in C. loureirii Nees plants extracts. This plant possesses potent antiproliferative activity (60-90%) on the malignant G361 and A549 and cell lines correlated with the production of nitric oxide. Especially, C. loureirii plant extracts have major metabolites that exhibit cancer cell death associated with cell cycle arrest. These findings support the potential application of Cinnamomum for the development of therapeutic nanoemulsion in future cancer therapy.
