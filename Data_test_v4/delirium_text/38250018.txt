38250018|a|Introduction: There is a need to better understand the neurophysiological changes associated with early brain dysfunction in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) before vascular or structural lesions. Our aim was to use a novel unbiased data-driven approach to detect and characterize hemodynamic response function (HRF) alterations in T2DM patients, focusing on their potential as biomarkers. Methods: We meshed task-based event-related (visual speed discrimination) functional magnetic resonance imaging with DL to show, from an unbiased perspective, that T2DM patients' blood-oxygen-level dependent response is altered. Relevance analysis determined which brain regions were more important for discrimination. We combined explainability with deconvolution generalized linear model to provide a more accurate picture of the nature of the neural changes. Results: The proposed approach to discriminate T2DM patients achieved up to 95% accuracy. Higher performance was achieved at higher stimulus (speed) contrast, showing a direct relationship with stimulus properties, and in the hemispherically dominant left visual hemifield, demonstrating biological interpretability. Differences are explained by physiological asymmetries in cortical spatial processing (right hemisphere dominance) and larger neural signal-to-noise ratios related to stimulus contrast. Relevance analysis revealed the most important regions for discrimination, such as extrastriate visual cortex, parietal cortex, and insula. These are disease/task related, providing additional evidence for pathophysiological significance. Our data-driven design allowed us to compute the unbiased HRF without assumptions. Conclusion: We can accurately differentiate T2DM patients using a data-driven classification of the HRF. HRF differences hold promise as biomarkers and could contribute to a deeper understanding of neurophysiological changes associated with T2DM.
