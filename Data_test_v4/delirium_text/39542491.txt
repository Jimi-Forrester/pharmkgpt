39542491|t|Efficacy and safety of remimazolam tosylate for patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: a study protocol for a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial in China.
39542491|a|INTRODUCTION: Maintaining haemodynamic stability is crucial but challenging during the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia (GA) in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG). Remimazolam tosylate is a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine with minimal cardiovascular depression. Currently, non-inferior studies comparing the haemodynamic changes induced by remimazolam and etomidate are limited. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of remimazolam tosylate for the induction and maintenance of GA in patients undergoing OPCABG. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This two-armed non-inferiority randomised controlled trial will include 88 patients aged 18-75 years who are scheduled for OPCABG. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either remimazolam tosylate or etomidate and propofol for anaesthesia induction and maintenance. The primary outcome will be the fluctuation of mean artery pressure during anaesthesia induction. Secondary outcomes will include adverse events, adverse drug reactions, the cumulative dosage of vasoactive drugs, vital signs and bispectral index values at different time points, lengths of postoperative mechanical ventilation and tracheal intubation, lengths of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay and hospital mortality. Analyses will be conducted using both the intention-to-treat approach and the per-protocol approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zibo Central Hospital (No. 2024001). The trial results will be submitted to an international peer-reviewed journal.
