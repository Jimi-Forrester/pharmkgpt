8738146|t|Two types of amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA in rat glioma cell lines: upregulation via a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway.
8738146|a|APP is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein and the only known natural source of beta A4 peptide-the major constituent of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The expression and cAMP-dependent regulation of the APP gene were investigated in primary cultures of rat astrocytes and two related glioma cell lines, BT4C and BT4Cn, which exhibit distinct invasive phenotypes. Besides the well-characterized 3.5 kb APP mRNA class, a robust expression of an unusual 2.8 kb APP mRNA class was revealed by Northern blotting in both glioma cell lines, but not in the astrocytes. Low amounts of the 2.8 kb APP mRNA species were also observed in rat liver and occasionally in aged rat brain. The 2.8 kb APP mRNA contained exons 1-18 and may thus be generated by truncation of the 3' untranslated region. For the first time, regulation of the APP gene via a cAMP-dependent mechanism was shown. Exposure to dBcAMP dramatically upregulated the 3.5 and 2.8 kb transcripts in BT4C cells, and, to a lesser extent, in BT4Cn cells where the constitutive expression of the APP gene was much higher. Elucidation of the factors involved in cAMP-dependent induction of APP mRNA in these cells may shed more light on the molecular mechanisms of APP overexpression.
