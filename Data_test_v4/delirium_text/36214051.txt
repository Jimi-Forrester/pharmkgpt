36214051|t|Reason and reality-identifying barriers to patient enrolment for clinical trials in invasive candidiasis.
36214051|a|OBJECTIVES: Enrolment of subjects to clinical trials investigating novel drugs for infectious diseases is an ongoing challenge. In this study, we evaluate factors associated with non-enrolment in treatment trials for invasive candidiasis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of pre-screening logs of patients that were assessed for enrolment in the three clinical trials ACTIVE (NCT00413218), APX001-201 (NCT03604705) and ReSTORE (NCT03667690), investigating novel drugs for invasive candidiasis between September 2007 and August 2021 to identify reasons for study ineligibility. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six patients with invasive candidiasis were identified for potential study participation with n = 154 for the ACTIVE trial, n = 89 for APX001-201 and n = 13 for ReSTORE. Half of the potential participants were unable or unwilling to consent. We further identified comorbid conditions such as hepatic or renal impairment [21 hepatic and renal cases (13.6%) in ACTIVE; 12 hepatic (13.5%) and 28 renal cases (31.5%) in APX], prior antifungal treatment [11 cases (7.1%) in ACTIVE; 16 (18.0%) in APX; 7 (38.5%) in ReSTORE] and the last positive culture obtained >=96 h prior to dosing [1 case (0.6%) in ACTIVE; 7 (7.9%) in APX; 5 (38.5%) in ReSTORE] as relevant reasons for non-enrolment. We also identified criteria repetitively used in the analysed studies that did not contribute substantially to ineligibility rates. Ultimately, 254/256 patients (99.2%) were ineligible for enrolment in the respective trial. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified barriers to enrolment in clinical trials assessing novel antifungal agents in invasive candidiasis. Identification of eligibility criteria associated with non-enrolment allows modification of future trial designs and may ultimately result in higher recruitment rates.
