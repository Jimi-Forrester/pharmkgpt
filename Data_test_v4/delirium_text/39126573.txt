39126573|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurological condition that occurs with age and poses a significant global public health concern, is distinguished by the degeneration of neurons and synapses in various regions of the brain. While the exact processes behind the neurodegeneration in AD are not completely known, it is now acknowledged that inflammation may have a significant impact on the beginning and advancement of AD neurodegeneration. The severity of many neurological illnesses can be influenced by the equilibrium between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. The IL-1 family of cytokines is linked to innate immune responses, which are present in both acute inflammation and chronic inflammatory diseases. Research on the role of the IL-1 family in chronic neurological disease has been concentrated on AD. In this context, there is indirect evidence suggesting its involvement in the development of the disease. This review aims to provide a summary of the contribution of every IL-1 family member in AD pathogenesis, current immunotherapies in AD disease, and present treatment possibilities for either targeting or boosting these cytokines.
