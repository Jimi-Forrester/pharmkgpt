36674832|t|Screening System of Cannabis sativa Extracts Based on Their Mitochondrial Safety Profile Using Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity as a Biomarker
36674832|a|The development of Cannabis sativa strains with high cannabidiol (CBD) and low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is a growing field of research, both for medical and recreational use. However, the mechanisms behind clinical actions of cannabinoids are still under investigation, although there is growing evidence that mitochondria play an important role in many of them. Numerous studies have described that cannabinoids modulate mitochondrial activity both through activation of mitochondrial cannabinoid receptors and through direct action on other proteins such as mitochondrial complexes involved in cellular respiration. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the actions of a panel of extracts, isolated from high-CBD varieties of Cannabis sativa, on the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), in order to select those with a safer profile. After demonstrating that Cannabis sativa strains could be identified by cannabinoids content, concentration-response curves were performed with a collection of extracts from strains with high-CBD and low-THC content using bovine CCO. The CCO rate was clearly modified by specific extracts of Cannabis sativa plants compared to others. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of extracts and the inhibitory effects evoked at 1 x 10-4 g/mL displayed a significant correlation with the THC. Therefore, the screening of extracts based on CCO activity provides a powerful and rapid methodology to identify those plants with higher mitochondrial toxicity or even mito-protective actions.
