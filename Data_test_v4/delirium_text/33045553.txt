33045553|a|In recent months, there has been a rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), being now regarded as a global pandemic. In this context, the governments of different countries have established strict containment measures, and subsequent deconfinement measures, with consequential alterations in the rhythms and living habits of the population, including patients with bipolar disorder (BD), who are in an extremely vulnerable situation. The present paper aims to propose a number of recommendations, based on scientific evidence, for mental health professionals who may be in charge of BD patients during this health crisis in the coming months. Among these recommendations, careful monitoring of pharmacological treatment, reinforcing medication adherence, and surveillance of drug-drug interaction risk in cases where the patient is being treated for COVID-19 are of utmost importance.
