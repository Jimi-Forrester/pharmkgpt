35610206|t|miR-188-3p targets skeletal endothelium coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis during ageing.
35610206|a|A specific bone capillary subtype, namely type H vessels, with high expression of CD31 and endomucin, was shown to couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis recently. The number of type H vessels in bone tissue declines with age, and the underlying mechanism for this reduction is unclear. Here, we report that microRNA-188-3p (miR-188-3p) involves this process. miRNA-188-3p expression is upregulated in skeletal endothelium and negatively regulates the formation of type H vessels during ageing. Mice with depletion of miR-188 showed an alleviated age-related decline in type H vessels. In contrast, endothelial-specific overexpression of miR-188-3p reduced the number of type H vessels, leading to decreased bone mass and delayed bone regeneration. Mechanistically, we found that miR-188 inhibits type H vessel formation by directly targeting integrin beta3 in endothelial cells. Our findings indicate that miR-188-3p is a key regulator of type H vessel formation and may be a potential therapeutic target for preventing bone loss and accelerating bone regeneration.
