33467274|t|The Importance of Exercise in Alzheimer's Disease and the Minds in Motion  Program: An Editorial.
33467274|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are prevalent neurodegenerative diseases characterized by decreased cognition, physical function, and quality of life. Currently, millions of people are living with AD and other dementias. With no cure, research has examined the use of non-pharmacological treatment options including exercise. Many high-quality studies demonstrate that physical activity slows the progression of AD's many outcomes, and is beneficial to overall quality of life in those living with AD. However, creating exercise interventions at the community level that individuals will adhere to is often a challenge. The Alzheimer's Society of Canada developed a unique program that combines physical activity with cognitive stimulation in a social atmosphere: The Minds in Motion  program. Minds in Motion  addresses many of the barriers often linked to poor physical activity participation in chronic diseases (such as inclusion of the care partner), to ensure the best program uptake. The Minds in Motion  program has anecdotally been successful in helping to increase physical function and social skills in those living with dementia. However, it is important to connect community-driven programs with the academic research community, to create an opportunity for high quality evaluation metrics that can be disseminated at multiple levels: to research audiences, clinical audiences, and to those in the community. With ongoing collaborations between research and community programs, there is a greater opportunity to understand the positive impact of a program, which ultimately increases the chance of funding for the program. In this editorial, we highlight that community-integrated research is an important priority for future collaborations.
