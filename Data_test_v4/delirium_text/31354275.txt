31354275|a|Objective: To evaluate the effect of aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400; Abilify Maintena ) on symptom stability in acute treatment and maintenance therapy settings in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Results were analyzed from two pivotal maintenance studies (Studies 246 and 247), a long-term (52 weeks), open-label extension of these studies (Study 248), an open-label, mirror-image study in patients switching from oral to long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy (Study 283), and a study of AOM 400 in the acute setting (Study 291). Symptom stability was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale (CGI-Severity of Illness and CGI-Improvement). Results are reported for the total study population and in subgroups stratified by age. Results: In Study 246, AOM 400 resulted in significantly greater improvements from baseline vs placebo on all measures of symptom stability, with improvements maintained through 52 weeks. In Study 247, a non-inferiority study, AOM 400 resulted in improvements in PANSS and CGI scores comparable or significantly greater at all timepoints vs oral aripiprazole. In Study 248, AOM 400 resulted in the long-term stability of symptom improvements from the earlier studies. In Study 283, AOM 400 resulted in significant improvements from baseline in PANSS and CGI scores over 24 weeks. In Study 291, AOM 400 resulted in significantly greater improvements from baseline in PANSS and CGI scores vs placebo at all post-baseline timepoints. In post hoc analyses, AOM 400 showed similar efficacy in symptom improvement in adult patients aged <=35 years and >35 years, with some evidence of a larger treatment effect on PANSS negative symptoms among younger patients in the acute treatment setting. Conclusion: In acute treatment and maintenance therapy settings, AOM 400 was effective in the rapid stabilization and long-term maintenance of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.
