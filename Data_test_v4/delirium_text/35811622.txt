35811622|t|Phytochemicals targeting NF-kappaB signaling: Potential anti-cancer interventions.
35811622|a|Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a ubiquitous regulator of the signalome and is indispensable for various biological cell functions. NF-kappaB consists of five transcription factors that execute both cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling processes in cells. NF-kappaB is the only signaling molecule that governs both pro- and anti-apoptotic, and pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. This is due to the canonical and non-canonical components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Together, these pathways orchestrate cancer-related inflammation, hyperplasia, neoplasia, and metastasis. Non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways are particularly involved in the chemoresistance of cancer cells. In view of its pivotal role in cancer progression, NF-kappaB represents a potentially significant therapeutic target for modifying tumor cell behavior. Several phytochemicals are known to modulate NF-kappaB pathways through the stabilization of its inhibitor, IkappaB, by inhibiting phosphorylation and ubiquitination thereof. Several natural pharmacophores are known to inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and associated pro-inflammatory responses and cell survival pathways. In view of this and the high degree of specificity exhibited by various phytochemicals for the NF-kappaB component, we herein present an in-depth overview of these phytochemicals and discuss their mode of interaction with the NF-kappaB signaling pathways for controlling the fate of tumor cells for cancer-directed interventions.
