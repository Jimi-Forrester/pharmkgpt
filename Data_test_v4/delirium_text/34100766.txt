34100766|t|Association Between the Digital Clock Drawing Test and Neuropsychological Test Performance: Large Community-Based Prospective Cohort (Framingham Heart Study).
34100766|a|BACKGROUND: The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) has been widely used in clinic for cognitive assessment. Recently, a digital Clock Drawing Text (dCDT) that is able to capture the entire sequence of clock drawing behaviors was introduced. While a variety of domain-specific features can be derived from the dCDT, it has not yet been evaluated in a large community-based population whether the features derived from the dCDT correlate with cognitive function. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association between dCDT features and cognitive performance across multiple domains. METHODS: Participants from the Framingham Heart Study, a large community-based cohort with longitudinal cognitive surveillance, who did not have dementia were included. Participants were administered both the dCDT and a standard protocol of neuropsychological tests that measured a wide range of cognitive functions. A total of 105 features were derived from the dCDT, and their associations with 18 neuropsychological tests were assessed with linear regression models adjusted for age and sex. Associations between a composite score from dCDT features were also assessed for associations with each neuropsychological test and cognitive status (clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment compared to normal cognition). RESULTS: The study included 2062 participants (age: mean 62, SD 13 years, 51.6% women), among whom 36 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Each neuropsychological test was associated with an average of 50 dCDT features. The composite scores derived from dCDT features were significantly associated with both neuropsychological tests and mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The dCDT can potentially be used as a tool for cognitive assessment in large community-based populations.
