36771011|a|Neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome and epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, are conditions that affect not only individuals but societies on a global scale. Current therapies offer a means for small symptomatic relief, but recently there has been increasing demand for therapeutic alternatives. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling system has been investigated for developing new therapies as it has been noted that any dysfunction or changes to this system can contribute to disease progression. Expression of the K-Cl-2 (KCC2) and N-K-C1-1 (NKCC1) cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) has recently been linked to the disruption of GABAergic activity by affecting the polarity of GABAA receptor signaling. KCC2 and NKCC1 play a part in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, making them a target of interest for potential therapies. This review explores current research suggesting the pathophysiological role and therapeutic importance of KCC2 and NKCC1 in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.
