35546794|t|Highly efficient soluble expression, purification and characterization of recombinant Abeta42 from Escherichia coli.
35546794|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is hypothesized to be a seminal neuropathological event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recombinant expression and purification of Abeta represents a common basis for investigating the molecular mechanisms of amyloid formation and toxicity. Herein, we report a novel high-yield expression and purification method for Abeta42 based on fusion with maltose binding protein (MBP) followed by the soluble polypeptide linker (NANP)3 and a modified tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site before the Abeta42. We obtained a final yield of ~18 mg L-1 of recombinant Abeta42 that was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, protein immunoblotting and MALDI-TOF. Finally, thioflavin T fluorescence and atomic force microscopy revealed that the recombinant Abeta42 aggregated into long, branched fibrils. Furthermore, the aggregates of the recombinant peptide had a strong cytotoxic effect on PC12 cells. The method described here can therefore be used to efficiently express the soluble fusion protein MBP-Abeta42 and obtain high-purity Abeta42 peptide, which can be used to understand the molecular mechanism of Abeta42 fibrillization and screen new candidate drugs for AD.
