38646650|a|Diabetes, a severe metabolic disease characterized by chronic hypoglycemia, poses debilitating and life-threatening risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications, including blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, and limb amputation. Addressing these complications is paramount, urging the development of interventions targeting diabetes-associated vascular dysfunctions. To effectively combat diabetes, a comprehensive understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying complications and identification of precise therapeutic targets are imperative. Transglutaminase 2 (TGase2) is a multifunctional enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, fibrosis, and inflammatory conditions. TGase2 has recently emerged as a key player in both the pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention of diabetic complications. This review highlights TGase2 as a therapeutic target for diabetic complications and explores TGase2 inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach in their treatment.
