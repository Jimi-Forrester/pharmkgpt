30054457|t|NAA10-related syndrome.
30054457|a|NAA10-related syndrome is an X-linked condition with a broad spectrum of findings ranging from a severe phenotype in males with p.Ser37Pro in NAA10, originally described as Ogden syndrome, to the milder NAA10-related intellectual disability found with different variants in both males and females. Although developmental impairments/intellectual disability may be the presenting feature (and in some cases the only finding), many individuals have additional cardiovascular, growth, and dysmorphic findings that vary in type and severity. Therefore, this set of disorders has substantial phenotypic variability and, as such, should be referred to more broadly as NAA10-related syndrome. NAA10 encodes an enzyme NAA10 that is certainly involved in the amino-terminal acetylation of proteins, alongside other proposed functions for this same protein. The mechanistic basis for how variants in NAA10 lead to the various phenotypes in humans is an active area of investigation, some of which will be reviewed herein.
