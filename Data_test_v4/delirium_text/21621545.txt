21621545|t|Structural basis for Abeta1-42 toxicity inhibition by Abeta C-terminal fragments: discrete molecular dynamics study.
21621545|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Of the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), the latter forms more toxic oligomers. C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of Abeta were recently shown to inhibit Abeta(1-42) toxicity in vitro. Here, we studied Abeta(1-42) assembly in the presence of three effective CTF inhibitors and an ineffective fragment, Abeta(21-30). Using a discrete molecular dynamics approach that recently was shown to capture key differences between Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) oligomerization, we compared Abeta(1-42) oligomer formation in the absence and presence of CTFs or Abeta(21-30) and identified structural elements of Abeta(1-42) that correlated with Abeta(1-42) toxicity. CTFs co-assembled with Abeta(1-42) into large heterooligomers containing multiple Abeta(1-42) and inhibitor fragments. In contrast, Abeta(21-30) co-assembled with Abeta(1-42) into heterooligomers containing mostly a single Abeta(1-42) and multiple Abeta(21-30) fragments. The CTFs, but not Abeta(21-30), decreased the beta-strand propensity of Abeta(1-42) in a concentration-dependent manner. CTFs and Abeta(21-30) had a high binding propensity to the hydrophobic regions of Abeta(1-42), but only CTFs were found to bind the Abeta(1-42) region A2-F4. Consequently, only CTFs but not Abeta(21-30) reduced the solvent accessibility of Abeta(1-42) in region D1-R5. The reduced solvent accessibility of Abeta(1-42) in the presence of CTFs was comparable to the solvent accessibility of Abeta(1-40) oligomers formed in the absence of Abeta fragments. These findings suggest that region D1-R5, which was more exposed to the solvent in Abeta(1-42) than in Abeta(1-40) oligomers, is involved in mediating Abeta(1-42) oligomer neurotoxicity.
