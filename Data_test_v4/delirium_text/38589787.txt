38589787|a|BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of elderly individuals worldwide, a greater number of people aged 80 years and older sustain fragility fracture due to osteopenia and osteoporosis. METHODS: This retrospective study included 158 older adults, with a median age of 85 (range: 80-99) years, who sustained hip fragility fracture and who underwent surgery. The patients were divided into two groups, one including patients who joined the post-acute care (PAC) program after surgery and another comprising patients who did not. The mortality, complication, comorbidity, re-fracture, secondary fracture, and readmission rates and functional status (based on the Barthel index score, numerical rating scale score, and Harris Hip Scale score) between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The patients who presented with fragility hip fracture and who joined the PAC rehabilitation program after the surgery had a lower rate of mortality, readmission rate, fracture (re-fracture and secondary fracture), and complications associated with fragility fracture, such as urinary tract infection, cerebrovascular accident, and pneumonia (acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or in-hospital cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: PAC is associated with a lower rate of mortality and complications such as urinary tract infection, bed sore, and pneumonia in octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with hip fragility fracture.
