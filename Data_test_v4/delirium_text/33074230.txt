33074230|t|Value of Neuropsychological Tests to Identify Patients with Depressive Symptoms on the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum.
33074230|a|BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can impact neuropsychological test results. In early stages of AD, disentangling cognitive impairments due to depression from those due to neurodegeneration often poses a challenge. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify neuropsychological tests able to detect AD-typical pathology while taking into account varying degrees of depressive symptoms. METHODS: A battery of neuropsychological tests (CERAD-NP) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were assessed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were obtained. After stratifying patients into CSF positive or negative and into low, moderate, or high GDS score groups, sensitivity and specificity and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each subtest. RESULTS: 497 participants were included in the analyses. In patients with low GDS scores (<=10), the highest AUC (0.72) was achieved by Mini-Mental State Examination, followed by Constructional Praxis Recall and Wordlist Total Recall (AUC = 0.714, both). In patients with moderate (11-20) and high (>=21) GDS scores, Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B) revealed the highest AUCs with 0.77 and 0.82, respectively. CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological tests showing AD-typical pathology in participants with low GDS scores are in-line with previous results. In patients with higher GDS scores, TMT-B showed the best discrimination. This indicates the need to focus on executive function rather than on memory task results in depressed patients to explore a risk for AD.
