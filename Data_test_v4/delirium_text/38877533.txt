38877533|t|Effect of remimazolam versus propofol anesthesia on postoperative delirium in neurovascular surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial.
38877533|a|BACKGROUND: Remimazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine newly approved for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Remimazolam emerges as an ideal drug for the neurosurgical population due to its rapid emergence, enabling early neurological assessment, and its ability to maintain perfusion pressure, which is crucial for preventing cerebral ischemia. However, the use of benzodiazepine has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium (POD). There is currently limited evidence about the relationship between remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and POD. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority trial, we plan to include 696 adult patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I to III, undergoing elective neurovascular surgery under general anesthesia. After informed consent, the patients will be randomized to receive either remimazolam or propofol-based TIVA with a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD within 5 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes include subtypes, number of positive assessments and severity of POD, emergence agitation, intraoperative awareness and undesirable patient movement, intraoperative hypotension, and postoperative cognitive function. The data will be analyzed in modified intention to treat. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effect of remimazolam on the development of POD compared to propofol anesthesia. The results of this trial will provide evidence regarding the choice of optimal anesthetics to minimize the risk of POD in neurosurgical patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was prospectively registered at the Clinical trials ( https://clinicaltrials.gov , NCT06115031, principal investigator: Jiseon Jeong; date of first registration: November 2, 2023, before the recruitment of the first participant.
