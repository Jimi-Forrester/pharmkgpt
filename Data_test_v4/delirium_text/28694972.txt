28694972|t|Rhabdomyolysis as a rare paraneoplastic presentation of acute myeloid leukemia.
28694972|a|We present the case of a 56-year-old man who presented with rhabdomyolysis and was found to have acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our case is the first to show an association of rhabdomyolysis with AML. Although rhabdomyolysis is likely a very rare clinical presentation of AML, our case raises awareness for workup for AML in patients who present with rhabdomyolysis and other suspicious findings. Both conditions are medical emergencies and require immediate treatment.
