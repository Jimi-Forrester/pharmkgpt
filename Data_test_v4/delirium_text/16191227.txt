16191227|t|Epidemiology: identifying vascular cognitive impairment.
16191227|a|There has been a move in recent years to recognize that the most effective treatment for vascular dementia, and for the mixed component of mixed vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, lies not in treatment but in prevention. This requires that cases be identified before the onset of vascular damage (a stage termed "brain-at-risk") or, failing this, as soon as possible but certainly before dementia has developed. These early stages are termed vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). No criteria exist for this early stage of cognitive loss due to cerebrovascular disease and relatively little data exist to indicate how such cases might be identified. The data that do exist suggest that many of the traditional "vascular" features of sudden onset and stepwise progression, etc., are not common in VCI and new criteria will be needed to identify cases. This paper summarizes the data that describe the clinical, neuropsychological, and radiological features that are to be expected in VCI.
