31469892|a|Curli amyloid fibrils secreted by Enterobacteriaceae mediate host cell adhesion and contribute to biofilm formation, thereby promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. Here, we present crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA, revealing steric zipper fibrils of tightly mated beta-sheets, demonstrating a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids. D-enantiomeric peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta, inhibited CsgA fibrillation and reduced biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Moreover, as previously shown, CsgA fibrils cross-seeded fibrillation of amyloid-beta, providing support for the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. The presented findings provide structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation, suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms, and hypothesize on the formation of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source that could influence neurodegenerative diseases.
