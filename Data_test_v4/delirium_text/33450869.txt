33450869|t|Cholesterol and Sphingolipid Enriched Lipid Rafts as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer.
33450869|a|Lipid rafts are critical cell membrane lipid platforms enriched in sphingolipid and cholesterol content involved in diverse cellular processes. They have been proposed to influence membrane properties and to accommodate receptors within themselves by facilitating their interaction with ligands. Over the past decade, technical advances have improved our understanding of lipid rafts as bioactive structures. In this review, we will cover the more recent findings about cholesterol, sphingolipids and lipid rafts located in cellular and nuclear membranes in cancer. Collectively, the data provide insights on the role of lipid rafts as biomolecular targets in cancer with good perspectives for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.
