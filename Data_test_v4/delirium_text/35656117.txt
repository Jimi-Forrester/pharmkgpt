35656117|t|Ongoing Clinical Trials in Aging-Related Tissue Fibrosis and New Findings Related to AhR Pathways.
35656117|a|Fibrosis is a pathological manifestation of wound healing that replaces dead/damaged tissue with collagen-rich scar tissue to maintain homeostasis, and complications from fibrosis contribute to nearly half of all deaths in the industrialized world. Ageing is closely associated with a progressive decline in organ function, and the prevalence of tissue fibrosis dramatically increases with age. Despite the heavy clinical and economic burden of organ fibrosis as the population ages, to date, there is a paucity of therapeutic strategies that are specifically designed to slow fibrosis. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an environment-sensing transcription factor that exacerbates aging phenotypes in different tissues that has been brought back into the spotlight again with economic development since AhR could interact with persistent organic pollutants derived from incomplete waste combustion. In addition, gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, and microbiota-associated tryptophan metabolites are dedicated contributors to fibrogenesis by acting as AhR ligands. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of tryptophan metabolites on fibrosis modulation through AhR may facilitate the exploitation of new therapeutic avenues for patients with organ fibrosis. In this review, we primarily focus on how tryptophan-derived metabolites are involved in renal fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis and cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, a series of ongoing clinical trials are highlighted.
