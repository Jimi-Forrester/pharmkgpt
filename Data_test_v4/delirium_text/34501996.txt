34501996|a|Most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) gradually develop oropharyngeal dysphagia which is often associated with pneumonia risk. The possible association of benzodiazepine (BZD) and benzodiazepine related drugs (BZRD) use with pneumonia risk has received increasing attention but remains controversial. We investigated pneumonia risk associated with the use of BZDs and BZRDs in older adult patients with PD. This case-control study analyzed data of 551,975 older adult patients with PD between 2001 and 2018 in Taiwan. To minimize potential confounding, we used 1:4 propensity score matching to include older adult patients without pneumonia as controls. Incident pneumonia risk was significantly higher in current (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.23-1.27) and past (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.11-1.15) users of BZDs. Regarding BZRDs, recent (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06-1.11) and past (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.88-0.91) users had higher and lower risks of incident pneumonia, respectively. Pneumonia risk varied based on their use of BZDs and BZRDs. In these individuals, incident pneumonia risk was high in users of BZDs, such as midazolam, lorazepam, flunitrazepam, estazolam, and clonazepam. Regarding the use of BZRDs, zopiclone increased incident pneumonia risk.
