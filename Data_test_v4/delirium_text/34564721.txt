34564721|a|OBJECTIVE: In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, teleneuropsychology utilization has increased. There is a need to characterize the first-hand experiences of individuals using teleneuropsychology, identify the common teleneuropsychology challenges, and devise practical strategies for mitigating/resolving these challenges. METHOD: Survey data were collected from U.S. based neuropsychologists and other individuals (e.g., graduate students and research assistants) who were engaged in remote cognitive assessment with adults (n = 87). Frequency analyses were conducted to examine: how respondents used teleneuropsychology (e.g., duration of use, types of measures and devices/technology platforms used); challenges that were encountered with different technology platforms and teleneuropsychology use; and advice for navigating these challenges. RESULTS: Most respondents began using teleneuropsychology relatively recently in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, with home-to-home or clinic-to-home settings being the most frequently reported teleneuropsychology settings. Zoom , Doxy.Me , and MyChart  were the most frequently used platforms, largely due to workplace mandates and/or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant features. Common challenges with teleneuropsychology included internet connection issues and environmental distractions in examinees' homes, and examinees having limited-to-no access to technologies requisite for teleneuropsychology. Providing clear instructions to the examinee prior to the teleneuropsychology visit was the most common advice for ensuring a successful teleneuropsychology evaluation. Similar response patterns were generally noted for those who used TeleNP for clinical or research purposes. CONCLUSIONS: These survey results reflect common experiences and challenges with teleneuropsychology and identify priority targets for increasing its feasibility, reliability, and validity. Findings provide context for the development of formal teleneuropsychology competencies.
