39206249|a|Purpose of Review: This narrative review summarizes environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors associated with cognitive decline and dementia in Black Americans. Recent Findings: Variations in environmental factors (education, toxins) contribute to poor cognition in Blacks. Historical context, early-life educational experiences, and environmental exposures should be considered for addressing late-life cognitive disparities. Sociocultural (stress, discrimination, social networks, social activity, loneliness) and behavioral (depression, coping, health behaviors) factors can have positive and negative implications for cognitive aging. Given these factors are not consistently shown to play a role in maintaining cognition in Blacks, further examination is needed. Cardiometabolic conditions increase the risk of cognitive issues and are more common in Blacks; thus, examination of biological mechanisms (inflammation, vascular changes, etc.) warrants further study. Summary: Future studies should explore the impact of education and segregation and identify mechanisms linking stress and discrimination to cognitive outcomes. Further, culturally tailored programs focused on preventative behaviors are needed to enhance health outcomes and reduce disparities.
