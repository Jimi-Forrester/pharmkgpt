23930181|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple factors such as retirement, work disability, social rejection, physical illness and etc., have an impact on general health of the elders. One factor among others is the role of psychological variables. The study is intended to assess the effect of positive and negative perfectionism and type-D personality (distressed) on general health of the elders. METHODS: In this descriptive-correlation study, 80 people (47 male and 33 female) were selected from residents of Nursing Home in Hamadan and Malayer using non-probability (accessible) sampling method. They responded to the questionnaires of type-D Personality, Goldberg and Hillier's General Health and Positive and Negative Perfectionism of Terry-Short et al. RESULTS: Positive perfectionism (r = 0.30) and type-D personality (r = 0.32) had significant correlation with general health. Multiple regression analysis revealed that positive perfectionism and type-D personality could explain at least 49% of the variance in general health. Concerning the variables of negative affectivity, social inhibition and social function, the females' mean was higher than that of males and considering the variables of positive perfectionism, and social functioning, the males' mean was higher than that of females. CONCLUSIONS: Positive perfectionism decreases mental disorder of the elders by creating optimistic attitudes and enhancing social functions. On the other hand, type-D personality, unlike positive perfectionism, makes elders susceptible to physical illness and mental disorder.
