36275484|t|Investigation of Neurological Symptoms Caused by COVID-19 in Intensive Care Unit.
36275484|a|We examined the neurological symptoms of patients treated in intensive care for COVID-19 in this study. We obtained the study data retrospectively from data records of 1,699 patients treated in the COVID-19 clinics of a training and research hospital. The study is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and Disease Information Form were used for data collection. Statistical Packed for the Social Sciences 25.0 IBM was used in Data analysis. It was observed that 37% of the COVID-19 patients were between the ages of 66-80 years and 55.6% of the COVID-19 patients were male. The most common neurological symptoms in the disease process and their rates were as follows: insomnia 74.6%, taste loss 74%, smell loss 75.6%, muscle pain 83.2%, headache 45.1%, dizziness 32.2%, weakness 20.2%, and agitation 34.7%. Assessment of neurological symptoms of patients followed up for COVID-19 is of great importance. We suggest that neurological problems should be tried to be cured with appropriate treatment protocols and therapy support before they progress further and the neurological prognosis progresses.
