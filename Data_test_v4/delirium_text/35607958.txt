35607958|a|Hyperglycemia in diabetic patients is associated with abnormally-elevated cellular glucose levels. It is hypothesized that increased cellular glucose will lead to increased formation of endogenous methanol and/or formaldehyde, both of which are then metabolically converted to formic acid. These one-carbon metabolites are known to be present naturally in humans, and their levels are increased under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, while formaldehyde is a cross-linking agent capable of causing extensive cytotoxicity, formic acid is an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, capable of inducing histotoxic hypoxia, ATP deficiency and cytotoxicity. Chronic increase in the production and accumulation of these toxic one-carbon metabolites in diabetic patients can drive the pathogenesis of ocular as well as other diabetic complications. This hypothesis is supported by a large body of experimental and clinical observations scattered in the literature. For instance, methanol is known to have organ- and species-selective toxicities, including the characteristic ocular lesions commonly seen in humans and non-human primates, but not in rodents. Similarly, some of the diabetic complications (such as ocular lesions) also have a characteristic species-selective pattern, closely resembling methanol intoxication. Moreover, while alcohol consumption or combined use of folic acid plus vitamin B is beneficial for mitigating acute methanol toxicity in humans, their use also improves the outcomes of diabetic complications. In addition, there is also a large body of evidence from biochemical and cellular studies. Together, there is considerable experimental support for the proposed hypothesis that increased metabolic formation of toxic one-carbon metabolites in diabetic patients contributes importantly to the development of various clinical complications.
