25313920|t|Kinetic intermediates in amyloid assembly.
25313920|a|In contrast to an expected Ostwald-like ripening of amyloid assemblies, the nucleating core of the Dutch mutant of the Abeta peptide of Alzheimer's disease assembles through a series of conformational transitions. Structural characterization of the intermediate assemblies by isotope-edited IR and solid-state NMR reveals unexpected strand orientation intermediates and suggests new nucleation mechanisms in a progressive assembly pathway.
