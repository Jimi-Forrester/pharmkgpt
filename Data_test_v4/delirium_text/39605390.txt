39605390|a|Abnormal accumulation of Tau protein in the brain disrupts normal cellular function and leads to neuronal death linked with many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. An attractive approach to mitigate Tau-induced neurodegeneration is to enhance the clearance of toxic Tau aggregates. We previously showed that upregulation of the fly gene mask protects against FUS- and Tau-induced photoreceptor degeneration in fly disease models. Here we have generated a transgenic mouse line carrying Cre-inducible ANKHD1, the mouse homolog of mask , to determine whether the protective role of mask is conserved from flies to mammals. Utilizing the TauP301S-PS19 mouse model for Tau-related dementia, we observed that ANKHD1 significantly reduced hyperphosphorylated human Tau in 6-month-old mice. Additionally, there was a notable trend towards reduced gliosis levels in these mice, suggesting a protective role of ANKHD1 against TauP301S-linked degeneration. Further analysis of 9-month- old mice revealed a similar trend of effects. Moreover, we found that ANKHD1 also suppresses the cognitive defect of 9-month-old PS19 female mice in novel object recognition (NOR) behavioral assay. Unlike previous therapeutic strategies that primarily focus on inhibiting Tau phosphorylation or directly clearing aggregates, this study highlights the novel role of ANKHD1 in promoting autophagy as a means to mitigate Tau pathology. This novel mechanism not only underscores ANKHD1's potential as a unique therapeutic target for tauopathies but also provides new insights into autophagy-based interventions for neurodegenerative diseases.
