29104136|a|The increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases represents a huge challenge for societies. These diseases are characterized by neuronal death and include several different pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Most of these pathologies are often associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins, such as amyloid-ss, tau, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin and prion proteins. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death in these diseases remain poorly understood. Nucleic acid aptamers represent a new class of ligands that could be useful to better understand these diseases and develop better diagnosis and therapy. In this review, several of these aptamers are presented as well as their applications for neurodegenerative diseases.
