12169219|a|There is growing realization that many neurodegenerative conditions have the same underlying pathogenetic mechanism: a change in protein conformation, where the beta-sheet content is increased. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid deposition in the form of neuritic plaques and congophilic angiopathy is driven by the conversion of normal soluble amyloid beta (sAbeta) to Abeta plaques, whereas in the prionoses the critical event is the conversion of normal prion protein, PrP(C), to PrP(Sc). This common theme in the pathogenesis of these disorders and the extracellular localization of the accumulating abnormal protein make them highly amenable to therapeutic approaches based on experimental manipulation of protein conformation and clearance. Different approaches under development include drugs that affect the processing of the precursor proteins, enhance clearance of the amyloidogenic protein, and inhibit or prevent the conformation change. Particularly interesting are recent studies of immune system activation, which appear to increase the clearance of the disease-associated protein. These immunologically based approaches are highly effective in animal models of these disorders, and in these model systems are associated with no obvious side effects. In transgenic mice with AD-related pathology, immunization has also been shown to prevent age-related cognitive impairment. However, the first clinical trial of this approach in AD patients was associated with unacceptable toxicity. These immune-based treatment approaches have great potential as rational therapies for this devastating group of disorders, but additional development is needed before they can be safely applied to humans.
