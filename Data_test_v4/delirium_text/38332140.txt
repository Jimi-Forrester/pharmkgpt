38332140|a|This manuscript presents the quantification and correlation of three aspects of Alzheimer's Disease evolution, including structural, biochemical, and cognitive assessments. We aimed to test a novel structural biomarker for neurodegeneration based on a cortical folding model for mammals. Our central hypothesis is that the cortical folding variable, representative of axonal tension in white matter, is an optimal discriminator of pathological aging and correlates with altered loadings in Cerebrospinal Fluid samples and a decline in cognition and memory. We extracted morphological features from T1w 3T MRI acquisitions using FreeSurfer from 77 Healthy Controls (age = 66 +- 8.4, 69% females), 31 Mild Cognitive Impairment (age = 72 +- 4.8, 61% females), and 13 Alzheimer's Disease patients (age = 77 +- 6.1, 62% females) of recruited volunteers in Brazil to test its discriminative power using optimal cut-point analysis. Cortical folding distinguishes the groups with reasonable accuracy (Healthy Control-Alzheimer's Disease, accuracy = 0.82; Healthy Control-Mild Cognitive Impairment, accuracy = 0.56). Moreover, Cerebrospinal Fluid biomarkers (total Tau, A[Formula: see text]1-40, A[Formula: see text]1-42, and Lipoxin) and cognitive scores (Cognitive Index, Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span Backward) were correlated with the global neurodegeneration in MRI aiming to describe health, disease, and the transition between the two states using morphology.
