38468130|t|Microglial activation in the lateral amygdala promotes anxiety-like behaviors in mice with chronic moderate noise exposure.
38468130|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term non-traumatic noise exposure, such as heavy traffic noise, can elicit emotional disorders in humans. However, the underlying neural substrate is still poorly understood. METHODS: We exposed mice to moderate white noise for 28 days to induce anxiety-like behaviors, measured by open-field, elevated plus maze, and light-dark box tests. In vivo multi-electrode recordings in awake mice were used to examine neuronal activity. Chemogenetics were used to silence specific brain regions. Viral tracing, immunofluorescence, and confocal imaging were applied to define the neural circuit and characterize the morphology of microglia. RESULTS: Exposure to moderate noise for 28 days at an 85-dB sound pressure level resulted in anxiety-like behaviors in open-field, elevated plus maze, and light-dark box tests. Viral tracing revealed that fibers projecting from the auditory cortex and auditory thalamus terminate in the lateral amygdala (LA). A noise-induced increase in spontaneous firing rates of the LA and blockade of noise-evoked anxiety-like behaviors by chemogenetic inhibition of LA glutamatergic neurons together confirmed that the LA plays a critical role in noise-induced anxiety. Noise-exposed animals were more vulnerable to anxiety induced by acute noise stressors than control mice. In addition to these behavioral abnormalities, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive microglia in the LA underwent corresponding morphological modifications, including reduced process length and branching and increased soma size following noise exposure. Treatment with minocycline to suppress microglia inhibited noise-associated changes in microglial morphology, neuronal electrophysiological activity, and behavioral changes. Furthermore, microglia-mediated synaptic phagocytosis favored inhibitory synapses, which can cause an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, leading to anxiety-like behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies LA microglial activation as a critical mediator of noise-induced anxiety-like behaviors, leading to neuronal and behavioral changes through selective synapse phagocytosis. Our results highlight the pivotal but previously unrecognized roles of LA microglia in chronic moderate noise-induced behavioral changes.
