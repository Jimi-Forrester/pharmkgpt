37292846|a|Background: The vagus nerve plays an important role in neuroimmune interactions and in the regulation of inflammation. A major source of efferent vagus nerve fibers that contribute to the regulation of inflammation is the brainstem dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMN) as recently shown using optogenetics. In contrast to optogenetics, electrical neuromodulation has broad therapeutic implications, but the anti-inflammatory efficacy of electrical DMN stimulation (eDMNS) was not previously investigated. Here, we examined the effects of eDMNS on heart rate (HR) and cytokine levels in murine endotoxemia as well as the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. Methods: Anesthetized male 8-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice on a stereotaxic frame were subjected to eDMNS using a concentric bipolar electrode inserted into the left or right DMN or sham stimulation. eDMNS (50, 250 or 500 muA and 30 Hz, for 1 min) was performed and HR recorded. In endotoxemia experiments, sham or eDMNS utilizing 250 muA or 50 muA was performed for 5 mins and was followed by LPS (0.5 mg/kg) i.p. administration. eDMNS was also applied in mice with cervical unilateral vagotomy or sham operation. In CLP experiments sham or left eDMNS was performed immediately post CLP. Cytokines and corticosterone were analyzed 90 mins after LPS administration or 24h after CLP. CLP survival was monitored for 14 days. Results: Either left or right eDMNS at 250 muA and 500 muA decreased HR, compared with pre- and post-stimulation. This effect was not observed at 50 muA. Left side eDMNS at 50 muA, compared with sham stimulation, significantly decreased serum and splenic levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF and increased serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 during endotoxemia. The anti-inflammatory effect of eDMNS was abrogated in mice with unilateral vagotomy and were not associated with serum corticosterone alterations. Right side eDMNS suppressed serum TNF levels but had no effects on serum IL-10 and on splenic cytokines. In mice with CLP, left side eDMNS suppressed serum TNF and IL-6, as well as splenic IL-6 and increased splenic IL-10 and significantly improved the survival rate of CLP mice. Conclusions: For the first time we show that a regimen of eDMNS which does not cause bradycardia alleviates LPS-induced inflammation and these effects require an intact vagus nerve and are not associated with corticosteroid alterations. eDMNS also decreases inflammation and improves survival in a model of polymicrobial sepsis. These findings are of interest for further studies exploring bioelectronic anti-inflammatory approaches targeting the brainstem DMN.
