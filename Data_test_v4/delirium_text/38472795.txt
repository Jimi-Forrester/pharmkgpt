38472795|t|Oral Administration of Euonymus alatus Leaf Extract Ameliorates Alzheimer's Disease Phenotypes in 5xFAD Transgenic Mice.
38472795|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and is frequently characterized by progressive and irreversible impairment of cognitive functions. However, its etiology remains poorly understood, limiting therapeutic interventions. Our previous study showed that the ethanol extract of Euonymus alatus leaves (EA) positively affected scopolamine-induced hypomnesia in the normal mouse model by promoting nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. Herein, we examined whether EA administration could ameliorate major AD phenotypes that are manifested in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Two-month-old mice were orally administered with EA at a dose of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg body weight/day thrice a week for 14 weeks. We observed that EA administration improved behavioral deficits as assessed by the passive avoidance, Morris water maze, and Y-maze tasks; decreased the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha and IL-1beta; decreased the protein expression levels of inflammatory mediators in the hippocampus; and attenuated histological damage and amyloid beta plaques in the hippocampal region of 5xFAD mouse brain. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the effectiveness was partially attributed to quercetin, which was noted to be a component of EA. Hence, these findings suggest that a long-term administration of EA could alleviate AD symptoms and delay its progression.
