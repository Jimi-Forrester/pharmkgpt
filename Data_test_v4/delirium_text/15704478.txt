15704478|t|[A comparative analysis of cognitive disturbances in dementia with Levy's bodies and Alzheimer's disease].
15704478|a|Basing on a neuropsychological study of 50 patients with dementia with Levy's bodies (DLB) and 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), peculiarities of cognitive impairment in these diseases are discussed. In similar severity of dementia, patients with DLB demonstrated a greater impairment of executive and visual-spatial functions as well as neurodynamic disturbances and patients with AD had more severe memory impairment.
