33800094|a|BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 infection often leads to impairments requiring pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) following the acute phase. Little is known about the efficacy of PR in these patients. We therefore compared post-COVID-19 patients (PG) referred to PR patients with other lung diseases (LG). METHODS: 99 PG were admitted to PR. In a prospective design, the results of PG were collected and compared to the results of LG of 2019 (n = 419) according to Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), 6-min walk test (6-MWT), duration of PR, and Feeling Thermometer (FT). RESULTS: According to age, sex, and CIRS, both groups showed no significant differences. The improvements in the 6-MWT in the pre to post comparison were on average 180 (+-101) meters for PG and 102 (+-89) meters for LG (p < 0.001). FT showed a significant enhancement for PG of 21 (+-14) points and for LG of 17 (+-16) points (p < 0.039), while FIM significantly increased by 11 (+-10) points in PG and 7 (+-8) points in LG (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive PR in PG is very effective according to the results in FIM, 6-MWT and FT. Therefore, we recommend PR following severe post-COVID-19 infections.
