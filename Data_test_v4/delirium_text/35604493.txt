35604493|t|A systematic review on neutrophil extracellular traps and its prognostication role in COVID-19 patients.
35604493|a|Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs composed of neutrophil granular and nuclear elements. Because of the potentially dangerous amplification circuit between inflammation and tissue damage, NETs are becoming one of the investigated components in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize studies on the role of NETs in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The study used six databases: PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCOHost, Europe PMC, ProQuest, and Scopus. This literature search was implemented until October 31, 2021. The search terms were determined specifically for each databases, generally included the Neutrophil Extracellular Traps, COVID-19, and prognosis. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was then used to assess the risk of bias. Ten studies with a total of 810 participants were chosen based on the attainment of the prerequisite. Two were of high quality, seven were of moderate quality, and the rest were of low quality. The majority of studies compared COVID-19 to healthy control. Thrombosis was observed in three studies, while four studies recorded the need for mechanical ventilation. In COVID-19 patients, the early NETs concentration or the evolving NETs degradations can predict patient mortality. Based on their interactions with inflammatory and organ dysfunction markers, it is concluded that NETs play a significant role in navigating the severity of COVID-19 patients and thus impacting their prognosis.
