36008755|t|Exploring Lead loci shared between schizophrenia and Cardiometabolic traits.
36008755|a|Individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) have, on average, a 10- to 20-year shorter expected life span than the rest of the population, primarily due to cardiovascular disease comorbidity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously been used to separately identify common variants in SCZ and cardiometabolic traits. However, genetic variants jointly influencing both traits remain to be fully characterised. To assess overlaps (if any) between the genetic architecture of SCZ and cardiometabolic traits, we used conditional false discovery rate (FDR) and local genetic correlation statistical framework analyses. A conjunctional FDR was used to identify shared genetic traits between SCZ and cardiometabolic risk factors. We identified 144 genetic variants which were shared between SCZ and body mass index (BMI), and 15 variants shared between SCZ and triglycerides (TG). Furthermore, we discovered four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3865350, rs9860913, rs13307 and rs9614186) and four proximate genes (DERL2, SNX4, LY75 and EFCAB6) which were shared by SCZ and BMI. We observed that the novel genetic variant rs13307 and the most proximate gene LY75 exerted potential effects on SCZ and BMI comorbidity. Also, we observed a mixture of concordant and opposite direction associations with shared genetic variants. We demonstrated a moderate to high genetic overlap between SCZ and cardiometabolic traits associated with a pattern of bidirectional associations. Our data suggested a complex interplay between metabolism-related gene pathways in SCZ pathophysiology.
