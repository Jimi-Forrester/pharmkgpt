12819821|t|Neuropeptides in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
12819821|a|Owing to the heterogeneity of cognitive dysfunctions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a single drug may not suffice. Combination therapy may be the most appropriate solution, but the cognitive networks in the brain have yet to be unraveled. In the years ahead, more comprehensive and precise knowledge of neurological function will allow scientists to pinpoint ever more sophisticated and effective therapeutic options for AD patients. In this review, the author discusses the currently known advantages and disadvantages of neuropeptides and how they may provide yet another drug target for AD treatment.
