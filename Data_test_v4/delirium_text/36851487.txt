36851487|t|Pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematous in COVID-19 Era.
36851487|a|Pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disorder with a highly variable course and prognosis. It results in functional abnormalities in the immune system due to intrinsic factors and the use of immunosuppressive therapies associated with underlying comorbidities seem to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 and poor outcomes of the disease in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The aim of this review is to obtain a better understanding of the existing link between this new viral infection and pediatric lupus. We have analyzed the characteristics of newly diagnosed cases of pediatric SLE following COVID-19 which have been reported in the literature and which describe the impact that COVID-19 has on patients already suffering with pediatric SLE.
