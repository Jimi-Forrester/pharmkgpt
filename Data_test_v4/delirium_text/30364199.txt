30364199|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the common progressive neurodegenerative disorders with several motor and non-motor symptoms. Most of the motor symptoms may appear at a late stage where most of the dopaminergic neurons have been already damaged. In order to provide better clinical intervention and treatment at the onset of disease, it is imperative to find accurate biomarkers for early diagnosis, including prodromal diagnosis and preclinical diagnosis. At the same time, these reliable biomarkers can also be utilized to monitor the progress of the disease. In this review article, we will discuss recent advances in the development of PD biomarkers from different aspects, including clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging and genetic aspects. Although various biomarkers for PD have been developed so far, their specificity and sensitivity are not ideal when applied individually. So, the combination of multimodal biomarkers will greatly improve the diagnostic accuracy and facilitate the implementation of personalized medicine.
