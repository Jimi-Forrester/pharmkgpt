35889193|a|Gut microbiota performs indispensable functions in the pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis (AH). We investigated the effects of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011 and Lactobacillus helveticus for gut microbial restoration toward eubiosis in patients with AH. A multicenter, double-blind, and randomized trial was conducted. Probiotics (n = 44) and placebo (n = 45) groups received, during 7 days, L. rhamnosus R0011/L. helveticus R0052 at 120 mg/day and placebo. All patients were hospitalized to ensure abstinence. Liver function, lipopolysaccharide level, and stool analysis were evaluated in patients before and after 7 days of treatment. At baseline, the dominant bacteria were Gram-negative in both groups which decreased after the probiotics treatment and exhibited a significant reduction in lipopolysaccharide level (p < 0.001). The probiotics ameliorated the Child-Pugh scores (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the probiotics group showed a decline in the levels of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (p < 0.05). The probiotics changed the gut microbial composition at various taxonomical levels. The proportion of Bacteroidetes (147%) was increased after 7 days of probiotics supplementation while Proteobacteria (30%) and Fusobacteria (0%) were decreased. Administration of L. rhamnosus R0011 and L. helveticus R0052 conceivably associated with restoration of gut microbiome in AH patients and improved AH by modulating the gut-liver axis.
