8177532|t|Regional differences in apolipoprotein E immunoreactivity in diffuse plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain.
8177532|a|Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) has been shown to be closely associated with beta amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In the present study, we have found strong Apo E immunoreactivity in the amyloid cores of senile plaques (SP) in the various brain regions examined. However, Apo E immunoreactivity in diffuse plaques varied distinctly and was strong within numerous cerebellar and cortical diffuse plaques, and absent or very weak within diffuse plaques in the striatum/thalamus. This distribution of Apo E immunoreactivity in SP correlates with the occurrence of small amounts of fibrillar amyloid in diffuse plaques that has been described in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, but not in the basal ganglia. These results show that Apo E may be associated with sites of beta amyloid fibril formation in diffuse plaques in AD brain, but they also suggest that factors other than Apo E, probably local, may influence fibrillogenesis.
