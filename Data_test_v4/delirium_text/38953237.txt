38953237|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 55 million individuals globally. Diagnosis typically occurs in advanced stages, and there are limited options for reversing symptoms. Preventive strategies are, therefore, crucial. Time Restricted Eating (TRE) or Time Restricted Feeding (TRF) is one such strategy. Here we review recent research on AD and TRE/TRF in addition to AD biomarkers and gut microbiota. METHODS: A comprehensive review of recent studies was conducted to assess the impact of TRE/TRF on AD-related outcomes. This includes the analysis of how TRE/TRF influences circadian rhythms, beta-amyloid 42 (Ass42), pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and gut microbiota composition. RESULTS: TRE/TRF impacts circadian rhythms and can influence cognitive performance as observed in AD. It lowers beta-amyloid 42 deposition in the brain, a key AD biomarker, and reduces pro-ininflammatory cytokines. The gut microbiome has emerged as a modifiable factor in AD treatment. TRE/TRF changes the structure and composition of the gut microbiota, leading to increased diversity and a decrease in harmful bacteria. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the potential of TRE/TRF as a preventive strategy for AD. By reducing Ass42 plaques, modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and altering gut microbiota composition, TRE/TRF may slow the progression of AD. Further research is needed to confirm these effects and to understand the mechanisms involved. This review highlights TRE/TRF as a promising non-pharmacological intervention in the fight against AD.
