37083500|t|Delirium and Previous Psychiatric History Independently Predict Poststroke Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
37083500|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is an acute brain dysfunction that has been correlated with adverse mental health outcomes, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, delirium has not been studied in relation to mental health outcomes after cerebrovascular events. This study aimed to examine the incidence of PTSD after nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and identify new predictors of poststroke PTSD symptoms. METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 205 patients diagnosed with nontraumatic ICH. Demographics and hospital course data were examined. Univariate and multivariable correlational analyses were performed to determine predictors of PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were assessed using PTSD checklist-civilian version (PCL-C) scores. RESULTS: Diagnostic criteria for a positive PTSD screen (PCL-C score >=44) were met by 13.7%, 20.2%, and 11.6% of nontraumatic patients with ICH at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. On univariate analysis, younger age, female sex, unemployed, and in-hospital delirium were correlated with higher PCL-C scores. In multivariable models, younger age, female sex, unemployed, in-hospital delirium, and a previous anxiety or depression diagnosis were associated with higher PCL-C scores at different follow-up times. Modified Rankin Scale scores were also positively correlated with PCL-C scores at each time point. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium, previous psychiatric history, younger age, female sex, and unemployment status were found to be associated with a greater degree of posthemorrhagic stroke PTSD symptoms. More significant PTSD symptoms were also correlated with greater functional impairment. A better understanding of patient susceptibility to PTSD symptoms may help providers coordinate earlier interventions.
