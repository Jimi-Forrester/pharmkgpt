39124670|a|Background: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) are prion diseases characterized by severe neurodegenerative conditions and a short duration of illness. Methods: This study explores the characteristics of hospitalizations for CJD and FFI in Spain from 2016 to 2022 using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database (SNHDD). Results: We identified a total of 1063 hospital discharges, including 1020 for CJD and 43 for FFI. Notably, the number of hospitalized patients with FFI showed a significant peak in 2017. The average length of hospital stay (LOHS) was 13 days for CJD and 6 days for FFI, with in-hospital mortality rates (IHM) of 36.37% for CJD and 32.56% for FFI. Among CJD patients, the average LOHS was 14 days, with a significantly longer duration for those who experienced IHM. Conclusions: The presence of sepsis or pneumonia and older age were associated with a higher IHM rate among CJD patients. The total estimated cost for managing CJD and FFI patients over the study period was EUR 6,346,868. This study offers new insights into the epidemiology and healthcare resource utilization of CJD and FFI patients, which may inform future research directions and public health strategies.
