34585328|a|Microglia activation and associated inflammation are implicated in the periventricular white matter damage (PWMD) in septic postnatal rats. This study investigated whether melatonin would mitigate inflammation and alleviate the axonal hypomyelination in the corpus callosum in septic postnatal rats. We further explored if this might be related to the modulation of microglial polarization from M1 phenotype to M2 through the JAK2/STAT3/telomerase pathway. We reported here that indeed melatonin not only can it reduce the neurobehavioral disturbances in LPS-injected rats, but it can also dampen microglia-mediated inflammation. Thus, in LPS + melatonin group, the expression of proinflammatory mediators in M1 phenotype microglia was downregulated. As opposed to this, M2 microglia were increased which was accompanied by upregulated expression of anti-inflammatory mediators along with telomerase reverse transcriptase or melatonin receptor 1(MT1). In parallel to this was decreased NG2 expression but increased expression of myelin and neurofilament proteins. Melatonin can improve hypomyelination which was confirmed by electron microscopy. In vitro in primary microglia stimulated by LPS, melatonin decreased the expression of proinflammatory mediators significantly; but it increased the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, the expression levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were significantly elevated in microglia after melatonin treatment. Remarkably, the effect of melatonin on LPS-treated microglia was blocked by melatonin receptor, JAK2, STAT3 and telomerase reverse transcriptase inhibitors, respectively. Taken together, it is concluded that melatonin can attenuate PWMD through shifting M1 microglia towards M2 via MT1/JAK2/STAT3/telomerase pathway. The results suggest a new therapeutic strategy whereby melatonin may be adopted to convert microglial polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype that would ultimately contribute to the attenuation of PWMD.
