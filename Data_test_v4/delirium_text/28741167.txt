28741167|a|Cerebral and systemic organ microvascular pathologies coexist with human Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. In this study, we hypothesised that both cerebral and systemic microvascular pathologies exist in 4- to 5-month-old male APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. To assess this we examined recognition memory in both wild-type and APP/PS1 mice using the object recognition task (ORT; n = 11 per group) and counted thioflavin-S-positive plaques in brain (n = 6 per group). Vascular casts of brain, liver, spleen and kidneys were examined using scanning electron microscopy (n = 6 per group), and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR; n = 5 per group) was measured as an index of glomerular permeability. Murine recognition memory was intact, as demonstrated by a significant preference for the novel object in the ORT paradigm. Brain sections of wild-type mice were devoid of thioflavin-S positivity, whereas age-matched APP/PS1 mice had an average of 0.88 +- 0.22 thioflavin-S-positive plaques in the cortex, 0.42 +- 0.17 plaques in the dentate gyrus and 0.30 +- 0.07 plaques in the cornus ammonis 1 region. The profiles of casted cerebral capillaries of wild-type mice were smooth and regular in contrast to those of APP/PS1 mice which demonstrate characteristic (0.5-4.6 mum) 'tags'. APP/PS1 mice also had a significantly reduced hepatic vessel number (p = 0.0002) and an increase in the number of splenic microvascular pillars (p = 0.0231), in the absence of changes in either splenic microvascular density (p = 0.3746) or glomerular ultrastructure. The highly significant reduction in uACR in APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type (p = 0.0079) is consistent with glomerular microvascular dysfunction. These findings highlight early microvascular pathologies in 4- to 5-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and may indicate an amenable target for pharmacological intervention in AD.
