39859269|t|Diverse Interactions of Sterols with Amyloid Precursor Protein Transmembrane Domain Can Shift Distribution Between Alternative Amyloid-beta Production Cascades in Manner Dependent on Local Lipid Environment.
39859269|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is correlated with the membrane content of various lipid species, including cholesterol, whose interactions with amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been extensively explored. Amyloid-beta peptides triggering AD are products of APP cleavage by secretases, which differ depending on the APP and secretase location relative to ordered or disordered membrane microdomains. We used high-resolution NMR to probe the interactions of the cholesterol analog with APP transmembrane domain in two membrane-mimicking systems resembling ordered or perturbed lipid environments (bicelles/micelles). In bicelles, spin-labeled sterol interacted with the peptide near the amphiphilic juxtamembrane region and N-terminal part of APP transmembrane helix, as described earlier for cholesterol. Upon transition into micellar environment, another interaction site appeared where sterol polar head was buried in the hydrophobic core near the hinge region. In MD simulations, sterol moved between three interaction sites, sliding along the polar groove formed by glycine residues composing the dimerization interfaces and flexible hinge of the APP transmembrane domain. Because the lipid environment modulates interactions, the role of lipids in the AD pathogenesis is defined by the state of the entire lipid subsystem rather than the effects of individual lipid species. Cholesterol can interplay with other lipids (polyunsaturated, gangliosides, etc.), determining the outcome of amyloid-beta production cascades.
