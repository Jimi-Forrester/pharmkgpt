37767130|a|A variety of Alzheimer disease (AD) mouse models has been established and characterized within the last decades. These models are generated to meet the principal criteria of AD isomorphism, homology and predictability to a maximum extent. To get an integrative view of the sophisticated etiopathogenesis of AD, whole genome transcriptome data analysis turns out to be indispensable. Here, we present a microarray-based transcriptome data collection based on RNA extracted from the retrosplenial (RS) cortex and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 AD mice and control animals. Experimental animals were age matched and importantly, both sexes were considered separately. Isolated RNA was purified, quantified und quality controlled prior to the hybridization procedure with SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression v2 8 x 60K microarrays. Following immunofluorescent measurement und preprocessing/extraction of image data, raw transcriptome data were uploaded including differentially expressed gene candidates and related fold changes in APP/PS1 AD mice and controls. Our data allow further insight into alterations in gene transcript levels in APP/PS1 AD mice compared to controls and enable the reader/user to carry out complex transcriptome analysis to characterize potential age-, sex- and brain-region-specific alterations in e.g., neuroinflammatory, immunological, neurodegenerative and ion channel pathways.
