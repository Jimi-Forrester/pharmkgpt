32470386|t|Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease: Current Evidence and Therapeutic Opportunities.
32470386|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent two major health burdens with steadily increasing prevalence and accumulating evidence indicates a close relationship between the two disorders. In view of their similar pathogenesis, the potential of T2DM drugs for the treatment of AD has attracted considerable attention in recent years, with inspiring outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of a total of 14 individual drugs (among which are seven T2DM drug types) against AD. Further, we discuss the potential action mechanisms of these T2DM drugs against AD. We argue that these findings may open novel avenues for AD drug discovery, drug target identification, and cotreatment of the two disorders.
