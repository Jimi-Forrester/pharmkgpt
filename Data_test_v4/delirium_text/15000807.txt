15000807|t|Serotoninergic polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR and 5-HT2A): association studies with psychosis in Alzheimer disease.
15000807|a|Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) often exhibit psychotic symptoms associated with cognitive impairment. A few association studies have been carried out to determine if the serotonin transporter and receptor genes are potential risk factors for AD and/or associated psychopathology. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of a serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and the 5-HT2A receptor T102C polymorphism with the risk of developing dementia and/or psychotic symptoms in a group of sporadic AD patients from Italy. No significant differences in the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of 5-HTTLPR and 5-HT2A T102C were found between patient and control groups. However, a significant association between the C102/C102 5-HT2A genotype and psychotic symptoms (p < 0.001) was observed. Our data strongly confirm results from previous studies suggesting that the C102 allele of the 5-HT2A receptor is associated with the occurrence of psychotic symptoms in AD. On the contrary, the serotonin transporter does not appear to be a major susceptibility factor in the pathophysiology of the disease.
