26578658|t|Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging in Stroke: Cross-Sectional and Follow-Up Assessment of Amyloid in Ischemic Stroke.
26578658|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiovascular risk factors significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease. A possible mechanism may be via ischemic infarction-driving amyloid deposition. We conducted a study to determine the presence of beta-amyloid in infarct, peri-infarct, and hemispheric areas after stroke. We hypothesized that an infarct would trigger beta-amyloid deposition, with deposition over time. METHODS: Patients were recruited within 40 days of acute ischemic stroke and imaged with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) positron emission tomographic scans. Follow-up positron emission tomographic scanning was performed in a subgroup <=18 months after the stroke event. Standardized uptake value ratios for regions of interest were analyzed after coregistration. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were imaged with (11)C-PiB positron emission tomography. There was an increase in (11)C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area compared with a reference region in the contralesional hemisphere, which was not statistically significant (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.07 [95% confidence interval, -0.06 to 0.123]; P=0.452). There was no significant increase in the accumulation of (11)C-PiB in the peri-infarct region or in the ipsilesional hemisphere (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.04 [95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.10]; P=0.095). We repeated (11)C-PiB positron emission tomography in 21 patients and found a significant reduction in accumulation of (11)C-PiB between regions of interest (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, -0.08 [95% confidence interval, -0.23 to -0.03]; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant increase in (11)C-PiB accumulation in or around the infarct. There was no increase in ipsilesional hemispheric (11)C-PiB accumulation over time. We found no evidence that infarction leads to sustained or increased beta-amyloid deposition <=18 months after stroke.
