30728759|a|Based on the concept of the tripartite synapse, we have reviewed the role of glucose-derived compounds in glycolytic pathways in astroglial cells. Glucose provides energy and substrate replenishment for brain activity, such as glutamate and lipid synthesis. In addition, glucose metabolism in the astroglial cytoplasm results in products such as lactate, methylglyoxal, and glutathione, which modulate receptors and channels in neurons. Glucose has four potential destinations in neural cells, and it is possible to propose a crossroads in "X" that can be used to describe these four destinations. Glucose-6P can be used either for glycogen synthesis or the pentose phosphate pathway on the left and right arms of the X, respectively. Fructose-6P continues through the glycolysis pathway until pyruvate is formed but can also act as the initial compound in the hexosamine pathway, representing the left and right legs of the X, respectively. We describe each glucose destination and its regulation, indicating the products of these pathways and how they can affect synaptic communication. Extracellular L-lactate, either generated from glucose or from glycogen, binds to HCAR1, a specific receptor that is abundantly localized in perivascular and post-synaptic membranes and regulates synaptic plasticity. Methylglyoxal, a product of a deviation of glycolysis, and its derivative D-lactate are also released by astrocytes and bind to GABAA receptors and HCAR1, respectively. Glutathione, in addition to its antioxidant role, also binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the synaptic cleft. Finally, we examined the hexosamine pathway and evaluated the effect of GlcNAc-modification on key proteins that regulate the other glucose destinations.
