33557022|t|Size-Specific Copper Nanoparticle Cytotoxicity Varies between Human Cell Lines.
33557022|a|Commercially available copper nanoparticles of three different sizes were tested for cytotoxicity against three human cell lines using four different cytotoxicity assays. This array of data was designed to elucidate trends in particle stability, uptake, and cytotoxicity. The copper nanoparticles are not stable in cell culture media, and rapid changes over the time course of the assays play a critical role in the measured endpoints. Typically, the 40-60 nm particles tested were more cytotoxic than either smaller or larger particles. These particles were also taken up more readily by cells and exhibited different stability dynamics in cell culture media. This provides a good correlation between total cellular uptake of copper and cytotoxicity that may be directly linked to particle stability, though it is unclear why the intermediate-sized particles exhibited these unique properties when compared with both larger and smaller particles.
