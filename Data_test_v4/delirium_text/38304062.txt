38304062|t|Case Report: Carcinoid heart disease with severe tricuspid regurgitation and concomitant patent foramen ovale causing severe hypoxia.
38304062|a|This case report demonstrates a unique case of managing complex concomitant structural cardiac issues using transcatheter techniques in a frail patient. The primary regurgitant lesion in this case caused significant right to left shunting with severely debilitating hypoxaemia for the patient, requiring high volumes of ambulatory oxygen to compensate. We would like to highlight the role of multi-modality cardiac imaging demonstrated in this case, as well as the limited surgical data and poor outcomes in advanced disease with higher peri-operative complications. Finally, it should be noted that percutaneous correction of structural lesions may provide palliative relief but carries an uncertain risk of recurrence.
