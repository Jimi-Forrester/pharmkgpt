25483559|a|The natural product resveratrol possesses diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and anti-aging effects in multiple organisms. The neuroprotective role of resveratrol has recently been reported in a cell model of amyloid (A)beta(25-35)-induced neurotoxic injury using PC12 cells. However, the pathomechanism by which resveratrol inhibits neuronal apoptosis has remained to be elucidated. The present study therefore aimed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in an Abeta(25-35)-induced model of neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects. It was demonstrated that resveratrol exerted neuronal protection through inhibition of cell apoptosis, which was associated with an increased acetylation level of p53. In accordance with this effect, when the acetylation level of p53 was decreased by p53 acetylation inhibitor pifithrin-alpha, the protective effects of resveratrol were abrogated. In conclusion, it was revealed that resveratrol inhibited Abeta(25-35)-induced cell apoptosis via the acetylation of p53 in PC12 cells.
