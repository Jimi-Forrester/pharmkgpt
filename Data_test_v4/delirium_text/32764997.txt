32764997|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether Chikungunya virus infection (CVI) was an independent risk factor for 2-year mortality in Afro-Caribbean subjects aged 65 years or older. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2014 to December 2016 in the University Hospital of Martinique. Subjects aged >=65 years admitted to the hospital were included. Baseline characteristics and concurrent manifestations at admission were collected. Subjects were followed up by phone for 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 687 old Afro-Caribbean subjects (80.4+-8.0 years) were included: 467 positive for CVI (Chik+) and 220 negative for CVI (Chik-). During the follow-up, 180 (26.2%) died. The proportion of deaths was higher among Chik- (40.9%) than among Chik+ subjects (21.6%) (p<0.0001). By multivariable analysis, when adjusted for age polyarthralgia, neurological troubles, cardiovascular disorders, absence of neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and hospital stay, Chik+ subjects had significantly higher survival rates (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.85) than Chik- ones. CONCLUSION: Within the two years following hospital admission of subjects aged >=65 years or older, Chik+ subjects had significantly higher survival rates than Chik- ones.
