16398156|t|[A systematic review of multifactorial interventions for primary prevention of delirium in the elderly].
16398156|a|Delirium is a severe psychiatric syndrome that is highly prevalent in elderly patients in a general hospital. Primary prevention is important to prevent delirium. This article reviews recent developments with regard to multifactorial intervention trials for primary prevention of delirium. The review process involved a systematic search in MEDLINE, The Cochrane Database and CINAHL Database and subsequent examination of reference lists. Six studies were selected. Four studies showed that systemic interventions regarding medical-, nurse-led, environmental-, and educational items, were effective in preventing delirium. In one study a reduction was found in duration and severity of duration only. One study showed no effect on delirium at all. Despite the methodological weaknesses of the studies, conclusions are that different kinds of non-pharmacological interventions can be effective in preventing delirium.
