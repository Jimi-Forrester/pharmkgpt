34165644|t|Oropharyngeal Dysphagia After Hospitalization for COVID-19 Disease: Our Screening Results.
34165644|a|A high percentage of patients suffered symptoms also after recovery from the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. It is not well clear what are the specific long-term sequelae (complications and symptoms). During the acute phase the patients may develop a multi-organ system pathology including aerodigestive tract. As the pathophysiology of COVID-19 emerges, the aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia after COVID-19 disease. From March to July 2020 we enrolled patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection who had been previously hospitalized for the disease. They were screened for dysphagia by mean of the Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10). The cases with EAT-10 score > 3 were graded for the aspiration risk by applying the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and were submitted to the Swal-QoL questionnaire. The cases with a GUSS score > 19 were subjected to FEES. 8/117 (7%) patients had positive screening result. 4/8 (50%) revealed an abnormal health related quality of life in oropharyngeal dysphagia with a mean Swal-QoL score of 69.73. The most affected domain was the "time of meals" (mean score 65) following by the "sleep" (mean score 66) and "eating desire" (mean score 72). 1/8 cases showed increased risk for aspiration and did not showed endoscopic signs of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Our results showed that the prevalence of upper dysphagia after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 is not anecdotal and that probably this long-lasting sequela has a psychogenic etiology.
