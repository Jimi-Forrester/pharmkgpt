36294963|t|The Neuroprotective Effect of NEUROMIDE, a Compound Bioidentical to Commensal Bacteria Metabolites.
36294963|a|GPR119 is a novel cannabinoid receptor that is primarily expressed in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract and has beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis exerted through the stimulation of GLP-1 secretion, as demonstrated in the rodent brain. GLP-1 also has important anti-inflammatory effects in chronic inflammatory diseases, including type 1 and 2 diabetes, asthma, psoriasis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the effect of the gut microbiota on both the gut and the brain. However, few studies have examined how gut microbes affect brain health through the endocannabinoid system. NEUROMIDE is a compound that shares a bioidentical structure with certain commensal bacterial metabolites, acting as a CB1 and GPR119 agonist. In an in vitro system exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), pretreatment with NEUROMIDE resulted in a significant increase in cell viability. The ROS-exposed system also showed decreased acetylcholine and an increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, changes that were counteracted in a dose-dependent manner in the NEUROMIDE treatment groups. To measure the effectiveness of NEUROMIDE in an in vivo system, we used scopolamine-treated mice as a neurodegenerative disease model and performed a series of passive avoidance tests to observe and quantify the cognitive impairment of the mice. Mice in the NEUROMIDE treatment group had increased latency time, thus indicating an improvement in their cognitive function. Furthermore, the NEUROMIDE treatment groups showed dose-dependent increases in acetylcholine along with decreases in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. These experiments demonstrate that NEUROMIDE can potentially be used for neuroprotection and the improvement of cognitive ability.
