36590531|a|Brain diseases are very heterogeneous; however they also display multiple common risk factors and comorbidities. With a paucity of disease-modifying therapies, prevention became a health priority. Towards prevention, one strategy is to focus on similar symptoms of brain diseases occurring before disease onset. Cognitive deficits are a promising candidate as they occur across brain diseases before disease onset. Based on recent research, this review highlights the similarity of brain diseases and discusses how early cognitive deficits can be exploited to tackle disease prevention. After briefly introducing common risk factors, I review common comorbidities across brain diseases, with a focus on cognitive deficits before disease onset, reporting both experimental and clinical findings. Next, I describe network abnormalities associated with early cognitive deficits and discuss how these abnormalities can be targeted to prevent disease onset. A scenario on brain disease etiology with the idea that early cognitive deficits may constitute a common symptom of brain diseases is proposed.
