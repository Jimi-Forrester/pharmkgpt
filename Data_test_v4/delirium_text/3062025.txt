3062025|a|Electrophoretic studies of human CSF proteins from patients with diseases of the NS are reviewed. Various 1-DE methods are of similar value in identifying the non-specific OBs, which are helpful in the diagnosis of MS and recurrent GBS. In early and subclinical MS, OBs are of prognostic value, with IEF gels having the greater resolution. Silver-stained 2-DE gels provide the equivalent information to the OBs on 1-DE gels, with even greater sensitivity, and yield additional disease-associated protein data. Two proteins have proven to have diagnostic value in CJD and other changes that are still being evaluated have been identified in Parkinson's disease, GBS, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and Herpes simplex encephalitis. The vastly improved CSF protein information obtained with silver-stained 2-DE gels heralds both a change from the relatively limited applications with 1-DE methods and also the need to adopt this approach in the routine clinical laboratory.
