39726673|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has witnessed a gradual rise in its prevalence in recent decades, particularly impacting a substantial segment of individuals aged 85 and above. The core pathological features of AD involve the presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed due to the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Current AD treatments primarily provide symptomatic relief without addressing the fundamental disease progression. Given the sluggish pace of finding a definitive AD cure, research has shifted its focus towards pioneering approaches. There is an increasing emphasis on targeting the early stages of AD, with the aim of intervening before irreversible pathological changes take hold, thus preserving cognitive function and neuronal health. In recent years, significant strides have been made in the development and subsequent clinical testing of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) designed to potentially alter the underlying pathophysiology of AD. These therapeutic strategies involve the utilization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically directed at Abeta. Some of the drugs falling into this category include aducanumab, bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, solanezumab, and lecanemab. These treatment approaches are grounded in the hypothesis that a systemic failure in clearing Abeta contributes to the initiation and progression of AD. Recently, aducanumab and lecanemab have received FDA approval for the treatment of AD with mild cognitive impairment. This review offers a comprehensive summation of recent research endeavors that delve into the therapeutic effects and clinical trial outcomes of aducanumab and lecanemab in individuals afflicted by AD.
