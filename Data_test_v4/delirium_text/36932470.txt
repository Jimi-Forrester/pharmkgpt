36932470|t|A narrative review of treatment interventions to improve cognitive performance in schizophrenia, with an emphasis on at-risk and early course stages.
36932470|a|Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), which unfavorably affects SCZ patients' daily functioning and overall clinical outcome. An increasing body of evidence has shown that cognitive deficits are present not only at the beginning of the illness but also several years before the onset of psychosis. Nonetheless, the majority of treatment interventions targeting cognitive dysfunction in SCZ, using both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches, have focused on chronic patients rather than individuals at high risk or in the early stages of the disease. In this article, we provide a narrative review of cognitive interventions in SCZ patients, with a particular focus on pre-emptive interventions in at-risk/early course individuals when available. Furthermore, we discuss current challenges for these pre-emptive treatment interventions and provide some suggestions on how future work may ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in these individuals.
