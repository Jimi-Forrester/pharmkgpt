30501125|t|Toward Exosome-Based Neuronal Diagnostic Devices.
30501125|a|Targeting exosome for liquid biopsy has gained significant attention for its diagnostic and therapeutic potential. For detecting neuronal disease diagnosis such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main technique for identifying AD still relies on positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging to detect the presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta). While the detection of Abeta in cerebrospinal fluid has also been suggested as a marker for AD, the lack of quantitative measurements has compromised existing assays. In cerebrospinal fluid, in addition to Abeta, T-Tau, and P-Tau, alpha-synuclein has been considered a biomarker of neurodegeneration. This review suggests that and explains how the exosome can be used as a neuronal diagnostic component. To this end, we summarize current progress in exosome preparation/isolation and quantification techniques and comment on the outlooks for neuronal exosome-based diagnostic techniques.
