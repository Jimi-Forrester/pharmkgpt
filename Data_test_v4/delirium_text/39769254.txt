39769254|t|The Influence of Genetic Polymorphisms in Cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1 and 2D6) Gene on the Susceptibility to Philadelphia Negative Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Sudanese Patients.
39769254|a|The most frequent type of leukemia in Africa is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The genetic background of the rarer Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) Ph-ve (BCR-ABL-ve) subform of CML is largely unknown in African patients. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the role of CYP1A1 and 2D6 SNPs in the pathogenesis of Ph-ve CML in the Sudanese population. A total of 126 patients were selected for analysis. DNA was isolated from Ph-ve CML patients and a control group for PCR-RFLP analysis of SNPs CYP1A1*2C and CYP2D6*4. The CYP1A1 gene significantly expressed the GG variant genotype (p < 0.05) in 23.1% of the Ph-ve CML patients and 8% of the control group. In contrast, the CYP2D6 GA genotype was strongly associated with a reduced risk of developing Ph-ve CML (p < 0.005) with a frequency of 50% in Ph-ve patients and 93% in the control group. CYP1A1 GG polymorphism was prevalent among patients with Ph-ve CML, suggesting its role in disease development. CYP2D6 GA (IM) polymorphism was uncommon among patients, compared with the control group, possibly indicating a protective role of the polymorphisms from Ph-ve CML. This study demonstrates an association between key metabolic SNPs and Ph-ve CML and highlights the role that altered xenobiotic metabolism may play in the development of several human leukemias.
