35887969|a|In the context of the manifestation of the phenomenon of normal aging and functional decline at older adults with neurodegenerative pathology, the development of physical activities and healthy lifestyle has become a priority that involves many decisions and responsibilities. Therefore, the study of the quality of life of the elderly in terms of delaying early aging and improving the lifestyle of patients with neurodegenerative diseases is a scientific challenge representing research of great interest and relevance. By promoting physical activity based on telerehabilitation programs or performed according to coordinated training either in the community or at home for both study groups, significant improvements have been obtained. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the intervention suitable patterns, surveys delivered through variables online platforms and tools to reflect the stagnation of early aging and the evolution of patients with PD and dementia. Our study involved selected original studies, intensively processed, which demonstrated through intervention specific tools, such as quantitative, qualitative, socio-economics, physical, and cognitive indicators, that significant improvements can be achieved in the process of early aging, but also significant progress in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. By searching the last five years of papers, our review, presents the importance of intervention by telerehabilitation or by scheduled physical exercises quantified by specific indicators.
