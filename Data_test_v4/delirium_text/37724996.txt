37724996|a|The microtubule (MT) instability observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is commonly attributed to hyperphosphorylation of the MT-associated protein, tau. In vivo PET imaging offers an opportunity to gain critical information about MT changes with the onset and development of AD and related dementia. We developed the first brain-penetrant MT PET ligand, [11C]MPC-6827, and evaluated its in vivo imaging utility in vervet monkeys. Consistent with our previous in vitro cell uptake and in vivo rodent imaging experiments, [11C]MPC-6827 uptake increased with MT destabilization. Radioactive uptake was inversely related to (cerebrospinal fluid) CSF Abeta42 levels and directly related to age in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of AD. Additionally, in vitro autoradiography studies also corroborated PET imaging results. Here, we report the preliminary results of PET imaging with [11C]MPC-6827 in four female vervet monkeys with high or low CSF Abeta42 levels, which have been shown to correlate with the Abeta plaque burden, similar to humans.
