10890808|t|Treating problem drinking.
10890808|a|Recent data suggest that most people experiencing alcohol problems have problems of mild to moderate severity. Relative to alcoholics, these drinkers have a shorter problem-drinking history, greater social and economic stability, and greater personal resources. This article describes a cognitive-behavioral treatment approach designed specifically for problem drinkers with low levels of physical dependence on alcohol who choose to reduce their drinking. After describing various drinking-reduction techniques, the article reviews empirical evidence for drinking-reduction training. The increasing availability of drinking-reduction interventions holds considerable promise for reducing alcohol-related dysfunction among problem drinkers.
