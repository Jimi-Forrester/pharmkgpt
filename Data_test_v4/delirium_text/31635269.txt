31635269|t|Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound Prevents Recurrent Ischemic Stroke in a Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Mouse Model via Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Induction.
31635269|a|The incidence of stroke recurrence is still higher despite the advanced progression of therapeutic treatment and medical technology. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been demonstrated to possess therapeutic effects on neuronal diseases and stroke via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induction. In this study, we hypothesized that LIPUS treatment possessed therapeutic benefits for the improvement of stroke recurrence. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery and then followed to secondary MCAO surgery as a stroke recurrence occurred after nine days from the first MCAO. LIPUS was administered continuously for nine days before secondary MCAO. LIPUS treatment not only decreased the mortality but also significantly moderated neuronal function injury including neurological score, motor activity, and brain pathological score in the recurrent stroke mice. Furthermore, the administration of LIPUS attenuated the apoptotic neuronal cells and increased Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression ratio and accelerated the expression of BDNF in the brain of the recurrent stroke mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that LIPUS treatment arouses the expression of BDNF and possesses a therapeutic benefit for the improvement of stroke recurrence in a mouse model. The neuroprotective potential of LIPUS may provide a useful strategy for the prevention of a recurrent stroke.
