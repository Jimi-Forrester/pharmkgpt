10629363|t|A study of remote memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease by using the family line test.
10629363|a|We evaluated remote autobiographical memory impairment in 25 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 25 sex-, age- and education-matched healthy subjects by using a newly developed, highly effective assessment tool for remote memory, the Family Line Test (FLT). The FLT yields a total score, scores for 3 lifetime periods and the duration of remote memory impairment. In the patients with AD, the total score was significantly lower and the duration of remote memory impairment was significantly longer than in the healthy controls. A prominent temporal gradient in remote memory impairment was documented in the patients with AD. The total FLT score and duration of remote memory impairment correlated with recent memory and general cognitive dysfunctions.
