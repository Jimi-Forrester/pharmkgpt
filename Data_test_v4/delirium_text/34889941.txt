34889941|a|Prostate cancer aggressiveness and metastatic potential are influenced by gene expression and genomic aberrations, features that can be influenced by the 3D structure of chromosomes inside the nucleus. Using chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we conducted a systematic genome architecture comparison on a cohort of cell lines that model prostate cancer progression, from normal epithelium to bone metastasis. We describe spatial compartment identity (A-open versus B-closed) changes with progression in these cell lines and their relation to gene expression changes in both cell lines and patient samples. In particular, 48 gene clusters switch from the B to the A compartment, including androgen receptor, WNT5A, and CDK14. These switches are accompanied by changes in the structure, size, and boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs). Further, compartment changes in chromosome 21 are exacerbated with progression and may explain, in part, the genesis of the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation. These results suggest that discrete 3D genome structure changes play a deleterious role in prostate cancer progression. .
