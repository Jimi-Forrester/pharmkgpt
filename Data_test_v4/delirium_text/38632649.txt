38632649|t|Osteoarthritis and hypertension: observational and Mendelian randomization analyses.
38632649|a|BACKGROUND: The association between osteoarthritis (OA) and hypertension is a subject of ongoing debate in observational research, and the underlying causal relationship between them remains elusive. METHODS: This study retrospectively included 24,871 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2013 to 2020. Weighted logistic regression was performed to investigate the connection between OA and hypertension. Additionally, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to explore the potential causal relationship between OA and hypertension. RESULTS: In the NHANES data, after adjusting for multiple confounding factors, there was no significant relationship between OA and hypertension (OR 1.30, 95% CI, 0.97-1.73, P = 0.089). However, among males, OA appeared to be associated with a higher risk of hypertension (OR 2.25, 95% CI, 1.17-4.32, P = 0.019). Furthermore, MR results indicate no relationship between multiple OA phenotypes and hypertension: knee OA (IVW, OR 1.024, 95% CI: 0.931-1.126, P = 0.626), hip OA (IVW, OR 0.990, 95% CI: 0.941-1.042, P = 0.704), knee or hip OA (IVW, OR 1.005, 95% CI: 0.915-1.105, P = 0.911), and OA from UK Biobank (IVW, OR 0.796, 95% CI: 0.233-2.714, P = 0.715). Importantly, these findings remained consistent across different genders and in reverse MR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that OA patients had a higher risk of hypertension only among males in the observational study. However, MR analysis did not uncover any causal relationship between OA and hypertension.
