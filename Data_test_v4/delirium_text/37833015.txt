37833015|a|Hallmark of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid beta peptide and phosphorylated tau deposition in brain that could be aggravated following traumatic of concussive head injury. However, amyloid beta peptide or p-tau in spinal cord following injury is not well known. In this investigation we measured amyloid beta peptide and p-tau together with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in spinal cord and brain following 48 h after spinal cord injury in relation to the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barrier, edema formation, blood flow changes and cell injury in perifocal regions of the spinal cord and brain areas. A focal spinal cord injury was inflicted over the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segment (4 mm long and 2 mm deep) and amyloid beta peptide and p-tau was measured in perifocal rostral (T9) and caudal (T12) spinal cord segments as well as in the brain areas. Our observations showed a significant increase in amyloid beta peptide in the T9 and T12 segments as well as in remote areas of brain and spinal cord after 24 and 48 h injury. This is associated with breakdown of the blood-spinal cord (BSCB) and brain barriers (BBB), edema formation, reduction in blood flow and cell injury. After 48 h of spinal cord injury elevation of amyloid beta peptide, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was seen in T9 and T12 segments of spinal cord in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brain stem regions associated with microglial activation as seen by upregulation of Iba1 and CD86. Repeated nanowired delivery of cerebrolysin topically over the traumatized segment repeatedly together with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to amyloid beta peptide (AbetaP), p-tau and TNF-alpha significantly attenuated amyloid beta peptide, p-tau deposition and reduces Iba1, CD68 and TNF-alpha levels in the brain and spinal cord along with blockade of BBB and BSCB, reduction in blood flow, edema formation and cell injury. These observations are the first to show that spinal cord injury induces Alzheimer's disease like symptoms in the CNS, not reported earlier.
