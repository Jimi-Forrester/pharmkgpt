39713905|t|Treatment and Prevention of Adrenal Crisis and Family Education.
39713905|a|Adrenal crisis is a life threatening complication of adrenal insufficiency (AI). Its treatment is urgent and parenteral hydrocortisone should be given at 10-15 times physiological doses in this situation. If hydrocortisone is not available, alternatively prednisolone or methyl prednisolone may be used. In cases where peripheral venous access cannot be achieved quickly, intramuscular administration should be performed without delay. Fluid deficit, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia should be evaluated and corrected. Stressful conditions, such as physical stress, accidents, injuries, surgical interventions and anaesthesia increase the need for cortisol and may lead the development of adrenal crisis. In order to prevent adrenal crisis, glucocorticoid dose should be increased according to the magnitude and severity of the stress situation as described in this review. Patients' and/or their families' education may improve the management of AI and reduce the frequency of adrenal crisis and/or mortality. They should be trained about conditions leading to adrenal crisis, how to increase the glucocorticoid dose in stress situations, recognizing signs of adrenal crisis and using intramuscular hydrocortisone if it is needed. All patients should be encouraged to carry a card/ information sheet/ medical alert bracelet or necklace indicating the diagnosis of AI and need for hydrocortisone administration. It is useful for patients and parents to have an emergency glucocorticoid injection kit and to receive self-injection training.
