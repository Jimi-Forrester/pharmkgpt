12501480|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia, where behavioral and cognitive disruption symptoms coexist. Depression, apathy, anxiety, and other conduct disorders are the complaints most often reported by caregivers. Fifty subjects were referred to our Institute with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive impairment was equally distributed among the subjects. Patients, aged 68 to 76 years old, were randomized to receive inhibitors of cholinesterase (Donepezil, 5 mg/day) alone, or inhibitors of cholinesterase plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram HBr, 20 mg/day). We followed up all the patients for one year, with particular concern for neuropsychological aspects associated with eventual behavioral changes. Results indicate that SSRI intake seems to be effective for depression, decreasing it and improving quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Side effects in both groups were few, and there were no study withdrawals. This paper discusses the relationship between dementia and depression, and presents our finding that depressive symptoms, if specifically treated, tend to reduce caregiver stress and improve well-being in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
