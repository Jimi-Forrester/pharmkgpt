36983805|t|The Current Strategy in Hormonal and Non-Hormonal Therapies in Menopause-A Comprehensive Review.
36983805|a|Menopause is a natural stage of hormonal aging in women, accompanied by a series of symptoms that reduce the quality of life of a fully active person. As no therapy is entirely satisfactory, the race for a better option is in full swing. Our study objective is to investigate the most recent menopause studies on pharmacological resources, emerging therapies, and the particularities of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). For this purpose, a comprehensive search was conducted in two main databases (PubMed and Web of Science) guided by the specific keywords "menopause" and "therapy" or "estrogen" or "progesterone" or "hormone replacement" during the last ten years period. Studies were eligible if they met certain criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCT) in adult women with menopause and hormonal or non-hormonal therapies. We selected 62 RCTs, which are focused on four main topics: (a) epidemiology of menopause-related symptoms, (b) hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) selective estrogen receptor modulators, (c) emerging therapies, and (d) menopause. HRT has proven a real health benefit for menopausal women; besides, complementary interventions must be considered. Further studies are needed on menopause and menopause-related therapies. The continuous updating of clinical experience will strengthen the therapeutic benefit and the decision to treat patients safely. This goal will fully access all therapeutic resources to address an unresolved health issue of active adult women.
