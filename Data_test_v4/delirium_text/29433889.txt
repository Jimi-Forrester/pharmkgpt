29433889|a|BACKGROUND: Underlying psychiatric conditions may affect outcomes of surgical treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) because of complex clinical presentation and treatment considerations. We hypothesized that patients with psychiatric illness (PSYCH) would have evidence of advanced disease at presentation, as manifested by higher rates of colorectal surgery performed in the presence of obstruction, perforation, and/or peritonitis (OPP-surgery). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the 2007-2011 National Inpatient Sample, we identified patients with a diagnosis of CRC undergoing colorectal surgery. In addition to somatic comorbid conditions flagged in the National Inpatient Sample, we used the Clinical Classification Software to identify patients with PSYCH, including schizophrenia, delirium/dementia, developmental disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, and other psychiatric conditions. Our study outcome was OPP-surgery. In addition to descriptive analysis, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to analyze the independent association between each of the PSYCH conditions and OPP-surgery, after adjusting for patient demographics and somatic comorbidities. RESULTS: Our study population included 591,561 patients with CRC and undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, of whom 60.6% were aged 65 years or older, 49.4% were women, and 6.3% had five or more comorbid conditions. Then, 17.9% presented with PSYCH. The percent of patients undergoing OPP-surgery was 13.9% in the study population but was significantly higher for patients with schizophrenia (19.3%), delirium and dementia (18.5%), developmental disorders (19.7%), and alcohol/substance abuse (19.5%). In multivariable analysis, schizophrenia, delirium/dementia, and alcohol/substance abuse were each independently associated with increased rates of OPP-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PSYCH may have obstacles in receiving optimal care for CRC. Those with PSYCH diagnoses had significantly higher rates of OPP-surgery. Additional evaluation is required to further characterize the clinical implications of advanced disease presentation for patients with PSYCH diagnoses and colorectal cancer.
