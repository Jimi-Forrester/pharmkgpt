34873914|t|Tricuspid Valve Intervention at the Time of Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
34873914|a|Background Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding in adults with congenital heart disease referred for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). However, indications for combined valve surgery remain controversial. This study aimed to evaluate early results of concomitant tricuspid valve intervention (TVI) at the time of PVR. Methods and Results Observational studies comparing TVI+PVR and isolated PVR were identified by a systematic search of published research. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, comparing outcomes between the 2 groups. Six studies involving 749 patients (TVI+PVR, 278 patients; PVR, 471 patients) met the eligibility criteria. In the pooled analysis, both TVI+PVR and PVR reduced TR grade, pulmonary regurgitation grade, right ventricular end-diastolic volume, and right ventricular end-systolic volumes. TVI+PVR, but not PVR, was associated with a decrease in tricuspid valve annulus size (mean difference, -6.43 mm, 95% CI, -10.59 to -2.27; P=0.010). Furthermore, TVI+PVR was associated with a larger reduction in TR grade compared with PVR (mean difference, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.05; P=0.031). No evidence could be established for an effect of either treatment on right ventricular ejection fraction or echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. There was no evidence for a difference in hospital mortality or reoperation for TR. Conclusions While both strategies are effective in reducing TR and right ventricular volumes, routine TVI+PVR can reduce TR grade to a larger extent than isolated PVR. Further studies are needed to identify the subgroups of patients who might benefit most from combined valve surgery.
