38967827|a|Alzheimer's disease remains an unsolved neurological puzzle with no cure. Current therapies offer only symptomatic relief, hindered by limited uptake through the blood-brain barrier. Auranofin, an FDA-approved compound, exhibits potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties targeting brain disorders. Yet, its oral bioavailability challenge prompts the exploration of nanoformulation-based solutions enhancing blood-brain barrier penetrability. The study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective potential of auranofin nanoparticles in streptozotocin-induced AD rats. Auranofin-containing polylactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles were formulated by the multiple emulsion solvent evaporation method. Characterization was done by determining entrapment efficiency, particle size distribution, surface charge, and morphology. An in vivo study was performed by administering streptozotocin (3 mg/kg/i.c.v., days 1 and 3), auranofin (5 and 10 mg/kg), auranofin nanoparticles (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), and donepezil (2 mg/kg) for 14 days orally. Behavioral deficits were evaluated using the open field test, Morris water maze, objective recognition test, change in oxidative stress levels, and AD markers in the brain. Following the decapitation of the rats, the brains were excised to isolate the hippocampus. Subsequent analyses included the quantification of biochemical and neuroinflammatory markers, as well as the assessment of neurotransmitter levels. The characterization of auranofin nanoparticles showed an entrapment efficiency of 98%, an average particle size of 101.5 +- 10.3 nm, a surface charge of 27.5 +- 5.10 mV, and a polydispersity index of 0.438 +- 0.12. In vivo, administration of auranofin and auranofin nanoparticles significantly reversed streptozotocin-induced cognitive deficits, biochemical alteration, neuroinflammatory markers, and neurotransmitter levels. The present finding suggests that auranofin nanoparticles have more significant neuroprotective potential than auranofin alone. The therapeutic efficacy may be attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its positive neuromodulatory effects. Therefore, our findings suggest that it could be a promising candidate for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
