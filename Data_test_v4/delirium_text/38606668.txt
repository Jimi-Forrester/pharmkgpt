38606668|a|Background: Animal-assisted therapy, also known as pet therapy, is a therapeutic intervention that involves animals to enhance the well-being of individuals across various populations and settings. Objective: This systematic study aims to assess the outcomes of animal-assisted therapy interventions and explore the associated policies. Methods: A total of 16 papers published between 2015 and 2023 were selected for analysis. These papers were chosen based on their relevance to the research topic of animal-assisted therapy and their availability in scholarly databases. Thematic synthesis and meta-analysis were used to synthesize the qualitative and quantitative data extracted from the selected papers. Results: The analysis included 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were deemed to be of moderate or higher quality. Among these studies, 4 demonstrated positive results for therapeutic mediation and one for supportive mediation in psychiatric disorders. Additionally, all studies showed positive outcomes for depression and neurological disorders. Regarding stress and anxiety, 3 studies indicated supportive mediation, while 2 studies showed activating mediation. Conclusions: The overall assessment of animal-assisted therapy shows promise as an effective intervention in promoting well-being among diverse populations. Further research and the establishment of standardized outcome assessment measures and comprehensive policies are essential for advancing the field and maximizing the benefits of animal-assisted therapy.
