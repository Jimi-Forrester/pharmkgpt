21170626|t|Outcome after valve surgery in octogenarians and efficacy of early mobilization with early cardiac rehabilitation.
21170626|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare postoperative complications and the surgical outcome in patients aged <80 years versus octogenarian patients. Another aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early mobilization with early cardiac rehabilitation in octogenarians. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 138 consecutive patients (group Y comprised 118 patients <80 years, and group O comprised 20 octogenarians) who had undergone valve surgery at the authors' institution between July 2007 and December 2009. Furthermore, the efficacy of early mobilization with early cardiac rehabilitation and long-term results were analyzed in 40 consecutive octogenarian patients undergoing valve surgery from 2000. The late survival follow-up was 100% complete. RESULTS: Redo cardiac operations were more frequent (O group 15.0% vs. Y group 3.4%, P = 0.011), and the preoperative EuroSCORE was significantly higher in group O than in group Y (group O 16.4 +- 18.3 vs. group Y 7.5 +- 9.1, P = 0.001). The incidence of delirium/confusion and worsening of renal function after surgery was higher in group O. The hospital mortality was 1.7% in group Y and no hospital death in group O (P > 0.99). Early mobilization with early cardiac rehabilitation significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium/confusion and increased the number of patients who could return directly home. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 77.7% for octogenarians. CONCLUSION: Although there were more high-risk patients among the octogenarians, valve surgery was a safe, low-risk procedure with excellent long-term results. Early mobilization with early cardiac rehabilitation was significantly effective and safe for postoperative recovery in octogenarians after cardiac valve surgery.
