37156856|t|Age-dependent differences and similarities in the plasma proteomic signature of postoperative delirium.
37156856|a|Delirium is an acute confusional state and a common postoperative morbidity. Prevalent in older adults, delirium occurs at other ages but it is unclear whether the pathophysiology and biomarkers for the condition are independent of age. We quantified expression of 273 plasma proteins involved in inflammation and cardiovascular or neurologic conditions in 34 middle-aged and 42 older patients before and one day after elective spine surgery. Delirium was identified by the 3D-CAM and comprehensive chart review. Protein expression was measure by Proximity Extension Assay and results were analyzed by logistic regression, gene set enrichment, and protein-protein interactions. Twenty-two patients developed delirium postoperatively (14 older; 8 middle-aged) and 89 proteins in pre- or 1-day postoperative plasma were associated with delirium. A few proteins (IL-8, LTBR, TNF-R2 postoperatively; IL-8, IL-6, LIF, ASGR1 by pre- to postoperative change) and 12 networks were common to delirium in both age groups. However, there were marked differences in the delirium proteome by age; older patients had many more delirium-associated proteins and pathways than middle-aged subjects even though both had the same clinical syndrome. Therefore, there are age-dependent similarities and differences in the plasma proteomic signature of postoperative delirium, which may signify age differences in pathogenesis of the syndrome.
