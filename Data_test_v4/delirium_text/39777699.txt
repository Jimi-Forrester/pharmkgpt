39777699|t|Tubulin-Binding Region Modulates Cholesterol-Triggered Aggregation of Tau Proteins.
39777699|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and tauopathies, severe neurodegenerative diseases, is the progressive aggregation of Tau, also known as microtubule-associated Tau protein. Full-length Tau1-441, also known as 2N4R, contains two N-terminal inserts that bind to tubulin. This facilitates the self-assembly of tubulin simultaneously enhancing stability of cell microtubules. Other Tau isoforms have one (1N4R) or zero (0N4R) N-terminal inserts, which makes 2N4R Tau more and 0N4R less effective in promoting microtubule self-assembly. A growing body of evidence indicates that lipids can alter the aggregation rate of Tau isoforms. However, the role of N-terminal inserts in Tau-lipid interactions remains unclear. In this study, we utilized a set of biophysical methods to determine the extent to which N-terminal inserts alter interactions of Tau isoforms with cholesterol, one of the most important lipids in plasma membranes. Our results showed that 2 N insert prevents amyloid-driven aggregation of Tau at the physiological concentration of cholesterol, while the absence of this N-terminal repeat (1N4R and 0N4R Tau) resulted in the self-assembly of Tau into toxic amyloid fibrils. We also found that the presence of cholesterol in the lipid bilayers caused a significant increase in the cytotoxicity of 1N4R and 0N4R Tau to neurons. This effect was not observed for 2N4R Tau fibrils formed in the presence of lipid membranes with low, physiological, and elevated concentrations of cholesterol. Using molecular assays, we found that Tau aggregates primarily exert cytotoxicity by damaging cell endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria.
