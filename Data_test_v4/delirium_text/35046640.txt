35046640|t|Dexmedetomidine Combined with Femoral Nerve Block Provides Effective Analgesia Similar to Femoral Nerve Combined with Sciatic Nerve Block in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Study.
35046640|a|BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a severe traumatic procedure, and femoral nerve block (FNB) combined with a sciatic nerve block (SNB) is widely used in TKA. However, injury of the sciatic nerve is clinically reported. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) could reduce stress and inflammation, as well as improve pain in TKA. This study aims to observe the analgesic impact of DEX combined with FNB in TKA. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients undergoing TKA were included and randomly divided into two groups: DF group (FNB combined with DEX 0.6mug/kg before surgery, followed by DEX 0.2-0.4mug/kg/h until articular closure) and SF group (FNB combined with SNB). Each nerve was blocked with 0.375% ropivacaine 20mL, and all patients received general anesthesia routinely. The primary endpoint was the pain visual analog scale (VAS) score during activities at postoperative 24 hours. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the pain VAS scores at any time point. The mean duration of analgesia for patients with rescue analgesic requests was comparable between the two groups: 25.4 +- 6.3 hours in the DF group vs 24.8 +- 6.4 hours in the SF group (two-sample t-test, p=0.738). The total dose of sufentanil was similar between groups (P=0.355). The maintenance dose of propofol and dose of rescue analgesics were comparable (all P>0.05). There were no statistical differences in the incidence of adverse events. However, the time to extubate in the DF group was significantly longer than those in the SF group (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: DEX combined with FNB could provide effective analgesia similar to SNB combined with FNB in TKA. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on November 17, 2019 (identifier: ChiCTR1900027552).
