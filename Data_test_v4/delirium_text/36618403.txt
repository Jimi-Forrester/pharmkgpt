36618403|a|Proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome are symptoms of podocytopathies, kidney diseases caused by direct or indirect podocyte damage. Human health worldwide is threatened by diabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the world. DN development and progression are largely dependent on inflammation. The effects of podocyte damage on metabolic disease and inflammatory disorders have been documented. Epigenetic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are also evident in DN. Targeting inflammation pathway and ER stress in podocytes may be a prospective therapy to prevent the progression of DN. Here, we review the mechanism of epigenetics and ER stress on podocyte inflammation and apoptosis, and discuss the potential amelioration of podocytopathies by regulating epigenetics and ER stress as well as by targeting inflammatory signaling, which provides a theoretical basis for drug development to ameliorate DN.
