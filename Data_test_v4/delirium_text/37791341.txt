37791341|a|The D-amino acid content of Ishizuchi-kurocha, a post-fermented tea produced in Ehime, Japan, was measured. Ishizuchi-kurocha mainly contains D-glutamic acid and D-alanine, but it also contains a small amount of D-aspartic acid. Two types of lactic acid bacteria, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Levilactobacillus brevis, are the main species involved in lactic acid fermentation during the tea fermentation process. Therefore, the D-amino acid-producing abilities of strains of these two species isolated from Ishizuchi-kurocha were examined. Specifically, the production of D-aspartic acid, D-alanine, and D-glutamic acid by L. brevis and L. plantarum strains was observed. The amount of D-aspartic acid produced by L. plantarum was low. D-glutamine was detected in culture supernatant but not in bacterial cells. D-arginine was detected in bacterial cells of the L. plantarum strains but not in the culture supernatant. Both the L. brevis and L. plantarum strains possessed at least three kinds of putative racemase genes: alanine racemase, glutamate racemase, and aspartate racemase. However, their expression and enzyme activity remain unknown. L. plantarum and L. brevis could play an important role in the production of D-amino acids in Ishizuchi-kurocha. In fact, Ishizuchi-kurocha is expected to possess the effective physiological activities of D-amino acids.
