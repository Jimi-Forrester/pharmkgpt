37374059|t|Novel Photodynamic Therapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma following Radiotherapy.
37374059|a|Radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) are frequently selected as treatments for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, salvage treatment remains challenging when endoscopic resection is not indicated for residual or recurrent ESCC following RT or CRT. Recently, owing to the emergence of second-generation photodynamic therapy (PDT) using talaporfin sodium, PDT can be performed with less phototoxicity and therefore has regained popularity in the treatment of ESCC. In this study, the effectiveness and safety of second-generation PDT in patients with residual or recurrent ESCC following RT or CRT were examined. Local complete response (L-CR) rates, procedure-related adverse events, and prognosis were evaluated. In 12 patients with 20 ESCC lesions, the L-CR rates were 95.0%. Perforation, postoperative bleeding, and photosensitivity were not observed. Esophageal stricture following PDT developed in one patient, but this could be addressed using balloon dilation. During a median follow-up period of 12 (range, 3-42) months, the 3-year cause-specific survival rate was 85.7%. Even in patients with a Charlson comorbidity index score >= 3, the 2-year overall survival rates were 100%. In conclusion, PDT was an efficacious and a safe salvage treatment in patients with local residual or recurrent ESCC following RT or CRT.
