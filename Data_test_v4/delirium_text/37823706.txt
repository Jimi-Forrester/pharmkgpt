37823706|a|INTRODUCTION: Inflammation is an important player in Alzheimer's disease (AD), whose effects can be influenced by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we investigated the relationship between BBB permeability, indicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma albumin quotient (Qalb), and CSF indexes of neuroinflammation in a cohort of biologically defined AD patients. METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] >22) underwent CSF analysis for inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, Il-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]). Using backward stepwise linear regression analysis, we explored the potential influence of each cytokine CSF level on Qalb considering age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) as covariates. RESULTS: Higher levels of IL-4 (beta = 0.356, 0.005) and IL-8 (beta = 0.249, 0.05) were associated with higher Qalb values, while macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1beta) (beta = -0.274; p = 0.032) and TNF-alpha (beta = -0.248; p = 0.031) showed a significant negative association with BBB permeability. Age was also positively associated with Qalb (beta = 0.283; p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the overall integrity of the BBB, its permeability could either influence or be influenced by central neuroinflammation, reflected by CSF cytokine levels. This is in line with previous studies that showed that patients with a more intact barrier are those with more prominent neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that different neuroinflammatory profiles can be associated with different levels of BBB permeability in AD.
