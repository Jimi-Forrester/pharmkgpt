36148760|a|Sleep disorders are associated with cognitive impairments, greater amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden and increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, while the underlying mechanism is unclear. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), as vital modulators of cognition, are sensitive to sleep disturbance. Sleep deprivation (SD) could induce the alterations of neuronal NMDAR subunits expression, however the alterations of astrocytic NMDARs in SD have not been reported. Our previous study has demonstrated knockdown of astrocytic Grin2a (gene encoding NMDAR subunit GluN2A) could aggravate Abeta-induced cognitive impairments, but what role astrocytic GluN2A may play in SD is unknown. Here we focused on the changes and roles of hippocampal astrocytic GluN2A in SD. Our results showed SD increased the expression of astrocytic GluN2A. Specific knockdown of hippocampal astrocytic Grin2a aggravated SD-induced cognitive decline, elevated Abeta, and attenuated the SD-induced increase in autophagy flux. Our finding, for the first time, revealed a novel neuroprotective role for astrocytic GluN2A in SD, which may be helpful for developing new preventive and therapeutic targets to sleep disorders.
