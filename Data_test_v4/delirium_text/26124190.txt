26124190|t|Elevated Serum Levels of NSE and S-100beta Correlate with Increased Risk of Acute Cerebral Infarction in Asian Populations.
26124190|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the clinical value of serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and human soluble protein-100beta (S-100beta) in acute cerebral infarction (ACI) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search of electronic databases identified relevant case-control studies that examined the correlations between NSE and S-100beta serum levels, and ACI. The retrieved studies were screened based on our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and high-quality studies were subsequently selected for meta-analysis. STATA software (Version 12.0, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was utilized for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 13 case-control studies, containing 911 ACI patients and 686 healthy controls, were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that serum levels of NSE and S-100beta in ACI patients were significantly higher than the control group. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed that the serum levels of NSE and S-100beta in ACI patients were significantly higher than the control group in Asian population. In Caucasian population, the serum levels of NSE in case group was significantly higher than the control group, but no significant differences in serum levels of S-100beta were observed between ACI patients and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we conclude that serum levels of NSE and S-100beta strongly correlate with ACI in Asian population, and may be important clinical markers for diagnosis and treatment of ACI.
