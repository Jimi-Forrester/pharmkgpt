36340600|t|Delayed biventricular repair of interrupted aortic arch with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a case report.
36340600|a|In patients with critical left ventricular outflow tract obstruction but adequately sized ventricles, the treatment of choice is biventricular repair. Several options have been proposed, including neonatal Yasui or Ross-Konno operation. However, each of these procedures carries a high mortality risk, especially in syndromic neonates. Here, we report the case of a patient with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and a diagnosis of interrupted aortic arch type B2, ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. As a means to avoid high-risk neonatal surgery in this patient, we pursued a strategy of delayed biventricular repair involving initial hybrid Norwood palliation followed by a Yasui-type operation at 3 months. Although this strategy turned out to be successful, proactive monitoring for the development of ductal stent stenosis during follow-up after the hybrid procedure remains crucial to prevent hemodynamic complications such as cardiac failure and systemic hypoperfusion.
