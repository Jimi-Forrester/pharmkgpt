37628702|t|The Potential Usefulness of the Expanded Carrier Screening to Identify Hereditary Genetic Diseases: A Case Report from Real-World Data.
37628702|a|Expanded carrier screening (ECS) means a comprehensive genetic analysis to evaluate an individual's carrier status. ECS is becoming more frequently used, thanks to the availability of techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), allowing for extensive genome-scale analyses. Here, we report the case of a couple who underwent ECS for a case of autism spectrum disorder in the male partner family. aCGH and whole-exome sequencing (WES) were performed in the couple. aCGH analysis identified in the female partner two deletions involving genes associated to behavioral and neurodevelopment disorders. No clinically relevant alterations were identified in the husband. Interestingly, WES analysis identified in the male partner a pathogenic variant in the LPL gene that is emerging as a novel candidate gene for autism. This case shows that ECS may be useful in clinical contexts, especially when both the partners are analyzed before conception, thus allowing the estimation of their risk to transmit an inherited condition. On the other side, there are several concerns related to possible incidental findings and difficult-to-interpret results. Once these limits are defined by the establishment of specific guidelines, ECS may have a greater diffusion.
