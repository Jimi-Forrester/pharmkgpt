35963082|t|The application of xylocaine 10% pump-spray to improve immediate post-adenotonsillectomy pain in children: A randomized controlled trial.
35963082|a|INTRODUCTION: Post-adenotonsillectomy pain is often severe, requiring substantial analgesia in the first 48-72 h. This pain is not only distressing to the patient and his or her parents, but often reflects poorly on an otherwise well performed procedure. Safe, simple and effective post-adenotonsillectomy pain control is still clinically elusive, even though a multitude of surgical and analgesic interventions have been proposed. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the analgesic properties of immediate post-operative application of xylocaine 10% pump spray to the tonsillar fossae in children having undergone adenotonsillectomy and how this impacts on anesthetic emergence and pain control in the first 24-h. METHODS: In this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 80 children were stratified into two groups: Group I (3-8 years-old) and Group II (9-14 years-old). Within these groups, participants were randomized to receive either xylocaine 10% pump spray or normal saline 0.9% post-operatively. A standardized anesthetic/analgesic regime was used intra-operatively. The same surgeon performed all surgeries using bi-polar diathermy. Outcome variables included state of anesthetic emergence; pain scores at specific intervals; need for rescue analgesia; post-operative nausea and vomiting; time to first oral intake and comfort associated with initial oral intake. RESULTS: Xylocaine 10% pump spray consistently provided superior pain control at all time intervals compared to normal saline 0.9% (p = 0.011). This was most pronounced in children 3-8 years old (Group I). Xylocaine 10% pump spray and normal saline 0.9% provided similar pain relief in children 9-14 years old (Group (II) (p = 0.640). Children receiving xylocaine had a decreased incidence of emergence delirium and consistently required less rescue analgesia (p = 0.005). Children who received xylocaine did not eat sooner post-operatively, but they experienced less pain when ingesting liquids (p = 0.003) and solids (p = 0.000). Children who received xylocaine did not experience increased post-operative complications (p = 1.000) or nausea and vomiting (p = 0.153). CONCLUSION: Xylocaine 10% spray may serve as a valuable adjunct to effective pain control post-adenotonsillectomy, especially if long acting opioids are contraindicated, as with patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The benefit of xylocaine appears to be negligible when a long acting opioid is administered. The benefits of xylocaine were most noteworthy in children aged 3-8 years old. This is the largest trial (n = 80) to date to assess the efficacy of xylocaine spray in isolation post-adenotonsillectomy. Xylocaine also offers improved comfort with oral intake and decreases emergence delirium and need for rescue analgesia without any increase in post-operative complications. Local anesthesia may decrease costs and help to solve the conundrum of a painless adenotonsillectomy especially in resource-limited settings.
