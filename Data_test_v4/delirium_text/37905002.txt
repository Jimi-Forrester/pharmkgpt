37905002|a|The pigment neuromelanin, produced in the locus coeruleus (LC) as a byproduct of catecholamine synthesis, gives the "blue spot" its name, and both identifies LC neurons and is thought to play an important yet complex role in normal and pathological aging. Using neuromelanin-sensitive T1-weighted turbo spin echo MRI scans we characterized volume and neuromelanin signal intensity in the LC of 96 participants between the ages of 19 and 86. Although LC volume did not change significantly throughout the lifespan, LC neuromelanin signal intensity increased from early adulthood, peaked around age 60 and precipitously declined thereafter. Neuromelanin intensity was greater in the caudal relative to rostral extent and in women relative to men. With regard to function, rostral LC neuromelanin intensity was associated with fluid cognition in older adults (60+) only in those above the 50th percentile of cognitive ability for age. The gradual accumulation of LC neuromelanin across the lifespan, its sudden dissipation in later life, and relation to preserved cognitive function, is consistent with its complex role in normal and pathological aging.
