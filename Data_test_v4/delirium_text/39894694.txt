39894694|t|Atypical Alzheimer's dementia: Addressing the subtypes, epidemiology, atypical presentations, diagnostic biomarkers, and treatment updates.
39894694|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the elderly population; and is characterized by the gradual loss of memory, cognition, and ability to carry out daily activities. However, a growing body of research indicates that there exists a subtype of Alzheimer's disease known as Atypical Alzheimer's disease. Atypical Alzheimer's disease is a rare form of dementia that differs from the typical presentation of Alzheimer's disease, such as variations in the age of onset, distribution of brain pathology, and clinical symptoms. The patients affected have a younger age of onset and have predominantly visual, language, executive function, motor, and behavioral dysfunction. The diagnosis requires a comprehensive neurological evaluation with specific attention to cognitive and behavioral changes while ruling out other potential causes of dementia. Emerging biomarkers including CSF profiles, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and advanced neuroimaging techniques offer promising avenues for improving diagnostic accuracy and understanding disease mechanisms. In this article, we focus on atypical presentations seen in the posterior cortical variant, frontal variant, progressive aphasic variant, corticobasal syndrome and look at the specific biomarkers used in the diagnosis of each variant along with focusing on the treatment of the disease. We also aim to provide an understanding of Atypical Alzheimer's disease, its clinical features, the biomarkers helping in diagnosing the disease, the current treatment guidelines, and the current scientific advancements in the field.
