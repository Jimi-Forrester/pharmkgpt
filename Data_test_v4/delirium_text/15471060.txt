15471060|t|Assaultive behavior in Alzheimer's disease: identifying immediate antecedents during bathing.
15471060|a|To identify immediate antecedents of bathing-related physical assaults against caregivers by nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, videotapes of nursing home residents who physically assaulted nursing assistants during baths were analyzed. Caregiver behaviors that occurred significantly (p < .01) more often during the 5 seconds preceding an assault included: calling the resident by name, confrontational communication, invalidation of the resident's feelings, failure to prepare the resident for a task, disrespectful speech, any touch, absence of physical restraint, and hurried pace of bath. Assaults were significantly more likely when caregivers sprayed water without a verbal prompt; the resident's feet, axilla, or perineum were touched; residents exhibited signs of temperature discomfort; and multiple caregivers were present. Improved caregiver training and individualized, gentler bathing methods should be investigated as methods of reducing assaults.
