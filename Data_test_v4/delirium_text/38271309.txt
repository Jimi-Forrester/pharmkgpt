38271309|t|The Relationship Between Uncertainty and Psychological Distress Among Family Caregivers of Patients With Delirium in Intensive Care Units: A Cross-Sectional Survey.
38271309|a|BACKGROUND: Although family caregivers experienced negative psychological symptoms associated with witnessing intensive care unit delirium in their loved ones, there is a lack of clear understanding of how delirium is associated with family caregiver psychological distress. Uncertainty could be a factor contributed to this association. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between uncertainty and psychological distress among family caregivers of patients with delirium in intensive care units. METHODS: A cross-sectional correlational design was used for this observational study of adult family caregivers of patients admitted to the intensive care unit and who reported witnessing delirium symptoms in their loved ones. Family caregivers completed an electronic survey in January 2022 that consisted of a family caregiver and patient demographic form, the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale-Family Member, and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Descriptive, correlational, and regression statistical analyses were applied. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one adult family caregivers were enrolled. Family caregivers reported substantial uncertainty (mean, 106.15, on a scale of 31-155) and moderate to severe psychological distress (mean, 31.37, on a scale of 10-50) regarding their witnessing of delirium episodes in their loved ones. Uncertainty was significantly correlated with psychological distress among family caregivers (rs = 0.52, P < .001). Uncertainty significantly predicted psychological distress among family caregivers (regression coefficient, 0.27; P < .001). DISCUSSION: Family caregiver uncertainty was positively associated with psychological distress. This distress can interfere with family caregiver involvement in patient delirium care. These findings are essential to increase critical care nurse awareness and inform the development of nursing interventions to alleviate possible uncertainty and distress.
