32343461|a|Alzheimer's disease represents the most prevalent neurodegeneration worldwide, clinically characterized by cognitive and memory impairment. New therapeutic approaches are extremely important to counteract this disorder. This research is focused on the potential use of choline alfoscerate in preventing neuronal death using in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease, representing the early stage of the disease, treated before or after the insult with glycerylphosphorylcholine. On the light of the results collected, we can postulate that choline alfoscerate, by the activation of the neurotrophin survival pathway, was able to counteract the detrimental effect of beta-amyloid in both in vitro models, reducing apoptotic cell death and preserving the neuronal morphology.
