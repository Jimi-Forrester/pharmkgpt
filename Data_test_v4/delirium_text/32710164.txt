32710164|t|A two-year multicenter point prevalence study of older patients with hip fractures admitted to rehabilitation units in Italy.
32710164|a|PURPOSE: To date in Italy we do not have sufficient information on the rehabilitation process of older patients with hip fractures especially in the context of dementia. The main aims of the study were to gather information on the characteristics of older patients with hip fracture admitted to rehabilitation units with a specific focus on geriatric syndromes and the rehabilitation process. METHODS: A national multi-center "point prevalence study" was conducted in Italy over two index days in 2017 and 2018. All patients aged 70 years and older hospitalized on the index day in Rehabilitation Units after a hip fracture were eligible. RESULTS: A total of 615 patients were included. Most of the hospitals involved were from northern Italy, to a lesser extent from central and from southern Italy. The mean age was 83.08 +- 7.9 years. Almost half of the patients lived alone before the hip fracture. Most of the falls happened at home and while walking. The prevalence of delirium, dementia and malnutrition was 9.1%, 36.6%, and 19.3%, respectively. Antidepressants were prescribed in 27% of the population. The multidisciplinary team was activated as follows: occupational therapist in 18.9% of the cases, psychologists in 14.5%, social workers in 15.3%, and speech therapists in 6.5%. CONCLUSION: The study allowed the collection of data on a relatively large sample of older patients with hip fracture showing the possible current limitations in the correct management of geriatric syndromes in this frail population. Future multicenter longitudinal studies are required to further study this population.
