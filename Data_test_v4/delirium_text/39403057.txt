39403057|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, but its etiopathogenesis is not yet fully understood. Recent preclinical studies and clinical evidence indicate that changes in the gut microbiome could potentially play a role in the accumulation of amyloid beta. However, the relationship between gut dysbiosis and AD is still elusive. In this review, the potential impact of the gut microbiome on AD development and progression is discussed. Pre-clinical and clinical literature exploring changes in gut microbiome composition is assessed, which can contribute to AD pathology including increased amyloid beta deposition and cognitive impairment. The gut-brain axis and the potential involvement of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome in AD are also highlighted. Furthermore, the potential of antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions as complementary therapies for the management of AD is summarized. This review provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies to modulate the gut microbiome in AD.
