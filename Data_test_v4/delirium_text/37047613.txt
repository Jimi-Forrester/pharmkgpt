37047613|t|Intrinsic Permeation and Anti-Inflammatory Evaluation of Curcumin, Bisdemethoxycurcumin and Bisdemethylcurcumin by a Validated HPLC-UV Method.
37047613|a|Curcumin shows anti-inflammatory activity, and it has been widely investigated for neurodegenerative diseases, adjuvant treatment in AIDS and antitumor activity against different tumors, among other activities. The goal of this work was to evaluate the capacity of curcumin and its derivatives (bisdemethoxycurcumin and bisdemethylcurcumin) in preventing the irritant effects of topically applied xylol and to assess the intrinsic capacity of curcuminoids in permeating human skin by ex vivo permeation tests. Its secondary goal was to validate an HPLC method to simultaneously determine the curcuminoids in the samples from the ex vivo permeation studies and drug extraction from the skin. Curcuminoid quantification was performed using an RP-C18 column, at isocratic conditions of elution and a detection wavelength of 265 nm. The method was specific with a suitable peak resolution, as well as linear, precise, and accurate in the range of 0.195-3.125 mug/mL for the three curcuminoids. Bisdemethylcurcumin showed the greatest permeation through the human skin, and it was the curcuminoid that was most retained within the human skin. The anti-inflammatory activity of the curcuminoids was evaluated in vivo using a xylol-induced inflammation model in rats. Histological studies were performed to observe any changes in morphology at the microscopic level, and these three curcuminoids were found to be respectful within the skin structure. These results show that these three curcuminoids are suitable for anti-inflammatory formulations for dermal applications, and they can be properly quantified using HPLC-UV.
