39845913|a|Introduction: Wernicke encephalopathy is a metabolic disease mainly associated with vitamin B1 deficiency, which is common in chronic alcoholism. Non-alcoholic Wernicke encephalopathy is difficult for early diagnosis. Case presentation: One case involved a 62-year-old man who was admitted to hospital with drug-induced liver failure. He presented lower extremity weakness and progressive worsening of consciousness disturbance post-admission and was eventually identified as Wernicke encephalopathy by magnetic resonance imaging scan and deficiency in vitamin B1. The classic symmetric hyperintense signals on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were reversible after intravenous vitamin B1 supplementation. Conclusion: A high index of clinical suspicion is required for early diagnosis and appropriate preventive and therapeutic strategies by adequate and immediate vitamin B1 supplements in the reversible stage of Wernicke encephalopathy.
