38270275|t|Down Syndrome Biobank Consortium: A perspective.
38270275|a|Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have a partial or complete trisomy of chromosome 21, resulting in an increased risk for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia by early midlife. Despite ongoing clinical trials to treat late-onset AD, individuals with DS are often excluded. Furthermore, timely diagnosis or management is often not available. Of the genetic causes of AD, people with DS represent the largest cohort. Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of DS-related AD (DS-AD), partly due to limited access to well-characterized brain tissue and biomaterials for research. To address this challenge, we created an international consortium of brain banks focused on collecting and disseminating brain tissue from persons with DS throughout their lifespan, named the Down Syndrome Biobank Consortium (DSBC) consisting of 11 biobanking sites located in Europe, India, and the USA. This perspective describes the DSBC harmonized protocols and tissue dissemination goals.
