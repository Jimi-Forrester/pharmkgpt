37175725|t|Synthesis and Evaluation of Hypoglycemic Activity of Structural Isomers of ((Benzyloxy)phenyl)propanoic Acid Bearing an Aminobornyl Moiety.
37175725|a|Free fatty acid receptor-1 (FFAR1) agonists are promising candidates for therapy of type 2 diabetes because of their ability to normalize blood sugar levels during hyperglycemia without the risk of hypoglycemia. Previously, we synthesized compound QS-528, a FFA1 receptor agonist with a hypoglycemic effect in C57BL/6NCrl mice. In the present work, structural analogs of QS-528 based on (hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid bearing a bornyl fragment in its structure were synthesized. The seven novel compounds synthesized were structural isomers of compound QS-528, varying the positions of the substituents in the aromatic fragments as well as the configuration of the asymmetric center in the bornyl moiety. The studied compounds were shown to have the ability to activate FFAR1 at a concentration of 10 muM. The cytotoxicity of the compounds as well as their effect on glucose uptake in HepG2 cells were studied. The synthesized compounds were found to increase glucose uptake by cells and have no cytotoxic effect. Two compounds, based on the meta-substituted phenylpropanoic acid, 3-(3-(4-(((1R,2R,4R)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo-[2.2.1]heptan-2-ylamino)methyl)benzyloxy)phenyl)propanoic acid and 3-(3-(3-(((1R,2R,4R)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo [2.2.1]heptan-2-ylamino)methyl)benzyloxy)phenyl)propanoic acid, were shown to have a pronounced hypoglycemic effect in the oral glucose tolerance test with CD-1 mice.
