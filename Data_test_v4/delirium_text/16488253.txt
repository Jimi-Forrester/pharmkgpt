16488253|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative onset of acute major depression in a patient with no previous history of psychiatric disorder is highly unexpected after skull base surgery. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old woman with no previous physical or mental illness presented with a 3-month history of left ear pain, short-term memory disturbance, and motor dysphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large extraaxial tumor in the left middle fossa. Left temporal craniotomy was performed, achieving complete tumor resection. The patient showed signs of confusion, disorientation, and severe depression 3 days after the surgery. She developed insomnia and auditory hallucinations along with expressed suicidal ideation, then deteriorated rapidly, necessitating a transfer to a psychiatric unit. In spite of the intensive treatment with antidepressive and antipsychotic medications, she continued to have prolonged psychotic symptoms and depression for several months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Although the incidence is rare, psychiatric complications should be anticipated in patients undergoing resection of a large skull base tumor affecting the temporal lobe. The exact mechanism in this process is not clear; however, it is important to clinically differentiate treatable etiologies such as steroid-induced psychosis and postoperative delirium.
