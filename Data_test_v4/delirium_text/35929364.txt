35929364|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, is largely associated with cognitive disability, amnesia, and abnormal behavior, which accounts for about two third of people with dementia worldwide. A growing body of research demonstrates that AD is connected to several factors, such as aberrant accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), increase in the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inordinate production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Despite remarkable efforts to realize the etiology and pathophysiology of AD, until now, scientists have not developed and introduced medications that can permanently cease the progression of AD. Thus, nowadays, research on the role of natural products in the treatment and prevention of AD has attracted great attention. Kaempferol (KMP), one of the prominent members of flavonols, exerts its ameliorative actions via attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation, reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, and regulating the cholinergic system. Therefore, in this review article, we outlined the possible effects of KMP in the prevention and treatment of AD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Kaempferol (KMP) exerts its ameliorative actions against AD via attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation, reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, and regulating the cholinergic system. The beneficial effects of KMP were addressed in both in vitro and in vivo studies; however, conducting further research can warrant its long-term effects as a safe agent. Therefore, after confirming its favorable functions in the prevention and treatment of AD, it could be used as a safe and effective agent.
