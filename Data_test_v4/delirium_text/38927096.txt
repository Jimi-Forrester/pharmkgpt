38927096|a|The relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) has long been extensively recognized, but their crosstalk mechanisms based on gene regulation remain elusive. In our study, for the first time, bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data were used to explore the shared molecular mechanisms between T2DM and CRC. Moreover, Connectivity Map and molecular docking were employed to determine potential drugs targeting the candidate targets. Eight genes (EVPL, TACSTD2, SOX4, ETV4, LY6E, MLXIPL, ENTPD3, UGP2) were identified as characteristic comorbidity genes for T2DM and CRC, with EVPL and ENTPD3 further identified as core comorbidity genes. Our results demonstrated that upregulation of EVPL and downregulation of ENTPD3 were intrinsic molecular features throughout T2DM and CRC and were significantly associated with immune responses, immune processes, and abnormal immune landscapes in both diseases. Single-cell analysis highlighted a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subset that specifically expressed ENTPD3 in CRC, which exhibited high heterogeneity and unique tumor-suppressive features that were completely different from classical cancer-promoting CAFs. Furthermore, ENTPD3+ CAFs could notably predict immunotherapy response in CRC, holding promise to be an immunotherapy biomarker at the single-cell level. Finally, we identified that droperidol may be a novel drug simultaneously targeting EVPL and ENTPD3. In conclusion, previous studies have often focused solely on metabolic alterations common to T2DM and CRC. Our study establishes EVPL and ENTPD3 as characteristic molecules and immune biomarkers of comorbidity in T2DM and CRC patients, and emphasizes the importance of considering immunological mechanisms in the co-development of T2DM and CRC.
