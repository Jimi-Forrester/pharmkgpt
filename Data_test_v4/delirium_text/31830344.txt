31830344|t|SARC-F combined with a simple tool for assessment of muscle abnormalities in outpatients with chronic liver disease.
31830344|a|AIM: An easily performed method for examination of muscle abnormalities is anticipated. We aimed to elucidate the clinical usefulness of simple assessments for muscle abnormality including a simple five-item questionnaire (SARC-F) in chronic liver disease patients. METHODS: From February to July 2019, 383 outpatients (median age 71 years, 259 men; chronic hepatitis (CH) : liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh A : liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B : liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh C = 157:176:39:11) who underwent a computed tomography examination were enrolled. SARC-F, previously reported cut-off values for muscle strength decline (MSD; handgrip), pre-muscle volume loss (pre-MVL), calf circumference and finger-circle test results were used, and these results were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A high SARC-F score (>=4) was observed in 25 patients, and a low score (<4) in 358 patients. The frequency of high SARC-F increased significantly with progression of chronic liver disease (chronic hepatitis : liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh A : liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B/C = 2.5%:8.0%:14.0%, P=0.010). MSD frequency was 22.4% in men and 41.1% in women. Muscle volume loss and pre-MVL were noted in 22% and 30.5%, respectively, of the male patients, and 9.7% and 32.3%, respectively, of the female patients. In cases with high SARC-F and MSD, calf circumference and finger-circle abnormalities were found in 56% and 40.0% of patients, respectively, whereas those values for patients with low SARC-F and MSD were 14.5% and 10.6%, respectively (P < 0.001, for each; positive/negative predictive values: 0.560/0.855 and 0.400/0.894, respectively). Each SARC-F item showed a good area under the curve for MSD, but not pre-MVL. CONCLUSION: SARC-F score in combination with MSD and calf circumference or finger-circle test results may be an easy and simple method for surveillance of chronic liver disease patients with a high risk of sarcopenia and decline of quality of life.
