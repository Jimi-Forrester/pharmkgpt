39068667|a|INTRODUCTION: The study aims to use power spectrum changes in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), for future biomarker studies in early AD diagnosis. METHODS: We recruited 23 SCD and 32 aMCI subjects and conducted comparative analysis using relative power spectral density (PSD). Automated preprocessing and statistical analysis were performed using iSync Brain  (iMediSync Inc., Republic of Korea) (https://isyncbrain.com/). RESULTS: Theta band power in the temporal region was 14.826 +- 7.2394 for the SCD group and 20.003 +- 10.1768 for the aMCI group. In the parietal region, theta band power was 13.614 +- 7.5689 for SCD and 19.894 +- 11.1387 for aMCI. Beta1 band power in the frontal region was 6.639 +- 2.2904 for SCD and 5.465 +- 1.8907 for aMCI, and in the temporal region it was 7.359 +- 2.5619 for SCD and 5.921 +- 2.1605 for aMCI. CONCLUSION: PSD analysis of resting-state EEG predicted SCD, a preclinical stage of AD. This cross-sectional study observed electrical-physiological characteristics of preclinical AD; however, follow-up studies are needed to evaluate predictive value for future cognitive decline.
