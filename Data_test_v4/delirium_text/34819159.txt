34819159|t|Alpha-synuclein from patient Lewy bodies exhibits distinct pathological activity that can be propagated in vitro.
34819159|a|Lewy bodies (LBs) are complex, intracellular inclusions that are common pathological features of many neurodegenerative diseases. They consist largely of aggregated forms of the protein alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), which misfolds to give rise to beta-sheet rich amyloid fibrils. The aggregation of monomers into fibrils occurs readily in vitro and pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) generated from recombinant alpha-Syn monomers are the basis of many models of LB diseases. These alpha-Syn PFFs recapitulate many pathological phenotypes in both cultured cells and animal models including the formation of alpha-Syn rich, insoluble aggregates, neuron loss, and motor deficits. However, it is not clear how closely alpha-Syn PFFs recapitulate the biological behavior of LB aggregates isolated directly from patients. Direct interrogation of the cellular response to LB-derived alpha-Syn has thus far been limited. Here we demonstrate that alpha-Syn aggregates derived from LB disease patients induce pathology characterized by a prevalence of large somatic inclusions that is distinct from the primarily neuritic pathology induced by alpha-Syn PFFs in our cultured neuron model. Moreover, these LB-derived aggregates can be amplified in vitro using recombinant alpha-Syn to generate aggregates that maintain the unique, somatic pathological phenotype of the original material. Amplified LB aggregates also showed greater uptake in cultured neurons and greater pathological burden and more rapid pathological spread in injected mouse brains, compared to alpha-Syn PFFs. Our work indicates that LB-derived alpha-Syn from diseased brains represents a distinct conformation species with unique biological activities that has not been previously observed in fully recombinant alpha-Syn aggregates and demonstrate a new strategy for improving upon alpha-Syn PFF models of synucleinopathies using amplified LBs.
