26054508|t|Predictors of Long-Term Mortality in Oldest Old Patients (90+) Hospitalized to Medical Wards via the Emergency Department: The SAFES Cohort.
26054508|a|OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for long-term mortality in patients aged 90 years and over who are admitted to hospital through the emergency department. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (SAFES cohort; Sujet Age Fragile - Evaluation Suivi). SETTING: 8 university teaching hospitals and one regional, non-academic hospital in France. PARTICIPANTS: Among 1306 patients in the SAFES cohort, 291 patients aged 90 or over were included. MEASUREMENTS: At inclusion, we recorded socio-demographic data (age, sex, level of education, living alone or in an institution, number of children, presence of helper/caregiver), and data from geriatric evaluation (dependence status, risk of depression, dementia, delirium, nutritional status, walking disorders, risk of falls, comorbidities, risk of pressure sores). Vital status at 36 months was obtained from the treating physician, the general practitioner, administrative registers, or during follow-up consultations. RESULTS: Among 291 patients included, 190 (65.3%) had died at 36 months. Risk factors for mortality at 36 months identified by multivariate analysis were risk of malnutrition (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.3, p=0.004) and delirium (HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.3, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Risk of malnutrition and presence of delirium are risk factors for mortality at 36 months in subjects aged 90 years and over hospitalized through the emergency department.
