34313818|t|Covid-19 and Parkinson's disease: an overview.
34313818|a|In March 2020, WHO declared Covid-19 outbreak pandemic. There has been increasing evidence that frail, old, multi-pathological patients are at greater risk of developing severe Covid-19 infection than younger, healthy ones. Covid-19's impact on Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients could be analysed through both the influence on PD patients' health and their risk of developing severe Covid-19, and the consequences of lockdown and restrictive measures on mental and cognitive health on both patients and caregivers. Moreover, there are critical issues to be considered about patients' care and management through an unprecedented time like this. One important issue to consider is physiotherapy, as most patients cannot keep exercising because of restrictive measures which has profoundly impacted on their health. Lastly, the relationship between PD and Sars-Cov2 may be even more complicated than it seems as some studies have hypothesized a possible Covid-19-induced parkinsonism. Hereby, we review the state of the art about the relationship between Covid-19 and Parkinson's Disease, focusing on each of these five points.
