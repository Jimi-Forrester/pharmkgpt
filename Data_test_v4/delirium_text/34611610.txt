34611610|t|Postnatal prebiotic supplementation in rats affects adult anxious behaviour, hippocampus, electrophysiology, metabolomics, and gut microbiota.
34611610|a|We have shown previously that prebiotic (Bimuno galacto-oligosacharides, B-GOS ) administration to neonatal rats increased hippocampal NMDAR proteins. The present study has investigated the effects of postnatal B-GOS  supplementation on hippocampus-dependent behavior in young, adolescent, and adult rats and applied electrophysiological, metabolomic and metagenomic analyses to explore potential underlying mechanisms. The administration of B-GOS  to suckling, but not post-weaned, rats reduced anxious behavior until adulthood. Neonatal prebiotic intake also reduced the fast decay component of hippocampal NMDAR currents, altered age-specific trajectories of the brain, intestinal, and liver metabolomes, and reduced abundance of fecal Enterococcus and Dorea bacteria. Our data are the first to show that prebiotic administration to rats during a specific postnatal period has long-term effects on behavior and hippocampal physiology. The study also suggests that early-life prebiotic intake may affect host brain function through the reduction of stress-related gut bacteria rather than increasing the proliferation of beneficial microbes.
