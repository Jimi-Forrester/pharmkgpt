METHODS: 'Neural stem cells' (NSCs) and 'neurogenesis' were used as keywords in Medline (1966 - November 2006) to identify relevant papers in the areas of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease (PD). This list was supplemented with papers from reference lists of seminal reviews. RESULTS: The concept of a 'stem cell' continues to evolve and is currently defined by operational criteria related to symmetrical renewal, multipotency and functional viability. In vivo adult mammalian neurogenesis occurs in discrete niches in the subventricular and subgranular zones - however, functional precursor cells can be generated in vitro from a wide variety of biological sources. Both artificial and physiological microenvironment is therefore critical to the characteristics and behaviour of neural precursors, and it is not straightforward how results from the laboratory can be extrapolated to the living organism. Transplant strategies in PD have shown that it is possible for primitive neural tissue to engraft into neuropathic brain areas, become biologically functional and lead to amelioration of clinical signs and symptoms. However, with long-term follow-up, significant problems related to intractable side-effects and potential neoplastic growth have been reported. These are therefore the potentials and pitfalls for NSC technology in neuropsychiatry. In AD, the physiology of amyloid precursor protein may directly interact with NSCs, and a role in memory function has been speculated. The role of endogenous neurogenesis has also been implicated in the etiology of depression. The significance of NSCs and neurogenesis for schizophrenia is still emerging. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of technical and conceptual challenges ahead before the promise of NSCs can be harnessed for the understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research into fundamental NSC biology and how this interacts with the neuropsychiatric disease processes is required.
