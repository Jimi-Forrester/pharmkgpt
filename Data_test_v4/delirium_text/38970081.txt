38970081|a|BACKGROUND: High doses of long-acting opioids were used to facilitate off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting procedure, which may result in opioid-related adverse events after surgery. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) had been reported to be effective in reducing intraoperative opioids consumption during surgery. The aim of this study is to assess whether TEAS with difference acupoints can reduce the doses of opioid analgesics. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. Patients underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting under general anesthesia were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomly and equally grouped into sham acupuncture group (n = 105), regional acupoints combination group (n = 105), or distal-proximal acupoints combination group (n = 105) using a centralized computer-generated randomization system. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation was applied for 30 min before anesthesia induction. The primary outcome was the doses of sufentanil during anesthesia. Secondary outcomes included the highest postoperative vasoactive-inotropic scores within 24 h, intraoperative propofol consumption, length of mechanical ventilation, duration of cardiac care unit and postoperative hospital stay, incidence of postoperative complications, and mortality within 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: Of the 315 randomized patients, 313 completed the trial. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, the doses of sufentanil were 303.9 (10.8) mug in the distal-proximal acupoints group, significantly lower than the sham group, and the mean difference was - 34.9 (- 64.9 to - 4.9) mug, p = 0.023. The consumption of sufentanil was lower in distal-proximal group than regional group (303.9 vs. 339.5), and mean difference was - 35.5 (- 65.6 to - 5.5) mug, p = 0.020. The distal-proximal group showed 10% reduction in opioids consumption comparing to both regional and sham groups. Secondary outcomes were comparable among three groups. CONCLUSION: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation with distal-proximal acupoints combination, compared to regional acupoints combination and sham acupuncture, significantly reduced sufentanil consumption in patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
