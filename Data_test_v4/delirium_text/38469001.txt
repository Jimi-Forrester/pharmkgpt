38469001|t|Efficacy of a Combined Periarticular and Intraosseous Multimodal Analgesic Injection Technique in Simultaneous Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38469001|a|Introduction Early postoperative pain poses a challenge for surgeons to manage after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Various techniques have been employed to optimize pain reduction, including Periarticular Multimodal Analgesia (PMA), recognized as a safe and effective method. Our study aims to enhance PMA through a combined intraosseous injection (PMA-I) and compare it with standard PMA. Methods Forty patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA surgery were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive PMA-I on one side of the knee, while the contralateral knee received standard PMA. Pain scores, bleeding, and range of motion (ROM) were assessed in both groups. Results The PMA-I group demonstrated statistically significant lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores at all postoperative time points, except at 48 hours, where the difference was not statistically significant. Postoperative bleeding and ROM did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusion PMA-I demonstrated both statistically and clinically significant reduction in early post-TKA pain, without additional costs, providing a technique that can be used to optimize postoperative pain control in TKA.
