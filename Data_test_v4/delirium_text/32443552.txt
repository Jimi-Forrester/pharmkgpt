32443552|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation has been the focus for a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. Naturally occurring polyphenols have an inhibitory effect on Abeta aggregation and have attracted a lot of attention for the development of treatment strategies which could mitigate the symptoms of AD. However, considerable evidence has shown that the pro-oxidant mechanisms of polyphenols could have a deleterious effect. Our group has established an assay system to evaluate the pro-oxidant characteristics of chemical compounds, based on their reactivity with DNA. In this review, we have summarized the anti-Abeta aggregation and pro-oxidant properties of polyphenols. These findings could contribute to understanding the mechanism underlying the potential risk of polyphenols. We would like to emphasize the importance of assessing the pro-oxidant properties of polyphenols from a safety point of view.
