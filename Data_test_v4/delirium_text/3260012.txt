3260012|a|Riege and Metter provide a useful review of the application of PET in the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We share their enthusiasm for continued support and development of tools to image metabolic processes. Our commentary focuses on neuroimaging and the diagnosis of AD and introduces some new data that directly impacts on the interpretation of PET-2-deoxyglucose (2DG) data.
