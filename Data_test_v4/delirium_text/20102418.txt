20102418|a|Today patients with mild to moderate Alzhiemer's disease (AD) have a treatment approach choice: oral or transdermal delivery. The aim of this review was to provide a concise, comprehensive overview of the clinically relevant safety, tolerability and efficacy information available for the rivastigmine transdermal system. Relevant articles were identified through a MEDLINE search of publications in the past 3 years using the terms 'rivastigmine' and 'transdermal' or 'patch'. Efficacy, safety and tolerability of the rivastigmine patch vs. placebo were established in a large, international, 24-week, double-blind, randomised clinical trial and subsequent 28-week open-label extension study. Drug exposure with the 9.5 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch was not significantly different to that provided by an oral capsule dose of 12 mg/day. Most frequently observed adverse events were gastrointestinal. In the primary study, incidences of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were: 5%, 3% and 3% respectively in the placebo group; 7%, 6% and 6% in the 9.5 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch group; and 23%, 17% and 5% in the 12 mg/day capsule group. Most patients experienced no, slight or mild application-site skin reactions. De novo patients or those taking oral rivastigmine or donepezil may tolerate a switch to rivastigmine patch. By providing drug exposure that is not significantly different to the highest recommended rivastigmine capsule dose (12 mg/day), with less fluctuation over 24 h, rivastigmine patch offers similar efficacy with an improved tolerability profile. The rivastigmine patch provides a viable treatment option for patients with mild to moderate AD.
