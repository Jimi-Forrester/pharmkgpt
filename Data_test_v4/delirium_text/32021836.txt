32021836|t|Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy: A Novel Modality for Immune Modulation.
32021836|a|Cancer remains a leading cause of death, despite multimodal treatment approaches. Even in patients with a healthy immune response, cancer cells can escape the immune system during tumorigenesis. Cancer cells incapacitate the normal cell-mediated immune system by expressing immune modulation ligands such as programmed death (PD) ligand 1, the B7 molecule, or secreting activators of immune modulators. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells were originally designed to target cancer cells. Engineered approaches allow CAR T cells, which possess a simplified yet specific receptor, to be easily activated in limited situations. CAR T cell treatment is a derivative of the antigen-antibody reaction and can be applied to various diseases. In this review, the current successes of CAR T cells in cancer treatment and the therapeutic potential of CAR T cells are discussed.
