26103109|t|[Night of the Alzheimer's patient: the nightmare of the caregiver via the caregivers'guides].
26103109|a|Care for Alzheimers' patients is quite a burden on the caregivers. Guides have been devoted to improve their knowledge about the disease and to help to provide the best care for the patient. A recent study on the reluctance of caregivers'spouses to seek external help, shows that none of 31 spouses had read a caregiver's guide. The aim of this study was to assess if caregiver's guides would help caregivers to deal with sleep/wake disorders. Amongst the 46 French guides, published between 1988 and 2013, thirty three raised the subject of the night sleep with more or less details. In these guides sleep disturbances are considered either as a symptom to be monitored or a natural aging process to be supported. We made a survey of the content of the caregiver's guides, of their goals and why they have been designed to. Then we analyze how the night sleep issue is dealt with in the guides, and eventually we consider the place to be granted to the patient in the management of his/her sleep disturbances.
