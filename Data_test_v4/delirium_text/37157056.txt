37157056|t|Reduced and Delayed Cerebrovascular Reactivity in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
37157056|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous and may contribute to disease pathophysiology or progression. There is a need to understand the mechanisms by which cerebrovascular dysfunction is altered in participants with PD. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that participants with PD exhibit a significant reduction in the ability of the cerebral vessels to dilate in response to vasoactive challenges relative to healthy controls (HC). METHODS: The current study uses a vasodilatory challenge while participants undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the amplitude and delay of cerebrovascular reactivity in participants with PD relative to age and sex-matched HC. An analysis of covariance was used to evaluate differences in cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude and latency between PD participants and HC. RESULTS: A significant main effect of group was observed for whole-brain cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude (F(1, 28)  = 4.38, p = 0.046, Hedge's g = 0.73) and latency (F(1, 28)  = 16.35, p < 0.001, Hedge's g = 1.42). Participants with PD exhibited reduced whole-brain amplitude and increased latencies in cerebrovascular reactivity relative to HC. The evaluation of regional effects indicates that the largest effects were observed in the cuneus, precuneus, and parietal regions. CONCLUSIONS: PD participants exhibited reduced and delayed cerebrovascular reactivity. This dysfunction may play an important role in chronic hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, mechanisms that could lead to disease progression. Cerebrovascular reactivity may serve as an important biomarker and target for future interventions.   2023 The Authors.
