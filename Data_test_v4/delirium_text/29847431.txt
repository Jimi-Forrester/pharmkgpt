29847431|t|Integrating a Mobility Champion in the Intensive Care Unit.
29847431|a|In recent years, early progressive mobilization programs have become mainstays in intensive care units (ICUs). Significant evidence exists that early mobility programs decrease length of stay, reduce time on the ventilator, and decrease the development of delirium in ICU patients. Yet, current literature still describes many barriers to performing early mobility, such as the time required, staffing pressures, and increased workload. Our critical care leaders found that defining and implementing a dedicated mobility champion team member was successful in improving the effectiveness of our early mobility program. This article describes how to define the mobility champion role, consider options for the person in the role, and integrate this new role into the ICU team.
