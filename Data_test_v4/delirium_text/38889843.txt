38889843|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is caused by neurodegenerative conditions and characterized by cognitive decline. Diagnostic accuracy for dementia subtypes, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease with dementia (PDD), remains challenging. METHODS: Here, different methods of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) analyses were employed to assess their effectiveness in distinguishing dementia subtypes from healthy controls under eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) conditions. RESULTS: Classic Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) power analyses differentiated between all conditions for the 4-8 Hz theta range. Only individuals with dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) differed from healthy subjects for the wider 4-15 Hz frequency range, encompassing the actual dominant frequency of all individuals. FFT results for this range yielded wider significant discriminators vs AR, also detecting differences between AD and DLB. Analyses of the inclusive dominant / peak frequency range (4-15 Hz) indicated slowing and reduced variability, also discriminating between synucleinopathies vs controls and AD. Dissociation of periodic oscillations and aperiodic components of AR spectra using Fitting-Oscillations-&-One-Over-F (FOOOF) modelling delivered a reliable and subtype-specific slowing of brain oscillatory peaks during EC and EO for all groups. Distinct and robust differences were particularly strong for aperiodic parameters, suggesting their potential diagnostic power in detecting specific changes resulting from age and cognitive status. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that qEEG methods can reliably detect dementia subtypes. Spectral analyses comprising an integrated, multi-parameter EEG approach discriminating between periodic and aperiodic components under EC and EO conditions may enhance diagnostic accuracy in the future.
