33204390|t|Evaluation of Binding of Rosmarinic Acid with Human Transferrin and Its Impact on the Protein Structure: Targeting Polyphenolic Acid-Induced Protection of Neurodegenerative Disorders.
33204390|a|Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural compound that is gaining wide popularity owing to its broad-spectrum biological activities. RA is known for its wide range of medicinal properties and therapeutic applications in a vast range of neurodegenerative disorders thus making it a vital natural compound. Human transferrin (hTf) is a clinically significant protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining iron homeostasis. The importance of studies pertaining to hTf is attributable to the pivotal role of iron deposition in CNS in neurodegenerative disorders. The study was intended to have an insight into the interaction between RA and hTf employing multispectroscopic approach, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation studies. Fluorescence quenching studies revealed that RA shows an excellent binding affinity to hTf with a binding constant (K) of 107 M-1 and is guided by static mode of quenching. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) further validated the spontaneous nature of binding. The estimation of enthalpy change ( H) and entropy change ( S) suggested that the RA-hTf complex formation is driven by hydrogen bonding, thereby making this process seemingly specific. Further, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra suggested that RA induces conformational and structural changes in hTf. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) studies were carried out to investigate the stability of the hTf and hTf-RA system and suggested that binding of RA induces structural alteration in hTf with free hTf being more stable. This study provides a rationale to use RA in drug development against neurodegenerative disorders by designing novel functional foods containing RA.
