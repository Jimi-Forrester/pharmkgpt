Moreover, oligomerized amyloid-beta (OAbeta) can be measured from blood for dementia screening. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship of plasma OAbeta levels with clinical and radiological variables in a health screening population. METHODS: WML, other volumetric parameters of magnetic resonance images, cognitive assessment, and plasma OAbeta level were evaluated. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants were analyzed. The majority of participants' clinical dementia rating was 0 or 0.5 (96.7%). White matter hyperintensities (WMH) increased with age, but OAbeta levels did not (r2 = 0.19, p < 0.001, r2 = 0.03, p = 0.10, respectively). No volumetric data, including cortical thickness/hippocampal volume, showed any significant correlation with OAbeta. Log-WMH volume was positively correlated with OAbeta (r = 0.24, p = 0.02), and this association was significant in the periventricular area. White matter signal abnormalities from 3D-T1 images were also correlated with the OAbeta in the periventricular area (p = 0.039). Multivariate linear regression showed that log-WMH values were independently associated with OAbeta (B = 0.879 (95% confidence interval 0.098 -1.660, p = 0.028)). Higher tertiles of WMH showed higher OAbeta levels than lower tertiles showed (p = 0.044). Using a cutoff of 0.78 ng/mL, the high OAbeta group had a larger WMH volume, especially in the periventricular area, than the low OAbeta group (p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Both WML and plasma OAbeta levels can be early markers for neurodegeneration in the healthcare population. The lesions, especially in the periventricular area, might be related to amyloid pathogenesis, which strengthens the importance of WML in the predementia stage.
