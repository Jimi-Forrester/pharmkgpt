38323091|a|The therapeutic potential of aerobic exercise in mitigating seizures and cognitive issues in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is recognized, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Using a rodent TLE model induced by Kainic acid (KA), we investigated the impact of a single bout of exercise (i.e., acute) or 4 weeks of aerobic exercise (i.e., chronic). Blood was processed for epilepsy-associated serum markers, and DNA methylation (DNAme), and hippocampal area CA3 was assessed for gene expression levels for DNAme-associated enzymes. While acute aerobic exercise did not alter serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) or Interleukin-6 (IL-6), chronic exercise resulted in an exercise-specific decrease in serum BDNF and an increase in serum IL-6 levels in epileptic rats. Additionally, whole blood DNAme levels, specifically 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), decreased in epileptic animals following chronic exercise. Hippocampal CA3 5-hmC levels and ten-eleven translocation protein (TET1) expression mirrored these changes. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that most 5-hmC changes in response to chronic exercise were neuron-specific within area CA3 of the hippocampus. Together, these findings suggest that DNAme mechanisms in the rodent model of TLE are responsive to chronic aerobic exercise, with emphasis on neuronal 5-hmC DNAme in the epileptic hippocampus.
