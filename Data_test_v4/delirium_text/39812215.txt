39812215|a|Due to the aging population, focusing on healthy aging has become a global priority. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and frailty, characterized by increased vulnerability to adverse stress and health events, interact synergistically in advanced age. In older adults, hip fractures are a frequent dramatic "life-transition" event. Conditions such as arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, heart failure, peripheral artery disease and adverse drug reactions may facilitate falls and thus bone fractures in older adults. Cardiovascular complications or the worsening of previous CVDs may increase the degree of frailty and disability following this surgery. The close relationship between older age, CVDs, frailty and orthopaedic surgery leads to the need to focus on the various phases of interventions in a multidisciplinary approach. This document aims to provide practical support to prevent cardiovascular complications in older and frail patients undergoing hip procedures by suggesting specific assessments and interventions. In particular, in pre-operative care the focus should be on the assessment and management of concomitant CVD and frailty, while immediate peri- and post-operative care should highlight specific concerns for anesthesia, prevention and management of thrombotic complications, specific nursing needs, including the prevention of infections and delirium, and the establishment of an integrated rehabilitation program focusing on CVDs and the risk of new falls, with a positive role for care-givers. Furthermore, by optimizing the "hip surgery pathway" the objective is to help avoid the deterioration of health and loss of independence that often result from this surgery through the correct management of cardiovascular patients in this peculiar context.
