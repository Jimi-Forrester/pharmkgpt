35056313|t|The Relationship between Cognitive Dysfunction and Postural Stability in Multiple Sclerosis.
35056313|a|Background and Objectives: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), most commonly characterized by balance dysfunction, fatigue syndrome and cognitive impairment. The goal of our study was to determine the association between cognitive functions and static posture control. Materials and Methods: The research group consisted of 76 randomized MS patients (ICDG 35.0) hospitalized at the Neurological Rehabilitation Clinic of the Medical University of Lodz. This group was divided into three subgroups according to the cognitive assessment based on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for patients over 65 years of age and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) under the age of 65. Fatigue syndrome was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and postural stability using a stabilometric platform. Results: The men demonstrated poorer stabilometric platform measurements than the women. Statistically significant differences were observed between patients without dysfunction and severe cognitive impairment. The results of the stabilometric platform were found to correlate with body mass index in all three groups of patients (Spearman's test). Conclusions: Body mass index and cognition have impact on postural stability in MS patients with moderate disability and fatigue syndrome.
