38740544|t|Protein kinase C epsilon-mediated modulation of T-type calcium channels underlies alcohol withdrawal hyperexcitability in the midline thalamus.
38740544|a|BACKGROUND: Millions of people struggle with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Abrupt abstinence after a period of chronic alcohol use can precipitate the alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), which includes hyperexcitability and, potentially, seizures. We have shown that T-type Ca2+ channels are novel, sensitive targets of alcohol, an effect that is dependent upon protein kinase C (PKC). The purpose of this study was to (1) understand midline thalamic neuronal hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal and its dependence on PKC; (2) characterize T channel functional changes using both current clamp and voltage clamp methods; and (3) determine which PKC isoform may be responsible for alcohol withdrawal (WD) effects. METHODS: Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed in midline thalamic neurons in brain slices prepared from C57bl/6 mice that underwent chronic intermittent alcohol exposure in a standard vapor chamber model. The recordings were compared to those from air-exposed controls. T-channel inactivation curves and burst responses were acquired through voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings, respectively. RESULTS: Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of native T-type current exhibited a depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependency of inactivation during alcohol withdrawal compared to air-exposed controls. A PKCepsilon translocation inhibitor peptide mitigated this change. Current clamp recordings demonstrated more spikes per burst during alcohol withdrawal. Consistent with voltage clamp findings, the PKCe translocation inhibitor peptide reduced the number of spikes per burst after WD. CONCLUSION: We found that alcohol WD produces T channel-mediated hyperexcitability in the midline thalamus, produced in part by a shift in the inactivation curve consistent with greater availability of T current. WD effects on T current inactivation were reduced to control levels by blocking PKCepsilon translocation. Our results demonstrate that PKCepsilon translocation plays an important role in the regulation of alcohol withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability in midline thalamic circuitry.
