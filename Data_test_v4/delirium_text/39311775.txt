39311775|a|INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may be an early marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Until recently, it was impossible to measure biomarkers specific for alpha-synuclein pathology; therefore, its association with subjective reports of cognitive decline is unknown. METHODS: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants without dementia (n = 918) were classified as positive or negative for amyloid beta (Abeta+ or Abeta-) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn+ or alpha-syn-) biomarkers. Self- and study partner-reported cognitive decline was measured with the Everyday Cognition (ECog) questionnaire. RESULTS: Per self-report, Abeta+/alpha-syn+ had the greatest cognitive decline. Abeta-/alpha-syn+ did not differ from Abeta-/alpha-syn- across ECog scores. Study partner-reported results had a similar pattern, but Abeta+/alpha-syn- and Abeta+/alpha-syn+ did not differ across ECog scores. Mild cognitive impairment classification moderated the study partner-reported memory score. DISCUSSION: While alpha-syn+ alone did not increase subjective reports of cognitive decline, Abeta+/alpha-syn+ had the most self- and study partner-rated cognitive decline. Therefore, the presence of multiple pathologies was associated with greater SCD. HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) seed amplification assay was used to determine alpha-syn positivity. Amyloid beta (Abeta)-/alpha-syn-, Abeta-/alpha-syn+, Abeta+/alpha-syn-, and Abeta+/alpha-syn+ biomarker groups were created. Abeta+/alpha-syn+ had greater subjective cognitive decline (SCD) than the other biomarker groups. Abeta-/alpha-syn+ did not differ from Abeta-/alpha-syn- across self- or study-partner reported SCD scores. Study partner-reported subjective memory results were largely driven by participants with mild cognitive impairment.
