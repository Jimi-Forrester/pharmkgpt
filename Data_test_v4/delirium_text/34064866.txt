34064866|t|Twenty Years of Research on Cyclodextrin Conjugates with PAMAM Dendrimers.
34064866|a|Recently, the number of gene and oligonucleotide drugs are increasing. Of various drug delivery systems (DDSs) for gene and oligonucleotide drugs, few examples of the clinical application of polymer as drug carriers are known, despite development of the novel polymers has been progressing. Cyclodextrin (CD) conjugates with starburst polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer (CDEs), as a new type of polymer-based carriers, were first published in 2001. After that, galactose-, lactose-, mannose-, fucose-, folate-, and polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-appended CDEs have been prepared for passive and active targeting for gene, oligonucleotide, and low-molecular-weight drugs. PEG-appended CDE formed polypsuedorotaxanes with alpha-CD and gamma-CD, which are useful for a sustained release system of gene and oligonucleotide drugs. Interestingly, CDEs were found to have anti-inflammatory effects and anti-amyloid effects themselves, which have potential as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Most recently, CDE is reported to be a useful Cas9-RNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNP) carrier that induces genome editing in the neuron and brain. In this review, the history and progression of CDEs are overviewed.
