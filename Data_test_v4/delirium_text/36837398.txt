36837398|a|Background and Objectives. Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more people are suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, and a considerable fraction of COVID-19 survivors have a variety of persistent neuropsychiatric problems after the initial infection. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a different perspective on mental disorders from Western biomedicine. Effective management of mental disorders has become an increasing concern in recent decades due to the high social and economic costs involved. This study attempts to express and ontologize the relationships between different mental disorders and physical organs from the perspective of TCM, so as to bridge the gap between the unique terminology used in TCM and a medical professional. Materials and Methods. Natural language processing (NLP) is introduced to quantify the importance of different mental disorder descriptions relative to the five depots and two palaces, stomach and gallbladder, through the classical medical text Huangdi Neijing and construct a mental disorder ontology based on the TCM classic text. Results. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework integrates NLP and data visualization, enabling clinicians to gain insights into mental health, in addition to biomedicine. According to the results of the relationship analysis of mental disorders, depots, palaces, and symptoms, the organ/depot most related to mental disorders is the heart, and the two most important emotion factors associated with mental disorders are anger and worry & think. The mental disorders described in TCM are related to more than one organ (depot/palace). Conclusion. This study complements recent research delving into co-relations or interactions between mental status and other organs and systems.
