37799246|t|Comparing the Incidence of Propranolol and Esmolol-Related Cardiac Arrest in Patients With Thyroid Storm: A Systematic Literature Review.
37799246|a|A precarious complication of thyrotoxicosis, or thyroid storm, is the increased risk of cardiomyopathy, which leads to circulatory collapse and cardiopulmonary arrest. It is crucial to promptly identify this condition to prevent significant deterioration of the left ventricular function and cardiogenic shock. This article seeks to examine published research that emphasizes the connection between thyroid storm and beta-blocker usage in relation to cardiogenic collapse and provides management recommendations. The search was performed on September 9, 2022, using PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar libraries. A systematic exploration was carried out using the keywords Thyroid Storm AND cardiogenic Shock AND cardiac arrest AND beta blocker. The use of beta blockers as part of thyroid storm management was linked to the development of cardiogenic collapse and cardiac arrest. Ultra-short-acting beta-blockers like esmolol were a safer option than propranolol in treating patients with a thyrotoxic storm.
