38201973|t|Study of Serum Copper and Zinc Levels and Serum Cu/Zn Ratio among Polish Women with Endometrial Cancer.
38201973|a|BACKGROUND: Micronutrients are important components for the homeostasis of the human body. The studies available in the literature of the subject on their impact on the risk of population diseases, including malignant neoplasms, are ambiguous. In this paper, the relationship between Cu and Zn serum levels and the occurrence of endometrial cancer have been analyzed. METHODS: 306 patients (153 test group and 153 control group) matched for age were analyzed for Cu and Zn levels. Microelements levels were determined for sera collected during the hospitalization of patients by means of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, the Cu/Zn ratio in the population included in the study was analyzed. Univariable and multivariable analyzes were used to examine the relationship between the factors under study and the incidence of endometrial cancer. RESULTS: Lower levels of elements were observed in the study group compared with the control group (Cu: 959.39 mug/L vs. 1176.42 mug/L, p < 0.001; Zn: 707.05 mug/L vs. 901.67 mug/L, p < 0.001). A statistically significant relationship with the occurrence of endometrial cancer was observed for Cu and Zn. The patients with the lowest Cu level had a significantly higher occurrence of endometrial cancer compared with reference tertile (OR 8.54; p < 0.001). Similarly, compared with the reference tertile, the patients with the lowest Zn levels had a significantly greater incidence of endometrial cancer (OR 15.0; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest an association of endometrial cancer occurrence with lower Cu and Zn serum levels.
