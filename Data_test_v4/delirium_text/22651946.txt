22651946|a|CONTEXT: Although an evidence-based clinical guideline for parenteral hydration therapy was established in Japan, the efficacy of the guideline has not been assessed. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to explore the effect of parenteral hydration therapy based on this clinical guideline on quality of life (QoL), discomfort, symptoms, and fluid retention signs in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, observational study included 161 patients with advanced abdominal cancer who received guideline-based hydration therapy. We evaluated the longitudinal changes of the global QoL (Item 30 of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-C30); the Discomfort Scale; the intensity of seven physical symptoms; and the severity of fluid retention signs. We also evaluated patient satisfaction and the feeling of benefit from hydration one week after the study commenced, and bronchial secretions, hyperactive delirium, communication capacity, and agitation 48 hours before a patient's death. RESULTS: The global QoL, the Discomfort Scale, and the intensities of all physical symptoms, except for vomiting and drowsiness, were stable throughout the study period. More than 80% of patients maintained all fluid retention signs. Patient global satisfaction was 76.4 (0-100) and feeling of benefit was 5.43 (range 0-7). CONCLUSION: Guideline-based parenteral hydration therapy contributed to maintaining global QoL and provided satisfaction and a feeling of benefit without increasing discomfort and worsening symptoms and fluid retention signs in patients with advanced cancer.
