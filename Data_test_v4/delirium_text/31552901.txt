31552901|a|The main symptom of patients with Alzheimer's disease is cognitive dysfunction. Alzheimer's disease is mainly diagnosed based on changes in brain structure. Functional connectivity reflects the synchrony of functional activities between non-adjacent brain regions, and changes in functional connectivity appear earlier than those in brain structure. In this study, we detected resting-state functional connectivity changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease to provide reference evidence for disease prediction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data from patients with Alzheimer's disease were used to show whether particular white and gray matter areas had certain functional connectivity patterns and if these patterns changed with disease severity. In nine white and corresponding gray matter regions, correlations of normal cognition, early mild cognitive impairment, and late mild cognitive impairment with blood oxygen level-dependent signal time series were detected. Average correlation coefficient analysis indicated functional connectivity patterns between white and gray matter in the resting state of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Functional connectivity pattern variation correlated with disease severity, with some regions having relatively strong or weak correlations. We found that the correlation coefficients of five regions were 0.3-0.5 in patients with normal cognition and 0-0.2 in those developing Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, in the other four regions, the range increased to 0.45-0.7 with increasing cognitive impairment. In some white and gray matter areas, there were specific connectivity patterns. Changes in regional white and gray matter connectivity patterns may be used to predict Alzheimer's disease; however, detailed information on specific connectivity patterns is needed. All study data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Library of the Image and Data Archive Database.
