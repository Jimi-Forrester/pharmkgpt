37563582|a|PURPOSE: Below knee amputation (BKA) is a common surgical procedure for diabetic foot ulcers and necrotizing lower limb fasciitis patients. However, it is a painful procedure and inadequate postoperative analgesia impedes rehabilitation and prolongs hospitalization. An ideal pain management regimen should provide superior analgesia while minimizing opioid consumption and improving rehabilitation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of 218 patients who underwent BKA for diabetic foot ulcer or necrotizing lower limb fasciitis at a single center between January 2017 and September 2020. Two groups were analyzed: patients who received dual nerve block (DNB) before surgery (Group I; n = 104), and patients who did not (Group II; n = 93). By the exclusion criteria, 21 patients were excluded. The femoral and sciatic nerves were each blocked separately under ultrasound guidance. This procedure was performed immediately before the operation. RESULTS: Group I patients' subjective pain scores were significantly lower than that of Group II at 6, 12, and 24 h after BKA (P < 0.05). Group I's morphine milligram equivalent (MME) was significantly lower than those of Group II at 72 h after BKA (P < 0.05). Moreover, the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and delirium was significantly lower in Group I patients than that in Group II patients. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided lower extremity nerve block surgery is excellent for early postoperative pain control, could be used as an accurate and effective pain control method, and can reduce the side effects of opioid consumption after BKA.
