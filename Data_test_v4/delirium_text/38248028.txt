38248028|t|The Role of Interleukin-10 in the Pathogenesis and Treatment of a Spinal Cord Injury.
38248028|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that often leads to severe and permanent neurological deficits. The complex pathophysiology of an SCI involves a cascade of events, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and secondary injury processes. Among the myriad of molecular players involved, interleukin-10 (IL-10) emerges as a key regulator with the potential to modulate both the inflammatory response and promote neuroprotection. This comprehensive review delves into the intricate interplay of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of an SCI and explores its therapeutic implications in the quest for effective treatments. IL-10 has been found to regulate inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, and glial scars after an SCI. Its neuroprotective properties have been evaluated in a plethora of animal studies. IL-10 administration, either isolated or in combination with other molecules or biomaterials, has shown neuroprotective effects through a reduction in inflammation, the promotion of tissue repair and regeneration, the modulation of glial scar formation, and improved functional outcomes. In conclusion, IL-10 emerges as a pivotal player in the pathogenesis and treatment of SCIs. Its multifaceted role in modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, glial scars, and neuroprotection positions IL-10 as a promising therapeutic target. The ongoing research exploring various strategies for harnessing the potential of IL-10 offers hope for the development of effective treatments that could significantly improve outcomes for individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries. As our understanding of IL-10's intricacies deepens, it opens new avenues for innovative and targeted therapeutic interventions, bringing us closer to the goal of alleviating the profound impact of SCIs on patients' lives.
