34584465|t|Effects of COVID-19 on the Musculoskeletal System: Clinician's Guide.
34584465|a|The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, continues to impact all facets of daily life. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 commonly include musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgias, arthralgias, and neuropathies/myopathies. The inflammatory response and its impact on the respiratory system have been the focus of most studies. However, the literature is more limited regarding the inflammatory response and its implications for other organ systems, specifically the musculoskeletal system. Previous studies have described how systemic inflammation may play a role in bone and joint pathology. Furthermore, it is important to understand the effects current therapeutics used in the treatment of COVID-19 may have on the musculoskeletal system. In this study, we will review the current understanding of the effect COVID-19 has on the musculoskeletal system, provide an overview of musculoskeletal symptoms of patients infected with the virus, and address key issues for clinicians to address during the care of COVID-19 patients.
