32477872|t|An unusual presentation of hemiparesis: Rapidly progressing Streptococcal pneumoniae meningitis secondary to acute mastoiditis.
32477872|a|A sixty-three year-old male who arrived to our emergency department with signs and symptoms of an acute left middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident. Initial neurovascular imaging failed to demonstrate any abnormalities that explained his symptoms. His neurologic status rapidly deteriorated in conjunction with the development of severe sepsis. The patient required endotracheal intubation and was transferred to our intensive care unit. After an extensive diagnostic work-up, the etiology of his condition was determined to be due to bacterial meningitis originating from acute mastoiditis. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient improved with intravenous antimicrobials, intravenous dexamethasone and a left sided myringotomy with tympanostomy tube. The patient made a complete neurological recovery following this treatment.
