39104072|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery. METHODS: The basic case data of 566 patients who underwent spine surgery under general anesthesia from January 2021 to January 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 296 males and 270 females with an average age of (71.58 +- 4.21) years old. There were 195 cases of cervical spine surgery, 26 cases of thoracic spine surgery and 345 cases of lumbar spine surgery.According to the occurrence of postoperative delirium, the patients were divided into postoperative delirium group(41 patients) and non-delirium group (525 patients). Univariate analysis was used to analyze the possible influencing factors such as gender, age, weight, smoking history, drinking history, surgical site, preoperative anxiety, intraoperative hypotension times, blood loss and so on, and binary Logistic regression was used to analyze the univariate factors with P<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients developed postoperative delirium. Univariate analysis showed that age (P=0.000), duration of surgery (P=0.039), preoperative anxiety (P=0.001), blood loss (P=0.000), history of opioid use (P=0.003), history of stroke (P=0.005), C-reactive protein (P=0.000), sodium ion(P=0.000) were significantly different between delirium group and non-delirium group. These factors were included in the binary Logistic regression analysis, and the results showed that age [OR=0.729, 95%CI(0.569, 0.932), P=0.012], opioid use [OR=21.500, 95%CI(1.334, 346.508), P=0.031], blood loss [OR=0.932, 95%CI(0.875, 0.993), P=0.029], C-reactive protein [OR=0.657, 95%CI(0.485, 0.890), P=0.007], preoperative anxiety [OR=23.143, 95%CI(1.859, 288.090), P=0.015], and sodium [OR=1.228, 95%CI(1.032, 1.461), P=0.020] were independent risk factors for the development of delirium after spinal surgery in elderly patients. CONCLUSION: Age, opioid use, blood loss, preoperative anxiety, elevated c-reactive protein, and hyponatremia are independent risk factors for the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery.
