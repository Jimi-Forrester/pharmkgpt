25454768|a|Prevention has been shown to be the most effective strategy for minimizing the occurrence of delirium as well as delirium-associated complications.(5) Therefore prevention of delirium in older adults undergoing surgery is a top research priority given the extent of the problem in this patient population. In this review, we will describe the POD syndrome, previously identified risk factors that predict POD in surgical cancer patients, long-term outcomes of POD and both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies aimed at preventing POD.
