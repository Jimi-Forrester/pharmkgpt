37678257|t|Podocyte Injury in Diabetic Kidney Disease in a Mouse Model Involves TRPC6-mediated Calpain Activation Impairing Autophagy.
37678257|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease is associated with impaired podocyte autophagy and subsequent podocyte injury. The regulation of podocyte autophagy is unique, because it minimally utilizes the mTOR and AMPK pathways. Thus, the molecular mechanisms underlying the impaired autophagy in podocytes in diabetic kidney disease remain largely elusive. METHODS: This study investigated how the calcium channel TRPC6 and the cysteine protease calpains deleteriously affect podocyte autophagy in diabetic kidney disease in mice. We demonstrated that TRPC6 knockdown in podocytes increased the autophagic flux due to decreased cysteine protease calpains activity. Diabetic kidney disease was induced in vivo using streptozotocin with unilateral nephrectomy in the BTBRob/ob mouse model. RESULTS: Diabetes increased TRPC6 expression in podocytes in vivo with decreased podocyte autophagic flux. Transgenic overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin, as well as pharmacological inhibition of calpain activity, normalized podocyte autophagic flux, reduced nephrin loss, and prevented the development of albuminuria in diabetic mice. In kidney biopsies from patients with diabetes, we further confirmed that TRPC6 overexpression in podocytes correlates with decreased calpastatin expression, autophagy blockade, and podocyte injury. CONCLUSION: Overall, we discovered a new mechanism that connects TRPC6 and calpain activity to impaired podocyte autophagy, increased podocyte injury, and development of proteinuria in the context of diabetic kidney disease. Therefore, targeting TRPC6 and/or calpain to restore podocyte autophagy might be a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic kidney disease.
