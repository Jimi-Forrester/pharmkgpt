38288394|t|Seizures, Psychosis, and Cerebral Vascular Malformation: A Rare Chain of Events.
38288394|a|Background: In psychiatry, anatomical abnormalities are sometimes forgotten, and this can mislead doctors into thinking that the diagnosis is purely psychiatric. A physical examination is important whenever it is possible. Even though cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) are rare and can go unnoticed, in some cases they can cause clinical symptoms, which is a complication. Case Presentation. In this case, we describe a patient with no prior medical or psychiatric history having a cAVM diagnosed after showing psychotic symptoms (delusion and disorganized thoughts and behavior). The deep 4 x 5 cm cAVM was discovered after admitting the patient to psychiatric ward, the neurological cause has been considered after a recorded seizure, which brings the following question: Is the clinical presentation a direct result of the cAVM or is it postictal? Conclusions: An abnormality leading to another, here is how we could describe our patient's psychopathology leading to psychotic symptoms. The two hypotheses explaining this case report have a low rate of occurring making this a rare case. Either way, neurological cause cannot be overlooked even if the clinical presentation is typical.
