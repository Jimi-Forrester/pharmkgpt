33764687|t|The 100 most-cited articles about the role of neurovascular unit in stroke 2001-2020: A bibliometric analysis.
33764687|a|BACKGROUND: The neurovascular unit (NVU) is emerging as a potential therapeutic target in neurological conditions, such as stroke, brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease; meanwhile, stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. The purpose of the study is to analyze the most influential articles, authors, countries, and topics in the role of NVU in stroke. METHODS: The Web of Science (WoS) database was used for bibliometric analysis using the search terms "Stroke" and "Neurovascular unit" on January 1st, 2021. Data were extracted from the WoS database to identify collaborations between authors, countries, organizations, and keywords using VOSviewer (1.6.16 mac). Two bibliometric indicators, the activity index (AI) and category normalized citation impact (CNCI), were computed. The keywords of bursts were also identified by CiteSpace. RESULTS: A total of 770 articles were analyzed by VOSviewer. AIs and CNCIs were computed of the eighteen countries according to VOSviewer co-authorship analysis results. The majority of authors mainly came from the United States and Japan. Romania, Hungary, and Poland have emerged as rising-star countries. In the 100 most-cited articles, the number of citations ranged from 1873 to 69, with a total of 15,758 citations. Most articles were published in 2011 and 2012 (n = 13 each), followed by 2009 (n = 11) and 2013, 2014, and 2015 (n = 8 each). Stroke and Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism were the two top journals. EH Lo from Harvard University/ Massachusetts General Hospital was the top first author and corresponding author. Harvard University/Massachusetts General Hospital was the most productive affiliated institution with 15 publications. CONCLUSION: There has been growing attention and efforts made in the field of stroke and NVU. The merit of the above findings may help to shape the research policy in ischemic stroke both at the country and institutional level.
