27385268|a|UNLABELLED: Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), also known as Raf kinase inhibitor protein, belongs to PEBP family of proteins. It is known to interact with many proteins that are mainly involved in pathways that monitor cell proliferation and differentiation. PEBP1 in many cells interacts with several pathways, namely MAPK, GRK2, NF-kB, etc. that keeps the cell proliferation and differentiation in check. This protein is expressed by many cells in humans, including neurons where it is predominantly involved in production of choline acetyltransferase. Deregulated PEBP1 is known to cause cancer, diabetic nephropathy and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia. Recent research led to the discovery of many drugs that mainly target the interaction of PEBP1 with its partners. These compounds are known to bind PEBP1 in its conserved domain which abrogate its association with interacting partners in several different pathways. We outline here the latest developments in understanding of PEBP1 function in maintaining cell integrity. Copyright   2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein is crucial in regulation of MAPK and PKC pathways. Its diverse roles, including regulating these pathways keep cell differentiation and proliferation in check. This review outlines some latest findings which greatly add to our current knowledge of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein.
