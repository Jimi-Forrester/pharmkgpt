26425347|t|Effect of therapeutic plasma exchange on plasma levels and total removal of adipokines and inflammatory markers.
26425347|a|BACKGROUND: Aside from well-established inflammatory mediators adipokines have recently been found to play an important role in a variety of immunologic diseases. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is an established treatment modality for the acute removal of pathophysiological relevant disease mediators. The aim of this study was to determine adipokine removal during TPE therapy. METHODS: 21 Caucasian patients (10 females, 11 males) with an indication for TPE using albumin as exchange fluid received two consecutive TPE sessions. Blood samples for measurement of resistin, leptin, sICAM-1, sCD40L, MCP-1, and sTNF-R were drawn before and at the end of each TPE session. Samples from the total removed plasma were collected at the end of every treatment. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in pre- vs. post-TPE plasma concentrations for sICAM-1 (517 +- 246 vs. 260 +- 159 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), sTNF-R (8.1 +- 6.4 vs. 5.7 +- 3.9 ng/ml, p < 0.05), and resistin plasma levels (14.3 +- 6.9 vs. 9.5 +- 4.7 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Solely sICAM-1 reduction persisted for 25 +- 5 h between the first and second TPE treatment, while the other investigated mediators increased to baseline levels. Substantial amounts of all measured mediators could be recovered from the removed plasma. CONCLUSIONS: TPE provides a persistent reduction in sICAM-1 levels and temporarily affects several adipokine and cytokine plasma levels. Our findings are of importance not only for the interpretation of blood levels of cytokines in patients undergoing TPE but provide solid evidence that TPE markedly decreases sICAM-1.
