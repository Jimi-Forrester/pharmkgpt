38187561|t|A programmable dual-targeting di-valent siRNA scaffold supports potent multi-gene modulation in the central nervous system.
38187561|a|Di-valent short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising therapeutic modality that enables sequence-specific modulation of a single target gene in the central nervous system (CNS). To treat complex neurodegenerative disorders, where pathogenesis is driven by multiple genes or pathways, di-valent siRNA must be able to silence multiple target genes simultaneously. Here we present a framework for designing unimolecular "dual-targeting" di-valent siRNAs capable of co-silencing two genes in the CNS. We reconfigured di-valent siRNA - in which two identical, linked siRNAs are made concurrently - to create linear di-valent siRNA - where two siRNAs are made sequentially attached by a covalent linker. This linear configuration, synthesized using commercially available reagents, enables incorporation of two different siRNAs to silence two different targets. We demonstrate that this dual-targeting di-valent siRNA is fully functional in the CNS of mice, supporting at least two months of maximal target silencing. Dual-targeting di-valent siRNA is highly programmable, enabling simultaneous modulation of two different disease-relevant gene pairs (e.g., Huntington's disease: MSH3 and HTT; Alzheimer's disease: APOE and JAK1) with similar potency to a mixture of single-targeting di-valent siRNAs against each gene. This work potentiates CNS modulation of virtually any pair of disease-related targets using a simple unimolecular siRNA.
