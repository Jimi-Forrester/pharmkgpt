34104806|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system where an autoimmune response leads to chronic inflammation. It represents the second leading cause of non-traumatic disability in the world, affecting mainly young adults and with high female to male incidence. At present, the causative agent in MS is unknown, preventing the development of prophylaxis policies and the understanding of how the human system copes with this complex inflammation. Tetracyclines (Tet) have attracted great attention due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Minocycline and doxycycline represent the second-generation Tet that have been largely used to treat acne and to suppress inflammation. In addition, they are safer and cheaper than other drugs currently used to treat MS. AIM: This study aims to review recent data involving the Tet minocycline and doxycycline and their therapeutic potential in MS. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Many of the drugs used to treat MS have severe side effects and are costly. Tet, on the other hand, are a safe and inexpensive class of drugs that can modulate the immune response in MS patients.
