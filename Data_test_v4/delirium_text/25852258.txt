25852258|t|Case report of rabies-induced persistent mental symptoms.
25852258|a|Rabies is a viral infection with a high case fatality rate. Typical symptoms of rabies include hydrophobia, pharynx muscle spasms, and progressive paralysis. Rabies-induced persistent mental disturbances are rare. Here we report a 22-year-old male who was infected with rabies after being attacked by a dog. He did not receive rabies vaccine immediately after the incident and was only provided with non-standard treatment at a local clinic. A week later he became disorientated, paranoid, and aggressive. One month after the attack, rabies antibody was found in his cerebrospinal fluid and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of his head revealed abnormal signals in the putamina, caudate nucleus, and insula. His mental symptoms persisted for six years and his daily functioning was severely impaired, but his vital signs were stable without signs of brain stem damage. Six years after the incident, a repeat MRI showed brain atrophy.
