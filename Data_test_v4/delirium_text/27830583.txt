27830583|a|As the main source of energy (celluar ATP) in eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are involved in cellular physiology and pathology. The balance of mitochondrial dynamic, fission and fusion regulated by quality control mechanisms, provides a guarantee for maintaining mitochondrial function, even celluar function. Worn out mitochondria would be removed through mitophagy which is regulated by autophagy related proteins and mitochondrial membrane proteins. Drp1, dynamic-related protein 1, is regarded as one of the most important proteins to evaluate mitochondrial fission mediating mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases (eg. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and heart failure. Recent studies have focused on the roles of Drp1 in ischemia-induced mitophagy in the hippocampal CA3 region, and traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced cell death together with functional deficits. However, the exact mechanisms have not been well characterized. In this review, we will discuss and clarify the role of Drp1 and mitophagy in nervous system diseases and brain injury therein, with a special emphasis on their molecular mechanisms mediating mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy.
