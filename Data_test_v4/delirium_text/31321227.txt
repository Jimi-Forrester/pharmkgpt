31321227|t|A Systematic Review of Thirty-One Assessment Tests to Evaluate Mobility in Older Adults.
31321227|a|Assessments of gait, balance, and transfer in elderly people play a valuable role in maintaining healthy aging and preventing a decline in mobility. Several evaluation tools have been proposed; however, clinicians should select the most accurate ones wisely, based on numerous criteria. This systematic review aims to identify all applicable elderly mobility assessment tests and show their measurement properties with as much detail as possible. Initially, a broad search was performed. Articles were screened based on their titles and abstracts, and only studies published in English were considered. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 assessment tests evaluating the mobility of healthy elderly people were found. Then, further searches were completed to identify the measurement properties of each test. These characteristics include the origin and year of establishment, several practicality factors, and validity. The analysis of our outcomes illustrates the similarities and differences between the identified tests.
