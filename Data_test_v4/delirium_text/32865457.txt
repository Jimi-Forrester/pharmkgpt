32865457|a|Objectives: Diversity is needed within the aging and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research and practice workforce to comprehensively address health inequities faced by underrepresented minority (URM) older adults. We conducted a scoping review of training programs designed to diversify the pool of researchers and practitioners in the field of aging and ADRD. Methods: Online database searches yielded 3976 articles published from 1999 to 2019. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Results: All programs were from the United States and included URM populations. Nine programs included students, one targeted university faculty, and four targeted clinical staff. Only five programs were guided by theory. Discussion: Our review identified URMs' desire for culturally diverse and representative mentorship, the need for career development support at various training stages, and the importance of incorporating theory to program design. It also identified key characteristics for future program development, creation of systematic evaluation standards, and opportunities for promotion.
