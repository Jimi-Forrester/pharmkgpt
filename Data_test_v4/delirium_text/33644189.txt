33644189|t|Endoscopic repair of delayed stomach perforation caused by penetrating trauma: A case report.
33644189|a|BACKGROUND: Primary endoscopic closure of a perforated gastric wall during endoscopic procedures is mostly effective and well-tolerated; however, there are very few studies on the efficacy of endoscopic management of delayed traumatic gastric perforation. Herein, we report a novel case of a patient who was successfully treated for delayed traumatic stomach perforation using an alternative endoscopic modality. CASE SUMMARY: A 39-year-old woman presented with multiple penetrating traumas in the back and left abdominal cavity. Initial imaging studies revealed left diaphragmatic disruption and peri-splenic hemorrhage without gastric perforation. An emergency primary repair of the disrupted diaphragm with omental reduction and suturing of the lacerated lung was performed; however, delayed free perforation of the gastric wall was noted on computed tomography after 3 d. Following an emergency abdominal surgery for the primary repair of the gastric wall, re-perforation was noted 15 d postoperatively. The high risk associated with re-surgery prompted an endoscopic intervention using 2 endoloops and 11 endoscopic clips using a novel modified purse-string suture technique. The free perforated gastric wall was successfully repaired without additional surgery or intervention. The patient was discharged after 46 d without any complications. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic closure with endoloops and clips can be a useful therapeutic alternative to re-surgery for delayed traumatic gastric perforation.
