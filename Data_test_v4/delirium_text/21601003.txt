21601003|t|Amyloid-beta: the seeds of darkness.
21601003|a|Whilst the amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis/centric theory continues to evolve, genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence still suggests that Abeta is central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, Abeta-oligomers/soluble Abeta, may be an earlier determinant of Alzheimer's disease and better correlative of cognitive impairment. Whilst there are a number of Abeta-oligomeric species in existence (making therapeutic and diagnostic biomarker choice cumbersome), their existence is in equilibrium with Abeta-fibrils, the main constituent of cored plaques. Although Alzheimer's disease remains incurable, improvements to Abeta immunotherapies and strategies to target Abeta continue to evolve, with the reliance upon Abeta imaging to shed light on the outcome of therapeutics proving very useful.
