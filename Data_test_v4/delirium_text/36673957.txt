36673957|t|Can Smart Home Technologies Help Older Adults Manage Their Chronic Condition? A Systematic Literature Review.
36673957|a|The management of chronic diseases requires personalized healthcare that allows older adults to manage their diseases at home. This systematic review aimed to describe the smart home technologies used in the management of chronic diseases in older people. A systematic literature review was conducted on four databases and was reported following the PRISMA statement. Nineteen articles were included. The intervention technologies were classified into three groups: smart home, characterized by environmental sensors detecting motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity; external memory aids, characterized by a partnership between mobile apps and smart home-based activity learning; and hybrid technology, with the integration of multiple technologies, such as devices installed at patients' homes and telemedicine. The health outcomes evaluated are vital signs, medication management, ADL-IADL, mobility, falls, and quality of life. Smart homes show great potential in the management of chronic diseases by favouring the control of exacerbations and increasing patients' safety by providing support in disease management, including support for cognitively impaired older people. The use of smart homes in the community could bring numerous benefits in terms of continuity of care, allowing the constant monitoring of older people by local and hospital health services.
