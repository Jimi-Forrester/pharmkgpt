8862328|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine the pattern of benzodiazepine prescribing in hospital and at discharge in relation to prior benzodiazepine therapy. DESIGN: Patient interview within 48 hours of admission to determine benzodiazepine, alcohol and other psychotropic drug use before admission and review of medical records after discharge to document drugs prescribed in hospital and at discharge. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital, January to August 1995. RESULTS: 1453 patients (mean age, 60 [SD, 19] years; 52.7% female) were interviewed; 277 patients (19.1%) were taking benzodiazepines regularly (one or more doses per week) before admission. Of these, 28.5% did not have benzodiazepine therapy continued while in hospital and 63.9% did not receive benzodiazepines at the time of discharge. Of the remaining 1176 patients (those not previously taking benzodiazepines), 277 (23.6%) were prescribed them for the first time in hospital and 5.3% received benzodiazepines at the time of discharge. Older age, female sex, marital status (single, divorced or widowed) and the use of antidepressants and Schedule 8 narcotic analgesics were all statistically significant predictors of benzodiazepine use before admission, but alcohol consumption was not. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of patients do not have their benzodiazepine therapy continued in hospital and at the time of discharge, and are thus at risk of developing benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, including delirium. A small but clinically significant number of patients who do not usually take benzodiazepines receive them at the time of discharge and may be at risk of becoming long term users.
