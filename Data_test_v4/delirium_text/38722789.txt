38722789|t|Advancing Neurological Health: Insights into Aging, Immunity, and Vascular Dynamics.
38722789|a|This editorial provides an overview of recent advancements in the understanding and treatment of neurological disorders, focusing on aging, immunity, and blood flow, as featured in this special issue. The first section explores the importance of identifying biomarkers of aging and aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, highlighting the emerging role of saliva-based biomarkers and the gut-brain axis in disease diagnosis and management. In the subsequent section, the dysregulated immune systems associated with aging are discussed, emphasizing the intricate landscape of the immune system during aging and its bidirectional relationship with neuroinflammation. Additionally, insights into the involvement of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis are presented. The third section examines the role of microglia in neuroinflammation and various neurological diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM). Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of stem cell and extracellular vesicle-based therapies for stroke is explored, along with molecular mechanism of how inflammation regulates cerebral and myocardial ischemia. Finally, the importance of blood flow in maintaining vascular health and its impact on neurological disorders are discussed, highlighting the potential of novel assessment methods for optimizing patient care. Overall, this special issue offers valuable insights into the complex mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and identifies potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.
