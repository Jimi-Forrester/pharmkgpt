37346234|t|Alzheimer Disease and Related Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: A Narrative Review of Screening, Prevention, and Management for Manual Therapy Providers.
37346234|a|Objective: The aim of this narrative review was to review literature relevant to manual therapists about cognitive impairment, together with screening, potential treatment, and prevention modalities. Methods: A literature search of AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PubMed, and MEDLINE was conducted with the search terms "cognitive decline," "cognitive impairment," "screening," and "prevention." We reviewed current screening practices, including functional exams, imaging, and laboratory testing. We reviewed current potential preventive measures and treatments being implemented in practice. Results: We selected 49 resources for this narrative summary. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Exam are recommended screening tools. Imaging and laboratory testing are not recommended in screening for cognitive decline. Promotion of healthy, active living through physical and mental activities may assist with prevention of cognitive decline. Conclusion: Cognitive decline affects a large proportion of the US population. Recognizing signs and symptoms of this condition starts with individuals, caretakers, family members, and health care providers. Health care providers should utilize the most appropriate screening tools to assess the presence of cognitive conditions.
