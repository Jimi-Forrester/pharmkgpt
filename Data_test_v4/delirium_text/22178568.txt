22178568|a|The role of miR-124 on the expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an important cleavager of amyloid precursor protein that plays a pivotal role in the beta-amyloid production, was studied in this paper using cellular models for Alzheimer' disease (AD) of cultured PC12 cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD.
