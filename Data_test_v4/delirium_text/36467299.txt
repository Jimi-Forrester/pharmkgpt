36467299|t|Persistence of Neutralizing Antibodies and Clinical Protection up to 12 Months After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in the Elderly.
36467299|a|Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely affected the elderly, who are expected to display decreased immune responses due to immunosenescence. Methods: This study retrospectively assesses neutralizing antibody (NAb) production up to 12 months after infection in long-term care patients. We used Roche Diagnostics immunoassay to quantify anti-spike (S) antibodies and a competitive immunoassay from YHLO as a surrogate test for NAb. Results: We included 91 patients (mean age, 86 years). There was no significant variation in anti-S titers over time. There was a significant decrease of NAb titers between month 3 and month 6 but no further significant change up to month 12. Overall, 75 of 91 (82%) and 52 of 91 (57%) patients had, at least once, anti-S titers >75 U/mL and NAb titers >50 AU/mL, respectively, corresponding to a significant neutralizing activity in vitro. All 68 patients studied at M12 had detectable anti-S antibodies and 60 (88%) had detectable NAb; 60 of 68 (88%) and 29 of 68 (42.6%) still had anti-S titers >75 U/mL and NAb titers >50 AU/mL. Higher NAb titers were correlated with severe infection, higher levels of C-reactive protein, and lower lymphocyte counts. No patient developed reinfection. Conclusions: Elderly people can display robust and persistent humoral response after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with NAb lasting up to 12 months.
