27910928|a|This work was designed to explore the effective components and targets of herbal medicine AS1350 and its effect on "Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome" (KYDS) based on a chinmedomics strategy which is capable of directly discovering and predicting the effective components, and potential targets, of herbal medicine. Serum samples were analysed by UPLC-MS combined with pattern recognition analysis to identify the biomarkers related to the therapeutic effects. Interestingly, the effectiveness of AS1350 against KYDS was proved by the chinmedomics method and regulated the biomarkers and targeting of metabolic disorders. Some 48 marker metabolites associated with alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, sphingolipids metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism were identified. The correlation coefficient between the constituents in vivo and the changes of marker metabolites were calculated by PCMS software and the potential effective constituents of AS1350 were also confirmed. By using chinmedomics technology, the components in AS1350 protecting against KYDS by re-balancing metabolic disorders of fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, etc. were deduced. These data indicated that the phenotypic characterisations of AS1350 altering the metabolic signatures of KYDS were multi-component, multi-pathway, multi-target, and overall regulation in nature.
