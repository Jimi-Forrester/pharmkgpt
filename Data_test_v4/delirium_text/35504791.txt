35504791|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is associated with increased mortality. Therefore, it is important to manage delirium during the entire perioperative period. Preoperative anxiety is associated with poor prognosis in postoperative patients who have undergone cardiovascular surgery. This study aims to investigate the relationship between preoperative anxiety and onset of delirium after cardiovascular surgery in elderly patients (aged 65 years or older), considering the individual psychological characteristics, such as personality and stress coping skills in response to anxiety, as confounding factors. METHODS: This prospective study included patients aged >65 years in a preoperative state before undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Subjects were divided into two groups based on whether they experienced postoperative delirium, or not. We compared clinical and demographic factors, preoperative psychiatric and psychological factors, and intraoperative and perioperative physical factors between the control and delirium groups. Multiple imputations were used to account for missing data. RESULTS: Out of 168 subjects enrolled in this study, 26 (15.5%) developed postoperative delirium. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in age (P = 0.027), cognitive function (P = 0.007), agreeableness (P = 0.029), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score (P = 0.023) between the delirium and control groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis did not identify a significant association between preoperative anxiety and the onset of postoperative delirium. However, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.114, P = 0.018), agreeableness (OR = 0.555, P = 0.008), and the APACHE-II score (OR = 1.227, P = 0.008) were identified as risk factors for postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: Agreeableness, one of the personality traits associated with preoperative anxiety, appears to be involved in the development of postoperative delirium as an independent psychological factor, regardless of age or physical factors.
