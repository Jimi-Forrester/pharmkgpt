30326011|t|Association of Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy Before Menopause Onset With Medial Temporal Lobe Neurodegeneration.
30326011|a|Importance: There is an increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia in women who undergo bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before menopause. However, data are lacking on the association of BSO before menopause with imaging biomarkers that indicate medial temporal lobe neurodegeneration and Alzheimer disease pathophysiology. Objective: To investigate medial temporal lobe structure, white matter lesion load, and beta-amyloid deposition in women who underwent BSO before age 50 years and before reaching natural menopause. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study of women in the population-based Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging-2 (MOA-2) and in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) in Olmsted County, Minnesota, included women who underwent BSO from 1988 through 2007 and a control group from the intersection of the 2 cohorts. Women who underwent BSO and control participants who underwent a neuropsychological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) were included in the analysis. Data analysis was performed from November 2017 to August 2018. Exposure: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in premenopausal women who were younger than 50 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cortical beta-amyloid deposition on PiB-PET scan was calculated using the standard uptake value ratio. White matter hyperintensity volume and biomarkers for medial temporal lobe neurodegeneration (eg, amygdala volume, hippocampal volume, and parahippocampal-entorhinal cortical thickness) on structural MRI and entorhinal white matter fractional anisotropy on diffusion tensor MRI were also measured. Results: Forty-one women who underwent BSO and 49 control participants were recruited. One woman was excluded from the BSO group after diagnosis of an ovarian malignant condition, and 6 women were excluded from the control group after undergoing BSO after enrollment. Twenty control participants and 23 women who had undergone BSO completed all examinations. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age at imaging was 65 (62-68) years in the BSO group and 63 (60-66) years in the control group. Amygdala volume was smaller in the BSO group (median [IQR], 1.74 [1.59-1.91] cm3) than the control group (2.15 [2.05-2.37] cm3; P < .001). The parahippocampal-entorhinal cortex was thinner in the BSO group (median [IQR], 3.91 [3.64-4.00] mm) than the control group (3.97 [3.89-4.28] mm; P = .046). Entorhinal white matter fractional anisotropy was lower in the BSO group (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.18-0.22]) than the control group (0.22 [0.20-0.23]; P = .03). Women were treated with estrogen in both groups (BSO, n = 22 of 23 [96%]; control, n = 10 of 19 [53%]). Global cognitive status test results did not differ between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Abrupt hormonal changes associated with BSO in premenopausal women may lead to medial temporal lobe structural abnormalities later in life. Longitudinal evaluation is needed to determine whether cognitive decline follows.
