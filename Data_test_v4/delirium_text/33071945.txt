33071945|t|Menopause and Brain Health: Hormonal Changes Are Only Part of the Story.
33071945|a|Most studies of menopause and brain aging have focused on the role of the sex steroid hormone, estradiol, as a key mechanisms contributing to cognitive and brain aging in women. An emerging literature demonstrates that beyond endogenous estradiol levels, menopausal symptoms, particularly vasomotor symptoms (VMS), are also key determinants of menopause-related changes in cognition and brain function. Critically, that literature shows the importance of using objective techniques to identify associations of VMS with memory performance, brain structure, and brain function. While self-report measures are important patient-centered outcomes in women's health research, objective measures of VMS typically relate more strongly to indices of cognitive and brain health. Currently, it is premature to make a causal claim about VMS and memory dysfunction, but initial findings raise the possibility that women with VMS might experience an improvement in cognition with VMS treatment. More generally, these findings underscore the utility of investigating female-specific risk factors for cognitive decline.
