39241972|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Research suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds promise in offering innovative approaches to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. In our endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to delve into the landscape of TCM research within the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the present scenario, breadth, and trends in this field. This analysis presents potentially valuable insights for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine and provides compelling evidence supporting its efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. AIM OF THE STUDY: The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the rise, yet effective treatments are still lacking. Research indicates that TCM could offer novel perspectives for addressing neurodegenerative conditions. Nonetheless, the literature on this topic is intricate and multifaceted, with existing reviews offering only limited coverage. To gain a thorough understanding of TCM research in neurodegenerative diseases, we undertook a bibliometric analysis to explore the current status, scope, and trends in this area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was carried out on April 1, 2024, utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Visualization and quantitative analyses were then performed with the assistance of CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R software. RESULTS: A total of 6,856 articles were retrieved in the search. Research on TCM for neurodegenerative diseases commenced in 1989 and has exhibited a notable overall growth since then. Main research contributors include East Asian countries like China, as well as the United States. Through our analysis, we identified 15 highly productive authors, 10 top-tier journals, 13 citation clusters, 11 influential articles, and observed a progression in keyword evolution across 4 distinct categories. In 2020, there was a significant upsurge in the knowledge base, collaboration efforts, and publication output within the field. This field is interdisciplinary: network pharmacology emerges as the cutting-edge paradigm in TCM research, while Alzheimer's disease remains a prominent focus among neurodegenerative conditions due to its evolving etiology. A burst detection analysis unveils that in 2024, the focal points of research convergence between TCM and neurodegenerative diseases lie in two key biological processes or mechanisms: autophagy and microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study quantitatively and visually captures the evolution of TCM in addressing neurodegenerative diseases, showcasing a notable acceleration in recent years. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of interdisciplinary collaboration and the necessity for increased global partnerships. Network pharmacology, leveraging the advancements of the big data era, embraces a holistic and systematic approach as a novel paradigm in exploring traditional Chinese medicine and unraveling their fundamental mechanisms. Three ethnomedical plants-Tianma, Renshen, and Wuweizi-demonstrate the promise of their bioactive compounds in treating neurodegenerative disorders, bolstered by their extensive historical usage for such ailments. Moreover, our intricate analysis of the evolutionary trajectories of key themes such as targets and biomarkers substantially enriches our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms involved.
