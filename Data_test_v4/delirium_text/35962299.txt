35962299|a|In attempts to develop effective therapeutic strategies to limit post-ischemic injury, mitochondria emerge as a key element determining neuronal fate. Mitochondrial damage can be alleviated by various mechanisms including mitochondrial network remodelling, mitochondrial elimination and mitochondrial protein biogenesis. However, the mechanisms regulating relationships between these phenomena are poorly understood. We hypothesized that mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a mitochondrial GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, mitochondria trafficking and mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethering, may act as one of linking and regulatory factors in neurons following ischemic insult. To verify this assumption, we performed temporal oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD/R) on rat cortical primary culture to determine whether Mfn2 protein reduction affected the onset of mitophagy, subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis and thus neuronal survival. We found that Mfn2 knockdown increased neuronal susceptibility to OGD/R, prevented mitochondrial network remodelling and resulted in prolonged mitophagosomes formation in response to the insult. Next, Mfn2 knockdown was observed to be accompanied by reduced Parkin protein levels and increased Parkin accumulation on mitochondria. As for wild-type neurons, OGD/R insult was followed by an elevated mtDNA content and an increase in respiratory chain proteins. Neither of these phenomena were observed for Mfn2 knockdown neurons. Collectively, our findings showed that Mfn2 in neurons affected their response to mild and transient OGD stress, balancing the extent of defective mitochondria elimination and positively influencing mitochondrial respiratory protein levels. Our study suggests that Mfn2 is one of essential elements for neuronal response to ischemic insult, necessary for neuronal survival.
