24717007|t|Nanoethosomes mediated transdermal delivery of vinpocetine for management of Alzheimer's disease.
24717007|a|AIM: To develop and statistically optimize nanoethosomal formulation for transdermal delivery of vinpocetine as an anti-Alzheimer's drug. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Box-Behnken experimental design was applied for optimization of nanoethosomes. The independent variables were phospholipid (X1), Tween 80 (X2) and Ethanol (X3) while entrapment efficiency (Y1), particle sizes (Y2), elasticity (Y3) and flux (Y4) were the dependent variables. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Optimized nanoethosomal vinpocetine formulation with mean particle size 50.57 +- 26.11 nm showed 97.51 +- 0.86% entrapment efficiency, achieved mean transdermal flux 925.60 +- 39.80 microg/cm2/h and elasticity of 86.61 +- 2.88. Ex-vivo study of nanoethosomal formulation showed a significant increase flux and entrapment efficiency compared with control vinpocetine solution. Our results suggest that nanoethosome is an efficient carrier for transdermal delivery of vinpocetine as compared to its oral form.
