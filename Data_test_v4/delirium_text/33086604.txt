33086604|a|The current study investigated the protective potential of Azolla pinnate ethanolic extract (APE) against lead-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Sixty male Wistar albino rats were randomly allocated into six groups (n = 10). The control group was orally administrated with saline. The second group received lead acetate (100 mg/kg body weight (BW) orally for 60 days). The third group was fed with APE (10 mg/kg BW orally for 60 days). The fourth group was administrated with lead acetate like the second group and APE like the third group, concomitantly, for 60 days. The fifth group was administrated with APE like the third group for 30 days, then orally administrated with the lead acetate like the second group for another 30 days. The sixth group was administrated with lead acetate like the second group for 30 days, then with APE like the third group for a further 30 days. Phytochemical analysis of APE indicated the presence of peonidin 3-O-glucoside cation, vitexin, rutin, thiamine, choline, tamarixetin, hyperoside, astragalin, and quercetin. The latter has been elucidated using one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (1D and 2D NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Lead acetate increased the serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases and that of urea, creatinine, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 1beta, hepatic tissue malondialdehyde contents, and caspase 3 protein expression, as well as altering the hepatic tissue architecture. However, it decreased the serum levels of interleukin 10 and glutathione (GSH) contents, and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase in hepatic tissue. In contrast, the administration of APE ameliorated the lead-induced alterations in liver function and structure, exemplifying the benefits of Azolla's phytochemical contents. Collectively, A. pinnate extract is a protective and curative agent against lead-induced hepatotoxicity via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic impacts.
