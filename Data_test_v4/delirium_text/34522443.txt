34522443|a|High expression of mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a mitochondrial fusion protein, has been frequently associated with poor prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. Here, we aimed to identify the function of MFN2 in cervical cancer to understand its influence on disease prognosis. To this end, from cervical adenocarcinoma, we performed an MTT assay and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis to assess the effects of MFN2 on the proliferation and of HeLa cells. Then, colony-formation ability and tumorigenesis were evaluated using a tumor xenograft mouse model. The migration ability related to MFN2 was also measured using a wound healing assay. Consequently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MFN2-knockdowned HeLa cells originating from adenocarcinoma. markers related to MFN2 were assessed by qRT-PCR. Clinical data were analyzed using cBioPortal and The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that MFN2 knockdown reduced the proliferation, colony formation ability, migration, and in vivo tumorigenesis of HeLa cells. Primarily, migration of MFN2-knockdowned HeLa cells decreased through the suppression of EMT. Thus, we concluded that MFN2 facilitates cancer progression and in vivo tumorigenesis in HeLa cells. These findings suggest that MFN2 could be a novel target to regulate the EMT program and tumorigenic potential in HeLa cells and might serve as a therapeutic target for cervical cancer. Taken together, this study is expected to contribute to the treatment of patients with cervical cancer.
