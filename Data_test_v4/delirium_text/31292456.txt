31292456|t|The molecular nature of the 17beta-Estradiol binding site in the voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel beta1 subunit.
31292456|a|The accessory beta1 subunit modulates the Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (BK) channel gating properties mainly by increasing its apparent Ca2+ sensitivity. beta1 plays an important role in the modulation of arterial tone and blood pressure by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). 17beta-estradiol (E2) increases the BK channel open probability (Po) in SMCs, through a beta1 subunit-dependent modulatory effect. Here, using molecular modeling, bioinformatics, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology, we identify a cluster of hydrophobic residues in the second transmembrane domain of the beta1 subunit, including the residues W163 and F166, as the binding site for E2. We further show that the increase in Po induced by E2 is associated with a stabilization of the voltage sensor in its active configuration and an increase in the coupling between the voltage sensor activation and pore opening. Since beta1 is a key molecular player in vasoregulation, the findings reported here are of importance in the design of novel drugs able to modulate BK channels.
