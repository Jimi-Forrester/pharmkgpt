24632849|a|The relationship between Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is relatively well established in Caucasians, but less established in other ethnicities. To examine the association between ApoE polymorphism and the onset of AD in Chinese population, we searched the commonly used electronic databases between January 2000 and November 2013 for relevant studies. Total 20 studies, including 1576 cases and 1741 controls, were retrieved. The results showed statistically significant positive association between risk factor epsilon4 allele carriers and AD in Chinese population (OR = 3.93, 95% CI = 3.37-4.58, P < 0.00001). Genotype ApoE epsilon4/epsilon4 and epsilon4/epsilon3 have statistically significant association with AD as well (epsilon4/epsilon4: OR = 11.76, 95% CI = 6.38-21.47, P < 0.00001; epsilon4/epsilon3: OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.57-3.69, P < 0.00001). Furthermore, the frequency of the ApoE epsilon3 is lower in AD than that in the health controls, and the difference of epsilon3 allele is also statistically significant (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.37-0.47, P < 0.00001). No significant heterogeneity was observed among all studies. This meta-analysis suggests that the subject with at least one ApoE epsilon4 allele has higher risk suffering from AD than controls in Chinese population. The results also provide a support for the protection effect of ApoE epsilon3 allele in developing AD.
