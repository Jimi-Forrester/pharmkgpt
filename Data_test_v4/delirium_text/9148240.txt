9148240|a|The localization of amyloid beta protein (A beta), A beta 40, A beta 42, and transthyretin (TTR) was investigated immunohistochemically in the autopsied human kidney, using polyclonal antibodies against TTR, A beta and C-terminal end-specific antibodies against A beta 40 and 42. Immunoreactivities of A beta and A beta 40 were found both in the proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells. But the immunolocalization of A beta 40 was observed predominantly in the distal tubules whereas that of A beta 42 was predominantly recognized in the proximal tubules. TTR, sequestrating protein for A beta, was present in the proximal tubules. The mechanism by which A beta does not form amyloid in Alzheimer's disease outside the brain remains unknown. The tubular epithelial cells in the kidney may provide a useful system to shed light on this issue.
