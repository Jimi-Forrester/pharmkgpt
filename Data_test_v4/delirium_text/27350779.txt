27350779|t|Cognitive and Functional Decline among Individuals 50 Years of Age or Older in Cambe, Parana, Brazil: A Population-Based Study.
27350779|a|AIMS: To identify the frequency of cognitive and functional decline (CFD) among adults 50 years of age and older by a population-based study. METHODS: Cognitive function was analyzed by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the functional conditions were based on instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Cases of CFD included individuals with cognitive decline and 2 or more compromised IADL. RESULTS: A total of 693 individuals were studied. The frequency of CFD was 16.3%. A low socioeconomic profile was associated with greater CFD independent of gender, age, education, and presence of depression (OR = 2.46; 95% CI: 1.53-3.97). CONCLUSIONS: These data show a high frequency of CFD among adults 50 years and older. Individuals with less education and a lower socioeconomic level exhibited poorer cognitive and functional conditions.
