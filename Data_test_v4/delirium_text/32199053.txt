32199053|a|Sleep is a key function that takes up one third of our lives. Sleep deprivation may lead to physical and psychological disorders in the short and long term. Hospitalization, regardless of its cause, does not favor good enough and restorative sleep. It is affected by both external (light, noise) and internal (procedures, drugs, care) factors. The intensive care unit is the place where falling asleep and maintaining sleep is more difficult. This is in addition to disease severity and the characteristics of its structure and functioning. A poor sleep quantity or quality may trigger an acute confusional state, which often affects hospitalized children, known as delirium. Promoting a joint effort among all sectors of the hospital setting targeted at protecting sleep as much as possible is the required task.
