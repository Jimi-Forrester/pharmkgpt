38552116|t|Remote Associations Between Tau and Cortical Amyloid-beta Are Stage-Dependent.
38552116|a|Background: Histopathologic studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques promote the spread of neurofibrillary tau tangles. However, these two proteinopathies initiate in spatially distinct brain regions, so how they interact during AD progression is unclear. Objective: In this study, we utilized Abeta and tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans from 572 older subjects (476 healthy controls (HC), 14 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 82 with mild AD), at varying stages of the disease, to investigate to what degree tau is associated with cortical Abeta deposition. Methods: Using multiple linear regression models and a pseudo-longitudinal ordering technique, we investigated remote tau-Abeta associations in four pathologic phases of AD progression based on tau spread: 1) no-tau, 2) pre-acceleration, 3) acceleration, and 4) post-acceleration. Results: No significant tau-Abeta association was detected in the no-tau phase. In the pre-acceleration phase, the earliest stage of tau deposition, associations emerged between regional tau in medial temporal lobe (MTL) (i.e., entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus) and cortical Abeta in lateral temporal lobe regions. The strongest tau-Abeta associations were found in the acceleration phase, in which tau in MTL regions was strongly associated with cortical Abeta (i.e., temporal and frontal lobes regions). Strikingly, in the post-acceleration phase, including 96% of symptomatic subjects, tau-Abeta associations were no longer significant. Conclusions: The results indicate that associations between tau and Abeta are stage-dependent, which could have important implications for understanding the interplay between these two proteinopathies during the progressive stages of AD.
