36162703|t|Pin1 and Alzheimer's disease.
36162703|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an immense and growing public health crisis. Despite over 100 years of investigation, the etiology remains elusive and therapy ineffective. Despite current gaps in knowledge, recent studies have identified dysfunction or loss-of-function of Pin1, a unique cis-trans peptidyl prolyl isomerase, as an important step in AD pathogenesis. Here I review the functionality of Pin1 and its role in neurodegeneration.
