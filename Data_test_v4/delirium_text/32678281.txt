32678281|t|Macrophagic myofasciitis and subcutaneous pseudolymphoma caused by aluminium adjuvants.
32678281|a|Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known adjuvant used in vaccines. Although it can enhance an adaptive immune response to a co-administered antigen, it causes adverse effects, including macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF), subcutaneous pseudolymphoma, and drug hypersensitivity. The object of this study is to demonstrate pediatric cases of aluminium hydroxide-induced diseases focusing on its rarity, under-recognition, and distinctive pathology. Seven child patients with biopsy-proven MMF were retrieved from the Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) pathology archives from 2015 to 2019. The medical records and immunisation history were reviewed, and a full pathological muscle examination was carried out. The mean age was 1.7 years (8.9-40 months), who had records of vaccination against hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and tetanus toxoid on the quadriceps muscle. The chief complaints were muscle weakness (n = 6), delayed motor milestones (n = 6), instability, dysarthria, and involuntary movement (n = 1), swallowing difficulty (n = 1), high myopia (n = 1), and palpable subcutaneous nodules with skin papules (n = 1). Muscle biopsy showed MMF (n = 6) and pseudolymphoma (n = 1) with pathognomic basophilic large macrophage infiltration, which had distinctive spiculated inclusions on electron microscopy. The intracytoplasmic aluminium was positive for PAS and Morin stains. Distinctive pathology and ultrastructure suggested an association with aluminium hydroxide-containing vaccines. To avoid misdiagnosis and mistreatment, we must further investigate this uncommon condition, and pharmaceutical companies should attempt to formulate better adjuvants that do not cause such adverse effects.
