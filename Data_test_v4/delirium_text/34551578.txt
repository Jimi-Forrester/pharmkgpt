34551578|a|OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the imaging techniques most commonly used to study Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging biomarkers can be used to evaluate these abnormalities, improve the ability of early diagnosis and help predict disease progression. These signs mainly include local brain atrophy on structural MRI, hypometabolic foci, and amyloid plaque deposition in the brain detected by specific imaging. These techniques not only have their unique advantages, but can complement each other in multimodal imaging evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. METHODS: A literature search was performed on PubMed using the search term combinations "Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-beta plaques", and "MRI". We discuss various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based techniques, including direct imaging, indirect imaging, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque and radiomics, Hybrid PET/MRI and MRI imaging technology in the future, placing a special emphasis on multimodal imaging, and focus our review on the MRI features of Abeta plaques (AD biomarkers). CONCLUSIONS: After a lot of research and reasonable selection, multimodal imaging composed of MRI and PET can significantly improve the diagnosis and treatment of AD patients, and the complementary information can be obtained by the new PET/MR instrument at the same time. The findings of this review emphasize that multimodal imaging is likely to be the preferred method for future AD research and clinical practice.
