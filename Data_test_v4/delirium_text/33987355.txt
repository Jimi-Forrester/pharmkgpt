33987355|t|SET knockdown attenuated phenotype modulation and calcium channel associated markers of airway smooth muscle cells in asthmatic mice.
33987355|a|BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional phenotype modulation and calcium channels in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) are important characteristics of airway remodeling in chronic asthma. However, the mechanisms underlying these pathological processes remain unclear. SET (I2PP2A, inhibitor-2 of protein phosphatase 2A) has many significant functions and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes. This study aimed to determine the function of SET in chronic asthma. METHODS: BALB/c mice were sensitized by ovalbumin injection and repeated inhalation of ovalbumin. The Penh value was measured using the Buxco whole body plethysmography system. A short hairpin RNA of the SET gene was designed and transfected into ASMCs derived from asthmatic mice. Flow cytometry of Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining was used for evaluating cell apoptosis. Western blot was adopted to measure the expression levels of ASMCs phenotype modulation markers and calcium channel-associated proteins. RESULTS: The results showed that shRNA targeting SET significantly decreased the expression of SET, and enhanced the apoptosis of ASMCs. SET knockdown promoted the expression of contractile phenotype markers such as alpha-SMA (alpha smooth muscle Actin), SM-MHC (smooth muscle Myosin heavy chain), and calponin, and inhibited the expression of synthetic phenotype markers including vimentin and CD44. The expression of the calcium channel-related proteins STIM1 (Stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1 were also inhibited after SET knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that SET participated in the development of airway dysfunction in asthma, suggesting that the silencing of SET may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of asthma patients.
