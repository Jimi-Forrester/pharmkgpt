37932983|a|To summarize the nursing experience of treating pediatric fulminant myocarditis with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The intensive care unit of our hospital treated 6 children with fulminant myocarditis with ECMO from 2019 to 2022. The main nursing measures included establishing an ECMO rescue team, preparing before initiation of ECMO, management of arterial and venous catheters, enteral nutrition support, reducing the risk of infection aggravation, anticoagulation management, prevention of bleeding and thrombosis, management of ECMO pump failure, and post-ECMO care. One child's family abandoned treatment and left the hospital, while the other 5 children were transferred to the cardiovascular department after stable weaning from ECMO and continued treatment, with good condition, and eventually discharged. Pediatric fulminant myocarditis has a high mortality rate, but detailed evaluation and nursing care can improve the outcome of these patients.
