Notably, combined exposure to triazine herbicides atrazine (ATR), simazine (SIM), and propazine (PRO) may promote the development of AD, but the mechanism is unknown. AIM: To study the molecular mechanism of AD induced by triazine herbicides. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of AD patients and controls were identified. The intersectional targets of ATR, SIM, and PRO for possible associations with AD were screened through network pharmacology and used for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The binding potentials between the core targets and herbicides were validated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics. RESULTS: A total of 1,062 DEGs were screened between the AD patients and controls, which identified 148 intersectional targets of herbicides causing AD that were screened by network pharmacology analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that cell cycling and cellular senescence were important signalling pathways. Finally, the core targets EGFR, FN1, and TYMS were screened and validated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that combined exposure to triazine herbicides might promote the development of AD, thereby providing new insights for the prevention of AD.
