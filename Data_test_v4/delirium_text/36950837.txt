36950837|t|Molecular and Cellular Crosstalk between Bone and Brain: Accessing Bidirectional Neural and Musculoskeletal Signaling during Aging and Disease.
36950837|a|Molecular omics technologies, including proteomics, have enabled the elucidation of key signaling pathways that mediate bidirectional communication between the brain and bone tissues. Here we provide a brief summary of the clinical and molecular evidence of the need to study the bone-brain axis of cross-tissue cellular communication. Clear clinical and molecular evidence suggests biological interactions and similarities between bone and brain cells. Here we review the current mass spectrometric techniques for studying brain and bone diseases with an emphasis on neurodegenerative diseases and osteoarthritis/osteoporosis, respectively. Further study of the bone-brain axis on a molecular level and evaluation of the role of proteins, neuropeptides, osteokines, and hormones in molecular pathways linked to bone and brain diseases is critically needed. The use of mass spectrometry and other omics technologies to analyze these cross-tissue signaling events and interactions will help us better understand disease progression and comorbidities and potentially identify new pathways and targets for therapeutic interventions. Proteomic measurements are particularly favorable for investigating the role of signaling and secreted and circulating analytes and identifying molecular and metabolic pathways implicated in age-related diseases.
