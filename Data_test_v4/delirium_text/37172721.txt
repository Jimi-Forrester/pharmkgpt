37172721|t|Orthogonal approaches required to measure proteasome composition and activity in mammalian brain tissue.
37172721|a|Proteasomes are large macromolecular complexes with multiple distinct catalytic activities that are each vital to human brain health and disease. Despite their importance, standardized approaches to investigate proteasomes have not been universally adapted. Here, we describe pitfalls and define straightforward orthogonal biochemical approaches essential to measure and understand changes in proteasome composition and activity in the mammalian central nervous system. Through our experimentation in the mammalian brain, we determined an abundance of catalytically active proteasomes exist with and without a 19S cap(s), the regulatory particle essential for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Moreover, we learned that in-cell measurements using activity-based probes (ABPs) are more sensitive in determining the available activity of the 20S proteasome without the 19S cap and in measuring individual catalytic subunit activities of each beta subunit within all neuronal proteasomes. Subsequently, applying these tools to human brain samples, we were surprised to find that post-mortem tissue retained little to no 19S-capped proteasome, regardless of age, sex, or disease state. Comparing brain tissues (parahippocampal gyrus) from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and unaffected subjects, available 20S proteasome activity was significantly elevated in severe cases of AD, an observation not previously noted. Taken together, our study establishes standardized approaches for comprehensive investigation of proteasomes in mammalian brain tissue, and we reveal new insight into brain proteasome biology.
