34062254|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder involving neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. The tau phosphorylation responsible for neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid deposition which causes plaques are both accelerated through the activity of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). In addition to these pathological pathways, 5-LO has also been linked to the neuro-inflammation associated with disease progression as well as to dysbiosis in the gut. Interestingly, gut dysbiosis itself has been correlated to AD development. Not only do gut metabolites have direct effects on the brain, but pro-inflammatory mediators such as LPS, BMAA and bacterial amyloids produced in the gut due to dysbiosis reach the brain causing increased neuro-inflammation. While microbial dysbiosis and 5-LO exert detrimental effects in the brain, the cause/effect relationship between these factors remain unknown. These issues may be addressed using mouse models of AD in the context of different knockout mice in the 5-LO pathway in specific pathogen-free, germ-free as well as gnotobiotic conditions.
