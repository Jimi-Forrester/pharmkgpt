36443761|a|BACKGROUND: The identification of patients with advanced chronic conditions and palliative care needs is essential since their care represents one of the main challenges for public health systems. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of inpatients with palliative care needs in different services of a tertiary care hospital using the NECPAL CCOMS-ICO  tool. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional cohort study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. The NECPAL tool identifies patients who require palliative care. Any patient with the Surprise Question with the answer "NO" and at least another question of the tool with a positive answer is considered a positive identification. Patients were classified as Non-NECPAL, NECPAL I-II, and NECPAL III, depending on the NECPAL tool criteria they met. The presence of physical symptoms, emotional distress, and social risk factors was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 602 inpatients, 236 (39.2%) were enrolled. Of them, 34 (14.4%) non-NECPAL, 202 (85.6%) NECPAL+ [105 (44.5%) NECPAL I-II, and 97 (41.1%) NECPAL III]. Physical symptom burden was high (pain intensity >= 1 in 68.3% of patients; tiredness >= 1 in 83.5%; somnolence >= 1 in 50.6%; dyspnea >= 1 in 37.9%; anorexia >= 1 in 59.5%). 64.1% had emotional distress, and 83.6% had social risk factors. The NECPAL-III group contained a higher percentage of cancer patients, higher demand for palliative care, and greater need for palliative care (p < 0.001). In 50.8% of cases, no referrals were made to psychology, social work, or hospital palliative and supportive care teams. The three services with the higher number of patients with palliative care needs were: Palliative Care Unit (100%), Oncology (54.54%), and Emergency Short-stay Unit (54.16%). CONCLUSION: A high percentage of patients admitted to tertiary care hospitals presented palliative care needs, with multiple unmet physical, emotional, and social needs. Less than 50% are referred to specialized care teams, such as hospital palliative and supportive care teams.
