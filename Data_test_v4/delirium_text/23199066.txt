23199066|a|Microtubules are key cytoskeletal elements found in all eukaryotic cells. The microtubule shaft is composed of the heterodimer protein, tubulin and decorated with multiple microtubule associated protein, regulating microtubule function. Tau (tubulin associated unit) or MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau), among the first microtubule associated proteins to be identified, was implicated in microtubule initiation as well as assembly, with increased expression in neurons and specific association with axonal microtubules. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent tauopathy, exhibiting tau-neurofibrillary tangles associated with cognitive dysfunction. AD is also characterized by beta-amyloid plaques. An abundance of tau inclusions, in the absence of beta-amyloid deposits, can be found in Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and other diseases, collectively described as tauopathies. The increase in tau pathology in AD correlates with the associated cognitive decline. The current manuscript touches on the variability as well as common denominators of the various tau pathologies coupled to new approaches/current innovation in treatment of tauopathies in favor of advanced technologies in predictive diagnostics, targeted preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM).
