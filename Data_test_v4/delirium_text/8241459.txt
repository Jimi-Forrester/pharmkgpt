8241459|t|Guanidinoethane sulfate: brain pH alkaline shifter.
8241459|a|A new category of agents, brain pH alkaline shifters, is described. Using the prototype agent, guanidinoethane sulfate (GES), the actual alkaline shift in pH was demonstrated in adult mice brain by 31-phosphorus (31P) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in vivo spectroscopy. This alkaline shift was also shown to effectively reduce the extent of brain intracellular lactic acidosis brought about by anoxic insult. These findings support the notion that a pH alkaline shift may protect the brain against the deleterious effects of lactic acidosis. Since higher pH has been shown to significantly reduce beta-amyloid deposition, alkaline shifters may also have therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease.
