38181270|a|The severity of severe pneumonia in children depends on the degree of local inflammation, spread of lung inflammation and systemic inflammatory response. Appropriate care can effectively reduce the mortality of children with severe pneumonia. This study was designed to explore the nursing effect of targeted sedation nursing and comprehensive nursing intervention in children with severe pneumonia. Eighty children with severe pneumonia who complained of the main complaint were selected, and they were evenly distributed to receive comprehensive care (control group) and targeted sedation care and comprehensive care (observation group). In each group, different degrees of sedation, pain scores, and changes in adverse reactions were evaluated. Before nursing, the sedation and pain scores of the 2 groups of children were not statistically significant; after nursing, the sedation and pain scores of the 2 groups of children improved with time, and the sedation effect of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control. In the group, the pain score was lower than that of the control group, indicating improvement. The SAS and SDS of the observation group were lower than those of the control group, while the social support score was significantly higher than that of the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P < .05). The accidental extubation, delirium, respiratory depression, and laryngospasm of the 2 groups of children were significantly improved, and the observation group was significantly less than the control group. This difference was statistically significant (P < .05). Targeted sedation nursing and comprehensive nursing intervention can effectively reduce the incidence of adverse reactions in children with severe pneumonia, reduce the pain and discomfort of children with severe pneumonia, and significantly improve the degree of sedation, which has certain reference value for the care of children with severe pneumonia.
