29374337|t|Lipidomics unveils the complexity of the lipidome in metabolic diseases.
29374337|a|Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is responsible for pathologies of human diseases including metabolic diseases. Recent advances in lipidomics analysis allow for the targeted and untargeted identification of lipid species and for their quantification in normal and diseased conditions. Herein, this review provides a brief introduction to lipidomics, highlights its application to characterize the lipidome at the cellular and physiological levels under different biological conditions, and discusses the potential for the use of lipidomics in the discovery of biomarkers.
