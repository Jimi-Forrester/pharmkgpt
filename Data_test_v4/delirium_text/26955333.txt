26955333|t|Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Presenting with Synchronous Bilateral Intracerebral Macrohemorrhages.
26955333|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the deposition of amyloid proteins in the cerebrovasculature, which can lead to intracerebral hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage in CAA often presents with microhemorrhages and, less frequently, with more devastating macrohemorrhages. We present a case of CAA-related synchronous bilateral intracerebral macrohemorrhage which, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in the literature, and postulate its relationship to antiplatelet therapy and transient elevations in blood pressure.
