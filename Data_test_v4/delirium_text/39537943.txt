39537943|a|PURPOSE: This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of clodronate, a vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) inhibitor, on intestinal-failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) in a rat model of short bowel syndrome (SBS). METHODS: The rats underwent jugular vein catheterization for continuous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and 90% small bowel resection. The animals were divided into the following groups: TPN/SBS (Control group), TPN/SBS/intravenous administration of low-dose clodronate (20 mg/kg twice per week; Low group), or TPN/SBS/intravenous administration of high-dose clodronate (60 mg/kg twice per week; High group). On day 7, the rats were euthanized. Hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular injury were also assessed. RESULTS: Hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation in the liver were observed in all groups. The High group showed histologically reduced hepatic steatosis compared with the Control group. IL-6 and Nlrp3 expression in the High group was significantly suppressed compared to that in the Control group. The expression of other inflammatory cytokines tended to be lower in the High dose group than in the control group. The lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver specimens showed no significant differences among the groups. CONCLUSION: The high-dose administration of clodronate may, therefore, inhibit hepatic steatosis and inflammation associated with IFALD in patients with SBS.
