28686968|a|The study aimed at the investigation of neuroprotective activity of macerated ethanolic extract of Indian propolis (MEEP) against beta-Amyloid 25-35 (Abeta25-35) induced memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. MEEP was administrated orally to Wistar rats at doses of 100, 200 and 300mg/kg. Behavioral performances were evaluated using morris water maze and radial arm maze. At the end of behavioral study, the brains were removed and antioxidant parameters and brain monoamines were estimated. Further acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibition and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) were evaluated. In addition hematological parameters and histopathological tests were also carried out. In behavioral models, MEEP significantly (P<0.05) reversed the cognitive impairment of beta amyloid-induced rats. The antioxidant potential was significantly increased (P<0.05) after administration of MEEP. Malondialdehyde levels were significantly (P<0.01) decreased in brain homogenate after treatment with MEEP extract as compared with diseased control group (group III). MEEP showed dose-dependent AChE inhibition and increased the levels of brain monoamines (P<0.05) as compared with group III. MEEP improved memory deficits by increasing BDNF in plasma (P<0.05). The study concludes that MEEP has anti-Alzheimer potential in rats through multiple mechanisms and further studies are ongoing for fractionation and biological screening.
