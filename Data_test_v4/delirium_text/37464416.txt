37464416|t|Aged mesenchymal stem cells and inflammation: from pathology to potential therapeutic strategies.
37464416|a|Natural ageing of organisms and corresponding age-related diseases result mainly from stem cell ageing and "inflammaging". Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit very high immune-regulating capacity and are promising candidates for immune-related disease treatment. However, the effect of MSC application is not satisfactory for some patients, especially in elderly individuals. With ageing, MSCs undergo many changes, including altered cell population reduction and differentiation ability, reduced migratory and homing capacity and, most important, defective immunosuppression. It is necessary to explore the relationship between the "inflammaging" and aged MSCs to prevent age-related diseases and increase the therapeutic effects of MSCs. In this review, we discuss changes in naturally ageing MSCs mainly from an inflammation perspective and propose some ideas for rejuvenating aged MSCs in future treatments.
