38972885|t|The features analysis of hemoglobin expression on visual information transmission pathway in early stage of Alzheimer's disease.
38972885|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by cognitive impairment. The motivation of this paper is to explore the impact of the visual information transmission pathway (V-H pathway) on AD, and the following feature were observed: Hemoglobin expression on the V-H pathway becomes dysregulated as AD occurs so as to the pathway becomes dysfunctional. According to the feature, the following conclusion was proposed: As AD occurs, abnormal tau proteins penetrate bloodstream and arrive at the brain regions of the pathway. Then the tau proteins or other toxic substances attack hemoglobin molecules. Under the attack, hemoglobin expression becomes more dysregulated. The dysfunction of V-H pathway has an impact on early symptoms of AD, such as spatial recognition disorder and face recognition disorder.
