37960251|a|5-Heptadecylresorcinol (AR-C17), a primary biomarker of whole grain (WG) consumption, has been demonstrated to improve the thermogenic activity of aging mice. However, the intricate regulatory mechanism is not fully understood. This study conducted metabolomics analysis on young and aging mice with or without AR-C17 administration after cold exposure. The results showed that the aging mice displayed lower levels of acylcarnitine (ACar) in their plasma compared with the young mice during cold exposure, and 150 mg/kg/day of AR-C17 administration for 8 weeks could increase the plasma ACar levels of aging mice. ACar has been reported to be an essential metabolic fuel for the thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT). AR-C17 had similar effects on the ACar levels in the BAT as on the plasma of the aging mice during cold exposure. Furthermore, the aging mice had reduced ACar metabolism in the BAT, and AR-C17 could improve the ACar metabolism in the BAT of aging mice, thereby promoting the metabolic utilization of ACar by BAT. Moreover, the glucose and lipid levels of aging mice could be improved by AR-C17. This study revealed a deeper metabolic mechanism involved in the AR-C17-mediated thermogenic regulation of BAT, providing a new theoretical basis for the nutrition and health benefits of WG.
