23042214|a|The frontal cortex is a brain structure that plays an important role in cognition and is known to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. Over the past years, transgenic mouse models have been generated to recapitulate the main features of this disease, including cognitive impairments. This study investigates frontal cortex dependent learning abilities in one of the most early-onset transgenic murine model of AD, the 5XFAD mice. We compared frontal performance of 2-, 4-, and 6-month-old 5XFAD mice with their wild-type littermates using a newly developed automated device, the olfactory H-maze, in which mice have to discover three different rules consecutively according to the delayed reaction paradigm. We report early cognitive deficits related to frontal cortex appearing in 4-month-old 5XFAD mice before hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment, in relation with neuropathologic processes such as strong gliosis and emerging amyloid plaques. The present results demonstrate that the olfactory H-maze is a very sensitive and simple experimental paradigm that allows assessment of frontal functions in transgenic mice and should be useful to test pre-clinical therapeutic approaches to alter the course of AD.
