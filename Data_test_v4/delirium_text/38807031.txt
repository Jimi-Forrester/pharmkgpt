38807031|a|To assess the correlation between preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and risk of postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus were systematically retrieved from inception until February 2023. Two authors independently conducted the selection of literature, data extraction and statistical analysis. In this meta-analysis, Review Manager 5.4 was used for statistical analysis, and the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of preoperative NLR between the POD group and non-POD group were calculated. We utilised the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to evaluate the quality of literature. Further, our meta-analysis used a random-effects model, and publication bias was evaluated by conducting a funnel plot. The correlation between preoperative NLR and POD was the primary outcome, and the secondary outcome was the association of other prognostic factors with the risk of POD. This meta-analysis included seven studies with 2424 patients, of whom 403 were diagnosed with POD with an incidence of 16.63%. Results indicated a positive correlation between preoperative NLR and the risk of POD (MD = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.64-1.49; P < 0.001). Further, our results found that neutrophil counts, advanced age, longer surgery time, diabetes, and elevated C-reactive protein were significantly associated with POD (MD = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.40-1.56; P = 0.001; MD = 4.20, 95% CI: 2.90-5.51; P < 0.001; MD = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.05-0.25; P < 0.01; OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.08-1.86; P = 0.01; MD = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.36-2.16; P < 0.01). Other factors including lymphocyte counts, hypertension and male gender were not significantly associated with POD (MD = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.27 to 0.05; P > 0.05; OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.91-1.58, P > 0.05; OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.00-1.63; P = 0.05). Our meta-analysis indicated a positive correlation between preoperative NLR and the risk of POD in older noncardiac surgery patients.
