25097386|t|ProADD: A database on Protein Aggregation Diseases.
25097386|a|UNLABELLED: ProADD, a database for protein aggregation diseases, is developed to organize the data under a single platform to facilitate easy access for researchers. Diseases caused due to protein aggregation and the proteins involved in each of these diseases are integrated. The database helps in classification of proteins involved in the protein aggregation diseases based on sequence and structural analysis. Analysis of proteins can be done to mine patterns prevailing among the aggregating proteins. AVAILABILITY: http://bicmku.in/ProADD.
