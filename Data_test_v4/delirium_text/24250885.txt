24250885|t|Cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease: Evidence from an Iranian population.
24250885|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have different cognitive impairments. The goal of this study is the analysis of these changes in the mentioned patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 87 patients with PD. Patients were given a questionnaire to gather data about their medical and living statuses. To assess cognitive assessment, SCOPA-COG (Scales for Outcome in Parkinson Cognition) was used by an expert cognitive neuroscientist. RESULTS: The age inversely correlated to memory and learning (P < 0.01). Education level correlated directly to attention, memory, learning, executive function and visuospatial function (for all items P < 0.001). Spouse relationship type showed inverse association with memory, learning, executive function and visuospatial function (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cognitive domains in PD patients may be under the influence of different factors. Due to the lack of control group in this study, cautious interpretation of findings is needed.
