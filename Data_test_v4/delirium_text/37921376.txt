37921376|a|OBJECTIVE: Acute confusional syndrome (ACS) is one of the complications with the highest morbidity and mortality in hospitalization units, but it is a reversible situation if detected early, representing a clear challenge for nursing. The objectives of this study were to assess the interventions carried out by nurses for the identification and non-pharmacological preventive measures applied in acute confusional syndrome and relate them to the years of professional experience and training received. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, prospective and analytical study was carried out through a self-administered structured questionnaire pre-post intervention (extracted from the JBI PACES program-Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System) on the identification and preventive measures applied in ACS. A total of 520 questionnaires (pre and post assessment) were distributed to nurses from the emergency department and the internal medicine unit of the Miguel Servet University Hospital in Zaragoza (Aragon, Spain) from January 2021 to April 2022. Statistical analysis carried out with the program Jamovi 2.3.13. RESULTS: 180 correctly completed questionnaires (94 pre and 86 post) were received. For 100%, the ACS supposed an extra workload and significant differences were found between the ability to manage ACS with the years of professional experience (p<=0.028). 97.2% of the nurses applied non-pharmacological interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being perceived as an extra burden in daily work, nurses perform non-pharmacological prevention for the management of ACS. It is necessary to improve training to provide guidance strategies.
