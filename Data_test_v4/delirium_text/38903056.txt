38903056|a|Introduction: Minimizing postprandial glucose response is an important goal for overall diabetes management. Diabetes-specific nutritional shakes (DSNS) have been clinically shown to minimize postprandial glucose response in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared to high-glycemic foods. However, it is unknown how a high-protein, low-fat DSNS impacts the GLP-1 response. Methods: We tested the postprandial glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 response to a high-protein, low-fat diabetes-specific nutritional shake (DSNS-HP) compared to isocaloric instant oatmeal (IOM) in a randomized, controlled, crossover study in adults with T2DM (n = 24). Participants were randomly selected to receive IOM or DSNS-HP on two test days. Glucose, insulin, and total GLP-1 concentration were measured at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min postprandially. Results: Compared to IOM, the glucose-positive area under the curve (pAUC) was significantly lower (P = .021). DSNS-HP significantly increased GLP-1 pAUC response by 213% (P <.001) with a corresponding increase in insulin pAUC (P = .033) compared to IOM. Discussion: A high-protein, low-fat DSNS leads to favorable changes in GLP-1 response and is a suitable option to minimize blood glucose response in people with type 2 diabetes.
