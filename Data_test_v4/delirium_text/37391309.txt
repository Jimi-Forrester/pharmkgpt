37391309|t|The spectrum of hospitalization-associated harm in the elderly.
37391309|a|Acutely ill patients are not infrequently referred to the hospital and admitted, when they could be diagnosed and managed in the ambulatory setting or by hospital-level care at home. Avoidable admissions are particularly regrettable when the wide spectrum of hospitalization-associated patient harm is considered. It includes acute discomfort to the patient due to multiple disturbing hospital stressors; an emotional trauma; the burden of multiple redundant tests begetting false-positive and incidental findings triggering further testing and cascades; highly prevalent adverse events and serious harm associated with medical care, such as nosocomial infections, delirium, falls, and adverse drug events; and a complex array of post-discharge complications including significant physical and functional decline; cognitive decline; flawed transitions of care; common post-discharge adverse events; and a substantial risk of readmission, restarting the vicious cycle and compromising patient well-being, safety, and outcomes. Elderly patients are especially vulnerable, but in-hospital patient harm is not limited to older adults and is associated with increased length of stay, escalating costs, and mortality. The myriad types of harm that often accompany hospital admission is often not fully appreciated. Better awareness may result in better preventive strategies, in finding alternatives to hospital admission in some cases, and may contribute towards an improved patient experience and safety when hospitalization is mandatory, and the provision of enhanced care in the vulnerable post-discharge period.
