11629|t|[Gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase in alcoholic liver diseases].
11629|a|In well defined liver diseases in 69 alcoholics and in 71 patients without history of alcoholism the enzymatic findings were compared. Also a group of 43 alcoholics with praedelirium or delirium tremens were examined. In steatosis due to alcohol, the average of GGTP (145 U/l) attains values two times higher than in comparable cases of non-alcoholic origin (73 U/l). In cirrhotics with alcoholism, the average GGTP levels (477 U/l) exceed those obtained in patients with cirrhosis of other origin (110 U/l), four times more. Similar or higher GGTP values were found only in primary biliary cirrhosis. After a period of at least 3 months of abstinence, GGTP values had decreased (to 68 U/l) in the average). The highest values of GGTP were found in acute alcoholic hepatitis and in chronic alcoholics with praedelirium or delirium tremens. GGTP accords diagnostic hints in comparison with other enzymes, as shown by a quotient of GGTP-GPT. GGTP is very helpful for differentiation and long time observation of alcoholic liver disease, especially with regards controlling abstinence of alcohol.
