32316637|t|Heterogeneous Disease Progression in a Mouse Model of Vascular Cognitive Impairment.
32316637|a|Recently, an asymmetric vascular compromise approach that replicates many aspects of human vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has been reported. The present study aimed to first investigate on the reproducibility in the disease progression of this newly reported VCI model using wild-type C57BL6/J mice. The second aim was to assess how this approach will affect the disease progression of transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) 5XFAD mice subjected to VCI. C57BL6/J and 5XFAD mice were subjected to VCI by placing an ameroid constrictor on the right CCA and a microcoil on the left CCA. Infarcts and hippocampal neuronal loss did not appear predominantly in the right (ameroid side) as expected but randomly in both hemispheres. The mortality rate of C57BL6/J mice was unexpectedly high. Inducing VCI reduced amyloid burden in the hippocampi of 5XFAD mice. Since VCI is known to be complex and complicated, the heterogeneous disease progression observed from this current study shares close resemblance to the clinical manifestation of VCI. This heterogeneity, however, makes it challenging to test novel treatment options using this model. Further study is warranted to tackle the heterogeneous nature of VCI.
