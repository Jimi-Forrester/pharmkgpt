38203605|t|Somatostatin and Somatostatin Receptors in Tumour Biology.
38203605|a|Somatostatin (SST), a growth hormone inhibitory peptide, is expressed in endocrine and non-endocrine tissues, immune cells and the central nervous system (CNS). Post-release from secretory or immune cells, the first most appreciated role that SST exhibits is the antiproliferative effect in target tissue that served as a potential therapeutic intervention in various tumours of different origins. The SST-mediated in vivo and/or in vitro antiproliferative effect in the tumour is considered direct via activation of five different somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5), which are well expressed in most tumours and often more than one receptor in a single cell. Second, the indirect effect is associated with the regulation of growth factors. SSTR subtypes are crucial in tumour diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, with the recent development of new SST analogues and receptor-specific agonists with emerging functional consequences of signaling pathways are promising therapeutic avenues in tumours of different origins that are discussed.
