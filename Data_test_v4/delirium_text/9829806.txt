9829806|t|NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in fibrillary components of neuronal and oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions in the pontine nuclei in multiple system atrophy.
9829806|a|We examined neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) and oligodendrocytic glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in the pontine nuclei in multiple system atrophy (MSA) using antibodies against the non-amyloid beta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (NACP/alpha-synuclein). Our immunohistochemical study revealed that anti-NACP antibodies labeled both NCIs and GCIs. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that positive reaction products were localized on the 15- to 30-nm-thick filamentous components of NCIs and GCIs. The present study demonstrates that NACP is associated with cytoplasmic inclusions of MSA, and suggests a role of NACP in abnormal filament aggregation in neuronal degeneration.
