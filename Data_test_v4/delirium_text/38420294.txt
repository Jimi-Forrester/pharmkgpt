38420294|t|A National Database Retrospective Review of Short-Term Postoperative Mortality in the Geriatric Population: A Comparison Between Emergency Spine Fractures and Hip Fractures.
38420294|a|BACKGROUND: Mortality rates following emergency spine fracture surgery are high, especially in the elderly. However, how the postoperative mortality rate following spine fractures compares to other geriatric fractures such as hip fractures remains unclear. Therefore, this retrospective cohort study aimed to compare 30-day mortality rates and risk factors between emergency spine fracture versus hip fracture surgery in the elderly. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried between 2011 and 2021 for emergency spine fractures and hip fractures in the elderly. Univariate analyses evaluated demographic data, perioperative factors, comorbidities, and 30-day mortality rates as the primary outcomes. A multivariable regression model was then constructed to control for significant baseline and demographic differences and evaluate independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 18,287 emergency hip fractures and 192 emergency spine fractures were included in our study. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in female sex, body mass index (BMI), operation time, length of hospital stays, disseminated cancer, and functional dependence between spine and hip fractures. Thirty-day mortality rates were significantly higher in spine versus hip fractures (9.4% vs. 5%). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated emergent spine fracture surgery, disseminated cancer, functional dependence, and length of stay as independent predictors of mortality in our cohort. Female sex, BMI, and operation time were protective factors for mortality in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency spine fractures in the elderly represent an independent predictor for 30-day postoperative mortality compared to emergency hip fractures. Disseminated cancer, functional dependence, and length of stay were independent predictors of mortality while female sex, BMI, and operation time were protective factors. These data demonstrate the severity of injury and high rates of mortality that clinicians can use to counsel patients and their families.
