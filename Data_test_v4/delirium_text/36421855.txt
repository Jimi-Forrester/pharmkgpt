36421855|t|Neurological Manifestations of SARS-CoV2 Infection: A Narrative Review.
36421855|a|The COVID-19 virus frequently causes neurological complications. These have been described in various forms in adults and children. Headache, seizures, coma, and encephalitis are some of the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological impairment. Recent publications have revealed important aspects of viral pathophysiology and its involvement in nervous-system impairment in humans. We evaluated the latest literature describing the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the central nervous system. We searched three databases for observational and interventional studies in adults published between December 2019 and September 2022. We discussed in narrative form the neurological impairment associated with COVID-19, including clinical signs and symptoms, imaging abnormalities, and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2-induced neurological damage.
