32075845|t|Efficacy and safety of a supplement combination for hand osteoarthritis pain: protocol for an internet-based randomised placebo-controlled trial (The RADIANT study).
32075845|a|INTRODUCTION: Hand osteoarthritis (HOA) is a highly prevalent disabling joint disease. The current management regimens are limited. Potentially as a consequence, many people turn to complementary and alternative medicines for symptomatic relief. A combination of two or more supplements is common in clinical practice; however, evidence for the efficacy of this approach is lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a supplement combination for treating symptomatic HOA in comparison to placebo. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The RADIANT study is an internet-based, parallel, superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, two-arm clinical trial. A participatory design is used to facilitate the study procedures. One hundred and six participants aged over 40 years with painful HOA and structural change on X-ray (Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KLG) >=2) will be recruited from the community and randomly allocated to receive either a supplement combination composed of: (1) combined supplement containing Boswellia serrata extract, pine bark extract and methylsulfonylmethane and (2) curcumin or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome will be 12-week change in hand pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Main secondary outcomes include adverse events, change in hand function, patient global assessment of disease activity and quality of life. A range of additional measures will be recorded, and an individual patient placebo response will be performed. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. Adverse events will be monitored weekly throughout the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC No. 2018/766). Dissemination will occur through conferences, social media, scientific publications and PhD thesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000835145); Pre-results.
