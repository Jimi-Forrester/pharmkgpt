Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is distinct from non-postpartum psychosis in many ways, and it is crucial to study and understand PPP to identify, treat, and possibly prevent this condition. We therefore sought to review the latest research findings about PPP with the intention of updating readers about the latest evidence base. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple physiologic pathways have been implicated in the development of PPP, and further understanding these pathways may allow for early detection and treatment. Risk assessment and treatment should include consideration of the woman patient but also the mother-infant dyad and the larger family. It is our hope that this review of research updates in postpartum psychosis may inform clinical practice and promote specialized, evidence-based diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment.
