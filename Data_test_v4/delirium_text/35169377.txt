35169377|a|BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused a pandemic that threatened all aspects of life and health while worsening the socio-economic situation of the entire population. COVID-19 affects all organs and organ systems. The symptoms of the affected organs can last for a long time after the acute infection. About 1/3 of patients develop neuropsychiatric signs in the clinical course of the disease. The most common symptoms are mental fog, headache, cognitive changes, behavior changes, muscle weakness, anosmia and ageusia. These symptoms may develop due to a direct effect of the virus on the neurons or hyper reactive immune response. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe 2 young adults who developed neuropsychiatric symptoms in the course of Long COVID-19 syndrome. Ischemic vasculitis was proved using CT imaging. CASE REPORT: We collected data of two younger females who had previously recovered from the acute form of COVID-19 without respiratory complications. They developed in the next 1-2 months a clinical picture of a brain disorder. In both cases, CT and angiography scans of the brain showed signs of ischemic vasculitis. Neurological therapy has led to an improvement of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: Neuropsychiatric disorders in Long Covid syndrome are common and diverse. Two cases of young adults who developed signs of neurological disorder in the post COVID-19 period were presented, and CT scans of the brain showed signs of ischemic vasculitis.
