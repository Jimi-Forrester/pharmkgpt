21356140|t|Elevation of BACE in an Abeta rat model of Alzheimer's disease: exacerbation by chronic stress and prevention by nicotine.
21356140|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides impairs nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function by a mechanism that may involve alpha7 and alpha4beta2-nAChR subtypes. Additionally, the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE), the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathogenic Abeta production pathway, is expressed at high levels in hippocampal and cortical regions of AD brains. We measured hippocampal area CA1 protein levels of BACE and alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChR subunits using an Abeta rat model of AD (14-d osmotic pump i.c.v. infusion of 300 pmol/d Abeta peptides) in the presence and absence of chronic stress and/or chronic nicotine treatment. There was a significant increase in the levels of BACE in Abeta-infused rats, which were markedly intensified by chronic (4-6 wk) stress, but were normalized in Abeta rats chronically treated with nicotine (1 mg/kg b.i.d.). The levels of the three subunits alpha7, alpha4 and beta2 were significantly decreased in Abeta rats, but these were also normalized in Abeta rats chronically treated with nicotine. Chronic stress did not further aggravate the reduction of nAChRs in Abeta-infused rats. The increased BACE levels and decreased nAChR levels, which are established hallmarks of AD, provide additional support for the validity of the Abeta i.c.v.-infused rat as a model of AD.
