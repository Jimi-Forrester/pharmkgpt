37760584|a|The link between Alzheimer's disease and cancer risk is a concern in public health. However, research has yielded limited and sometimes contrasting results, suggesting the need for more validation. We analyzed a large cohort to examine the long-term association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the risk of developing cancer. In total, 24,664 AD patients and 98,656 control participants were selected from the National Health Insurance Cohort database of Korea, spanning from 2002 to 2019. Propensity score matching and overlap-weighted adjustment techniques were used to balance the standardized differences between the AD and control groups. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for various cancers, considering relevant covariates. Results indicated that patients with AD had a significantly lower likelihood of overall malignancy (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59-0.68) and each of the 10 site-specific cancers compared to the control group. Among these, pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.50) exhibited the strongest inverse association, followed by hepatic (HR, 0.60), gastric (HR, 0.63), kidney (HR, 0.63), lung (HR, 0.64), thyroid (HR, 0.65), colorectal (HR, 0.67), gallbladder and biliary duct (HR, 0.73), hematologic malignancy (HR, 0.73), and bladder cancers (HR, 0.76). This protective effect against certain organ-specific cancers persisted over the 16-year follow-up period, except for in kidney cancer and hematologic malignancies. The protective effect against specific cancer types (gastric, colorectal, lung, hepatic, and pancreatic) was more prominent in individuals aged 60 years and older, regardless of their sex. However, there were some variations in the specific types of cancer observed between males and females. In summary, Korean patients with AD had a lower risk of cancer, especially in individuals 60 years and older, during the 16-year follow-up period.
