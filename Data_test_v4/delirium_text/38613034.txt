38613034|a|Many studies suggest a significant association between individual essential trace elements (ETEs) and cognitive impairment in older adults, but evidence of the synchronized effect of multiple ETEs on cognitive function is lacking. We investigated the association between multiple ETEs, cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND), and executive function in older Korean adults, using the Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model. Three hundred and thirty-six older adults were included as the study population and classified as the CIND and control groups. Blood manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), and molybdenum (Mo) were measured as relevant ETEs. The frontal/executive tests included digit symbol coding (DSC), the Korean color word Stroop test (K-CWST), a controlled oral word association test (COWAT), and a trial-making test (TMT). Overall, the BKMR showed a negative association between multiple ETEs and the odds of CIND. Mn was designated as the most dominant element associated with the CIND (PIP = 0.6184), with a U-shaped relationship. Cu and Se levels were positively associated with the K-CWST percentiles (beta = 31.78; 95% CI: 13.51, 50.06) and DSC percentiles (beta = 25.10; 95% CI: 7.66, 42.53), respectively. Our results suggest that exposure to multiple ETEs may be linked to a protective mechanism against cognitive impairment in older adults.
