37737223|a|Nanomotor chassis constructed from biological precursors and powered by biocatalytic transformations can offer important applications in the future, specifically in emergent biomedical techniques. Herein, cross beta amyloid peptide-based nanomotors (amylobots) were prepared from short amyloid peptides. Owing to their remarkable binding capabilities, these soft constructs are able to host dedicated enzymes to catalyze orthogonal substrates for motility and navigation. Urease helps in powering the self-diffusiophoretic motion, while cytochrome C helps in providing navigation control. Supported by the simulation model, the design principle demonstrates the utilization of two distinct transport behaviours for two different types of enzymes, firstly enhanced diffusivity of urease with increasing fuel (urea) concentration and secondly, chemotactic motility of cytochrome C towards its substrate (pyrogallol). Dual catalytic engines allow the amylobots to be utilized for enhanced catalysis in organic solvent and can thus complement the technological applications of enzymes.
