23140885|t|Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of tri-substituted thiazoles as RAGE antagonists for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
23140885|a|A series of thiazole derivatives were designed, and prepared to develop RAGE antagonist for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SAR studies were performed to optimize inhibitory activity on Abeta-RAGE binding. SAR studies showed that introducing an amino group at part A was essential for inhibitory activity on Abeta-RAGE binding. Compounds selected from Abeta-RAGE binding screening displayed inhibitory activity on Abeta transport across BBB. They also showed inhibitory activity against Abeta-induced NF-kappaB activation. These results indicated that our derivatives had a potential as therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.
