33276089|a|As cognitive impairments continue to rise in prevalence, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of learning and memory in normal and disordered states. C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been implicated in the regulation of multiple forms of learning and memory via its regulation on learning-related cell signaling and neuronal plasticity. As a chemokine receptor and a co-receptor for HIV, CCR5's role in immune response and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has been widely studied. In contrast, CCR5 is less understood in cognitive deficits associated with other disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke and certain psychiatric disorders. A broad overview of the present literature shows that CCR5 acts as a potent suppressor of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, although a few studies have reported the opposite effect of CCR5 in stroke or AD animal models. By summarizing the current literature of CCR5 in animal and human studies of cognition, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of CCR5 in learning and memory in both normal and disordered states and to discuss the possibility of CCR5 suppression as an effective therapeutic to alleviate cognitive deficits in HAND, AD, and stroke.
