10343807|a|Static and dynamic contrast sensitivity (SCS and DCS), semantic object identification, and verbal recall functions were evaluated in 20 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and in 20 control subjects. We found general SCS and DCS loss in the 0.48-14.34 c deg-1 spatial frequency range. In relation to the cognitive functions, semantic object identification was intact, whereas explicit memory was markedly impaired in the AD group. There was no significant correlation between the CS and the memory disturbances. The results suggest that early visual impairment and higher-level cognitive disturbances are independent in AD.
