31023987|t|Improving Care Transitions for Hospitalized Veterans Discharged to Skilled Nursing Facilities: A Focus on Polypharmacy and Geriatric Syndromes.
31023987|a|Geriatric syndromes and polypharmacy are common in older patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and increase 30-day readmission risk. In a U.S.A. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-funded Quality Improvement study to improve care transitions from the VA hospital to area SNFs, Veterans (N = 134) were assessed for geriatric syndromes using standardized instruments as well as polypharmacy, defined as five or more medications. Warm handoffs were used to facilitate the transfer of this information. This paper describes the prevalence of geriatric syndromes, polypharmacy, and readmission rates. Veterans were prescribed an average of 14.7 medications at hospital discharge. Moreover, 75% of Veterans had more than two geriatric syndromes, some of which began during hospitalization. While this effort did not reduce 30-day readmissions, the high prevalence of geriatric syndromes and polypharmacy suggests that future efforts targeting these issues may be necessary to reduce readmissions among Veterans discharged to SNF.
