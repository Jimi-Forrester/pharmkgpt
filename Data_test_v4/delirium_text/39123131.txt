39123131|a|AIM: To investigate the impact of preoperative cardiovascular disease on the perioperative period of rectal cancer patients over 75 years old. METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 625 elderly patients aged >= 75 years who underwent radical rectal cancer surgery in the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and affiliated Heji Hospital of Changzhi Medical College from January 2011 to December 2022 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. According to preoperative comorbidities, all patients were divided into cardiovascular disease group (n = 361) and non-cardiovascular disease group (n = 264). One hundred and ninety-two pairs were selected from each group through Propensity score-matched to further analysis. Perioperative indexes and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in clinicopathological data between the two groups (P > 0.05). The proportion of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease who went to ICU after radical surgery was significantly higher than those without cardiovascular disease (19.3% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.015). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the time to first flatus (3.0 vs. 3.5 days, P = 0.332) and postoperative hospital stay (11.3 vs. 10.5 days, P = 0.297). One patient in the cardiovascular disease group died due to pulmonary embolism. A total of 100 patients (26.0%) developed postoperative complications, and the incidence of overall complications (30.7% vs. 21.4%, P = 0.036) and grade 3-5 complications (12.5% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.036) in the cardiovascular disease group was significantly higher than that in the non-cardiovascular disease group. In terms of gastrointestinal disorders, the incidence of anastomotic leakage (6.8% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.026) in elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases was significantly higher than that in patients without cardiovascular disease. In addition, the incidence of cardiac disorders (8.3% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.014) in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Elderly rectal cancer patients over 75 years old with cardiovascular disease are more likely to develop severe complications after radical surgery, especially anastomotic leakage and cardiac disorders.
