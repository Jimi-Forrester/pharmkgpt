39266924|t|The Use of Neurotrophic Factors as a Promising Strategy for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases (Review).
39266924|a|The review considers the use of exogenous neurotrophic factors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and others. This group of diseases is associated with the death of neurons and dysfunction of the nervous tissue. Currently, there is no effective therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, and their treatment remains a serious problem of modern medicine. A promising strategy is the use of exogenous neurotrophic factors. Targeted delivery of these factors to the nervous tissue can improve survival of neurons during the development of neurodegenerative processes and ensure neuroplasticity. There are methods of direct injection of neurotrophic factors into the nervous tissue, delivery using viral vectors, as well as the use of gene cell products. The effectiveness of these approaches has been studied in numerous experimental works and in a number of clinical trials. Further research in this area could provide the basis for the creation of an alternative treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.
