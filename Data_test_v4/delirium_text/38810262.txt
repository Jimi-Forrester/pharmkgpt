38810262|a|ABSTRACT: The optimal means of assessing candidacy of older adults (>=65 years) for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy are unknown. We explored the role of a geriatric assessment (GA)-guided multidisciplinary clinic (GA-MDC) in selecting and optimizing older adults for CAR-T. Sixty-one patients were evaluated in a GA-MDC (median age, 73 years; range, 58-83). A nonbinding recommendation ("proceed" or "decline") regarding suitability for CAR-T was provided for each patient based on GA results. Fifty-three patients ultimately received CAR-T (proceed, n = 47; decline, n = 6). Among patients who received B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed (n = 11) and CD19-directed CAR-T (n = 42), the median overall survival (OS) was 14.2 months and 16.6 months, respectively. GA uncovered high rates of geriatric impairment among patients proceeding to CAR-T therapy, with fewer impairments in those recommended "proceed." Patients recommended "proceed" had shorter median length of stay (17 vs 31 days; P = .05) and lower rates of intensive care unit admission (6% vs 50%; P = .01) than those recommended "decline." In patients receiving CD19- and BCMA-directed CAR-T therapy, a "proceed" recommendation was associated with superior OS compared with "decline" (median, 16.6 vs 11.4 months [P = .02]; and median, 16.4 vs 4.2 months [P = .03], respectively). When controlling for Karnofsky performance status, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase at time of lymphodepletion, the GA-MDC treatment recommendation remained prognostic for OS (hazard ratio, 3.26; P = .04). Patients optimized via the GA-MDC without serious vulnerabilities achieved promising outcomes, whereas patients with high vulnerability experienced high toxicity and poor outcomes after CAR-T therapy.
