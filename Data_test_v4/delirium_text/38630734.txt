38630734|a|Although histone proteins are widely known for their intranuclear functions where they organize DNA, all five histone types can also be released into the extracellular space from damaged cells. Extracellular histones can interact with pattern recognition receptors of peripheral immune cells, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), causing pro-inflammatory activation, which indicates they may act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in peripheral tissues. Very limited information is available about functions of extracellular histones in the central nervous system (CNS). To address this knowledge gap, we applied mixed histones (MH) to cultured cells modeling neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Microglia are the professional CNS immunocytes, while astrocytes are the main support cells for neurons. Both these cell types are critical for neuroimmune responses and their dysregulated activity contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. We measured effects of extracellular MH on cell viability and select neuroimmune functions of microglia and astrocytes. MH were toxic to cultured primary murine neurons and also reduced viability of NSC-34 murine and SH-SY5Y human neuron-like cells in TLR4-dependent manner. MH did not affect the viability of resting or immune-stimulated BV-2 murine microglia or U118 MG human astrocytic cells. When applied to BV-2 cells, MH enhanced secretion of the potential neurotoxin glutamate, but did not modulate the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), or the overall cytotoxicity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and/or interferon (IFN)-gamma-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells towards NSC-34 neuron-like cells. We demonstrated, for the first time, that MH downregulated phagocytic activity of LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. However, MH also exhibited protective effect by ameliorating the cytotoxicity of LPS-stimulated U118 MG astrocytic cells towards SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells. Our data demonstrate extracellular MH could both damage neurons and alter neuroimmune functions of glial cells. These actions of MH could be targeted for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
