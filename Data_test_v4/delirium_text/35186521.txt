35186521|t|Cardiovascular Involvement in Thyrotoxicosis Resulting in Heart Failure: The Risk Factors and Hemodynamic Implications.
35186521|a|Thyrotoxicosis is a clinical syndrome with persistently elevated concentrations of free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, or both, which correlates with an increased thyroid metabolic function. This article has discussed the direct effect of increased thyroid hormone on the heart, as the thyroid hormone physiologically exhibits a close harmony with hormones of the cardiovascular system. This action can lead to disturbances in hemodynamic stability, exacerbating the possibility of developing complications such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. This article has also explored the multifaceted pathogenesis of thyrotoxicosis and various pharmacological treatment options, including beta-blockers and anti-thyroid drugs. This article has reviewed numerous studies that have concluded that the main goal of therapy should always aim to normalize thyroid hormone levels based on the etiology of the thyrotoxicosis, although cardiovascular conditions are associated with a higher rate of mortality.
