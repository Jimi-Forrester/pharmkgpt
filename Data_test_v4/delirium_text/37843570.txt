37843570|a|PURPOSE: Clinician-patient language concordance improves patient outcomes in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings. We sought to assess the association of ICU nurse-patient language concordance with delirium-related outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult English- or Spanish-speaking mechanically ventilated ICU patients admitted to ICUs at the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics (January 2021-September 2022). Our primary exposure was nurse-patient language concordance on each shift. We used mixed-effects multivariable regression to evaluate the association of language concordance with the primary outcome of restraint use, and secondary outcomes of agitation and identification of delirium, during each shift (with patient as a random effect). RESULTS: Our cohort included 4326 shifts (3380 [78.1%] with language concordance) from 548 patients and 157 nurses. Spanish language was preferred by 269 (49.1%) of patients. English-speaking patients tended to be younger (65 [53, 75] vs 73 [61, 83], p < 0.001) and of non-Hispanic ethnicity (55.5% vs 7.1%, p < 0.001). English-speakers had restraints ordered on fewer of their included shifts (0 [0, 3] vs 1 [0, 3], p = 0.005). After adjustment, the odds of restraint use on shifts with language concordance was significantly lower (odds ratio [OR, 95% confidence interval [CI]]: 0.50 [0.39-0.63], p < 0.001). Agitation (18.6% vs 25.2%; OR [95% CI]: 0.71 [0.55-0.92], p = 0.009) and delirium identification (34.5% vs 41.3%; OR [95% CI]: 0.54 [0.34-0.88], p = 0.014) were also less common. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a twofold reduction in the odds of restraint use among mechanically ventilated patients for language concordant nurse-patient dyads. Ensuring nurse-patient language concordance may improve ICU delirium, agitation, and restraint use.
