8301879|t|Concentration of neural thread protein in cerebrospinal fluid from progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease.
8301879|a|We measured the concentration of neural thread protein (NTP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by an automatized microparticle enzyme immunoassay from 11 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients and 11 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 7 patients with cervical spondylosis as controls. The mean levels did not differ significantly among the groups. In the PSP group, however, the levels correlated significantly with the severity of motor symptoms, signs and functional disability but not with dementia, while the opposite was true in the PD group. The elevated levels in PSP cases may reflect an increase with progression of the disease in such pathological structures as neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads, while in PD such levels may indicate associated Alzheimer-type pathology.
