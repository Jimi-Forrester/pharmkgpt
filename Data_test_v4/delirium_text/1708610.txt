1708610|t|[Cytoskeleton--function and pathology: studies on the pathology of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton of liver cells].
1708610|a|Microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments (IF) are major filamentous components of the cytoskeleton and play a role in the modulation of cell shape, in cellular movements, cellular stability, intracellular organisation as well as cell-to-cell and cell-to-stroma interactions. Particular interest was concentrated in the last few years on IF because of their cell type-specificity and, consequently, their suitability as cell markers in diagnostic pathology. Despite their apparent stability, IF are dynamic structures which may be modified under pathologic conditions. In recent years, pathologic alterations related to the IF cytoskeleton have been described in a diversity of chronic and degenerative disorders, including alcoholic hepatitis and neurologic diseases (e.g. M. Alzheimer, M. Parkinson). Our studies were particularly devoted to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of severe alcoholic liver injury (alcoholic hepatitis), which is associated with inflammation, liver cell degeneration and necrosis and morphologically characterized by the appearance of cytoplasmic hyaline inclusions (i.e., Mallory bodies). In the present review morphologic, immunologic and biochemical studies on nature and pathogenesis of Mallory bodies are summarized. Moreover, similarities between Mallory bodies and other cytoskeleton-related inclusion bodies suggest common routes of pathogenesis. Consequently, studies along these lines may not only lead to the understanding of mechanisms involved in alcoholic injury but may also provide information on general principles of cell damage as well as on regulation and function of the IF cytoskeleton.
