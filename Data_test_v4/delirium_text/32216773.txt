32216773|t|Detection and recognition thresholds for five basic tastes in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia.
32216773|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) are thought to exhibit taste disorders; however, this has not been extensively studied. We investigated gustatory functions and factors affecting taste in patients with ADD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in non-demented controls (NDCs) and evaluated associations between cognitive impairment and gustatory functions. METHODS: We recruited 29 patients with ADD, 43 with MCI, and 14 with NDCs. We obtained medical and medication history, measured salivary secretion volumes, and performed cognitive function tests, blood tests, whole-mouth gustatory tests, and dietary and gustatory questionnaires. RESULTS: Patients with ADD showed significantly higher recognition threshold values than NDCs (p < 0.05). Many individuals did not recognize umami at the maximum concentration, and this happened more frequently in patients with ADD or MCI than in NDCs. Evaluation items other than cognitive function tests did not show significant differences among the groups, but many individuals had decreased salivation, low serum zinc levels, and were on multiple medications. We found a significant correlation between recognition threshold and age (r = 0.229, p < 0.05) and cognitive function test score (r = 0.268, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ADD showed impairment of gustatory function. Gustatory impairment in patients with MCI could not be confirmed. However, many individuals with MCI did not recognize umami, either. Our results suggest that taste disorders in elderly people with cognitive decline occur independently of factors affecting taste such as salivation, zinc levels, or prescription drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry on February 10, 2017, with reference number UMIN000026087.
