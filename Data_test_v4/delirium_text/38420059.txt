38420059|a|Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by diverse manifestations, notably in dermatological and neurological domains. This review aims to synthesize the current understanding of these manifestations and their impact on long-term prognosis. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases, focusing on studies exploring SLE's dermatological and neurological aspects. Selected studies were analyzed to understand their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and impact on prognosis. Six pivotal studies were reviewed, highlighting the severity of neuropsychiatric SLE, the progression of skin diseases, and their systemic implications. Notably, studies underscored the role of high disease activity and specific antibodies in the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms and the progression of cutaneous manifestations. The review emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach to managing SLE, considering the interplay between its dermatological and neurological manifestations. It suggests that tailored treatment strategies, early detection, and comprehensive care are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This synthesis provides a foundation for future research to develop integrated care protocols and advance patient care in SLE.
