31378845|t|Episodes of psychomotor agitation among medical patients: findings from a longitudinal multicentre study.
31378845|a|BACKGROUND: The management of delirium among older in-hospital patients is a challenge, leading to worse outcomes, including death. Specifically, psychomotor agitation, one of the main characteristics of hyperactive delirium, requires a significant amount of medical and nursing surveillance. However, despite its relevance, to date incidence and/or prevalence of psychomotor agitation, its predictors and outcomes have not been studied among Italian older patients admitted in medical units. AIMS: To describe the incidence and the prevalence of psychomotor agitation among patients aged > 65 years admitted to medical units and identify predictors at the individual, nursing care and hospital levels. METHODS: A longitudinal multicentre study was conducted involving 12 medical units in 12 northern Italian hospitals. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among the 1464 patients included in the study, two hundred (13.6%) have manifested episode(s), with an average of 3.46/patient (95% confidence of interval [CI] 2.73-4.18). In 108 (54.0%) patients, episode(s) were present also in the week prior to hospitalisation: therefore, in-hospital-acquired psychomotor agitation was reported in 92 patients (46%). The multivariate logistic regression analysis explained the 25.4% of the variance and identified the following variables as psychomotor agitation predictors: the risk of falls (relative risk [RR] 1.314, 95% CI 1.218-1.417), the amount of missed nursing care (RR 1.078, 95% CI 1.037-1.12) and the patient's age (RR 1.018, 95% CI 1.002-1.034). Factors preventing the occurrence of episode(s) were: the amount of care received from graduated nurses (RR 0.978; 95% CI 0.965-0.992) and the lower functional dependence at admission (RR 0.987, 95% CI 0.977-0.997). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of elderly patients admitted in medical units develop psychomotor agitation; its predictors need to be identified early to inform decisions regarding the personal care needed to prevent its occurrence, especially by acting on modifiable factors, such as the risk of falls, missed nursing care and functional dependence.
