39185104|t|An Interprofessional Team for Disease-Modifying Therapy in Alzheimer Disease Implementation.
39185104|a|Background: Lecanemab and other new amyloid-targeting immunotherapies for Alzheimer disease show notable promise but may also pose significant risk for patients. Recent Findings: To facilitate the implementation and monitoring of lecanemab infusions at our tertiary medical center, we convened an interprofessional team. The team created a number of resources including patient handouts and medical documentation templates as well as systems and processes that are likely to be useful to other clinical care settings and centers. Implications for Practice: It is our intent to widely share the resources and processes developed.
