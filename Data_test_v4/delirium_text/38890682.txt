38890682|a|BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is characterized by reduced skeletal muscle volume and is a condition that is prevalent among elderly patients and associated with poor prognosis as a comorbidity in malignancies. Given the aging population over 80 years old in Japan, an understanding of malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC), complicated by sarcopenia is increasingly important. Therefore, the focus of this study is on a novel and practical diagnostic approach of assessment of psoas major muscle volume (PV) using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) in diagnosis of sarcopenia in patients with CRC. METHODS: The subjects were 150 patients aged >= 80 years with CRC who underwent primary tumor resection at Juntendo University Hospital between 2004 and 2017. 3D-CT measurement of PV and conventional CT measurement of the psoas major muscle cross-sectional area (PA) were used to identify sarcopenia (group S) and non-sarcopenia (group nS) cases. Clinicopathological characteristics, operative results, postoperative complications, and prognosis were compared between these groups. RESULTS: The S:nS ratios were 15:135 for the PV method and 52:98 for the PA method. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) between PVI (psoas major muscle volume index) and PAI (psoas major muscle cross-sectional area index), which were calculated by dividing PV or PA by the square of height. Surgical results and postoperative complications did not differ significantly in the S and nS groups defined using each method. Overall survival was worse in group S compared to group nS identified by PV (p < 0.01), but not significantly different in groups S and nS identified by PA (p = 0.77). A Cox proportional hazards model for OS identified group S by PV as an independent predictor of a poor prognosis (p < 0.05), whereas group S by PA was not a predictor of prognosis (p = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: The PV method for identifying sarcopenia in elderly patients with CRC is more practical and sensitive for prediction of a poor prognosis compared to the conventional method.
