36615257|t|Microwave-Assisted Cu-Catalyzed Diaryletherification for Facile Synthesis of Bioactive Prenylated Diresorcinols.
36615257|a|Prenylated diresorcinols exhibit various bioactivities, including cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. Therefore, establishing facile and efficient synthetic routes for prenylated diresorcinols facilitates their development as chemical probes or drugs with a novel mode of action. In this study, microwave-assisted copper catalysis was explored as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method for the cross-coupling of sterically hindered ortho-prenylated phenols and aryl halides to produce bioactive prenylated diresorcinols, diorcinol I and leotiomycene B. Notable advantages of microwave-assisted catalysis include not only operational simplicity and rapid heating but also shorter reaction times and higher chemical yields. In addition, highly regioselective prenylation of phenol was achieved for the preparation of ortho-prenyl phenol via directed lithiation and subsequent alkylation. This study provides valuable insights for the preparation of other bioactive prenylated diresorcinols. Furthermore, considering that prenylated benzenoids are biosynthetic precursors of various polycyclic natural products, this synthetic route could be expanded to more complex bioactive compounds possessing diaryl ethers.
