28041964|t|Association between DNA methyltransferase gene polymorphism and Parkinson's disease.
28041964|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder, the second most prevalent, only behind Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that environmental factors may contribute for neurodegeneration through induction of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, that is carried out by enzymes, such as DNMT1 and DNMT3B. This present study targeted to investigate the association among DNMT1 and DNMT3B polymorphisms with PD. Five hundred and twenty-two participants (214 PD patients following UK Brain Bank criteria and 308 healthy individuals) were evaluated. DNA was obtained from whole blood and genotypes were detected by an allelic discrimination assay using TaqMan  MGB probes on a real-time PCR system. The polymorphisms studied were rs2162560 and rs759920 (DNMT1) and rs2424913, rs998382 and rs2424932 (DNMT3B). Was found association between DNMT3B rs2424913 in T allele carriers with PD. The presence of the T allele was associated with PD (OR=1.80, 95% CI 1.16-2.81, p=0.009). No significant difference was observed for others DNMT3B SNPs. Also, no association between PD and the control group were observed for DNMT1 polymorphisms. This is the first study addressing an association between DNMT3B polymorphism and PD. The polymorphism may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD.
