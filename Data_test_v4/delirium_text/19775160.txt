19775160|a|Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibition is expected to be a promising therapeutic approach for treating Alzheimer's disease. Previously we reported a series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives as potent and highly selective GSK-3beta inhibitors, however, the representative compounds 1a,b showed poor pharmacokinetic profiles. Efforts were made to address this issue by reducing molecular weight and lipophilicity, leading to the identification of oxadiazole derivatives containing a sulfinyl group, (S)-9b and (S)-9c. These compounds exhibited not only highly selective and potent inhibitory activity against GSK-3beta but also showed good pharmacokinetic profiles including favorable BBB penetration. In addition, (S)-9b and (S)-9c given orally to mice significantly inhibited cold water stress-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in mouse brain.
