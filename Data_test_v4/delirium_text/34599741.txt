34599741|t|Decreased Astrocytic CCL2 Accounts for BAF-312 Effect on PBMCs Transendothelial Migration Through a Blood Brain Barrier in Vitro Model.
34599741|a|Disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) is a common event in several neurological diseases and in particular, in multiple sclerosis (MS), it contributes to the infiltration of the central nervous system by peripheral inflammatory cells. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive molecule with pleiotropic effects. Agonists of S1P receptors such as fingolimod and siponimod (BAF-312) are in clinical practice for MS and have been shown to preserve BBB function in inflammatory conditions. Using an in vitro BBB model of endothelial-astrocytes co-culture exposed to an inflammatory insult (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma; T&I), we show that BAF-312 reduced the migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) through the endothelial layer, only in the presence of astrocytes. This effect was accompanied by decreased expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. BAF-312 also reduced the activation of astrocytes, by controlling NF-kB and NLRP3 induction and preventing the increase of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines. Reduction of CCL2 by BAF-312 may be responsible for the observed effects and, accordingly, addition of exogenous CCL2 was able to counteract BAF-312 effects and rescued T&I responses on PBMC migration, ICAM-1 expression and astrocyte activation. The present results further point out BAF-312 effects on BBB properties, suggesting also the key role of astrocytes in mediating drug effects on endothelial function.
