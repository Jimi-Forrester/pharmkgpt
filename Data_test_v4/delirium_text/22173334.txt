22173334|a|Simple synthesis and biological activities of modafinil derivatives are described. The key reactions include condensation of acid and propargyl alcohol, subsequent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of alkynes and (3-azido-propyl)cyclohexane or (4-azido-butyl)benzene in the presence of sodium ascorbate and CuSO4 5H2O in excellent yield. They were then evaluated for the suppression of LPS-induced NO generation in vitro. It was found that all compounds showed moderate effects for suppression of LPS-induced NO generation.
