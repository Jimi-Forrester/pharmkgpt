34355181|a|As part of our efforts to develop sustainable drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have been focusing on the inexpensive and largely available cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) as a starting material for the identification of new acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Herein, we decided to investigate whether cardanol, a phenolic CNSL component, could serve as a scaffold for improved compounds with concomitant anti-amyloid and antioxidant activities. Ten new derivatives, carrying the intact phenolic function and an aminomethyl functionality, were synthesized and first tested for their inhibitory potencies towards AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). 5 and 11 were found to inhibit human BChE at a single-digit micromolar concentration. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the potential of five derivatives to modulate Abeta aggregation, including 5 and 11. In HORAC assays, 5 and 11 performed similarly to standard antioxidant ferulic acid as hydroxyl scavenging agents. Furthermore, in in vitro studies in neuronal cell cultures, 5 and 11 were found to effectively inhibit reactive oxygen species production at a 10 muM concentration. They also showed a favorable initial ADME/Tox profile. Overall, these results suggest that CNSL is a promising raw material for the development of potential disease-modifying treatments for AD.
