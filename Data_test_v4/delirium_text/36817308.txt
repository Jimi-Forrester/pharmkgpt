36817308|t|Acute Diarrhea Isn't Always Infectious: An Atypical Presentation of Adrenal Insufficiency.
36817308|a|Adrenal insufficiency can be a primary or secondary disorder occurring from a hormone deficiency or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis from various etiologies. The diagnosis can be challenging given the lack of specificity and indolence of symptoms. Diarrhea is not a typical presenting symptom of adrenal insufficiency and can be overlooked as an infectious disease during an adrenal crisis. Herein we present a patient with an undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency who presented with subacute diarrhea during an adrenal crisis after a dental procedure and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
