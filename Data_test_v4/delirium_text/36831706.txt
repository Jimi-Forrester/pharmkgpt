36831706|t|The Role of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in Diagnosis and Treatment of Epilepsy, Depression, Schizophrenia, Anorexia Nervosa and Alzheimer's Disease as Highly Drug-Resistant Diseases: A Narrative Review.
36831706|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the family of neurotrophins, which are growth factors with trophic effects on neurons. BDNF is the most widely distributed neurotrophin in the central nervous system (CNS) and is highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Its distribution outside the CNS has also been demonstrated, but most studies have focused on its effects in neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the advances in medicine in recent decades, neurological and psychiatric diseases are still characterized by high drug resistance. This review focuses on the use of BDNF in the developmental assessment, treatment monitoring, and pharmacotherapy of selected diseases, with a particular emphasis on epilepsy, depression, anorexia, obesity, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. The limitations of using a molecule with such a wide distribution range and inconsistent method of determination are also highlighted.
