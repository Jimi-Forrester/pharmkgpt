9272645|t|beta-amyloid protein enhances macrophage production of oxygen free radicals and glutamate.
9272645|a|Cells of the monocyte phagocytic system can generate superoxide and glutamate anions, both of which are neurotoxic at high levels. We used rat peritoneal macrophages as a model system to test the effects of various stimulants on the production of these molecules. Glutamate production by such cells was enhanced, in a concentration-dependent manner, by treatment with serum-opsonized zymosan (OZ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and beta-amyloid peptide Abeta (1-40); but not by treatment with the reverse Abeta (40-1) or the Abeta (25-35) subfragment. Superoxide anion production by the cells was stimulated by OZ, PMA, Abeta (1-40), and Abeta (25-35). Moreover, Abeta and its subfragment, when used as priming agents, also enhanced the stimulatory effect of PMA. However, they did not act as priming agents for OZ, suggesting a competition for receptors or intracellular signaling pathways linked to those receptors. Inflammatory mediators, including Abeta, could place glutamate-sensitive neurons at risk by enhancing glutamate and oxygen free radical production by monocyte-derived cells. Such mechanisms could contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.
