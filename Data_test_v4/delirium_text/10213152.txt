10213152|t|A novel mutation in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE*4 Pittsburgh) is associated with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
10213152|a|Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing techniques, we identified a unique missense mutation (T-->C) in exon 3 of the APOE gene which resulted in the substitution of pro-28 for leu-28. We screened 1118 White cases of late-onset (>60 years) Alzheimer's disease (AD) from three independent centers (Pittsburgh = 489, Indiana = 319, Mayo Clinic Rochester = 310) and 1123 controls (607 clinically assessed and 516 individuals randomly ascertained from the general population). Two of the 1123 control subjects had the pro-28 mutation (0.18%). However, this mutation was observed in heterozygous state in 2.66, 2.51 and 1.94% of the AD cases from Pittsburgh, Indiana and Mayo Clinic Rochester, respectively, with an overall frequency of 2.42%. All individuals with this mutation were carriers of the APOE*4 allele and hence the mutation was denoted as APOE*4 Pittsburgh (APOE*4P). Compared with the non-E*4P carriers, the E*4P carriers were associated with an increased risk of AD (odds ratio (OR) 13.2) and this risk remained significant even after adjusting for the known effect of APOE*4 (OR 5.4). The risk associated with the E*4P/E*4 combination was about five times (OR 29.1) the risk attributed to APOE*4 carriers alone (OR 5.7). Our data indicates that the new mutation most likely exists in cis-orientation with APOE*4 and is associated with increased risk of developing AD.
