1343507|a|Biological research on Alzheimer's disease is expanding quickly, and the mechanisms of the disease are better understood today. Progress has been specially impressive in the knowledge of the brain lesions (senile plaques, neurofibrillary degeneration). It is likely that the beta-amyloid protein, which accumulates in the senile plaques plays a major role in the development of the brain lesions and, subsequently of the clinical symptoms. The metabolism of the precursor of this protein might be abnormal, leading to the beta-amyloid protein deposits. Some discrete genetic abnormalities (such as punctate mutations on the beta amyloid precursor gene) have been described recently in familial cases of the disease. It seems unlikely that such punctate mutations would be responsible for the majority of the cases. Therefore it is possible that Alzheimer's disease has multiple causes, the genetic factors being only one of them.
