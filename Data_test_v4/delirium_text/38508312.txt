Disturbances in protein homeostasis are linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). PINK1, a protein kinase, plays a significant role in mitochondrial quality control and cellular stress response, and its mutated forms lead to early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its importance, the specific mechanisms regulating PINK1 protein stability have remained unclear. This study reveals a cytoplasmic interaction between PINK1 and FBW7beta in mammalian cells. FBW7beta, a component of the Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box protein (SCF) complex-type ubiquitin ligase, is instrumental in recognizing substrates. Our findings demonstrate that FBW7beta regulates PINK1 stability through the SCF complex and the proteasome pathway. It facilitates the K48-linked polyubiquitination of PINK1, marking it for degradation. When FBW7 is absent, PINK1 accumulates, leading to heightened mitophagy triggered by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone treatment. Moreover, exposure to the toxic compound staurosporine accelerates PINK1 degradation via FBW7beta, correlating with increased cell death. This study unravels the intricate mechanisms controlling PINK1 protein stability and sheds light on the novel role of FBW7beta. These findings deepen our understanding of PINK1-related pathologies and potentially pave the way for therapeutic interventions.
