8891063|a|The immunolocalization of presenilin in human brain was studied using two antibodies raised against different portions of presenilin 1 (S182) protein. A granular staining was found in the cytoplasm of neurons in cortical layers III and V. One of the antibodies, also reactive to presenilin 2 (E5-1) protein, additionally stained dendrites and axons. This was seen in normal brains as well as in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. Less prominent immunolabeling was noted in some senile plaques. No relationship to neurofibrillary tangles was found in double-labeling experiments combined with anti-paired helical filament-tau antibody (AT8). The widespread expression of presenilin in normal brain suggests a physiological role of the protein.
