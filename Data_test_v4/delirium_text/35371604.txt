35371604|t|DNA Methylation Modulates Aging Process in Adipocytes.
35371604|a|Aging has been recognized to be a highly complex biological health problem with a high risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Particularly, age-related turnover in adipose tissue is a major contributor to metabolic syndromes and shortened lifespan. Adipocytes undergo senescence in early stage, which results in adipose tissue metabolic dysfunction, redistribution, and inflammation. The well-established association between DNA methylation (DNAm) and aging has been observed in the past few decades. Indeed, age-related alteration in DNAm is highly tissue-specific. This review intends to summarize the advancements how DNAm changes coupled with aging process in adipose tissue, by which DNAm regulates cellular senescence, metabolic function, adipokine secretion and beiging process in adipocytes. Elucidation of the effect of DNAm on adipose aging would have great potential to the development of epigenetic therapeutic strategies against aging-related diseases in clinical settings.
