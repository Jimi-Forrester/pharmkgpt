10844710|a|To benefit Alzheimer's disease research, a central data co-ordinating centre (CDCC) is planned that will systematically collect data from 27 Alzheimer's disease centres (ADCs) located nationwide. This CDCC will combine, analyse and disseminate epidemiologic, demographic, clinical and neuropathological data to researchers from the ADCs and the broader scientific community. New and larger scale collaborative studies on Alzheimer's disease will be possible through this centre. Since 1 July 1997, an interim data co-ordinating centre (IDCC) has been serving as the agent of the ADCs to begin the data sharing process until a permanent CDCC is established. The data collected by the IDCC are limited to administrative information and to indexing of specimens and clinical material, with future plans for the transfer of the data collected to the CDCC once it is established.
