29608380|t|The Alzheimer's Disease Home Hospice Knowledge Scale: development, validity and reliability.
29608380|a|BACKGROUND: Several instruments are available to assess knowledge about hospice care, but none specifically address knowledge about home hospice for persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AIM: To develop and validate the Alzheimer's Disease Home Hospice Knowledge Scale (AD-HHK-S). METHODS: A total of 107 Israeli family caregivers of persons with dementia (mean age=71.2; 73% female) participated in the study. RESULTS: The AD-HHK-S included 28 true/false items assessing 3 areas of knowledge: knowledge about hospice, knowledge about home hospice, and knowledge about home hospice for AD. Good internal reliability was found, with Cronbach alpha ranging from 0.72 to 0.85. Good face, construct and predictive validity were found. CONCLUSIONS: The AD-HHK-S proved to be a valid and reliable tool to assess knowledge about hospice care in the area of AD. It might provide an effective tool for palliative care nurses to communicate with family caregivers of persons with AD at the end of life.
