36552526|a|Researchers recently focused on studying the nutritional and functional qualities of sprouts generated from seeds. The current study investigated the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids (TF), total flavonols (TFL), antioxidant activity (AOA), specific phenolic acids, and volatile chemicals in fennel seeds (FS) and fennel seed sprouts (FSS). The oxidative DNA damage prevention activity of selected FS and FSS extracts against DNA was examined. Consequently, the antioxidative stress potential of FS and FSS extracts at 300 and 600 mg kg-1 on CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats weas investigated. The liver's functions and oxidative stress biomarkers in rat blood were examined. FSS exhibited rich phytochemical content such as TPC, TF, TFL, and AOA with altered phenolics and volatiles. HPLC identified nineteen compounds of phenolic acids and their derivatives in FS. Thirteen phenolics and six flavonoids were predominantly identified as Vanillic acid and Kaempferol, respectively. GC-MS analysis identified fifty and fifty-one components in FS and FSS, respectively. The predominant component was Benzene, [1-(2-propenyloxy)-3-butenyl] (trans-Anethole) (38.41%), followed by trans-Anethole (Benzene, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)) (23.65%), Fenchone (11.18%), and 1,7-Octadiene, 2-methyl-6-methylene- Cyclohexene (7.17%). Interestingly, alpha-Pinene, Fenchone, trans-Anethole (Benzene, 1-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)), 4-Methoxybenzaldehyde (4-Anisaldehyde), Benzeneacetic acid, alpha-hydroxy-4-methoxy, and Nonacosane contents were increased. While Dillapiole, 7-Octadecenoic acid, and methyl ester were newly identified and quantified in FSS. The oxidative DNA damage prevention capability of FSS and FS extracts indicated remarkable DNA protection. Administrating FS and FSS extracts at 300 and 600 mg kg-1 ameliorated AST, ALT, and ALP, as well as GSH, CAT, MDA, and SOD, in a dose-dependent manner. The most efficient treatment of FS or FSS was using a dose of 600 mg Kg-1, which recorded an improvement rate of 20.77 and 24.17, 20.36 and 24.92, and 37.49 and 37.90% for ALT, AST, and ALP, respectively. While an improvement rate of 40.08 and 37.87%, 37.17 and 46.52%, 114.56 and 154.13%, and 66.05 and 69.69% for GSH, DMA, CAT, and SOD compared to the CCl4-group, respectively. The observed protection is associated with increased phenolics and volatiles in F. vulgare. Therefore, FS and FSS are recommended as functional foods with bioactive functionality, health-promoting properties, and desired prevention capabilities that may help prevent oxidative stress-related diseases.
