36364200|t|Zebrafish: A Pharmacological Model for Learning and Memory Research.
36364200|a|Learning and memory are essential to organism survival and are conserved across various species, especially vertebrates. Cognitive studies involving learning and memory require using appropriate model organisms to translate relevant findings to humans. Zebrafish are becoming increasingly popular as one of the animal models for neurodegenerative diseases due to their low maintenance cost, prolific nature and amenability to genetic manipulation. More importantly, zebrafish exhibit a repertoire of neurobehaviors comparable to humans. In this review, we discuss the forms of learning and memory abilities in zebrafish and the tests used to evaluate the neurobehaviors in this species. In addition, the pharmacological studies that used zebrafish as models to screen for the effects of neuroprotective and neurotoxic compounds on cognitive performance will be summarized here. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in establishing zebrafish as a robust model for cognitive research involving learning and memory. Zebrafish are becoming an indispensable model in learning and memory research for screening neuroprotective agents against cognitive impairment.
