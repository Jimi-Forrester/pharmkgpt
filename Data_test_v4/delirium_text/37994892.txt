37994892|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socio-demographic, clinical and psychological characteristics of patients with residual schizophrenia, to identify variants of residual states and to determine measures for psychosocial rehabilitation on this basis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: At the time of investigation, 91 patients with the diagnosis of residual schizophrenia (F20.5xx according to ICD-10) were under dispensary supervision in the psychoneurological dispensary No. 18 of Moscow. A study of the medical records of all these patients was carried out. Twenty-three patients consented to face-to-face examination. The Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Brief Assessment of Cognitive Functions in Schizophrenia (BACS) and the author's questionnaire concerning the opinion of psychiatrists on the clinical and social characteristics of patients with residual schizophrenia were used. Mathematical and statistical methods implemented in the STATISTICA 12.1 software and the Excel office suite were used. The method of stochastic nesting of neighbors (<<T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding>>, t-SNE) implemented in the Python program to cluster cases and identify variants of residual states was used. RESULTS: The patients with residual schizophrenia belonged to the cohort of elderly patients (mean age 66.3+-13.28 years) with a predominance of females (62.22%). At the time of examination, the course of the schizophrenic process had a negative impact on the social life and professional activities of patients, which led to disability of 74.72% patients and 91.55% of them had disability due to a mental disorder. The analysis showed that patients with residual schizophrenia was a heterogeneous group with a predominant presence of negative symptoms in the clinical picture (the composite score on the PANSS negative subscale was17.79+-6.67). Three variants of residual states were identified using clustering by the t-SNE method of individual PANSS indicators. Deficiency symptoms with features of pseudoorganic syndrome prevailed in the first variant. In the second variant, patients had mild positive symptoms, mainly in the form of paranoia and residual delirium, as well as a psychopathic syndrome. The third, small group, included patients with the most favorable variant of remission, having a fairly high level of social adaptation, mainly with personality changes. CONCLUSION: The obtained data were correlated with the results of a psychological examination. It was revealed that patients with residual schizophrenia were not sufficiently included in the process of psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation. Taking into account the identified variants of residual states, the directions of possible psychosocial interventions were determined.
