37994783|a|The phospholipase D (PLD) family is comprised of enzymes bearing phospholipase activity towards lipids or endo- and exonuclease activity towards nucleic acids. PLD3 is synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein and proteolytically cleaved in lysosomes, yielding a soluble active form. The deficiency of PLD3 leads to the slowed degradation of nucleic acids in lysosomes and chronic activation of nucleic acid-specific intracellular toll-like receptors. While the mechanism of PLD phospholipase activity has been extensively characterized, not much is known about how PLDs bind and hydrolyze nucleic acids. Here, we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the luminal N-glycosylated domain of human PLD3 in its apo- and single-stranded DNA-bound forms. PLD3 has a typical phospholipase fold and forms homodimers with two independent catalytic centers via a newly identified dimerization interface. The structure of PLD3 in complex with an ssDNA-derived thymidine product in the catalytic center provides insights into the substrate binding mode of nucleic acids in the PLD family. Our structural data suggest a mechanism for substrate binding and nuclease activity in the PLD family and provide the structural basis to design immunomodulatory drugs targeting PLD3.
