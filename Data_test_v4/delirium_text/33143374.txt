33143374|t|Neuron Loss in Alzheimer's Disease: Translation in Transgenic Mouse Models.
33143374|a|Transgenic mouse models represent an essential tool for the exploration of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological mechanisms and the development of novel treatments, which at present provide only symptomatic and transient effects. While a variety of mouse models successfully reflects the main neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits, intracellular accumulation of Tau protein, the development of micro- and astrogliosis, as well as behavioral deficits, substantial neuron loss, as a key feature of the disease, seems to be more difficult to achieve. In this review, we summarize information on classic and more recent transgenic mouse models for AD, focusing in particular on loss of pyramidal, inter-, and cholinergic neurons. Although the cause of neuron loss in AD is still a matter of scientific debate, it seems to be linked to intraneuronal Abeta accumulation in several transgenic mouse models, especially in pyramidal neurons.
