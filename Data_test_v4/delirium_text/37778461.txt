37778461|t|Delayed-Onset Psychosis Secondary to Tacrolimus Neurotoxicity after Lung Transplant: A Case Report and Systematic Review.
37778461|a|BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus is the most common immunosuppressant used after transplant, yet it can result in moderate-to-severe neurotoxicity in up to 32% of patients. Signs of neurotoxicity can vary from mild (tremor or headache) to severe (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) or psychosis. Prompt recognition and management is needed to lead to symptom resolution. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation of tacrolimus-induced psychosis, a type of tacrolimus-inducted neurotoxicity, and distinguish it from other central nervous system disturbances, including delirium. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a case of delayed onset tacrolimus-induced psychosis with focus on unique clinical features and management strategies. We conducted a systematic review of cases of tacrolimus-induced psychosis using the PubMed database and included fifteen manuscripts in our review. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus-induced psychosis is a unique presentation of tacrolimus-related neurotoxicity and can present without the cardinal symptoms of delirium. The data on isolated psychotic symptoms is limited with current literature focusing on more common presentations of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity, such as delirium and tremor. Development of psychosis can occur later in the treatment course and at normal tacrolimus serum levels. It can improve with antipsychotic therapies, but primary management should include cross-titration to an alternate immunosuppressant regimen.
