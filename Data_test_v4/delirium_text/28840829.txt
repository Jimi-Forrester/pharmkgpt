28840829|t|Transglutaminase 2 in human diseases.
28840829|a|Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is an inducible transamidating acyltransferase that catalyzes Ca(2+)-dependent protein modifications. In addition to being an enzyme, TG2 also serves as a G protein for several seven transmembrane receptors and acts as a co-receptor for integrin beta1 and beta3 integrins distinguishing it from other members of the transglutaminase family. TG2 is ubiquitously expressed in almost all cell types and all cell compartments, and is also present on the cell surface and gets secreted to the extracellular matrix via non-classical mechanisms. TG2 has been associated with various human diseases including inflammation, cancer, fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, celiac disease in which it plays either a protective role, or contributes to the pathogenesis. Thus modulating the biological activities of TG2 in these diseases will have a therapeutic value.
