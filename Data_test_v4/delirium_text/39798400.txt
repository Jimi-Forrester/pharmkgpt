39798400|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives as potent GSK-3beta inhibitors for treating Alzheimer's disease.
39798400|a|The development of potent glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitor has been increasingly recognized as the candidate treatment against the multifactorial pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study prepared various new pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives, evaluated the anti-AD activities and detected the security based on the structure-guided rational design. Our results indicated that many pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives had strong GSK-3beta inhibitory activities, particularly compounds 41, 46 and 54, with the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.22, 0.26 and 0.24 nM, respectively, and each of them generally possessed GSK-3beta selectivity over 24 structurally similar kinases. In addition, further targeting studies at the cellular level revealed that compound 41 increased GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9 site dose-dependently for inhibiting GSK-3beta activity, therefore inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein by decreasing the p-tau-Ser396 abundance. Moreover, 41 up-regulated beta-catenin and neurogenesis-related markers (GAP43 and MAP-2), thereby promoting neurite outgrowth of neurons in SH-SY5Y cells. According to the in vitro cells assay, 41 showed the lower cytotoxicity to SH-SY5Y cells with a survival rate of over 70 % at the concentration of 100 muM. In vivo efficacy and acute toxicity experiments showed that, 41 effectively ameliorated the dyskinesia in AlCl3-induced zebrafish AD models and exhibited its low-toxicity nature in C57BL/6 mice. Overall, the pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine derivative 41 could serve as a promising GSK-3beta inhibitor for treating AD.
