37790412|a|Severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with neurological complications that may be linked to direct infection of the central nervous system (CNS), but the selective pressures ruling neuroinvasion are poorly defined. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the lung versus CNS of infected mice. Higher levels of viral diversity were observed in the CNS than the lung after intranasal challenge with a high frequency of mutations in the Spike furin cleavage site (FCS). Deletion of the FCS significantly attenuated virulence after intranasal challenge, with lower viral titers and decreased morbidity compared to the wild-type virus. Intracranial inoculation of the FCS-deleted virus, however, was sufficient to restore virulence. After intracranial inoculation, both viruses established infection in the lung, but this required reversion of the FCS deletion. Cumulatively, these data suggest a critical role for the FCS in determining SARS-CoV-2 tropism and compartmentalization with possible implications for the treatment of neuroinvasive COVID-19.
