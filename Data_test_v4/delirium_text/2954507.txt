2954507|t|Phosphofructokinase activity in the brain in Alzheimer's disease.
2954507|a|The activity of phosphofructokinase, a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, was determined in neurosurgical samples of neocortex obtained from 6 patients with primary degenerative dementia, including 4 with Alzheimer's disease. No consistent reductions were seen compared with samples from nondemented controls. These results contrast with the greatly reduced activity reported previously for postmortem brain specimens from patients with Alzheimer's disease.
