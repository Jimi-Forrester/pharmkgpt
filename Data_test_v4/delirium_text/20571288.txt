20571288|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurons expressing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) degenerate and a loss of cholinergic activity directly correlates with cognitive decline. Recent studies have suggested that cholesterol plays a role in AD. The aim of the present study was to explore if cholesterol and its oxysterols, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OH Chol) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH Chol), affect ChAT-positive neurons in organotypic brain slices of the basal nucleus of Meynert (nBM). We showed that slices expressed approximately 140 ChAT-positive neurons/slice after 2 weeks when incubated with nerve growth factor (NGF). This number markedly decreased when incubated without NGF to approximately 20 neurons/slice. Cholesterol and 24S-OH Chol delayed this decrease in ChAT-positive neurons. In contrast, 25-OH Chol induced a decline in ChAT-positive neurons in 2-week-old slices within 4 days. The effects of cholesterol and its oxysterols were exhibited in a dose- and time-dependent way. Our results show that cholesterol and 24S-OH Chol delays the decrease in ChAT-positive neurons, while 25-OH Chol rapidly decreases ChAT expression, suggesting differential mechanisms on ChAT expression in cholinergic nBM neurons.
