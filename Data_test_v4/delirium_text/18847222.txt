18847222|a|Oxidative stress plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, the abnormally high Cu(2+) ion concentrations present in senile plaques has provoked a substantial interest in the relationship between the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) found within plaques and redox-active copper ions. There have been a number of studies monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by copper and ascorbate that suggest that Abeta acts as a prooxidant producing H2O2. However, others have indicated Abeta acts as an antioxidant, but to date most cell-free studies directly monitoring ROS have not supported this hypothesis. We therefore chose to look again at ROS generation by both monomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta under aerobic conditions in the presence of Cu(2+) with/without the biological reductant ascorbate in a cell-free system. We used a variety of fluorescence and absorption based assays to monitor the production of ROS, as well as Cu(2+) reduction. In contrast to previous studies, we show here that Abeta does not generate any more ROS than controls of Cu(2+) and ascorbate. Abeta does not silence the redox activity of Cu(2+/+) via chelation, but rather hydroxyl radicals produced as a result of Fenton-Haber Weiss reactions of ascorbate and Cu(2+) rapidly react with Abeta; thus the potentially harmful radicals are quenched. In support of this, chemical modification of the Abeta peptide was examined using (1)H NMR, and specific oxidation sites within the peptide were identified at the histidine and methionine residues. Our studies add significant weight to a modified amyloid cascade hypothesis in which sporadic AD is the result of Abeta being upregulated as a response to oxidative stress. However, our results do not preclude the possibility that Abeta in an oligomeric form may concentrate the redox-active copper at neuronal membranes and so cause lipid peroxidation.
