36079590|a|Agavaceae contains about 480 species, commonly used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as tequila and mezcal, making it a resource of economic and cultural importance. Uses of this plant rely mainly on the stem; other components such as the leaves are discarded, generating agro-industrial waste, despite being a source of bioactive and nutraceutical products. Reports show anti-inflammatory and anti-neuroinflammatory effects of these species, with flavonoids and saponins being mainly responsible. Neuroinflammation is a brain process that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders and its effects contribute greatly to mortality and morbidity worldwide. This can be triggered by mechanisms such as glial reactions that lead to the release of inflammatory and oxidative molecules, causing damage to the CNS. Treatments do not cure chronic disease associated with inflammation; they only slow its progression, producing side effects that affect quality of life. Plant-based therapy is promising for treating these diseases. Pharmacological activities have been described for the Agavaceae family; however, their role in neuroinflammation has not been fully investigated, and represents an important target for study. This review synthesizes the existing literature on the biologically active compounds of Agave species that are related in some way to inflammation, which will allow us to propose a line of research with this genus on the forefront to orient experimental designs for treating neuroinflammation and associated diseases.
