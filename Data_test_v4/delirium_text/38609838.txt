38609838|a|BACKGROUND: Retirement and aging are phenomena that often occur simultaneously and lead to various physical and psychological changes in older adults. Retirement syndrome consists of symptoms such as feelings of emptiness, loneliness, uselessness, lack of clear understanding of future conditions and dissatisfaction with one's performance after retirement. This phenomenon requires interventions to adapt to these changes. Considering the supportive role of nurses, the formation of support groups as an effective intervention in adapting to transitional stages is emphasized. AIMS: This study aims to investigate the effect of older adults' participation in support groups on retirement syndrome. METHODS: This Quasi-experimental study recruited a total of 80 retired older adults meeting the inclusion criteria from three Retirement Associations (Retirement centers for social security retirees are among the institutions that have been set up by the government and this organization to provide face-to-face and offline services to social security retirees, as well as providing some facilities to this segment of the society). in Iran, Research samples were randomly assigned to two intervention and control groups. The demographic questionnaire and retirement syndrome questionnaire were completed by both groups at the beginning of the study. Then, four support group sessions lasting 60 to 90 min were held twice a week for the support group, and eight weeks after the end of the intervention, the questionnaires were completed for both groups. The data were analyzed using statistical tests in SPSS version 16. The significance level was set at p < 0.05 for all tests. RESULTS: The results of the covariance analysis showed that after the intervention, the feelings of helplessness and failure (p < 0.001), feelings of older and idleness (p = 0.027), and feelings of confusion and conflict (p = 0.002) were significantly less in the support group compared to the control group. In addition, the Feeling of trying and new direction (p < 0.001) was higher after the intervention. The paired t-test results showed that in the support group, the feelings of helplessness and failure (p < 0.001), feelings of older and idleness (p = 0.004), and feelings of confusion and conflict (p < 0.001) significantly decreased after the intervention compared to before it, while the feelings of trying and new direction (p = 0.004) significantly increased. Therefore, the results showed that after the intervention, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in all components of the retirement syndrome. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that participation of retired older adults in support groups can significantly improve all components of retirement syndrome, leading to an improvement in their quality of life and satisfaction.
