36836534|t|Native and Prosthetic Simultaneously Double Valve Infective Endocarditis with Enterococcus faecalis-Case-Based Review.
36836534|a|Infective endocarditis is a severe infective heart disease, commonly involving native or prosthetic valves. It frequently presents with univalvular involvement and simultaneous double valve or multivalvular involvement is rarely described. The third leading cause of infective endocarditis worldwide is Enterococcus faecalis, which is associated with high mortality rates despite important advances in antimicrobial therapy. It develops secondary to enterococcal bacteremia, with its origin from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract and predominantly affecting the elderly population with multiple comorbidities. Clinical presentation is usually less typical, and the treatment is challenging. It can be marked by antibiotic resistance, side effects, and subsequent complications. Surgical treatment can be considered if deemed appropriate. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case-based narrative review of Enterococcus faecalis double valve endocarditis involving both the aortic native and prosthetic mitral valve, highlighting the clinical characteristics, treatment, and complications of this condition.
