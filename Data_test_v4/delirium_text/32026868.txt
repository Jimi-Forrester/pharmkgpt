32026868|t|Severe delirium after GHB abuse.
32026868|a|BACKGROUND: The management of benzodiazepine-resistant GHB withdrawal requires careful consideration of GHB pharmacodynamics. CASE PRESENTATION: A young woman was admitted with tachycardia, confusion, agitation and delusions the day after attempting to quit a daily, high-dose GHB habit. A total of 225 mg of diazepam had no effect. She was sedated with propofol and intubated. An extubation attempt after 24 hours was followed by recurrence of delirium. After reintubation she required high doses of propofol, alfentanil and dexmedetomidine to maintain sedation for two days. Baclofen and diazepam were introduced on the third day, allowing dose reductions in anaesthetic agents the fourth day and extubation on the fifth day with resolution of the delirium. INTERPRETATION: GHB targets the GABAB receptor and downregulates it with abuse. Most anaesthetic agents affect the GABAA receptor. Our report suggests that baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, may reduce the need for anaesthetic agents and facilitate recovery.
