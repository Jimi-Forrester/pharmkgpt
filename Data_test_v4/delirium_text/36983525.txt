36983525|t|Dual Disseminated Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis Diagnosed at Autopsy: A Report of Two Cases of Coinfection and a Review of the Literature.
36983525|a|Coinfection with invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients has been reported but is rarely confirmed by tissue histology or autopsy. Serum fungal biomarkers and culture are the primary diagnostic tools but are suboptimal for detecting fungal coinfection. Here, we present the cases of two patients who were immunocompromised due to hematologic malignancy where disseminated aspergillosis and mucormycosis coinfection was only diagnosed upon autopsy despite extensive fungal diagnostic workup, and also review recent literature of such instances of coinfection.
