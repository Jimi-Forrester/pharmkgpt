38037163|a|BACKGROUND: An international pandemic of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. A large number of patients with chest trauma were infected with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the management of chest trauma. OBJECTIVE: The present observational study was conducted to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of chest trauma patients with or without COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A multicenter observational study was performed at three Chinese hospitals between November 1, 2022, and January 31, 2023. All enrolled patients were diagnosed with chest trauma. We analyzed data from existing medical records, including all baseline data and prognostic follow-up data, such as 30-day mortality, hospital stays, hospitalization costs, and complications. RESULTS: All 375 eligible patients completed the follow-up. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between chest trauma combined with COVID-19 (p > 0.05). Chest trauma combined with COVID-19 infection may lead to higher 30-day mortality (16.36% vs. 7.14%, p = 0.005), longer hospital stays (22.5 +- 5.9 vs. 12.8 +- 4.2, p < 0.001), larger hospitalization costs (p < 0.001), and increased hospitalization complications, such as pulmonary embolism (10.30% vs. 4.76%, p = 0.039), deep vein thrombosis (DVT, 33.33% vs. 18.57%, p = 0.001), the incidence of 7-day delirium (69.70% vs. 46.19%, p < 0.001), and respiratory failure (38.18% vs. 24.77%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to chest trauma alone, it may lead to higher mortality, larger hospitalization costs, and more complications. To better respond to the future of COVID-19 or other similar virus-borne disease pandemics, it is important to understand the clinical characteristics and complications, such as pulmonary embolism, DVT, and respiratory failure after COVID-19 infection. To guide the future treatment of chest trauma combined with COVID-19 infection or other infectious diseases.
