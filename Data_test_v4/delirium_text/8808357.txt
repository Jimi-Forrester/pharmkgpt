8808357|t|The use of haloperidol in the agitated, critically ill pediatric patient with burns.
8808357|a|Haloperidol has become the drug of choice for sedation of the acutely agitated, delirious adult patient in the critical care setting because of its well-documented efficacy and lack of major side effects. Its use in the critically ill pediatric patient with burns has not been described. To determine the safety and efficacy of haloperidol in this population, the medical records of 30 critically ill pediatric patients with burns treated with haloperidol during the period 1986 to 1992 were reviewed. Our findings support the safe and effective use of haloperidol to treat severe agitation and delirium in the critically ill pediatric patient. The intravenous route appears to be more effective than the enteral route and should be considered when rapid, acute control of agitation is required.
