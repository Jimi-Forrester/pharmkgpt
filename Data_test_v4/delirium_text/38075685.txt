38075685|t|A pharmacogenetic study of perampanel: association between rare variants of glutamate receptor genes and outcomes.
38075685|a|Introduction: The selection of antiseizure medication usually requires a trial-and-error process. Our goal is to investigate whether genetic markers can predict the outcome of perampanel (PER) use in patients with epilepsy. Method: The studied participants were selected from our previous epilepsy genetics studies where whole exome sequencing was available. We reviewed the medical records of epilepsy patients older than 20 years old treated with PER. The outcome of PER treatment included the response to PER, the occurrence of any adverse drug reaction (ADR), the presence of behavior ADR, and the ability to adhere to PER for more than 1 year. We investigated the association between the rare variants of the glutamate receptor genes and the outcomes of PER use. Result: A total of 83 patients were collected. The gene group burden analysis showed that enriched genetic variants of the glutamate receptor gene group were statistically significantly associated with the occurrence of ADR, while the glutamate ionotropic receptor delta type subunit had a nominal association with the occurrence of ADR. The gene collapse analysis found that GRID1 had a nominal association with the occurrence of ADR and GRIN3A had a nominal association with the occurrence of behavior ADR. However, these nominal associations did not remain statistically significant once adjusted for multiple testing. Discussion: We found that enriched rare genetic variants of the glutamate receptor genes were associated with the occurrence of ADR in patients taking PER. In the future, combining the results of various pharmacogenetic studies may lead to the development of prediction tools for the outcome of antiseizure medications.
