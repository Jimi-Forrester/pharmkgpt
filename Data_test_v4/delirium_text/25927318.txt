25927318|a|BACKGROUND: The American Stroke Association/American Heart Association recommended the criteria for diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and memory impairment (MI) is a feature in the classification of vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI). VaMCI patients with MI may differ in terms of infarct location or demographic features, so we evaluated the clinical characteristics associated with MI in patients with VaMCI. METHODS: A prospective multicenter study enrolled 353 acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent evaluation using the Korean Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standard Neuropsychological Protocol at three months after onset. The association between MI and demographic features, stroke risk factors, and infarct location was assessed. RESULTS: VaMCI was diagnosed in 141 patients, and 58 (41.1%) exhibited MI. Proportions of men and of left side infarcts were higher in VaMCI with MI than those without (75.9 vs. 57.8%, P = 0.03, 66.7 vs. 47%, P = 0.02). Multiple logistic analyses revealed that male sex (odds ratio [OR] 3.07, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.12-8.42), left-side infarcts (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.37-7.20), and basal ganglia/internal capsule infarcts (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.55-13.22) were associated with MI after adjusting other demographic variables, vascular risk factors, and subtypes of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: MI is associated with sex and infarct location in VaMCI patients.
