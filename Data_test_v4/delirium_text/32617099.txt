32617099|t|Preoperative Altered Spontaneous Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity Were Independent Risk Factors for Delayed Neurocognitive Recovery in Older Adults Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery.
32617099|a|Objectives: Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients with subtle preexisting cognitive impairment were susceptible to delayed neurocognitive recovery (DNR). This present study investigated whether preoperative alterations in gray matter volume, spontaneous activity, or functional connectivity (FC) were associated with DNR. Methods: This was a nested case-control study of older adults (>=60 years) undergoing noncardiac surgery. All patients received MRI scan at least 1 day prior to surgery. Cognitive function was assessed prior to surgery and at 7-14 days postsurgery. Preoperative gray matter volume, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and FC were compared between the DNR patients and non-DNR patients. The independent risk factors associated with DNR were identified using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Of the 74 patients who completed assessments, 16/74 (21.6%) had DNR following surgery. There were no differences in gray matter volume between the two groups. However, the DNR patients exhibited higher preoperative ALFF in the bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and left fusiform gyrus and lower preoperative FC between the bilateral MCC and left calcarine than the non-DNR patients. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher preoperative spontaneous activity in the bilateral MCC was independently associated with a higher risk of DNR (OR = 3.11, 95% CI, 1.30-7.45; P = 0.011). A longer education duration (OR = 0.57, 95% CI, 0.41-0.81; P = 0.001) and higher preoperative FC between the bilateral MCC and left calcarine (OR = 0.40, 95% CI, 0.18-0.92; P = 0.031) were independently correlated with a lower risk of DNR. Conclusions: Preoperative higher ALFF in the bilateral MCC and lower FC between the bilateral MCC and left calcarine were independently associated with the occurrence of DNR. The present fMRI study identified possible preoperative neuroimaging risk factors for DNR. This trial is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-DCD-15006096.
