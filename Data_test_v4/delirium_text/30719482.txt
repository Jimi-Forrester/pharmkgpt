30719482|t|Increased Prevalence of Concomitant Psychiatric Diagnoses Among Patients Undergoing Hip Arthroscopic Surgery.
30719482|a|BACKGROUND: Active patients with musculoskeletal pain are not immune to psychological or psychiatric disease. Observations suggest that patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery may have an increased prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions. HYPOTHESIS: Patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery have an increased prevalence of concomitant psychiatric diagnoses compared with the general population as well as those undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A retrospective review of a medical claims database spanning from 2007 to 2016 was utilized to identify patients with a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code indicating that they had undergone hip arthroscopic surgery. This group was then dichotomized to those with or without an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) and 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code indicating a psychological or psychiatric condition at any time before hip arthroscopic surgery or up to 2 years after hip arthrscopic surgery. As a control, ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes for psychological or psychiatric conditions were determined in patients without a CPT code for hip arthroscopic surgery (general population) as well as for 2 surgical groups: those undergoing ACL reconstruction and those undergoing shoulder stabilization surgery. Prevalence was determined in all groups and compared using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: There were 22,676,069 patients in the database, with 2428 undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery. Those undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery had a 3-fold increased prevalence of concomitant psychiatric diagnoses compared with the general population (52% vs 17%, respectively; P < .0001). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in the hip arthroscopic surgery group between male and female patients (46% vs 56%, respectively; P = .0061), with depression and anxiety being the 2 most common comorbid conditions. Those undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery also had a significantly increased prevalence of concomitant psychiatric diagnoses versus those undergoing ACL reconstruction (52% vs 28%, respectively; P < .0001) as well as those undergoing shoulder stabilization surgery (52% vs 42%, respectively; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery had an increased prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions compared with the general population as well as those undergoing ACL reconstruction or shoulder stabilization surgery. Depression and anxiety were the most prevalent concomitant psychiatric diagnoses.
