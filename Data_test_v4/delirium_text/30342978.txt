30342978|a|Many gene variants may impair our health and cognitive abilities at old age, but some of them paradoxically improve the same or similar functions at much younger age (antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis). Such a diametric pattern may also hold true for the ancestral Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele, which increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in old age, but may benefit (pre)frontal (executive) functions in young carriers. We therefore investigated potential cognitive benefits of the risk allele on cognitive control capacities and top-down control allocation ("metacontrol") in n = 190 healthy young adults. On a behavioral level, we found young APOE epsilon4 carriers to better adapt to different degrees of cognitive control requirements, with superior performance in case of high control demands. On a neurophysiological level, these group differences were reflected by modulations of the N450 component, which were rooted in activation differences of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG, BA8). Taken together, our results suggest that young epsilon4 carriers are more efficient than non-carriers at allocating cognitive control resources based on the actual task requirements (i.e. metacontrol), as they seem to experience less conflict/exert less effort and recruit fewer additional prefrontal areas when task set complexity increases. We further found that epsilon2 carriers processed implicit spatial stimulus features to a stronger degree than epsilon3 and epsilon4 carriers, but failed to benefit from this, as the additional information likely increased response selection conflicts. This finding should however be treated with ample caution as the group of epsilon2 carriers was comparatively small.
