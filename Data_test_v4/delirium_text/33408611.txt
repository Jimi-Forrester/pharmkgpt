33408611|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the extent to which sleep quality associated with plasma Abeta levels in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) elderly. METHODS: A total of 172 cognitively normal (NC) elderly and 133 aMCI elderly were included in this study. For the evaluation of sleep quality, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used. Levels of plasma Abeta were determined by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Multivariable linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate associations between sleep quality and plasma Abeta levels after adjusting potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared to NC subjects, participants with aMCI had a higher global PSQI score (8.72 +- 3.87 vs. 7.10 +- 3.07, p < 0.001). The global PSQI score was positively associated with plasma Abeta42 level in the aMCI group (beta = 0.063, 95% CI 0.001-0.125, and p = 0.049) but not in the NC group (p > 0.05). Additionally, a higher global PSQI score was associated with a higher plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in both NC (beta = 0.010, 95% CI 0.003-0.016, and p = 0.003) and aMCI groups (beta = 0.012, 95% CI 0.005-0.018, and p < 0.001). The association between global PSQI score and plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was stronger in individuals with aMCI relative to the NC subjects (beta = 0.076 vs. 0.030, p for interaction = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality was associated with plasma Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, with a stronger effect among individuals with aMCI. A better understanding of the role of sleep in plasma Abeta levels in aMCI patients could lead to effective sleep-based intervention against the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
