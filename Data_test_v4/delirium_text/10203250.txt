10203250|t|No association between the alpha-2 macroglobulin I1000V polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease.
10203250|a|Recent reports have suggested that variability in the alpha2-macroglobulin gene is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Here we have both tested a common polymorphism in the gene (I1000V) for association with the disease in a four-site case control study design, and tested the locus for linkage in a large series of sibpairs afflicted with late onset disease. Our results fail to show an association between this polymorphism and disease.
