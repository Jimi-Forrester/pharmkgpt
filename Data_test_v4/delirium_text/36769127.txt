36769127|t|Precision Medicine in Glaucoma: Artificial Intelligence, Biomarkers, Genetics and Redox State.
36769127|a|Glaucoma is a multifactorial neurodegenerative illness requiring early diagnosis and strict monitoring of the disease progression. Current exams for diagnosis and prognosis are based on clinical examination, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, visual field tests, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). In this scenario, there is a critical unmet demand for glaucoma-related biomarkers to enhance clinical testing for early diagnosis and tracking of the disease's development. The introduction of validated biomarkers would allow for prompt intervention in the clinic to help with prognosis prediction and treatment response monitoring. This review aims to report the latest acquisitions on biomarkers in glaucoma, from imaging analysis to genetics and metabolic markers.
