36230993|t|Targeting Mast Cells in Allergic Disease: Current Therapies and Drug Repurposing.
36230993|a|The incidence of allergic disease has grown tremendously in the past three generations. While current treatments are effective for some, there is considerable unmet need. Mast cells are critical effectors of allergic inflammation. Their secreted mediators and the receptors for these mediators have long been the target of allergy therapy. Recent drugs have moved a step earlier in mast cell activation, blocking IgE, IL-4, and IL-13 interactions with their receptors. In this review, we summarize the latest therapies targeting mast cells as well as new drugs in clinical trials. In addition, we offer support for repurposing FDA-approved drugs to target mast cells in new ways. With a multitude of highly selective drugs available for cancer, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders, drug repurposing offers optimism for the future of allergy therapy.
