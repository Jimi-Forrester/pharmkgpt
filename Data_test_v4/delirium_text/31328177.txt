31328177|a|Serum pro-inflammatory markers may contribute to dementia pathophysiology and cognitive impairment. In a population-representative birth cohort, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and white cell count (WCC) were measured at age 60-64 years and cognition was assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-III) at age 69 years. Higher baseline CRP and IL-6 were associated with lower ACE-III scores, but associations were attenuated on adjustment for educational attainment, sex, and other modifiable life course factors. No associations were found for CRP, IL-6, and WCC with visual search speed or verbal memory. In conclusion, the relationship between increased baseline systemic inflammation and poorer cognition in later life may be explained by, or share pathways with, education and other modifiable life course factors.
