24685291|a|Over the last few years, advances in neuroimaging have generated biomarkers, which increase diagnostic certainty, provide valuable information about prognosis, and suggest a particular pathology underlying the clinical dementia syndrome. We aim to review the evidence for use of already established imaging modalities, along with selected techniques that have a great potential to guide clinical decisions in the future. We discuss structural, functional and molecular imaging, focusing on the most common dementias: Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular dementia. Finally, we stress the importance of conducting research using representative cohorts and in a naturalistic set up, in order to build a strong evidence base for translating imaging methods for a National Health Service. If we assess a broad range of patients referred to memory clinic with a variety of imaging modalities, we will make a step towards accumulating robust evidence and ultimately closing the gap between the dramatic advances in neurosciences and meaningful clinical applications for the maximum benefit of our patients.
