38487969|t|Lutein and the Underlying Neuroprotective Promise against Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38487969|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are the two most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases with limited knowledge on their cause and, presently, have no cure. There is an existence of multiple treatment methods that target only the symptoms temporarily and do not stop the progression or prevent the onset of disease. Neurodegeneration is primarily attributed to the natural process of aging and the deleterious effects of heightened oxidative stress within the brain, whether via direct or indirect mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that certain nutritional aspects play a crucial role in the prevention and management of neurodegenerative diseases. Lutein, a dietary carotenoid, has been studied for its antioxidant properties for more than a decade with several applications against age-related macular degeneration. It is high antioxidant potential and selective accumulation in the brain makes it a versatile compound for combatting various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the studies exhibiting neuroprotective properties of lutein against neurodegenerative conditions, more specifically AD and PD in various model systems as well as clinical observations have been reviewed. Accordingly, the concerns associated with lutein absorption and potential strategies to improve its bioavailability have been discussed.
