30621606|t|Consensus and evidence-based medication review to optimize and potentially reduce psychotropic drug prescription in institutionalized dementia patients.
30621606|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia patients often show neuropsychiatric symptoms, known as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These are a common motive for medical consultations, hospitalizations, and nursing home stays. Various studies have suggested that the high prevalence of psychotropic drug use to treat BPSD in institutionalized dementia patients may lead to impaired cognitive capacity, rigidity, somnolence, and other complications during the course of the illness. The aim of this study was to design a consensus-based intervention between care levels to optimize and potentially reduce prescription of psychotropic drugs in institutionalized patients with dementia and assess the changes occurring following its implementation. METHODS: Design: Prospective, quasi-experimental, pre/post intervention, multicenter study. SCOPE: 7 nursing homes associated with a single primary care team. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Institutionalized patients diagnosed with dementia and under treatment with 1 or more psychotropic drugs for at least 3 months. SAMPLE: 240 individuals; mean age, 87 years (SD: 6.795); 75% (180) women. INTERVENTION: Creation of evidence-based therapeutic guidelines for psychotropic drug use in the treatment of BPSD by consensus between reference professionals. Joint review (primary care and geriatric care nursing home professionals) of the medication based on the guidelines and focusing on individual patient needs. Primary variable: Number of psychotropic drugs used per patient. ASSESSMENT: Preintervention, immediate postintervention, and at 1 and 6 months. RESULTS: Overall, the number of psychotropic drugs prescribed was reduced by 28% (from 636 before to 458 after the intervention). The mean number of psychotropic drugs prescribed per patient decreased from 2.71 at baseline to 1.95 at 1 month postintervention and 2.01 at 6 months (p < 0.001 for both time points). Antipsychotics were the drug class showing the highest reduction rate (49.66%). Reintroduction of discontinued psychotropic drugs was 2% at 1 month following the intervention and 12% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A consensus guidelines-based therapeutic intervention with a patient-centered medication review by a multidisciplinary team led to a reduction in prescription of psychotropic drugs in institutionalized dementia patients.
