32726329|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential value of some miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among patients with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to identify other risk factors for MCI among them. METHODS: This study enrolled 163 adults with T2DM using face to face interview. Cognitive function with its domains was assessed using Adenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE III). Lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin, and miR-128, miR-132, miR- 874, miR-134, miR-323, and miR-382 expressions, using quantitative real-time PCR, were assessed. RESULTS: MCI was detected among 59/163 (36.2%) patients with T2DM. Plasma expression of miR-132 was significantly higher in T2DM patients with MCI compared to those without MCI and to normal cognitive healthy individuals (median = 2, 1.1 and 1.2 respectively, P < 0.05. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher miR-132 expression with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.3), female gender (AOR:2.1; 95%CI 1.0-4.3), education below postgraduate (secondary and university education with AOR: 9.5 & 19.4 respectively) were the significant predicting factors for MCI among T2DM patients. Using ROC curve, miR-132 was the only assayed miRNA that significantly differentiates T2DM patients with MCI from those with normal cognition with 72.3% sensitivity, 56.2% specificity, and 63.8% accuracy (P < 0.05). Other studied miRNAs showed lower sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI among studied T2DM participants. CONCLUSION: MCI affects nearly one-third of adult patients with T2DM. A significantly over expression of miR-132 was detected among T2DM with MCI compared to those with normal cognition.
