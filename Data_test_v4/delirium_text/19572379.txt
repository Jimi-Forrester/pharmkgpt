19572379|t|Variable-field relaxometry of iron-containing human tissues: a preliminary study.
19572379|a|Excess iron is found in brain nuclei from neurodegenerative patients (with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases) and also in the liver and spleen of cirrhosis, hemochromatosis and thalassaemia patients. Ferritin, the iron-storing protein of mammals, is known to darken T(2)-weighted MR images. Understanding NMR tissue behavior may make it possible to detect those diseases, to follow their evolution and finally to establish a protocol for non-invasive measurement of an organ's iron content using MRI methods. In this preliminary work, the MR relaxation properties of embalmed iron-containing tissues were studied as well as their potential correlation with the iron content of these tissues. Relaxometric measurements (T(1) and T(2)) of embalmed samples of brain nuclei (caudate nucleus, dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, red nucleus and substantia nigra), liver and spleen from six donors were made at different magnetic fields (0.00023-14 T). The influence of the inter-echo time on transverse relaxation was also studied. Moreover, iron content of tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. In brain nuclei, 1/T(2) increases quadratically with the field and depends on the inter-echo time in CPMG sequences at high fields, both features compatible with an outer sphere relaxation theory. In liver and spleen, 1/T(2) increases linearly with the field and depends on the inter-echo time at all fields. In our study, a correlation between 1/T(2) and iron concentration is observed. Explaining the relaxation mechanism for these tissues is likely to require a combination of several models. The value of 1/T(2) at high field could be used to evaluate iron accumulation in vivo. In the future, confirmation of those features is expected to be achieved from measurements of fresh (not embalmed) human tissues.
