38180440|t|The assessment and management of cirrhotic patients with encephalopathy.
38180440|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a debilitating complication associated with both acute and chronic liver injury. It is associated with a greater risk of death than any other significant hepatic decompensation event. It manifests as a wide spectrum of neuropsychological abnormalities ranging from subtle impairments in higher cognitive function, to confusion and coma. The pathophysiological role of ammonia in the development of HE is well known, but there is increasing recognition that the gut microbiome, gut-derived systemic inflammation and development of infection can serve as drivers of HE in patients with cirrhosis. The development of HE portents to the severity of cirrhosis and the prognosis is poor without liver transplantation. A referral for liver transplantation should therefore be considered early in those who are eligible. This review covers the pragmatic assessment of HE in patients with cirrhosis, as well as the current evidence base for the best practice management of HE in such patients.
