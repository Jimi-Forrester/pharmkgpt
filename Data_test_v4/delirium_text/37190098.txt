37190098|t|A Preliminary Study of Mild Heat Stress on Inflammasome Activation in Murine Macrophages.
37190098|a|Inflammation and mitochondrial-dependent oxidative stress are interrelated processes implicated in multiple neuroinflammatory disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Exposure to elevated temperature (hyperthermia) is proposed as a non-pharmacological, anti-inflammatory treatment for these disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we asked if the inflammasome, a protein complex essential for orchestrating the inflammatory response and linked to mitochondrial stress, might be modulated by elevated temperatures. To test this, in preliminary studies, immortalized bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages (iBMM) were primed with inflammatory stimuli, exposed to a range of temperatures (37-41.5  C), and examined for markers of inflammasome and mitochondrial activity. We found that exposure to mild heat stress (39  C for 15 min) rapidly inhibited iBMM inflammasome activity. Furthermore, heat exposure led to decreased ASC speck formation and increased numbers of polarized mitochondria. These results suggest that mild hyperthermia inhibits inflammasome activity in the iBMM, limiting potentially harmful inflammation and mitigating mitochondrial stress. Our findings suggest an additional potential mechanism by which hyperthermia may exert its beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases.
