35667743|a|Neurologic complications can be seen in mild to severe COVID-19 with a higher risk in patients with severe COVID-19. These can occur as a direct consequence of viral infection or consequences of treatments. The spectrum ranges from non-life-threatening, like headache, fatigue, malaise, anosmia, dysgeusia, to life-threatening complications, like stroke, encephalitis, coma, Guillain-Barre syndrome. A high index of suspicion can aid in early recognition and treatment. Outcomes depend on severity of underlying COVID-19, patient age, comorbidities, and severity of the complication. Postacute sequelae of COVID-19 range from fatigue, headache, dysosmia, brain fog, anxiety, depression to an overlap with postintensive care syndrome.
