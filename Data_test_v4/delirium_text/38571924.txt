38571924|a|Aim: To evaluate how effective a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is for changing key physical measurements such as weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), and fat mass (FM) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who were obese or overweight. Methods: Several online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science (WOS), were searched systematically to find relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up until June 2023. The Q-test and I2 statistics were used to assess the level of heterogeneity among the included studies. The data were then combined using either a fixed or random effects model and presented as a weighted mean difference (WMD) along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Of the 682 citations, 11 RCTs were included. The pooled results showed a significant decrease in the WMD of weight levels [WMD = -9.13 kg; 95% CI, -11.88, -6.39, P < 0.001; I2 = 87.23%] following KD. Moreover, KD significantly reduced BMI levels [WMD = -2.93 kg/m2; 95% CI, -3.65, -2.21, P < 0.001; I2 = 78.81%] compared to the controls. Patients with PCOS received KD demonstrated significant decrease in WC [WMD = -7.62 cm; 95% CI, -10.73, -4.50, P < 0.001; I2 = 89.17%] and FM [WMD = -5.32 kg; 95% CI, -7.29, -3.36, P < 0.001; I2 = 83.97%]. Conclusion: KD was associated with lower weight loss (WL) parameters, including weight, BMI, WC, and FM, in obese or overweight women with PCOS, highlighting the significance of physicians and nurses in taking care of the nutritional needs of overweight/obese patients with PCOS.
