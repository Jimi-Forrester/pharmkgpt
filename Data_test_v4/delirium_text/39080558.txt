39080558|t|The individual and combined impacts of pre-existing diabetes and dementia on ischemic stroke outcomes: a registry-based cohort study.
39080558|a|BACKGROUND: Individually, diabetes mellitus and dementia are associated with poorer outcomes after stroke. However, the combined impact of these pre-existing factors on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) outcomes has not been examined. METHODS: All consecutive patients with AIS admitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals between 2003 and 2016 (catchment population ~ 900,000) were divided into four groups: those with neither diabetes nor dementia (reference), with diabetes without dementia, with dementia without diabetes, and with both co-morbidities. In-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LoS), and disability outcomes were analysed using logistic regressions. Post-discharge mortality and recurrence were assessed using Cox regressions. Additionally, interaction terms were added to the models for the short-term outcomes and long-term mortality to test for synergistic effects of diabetes and dementia. Models were adjusted for age, sex, Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, comorbidities, hematological and biochemical measures, and antithrombotic medications. RESULTS: The cohort was 10,812 patients with 52% females and a median age of 80. The median follow-up was 3.8 years for stroke recurrence and 5.5 years for mortality. No significant differences between the four groups existed for in-hospital mortality and post-stroke disability. Patients with dementia had significantly longer LoS (OR 2.25 [95% CI: 1.34-3.77] and 1.31 [1.02-1.68] with and without diabetes, respectively). Patients with both comorbidities had the highest risk of stroke recurrence (HR 2.06 [1.12-3.77]), followed by those with only dementia (1.59 [1.15-2.20]) and only diabetes (1.25 [1.06-1.49]). Similarly, the patient group with both diabetes and dementia had the highest long-term mortality risk (1.76 [1.33-2.37]). The hazard ratios for patients with only dementia and only diabetes were 1.71 [1.46-2.01] and 1.19 [1.08-1.32], respectively. No significant interactions were seen between diabetes and dementia with regards to their effects on the outcomes. CONCLUSION: Individual and cumulative impacts of the two conditions on long-term mortality and stroke recurrence were notable. However, no synergistic impact of the two comorbidities were seen on the stroke outcomes tested in our study. Therefore, tailoring the management of stroke patients based on additional requirements associated with each pre-existing condition will be more impactful towards improving outcomes.
