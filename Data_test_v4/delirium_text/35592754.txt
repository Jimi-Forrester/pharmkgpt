35592754|t|Serum 25(OH)D Levels Modify the Association between Triglyceride and IR: A Cross-Sectional Study.
35592754|a|Background: Triglycerides and 25(OH)D had been reported as correlates of IR, but the results suggest substantial heterogeneity across races. In addition, little research reported on whether different 25(OH)D levels affect triglycerides and IR. Therefore, a similar study on the US population would be a great addition to the current one. This study investigated the association between triglycerides and IR at different 25(OH)D levels. Methods: A total of 19,926 participants were included, each containing specific indicators for the study project. IR was estimated as a HOMA-IR index >=2.73. Four multivariate logistic regression models were developed to analyze the association between TG and IR and whether different 25(OH)D levels influenced this association. Smoothed fitting curves were plotted. Results: Triglyceride was significantly associated with IR (OR: 1.3, 95 CI %), while this association received different 25(OH)D levels (P for interaction <0.001). The effect value OR was 1.33 with the high levels, and its effect value OR was 1.28 with the low levels. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that triglyceride levels are significantly associated with insulin in the US adult population and can be used as a predictor of IR. This correlation was compromised at different 25 (OH)D levels, so future studies need to be explored in more ethnically diverse contexts.
