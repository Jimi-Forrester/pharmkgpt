35412431|a|Endothelial dysfunction is an important mechanism involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We aimed to explore the effects of Oxycodone on myocardial I/R injury in vivo and in vitro to reveal its mechanisms related to Sigma-1 Receptor (SIGMAR1). A rat model of I/R-induced myocardial injury was developed. The ischemic area and myocardial histopathological changes after oxycodone addition were evaluated by TTC staining and H&E staining. LDH, CK-MB and cTnI levels were used to assess myocardial function. Then, the endothelial integrity was reflected by the expressions of ZO-1, Claudin-1 and Occludin. Afterward, ELISA, RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assays were adopted for the detection of inflammation-related genes. SIGMAR1 expression in myocardial tissues induced by I/R and cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) under hypoxic/reoxygenation (H/R) was determined using RT-qPCR and western blotting. Subsequently, after SIGMAR1 silencing or BD1047 addition (a SIGMAR1 antagonist), cell apoptosis and endothelial integrity were analyzed in the presence of Oxycodone in H/R-stimulated CMECs. Results indicated that Oxycodone decreased the ischemic area and improved myocardial function in myocardial I/R injury rat. Oxycodone improved myocardial histopathological injury and elevated endothelial integrity, evidenced by upregulated ZO-1, Claudin-1 and Occludin expressions. Moreover, inflammatory response was alleviated after Oxycodone administration. Molecular docking suggested that SIGMAR1 could directly bind to Oxycodone. Oxycodone elevated SIGMAR1 expression and SIGMAR1 deletion or BD1047 addition attenuated the impacts of Oxycodone on apoptosis and endothelial integrity of CMECs induced by H/R. Collectively, Oxycodone alleviates myocardial I/R injury in vivo and in vitro by binding to SIGMAR1.
