24404923|t|Intranasal therapeutic strategies for management of Alzheimer's disease.
24404923|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive age-related irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that represents 70% of all dementia with 35 million cases worldwide. Successful treatment strategies for AD have so far been limited, and present therapy is based on cholinergic replacement therapy and inhibiting glutamate excitotoxicity. In this context, role of neuroprotective drugs has generated considerable interest in management of AD. Recently, direct intranasal (IN) delivery of drug moieties to the central nervous system (CNS) has emerged as a therapeutically viable alternative to oral and parenteral routes. IN delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier by delivering and targeting drugs to the CNS along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways which are in direct contact with both the environment and the CNS. In an attempt to understand how neurotherapeutics/nanoparticulate delivery systems can be transported from the nose to the CNS, the present review sets out to discuss the mechanism of transport from nose to brain. The aim of this review is to discuss and summarize the latest findings of some of the major studies on IN drug delivery in AD models, with a focus on the potential efficacy of neuroprotective treatments.
