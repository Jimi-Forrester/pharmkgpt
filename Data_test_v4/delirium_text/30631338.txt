30631338|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric manifestations of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) have not been studied in a systematic way. AIM: To study the spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with iNPH. PATIENT SELECTION AND EVALUATION: Patients attending 3 different tertiary care centers during three consecutive time periods spanning from 2010 to 2015 were analyzed for neuropsychiatric manifestations. Patients diagnosed as having probable or possible iNPH as per the consensus criteria were included in the study. Neuropsychiatric manifestations were captured by a comprehensive inventory (Cambridge Behavioral Inventory, CBI). RESULTS: The CBI score was available for 41 patients. The mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 15.37 (SD 7.2) and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination score was 34.95 (SD 19.67), thereby indicating cognitively advanced iNPH. All patients had impairment in one or more items on the CBI. The mean score was 55.46 (SD 27) out of 180, thereby indicating a mild degree of impairment. Among the subscores, impairment with motivation was the most observed abnormality followed by memory impairment. When the CBI total score and subscores were compared, all of them (except motivation) were higher for Alzheimer's disease; however, none was statistically significant. Even though the motivation score was higher for iNPH, the difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that neurobehavioral abnormalities are common in patients with cognitively advanced normal pressure hydrocephalus. However, the intensity of involvement appeared less when compared to Alzheimer's disease. Apathy appears to be the most common impairment.
