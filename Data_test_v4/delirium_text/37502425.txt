37502425|a|Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is common in the late stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can lead to disability and impacts the quality of life. Therefore, early recognition is crucial for therapeutic intervention. We aimed to explore the abnormal regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) in FOG converters and evaluate their diagnostic values. Methods: The data downloaded from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Markers Project (PPMI) cohort was subdivided into PD-FOG converters (n = 16) and non-converters (n = 17) based on whether FOG appeared during the 3-year follow-up; 16 healthy controls were well-matched. ReHo and FC analyses were used to explore the variations in spontaneous activity and interactions between significant regions among three groups of baseline data. Correlations between clinical variables and the altered ReHo values were assessed in FOG converter group. Last, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to predict diagnostic value. Results: Compared with the non-converters, FOG converters had reduced ReHo in the bilateral medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed), which was negatively correlated with the postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) score. ReHo within left amygdala/olfactory cortex/putamen (AMYG/OLF/PUT) was decreased, which was correlated with anxiety and autonomic dysfunction. Also, increased ReHo in the left supplementary motor area/paracentral lobule was positively correlated with the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder screening questionnaire. FOG converters exhibited diminished FC in the basal ganglia, limbic area, and cognitive control cortex, as compared with non-converters. The prediction model combined ReHo of basal ganglia and limbic area, with PIGD score was the best predictor of FOG conversion. Conclusion: The current results suggested that abnormal ReHo and FC in the basal ganglia, limbic area, and cognitive control cortex may occur in the early stage of FOG. Basal ganglia and limbic area dysfunction combined with higher PIGD score are useful for the early recognition of FOG conversion.
