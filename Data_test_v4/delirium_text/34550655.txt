Clinically, AD is characterized by progressive memory loss. Moreover, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, apathy or depression are frequently present, and may overlay cognitive dysfunction in early AD. There is a broad consensus in the research community that early stages of AD offer a promising window of opportunity for potential therapeutic intervention. Recent studies also suggest that a healthy and active lifestyle has a significant preventive effect. By supporting the patient in lifestyle and health management, the treating physician can make a relevant contribution to the prevention of AD.
