32545604|a|Lack of disease-modifying therapy against epileptogenesis reflects the complexity of the disease pathogenesis as well as the high demand to explore novel treatment strategies. In the pursuit of developing new therapeutic strategies against epileptogenesis, neurodegenerative proteins have recently gained increased attention. Owing to the fact that neurodegenerative disease and epileptogenesis possibly share a common underlying mechanism, targeting neurodegenerative proteins against epileptogenesis might represent a promising therapeutic approach. Herein, we review the association of neurodegenerative proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta (Abeta), and tau protein, with epilepsy. Providing insight into the alpha-synuclein, Abeta and tau protein-mediated neurodegeneration mechanisms, and their implication in epileptogenesis will pave the way towards the development of new agents and treatment strategies.
