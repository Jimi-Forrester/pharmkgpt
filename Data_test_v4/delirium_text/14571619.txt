METHODS: The experimental AD model of rats was improved and established by combined injection of beta-amyloid protein (beta-AP) to lateral ventricle and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) to brain. The learning and memory function of the model rats were tested by step-through test and water-maze test, and the number and cross area of beta-AP deposited macula in cerebral cortex and CA1 region of hippocampus were estimated quantitatively using immunohistochemical method and image pattern analysis. RESULTS: The improved AD animal model showed both the specificity of behavior (learning and memory impairments) and the typical pathological specificity (beta-AP deposited macula). ZNC could effectively improve the impairment of learning and memory and reduce the number and cross area of beta-AP deposited macula in cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1 region in the AD model rats. CONCLUSION: The AD rat model induced by the combined injection of beta-AP and TGF beta 1 is a good animal model simulated to the clinical reality, which could be used to screen and evaluate the anti-dementia agents. ZNC could display anti-dementia effect of the AD model rats.
