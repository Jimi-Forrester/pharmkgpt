34942871|a|Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), despite being a hepatotropic virus, is the causative agent of many systemic disorders, such as vasculitis, autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Although symptoms have been misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, only recently, evidence of direct (inflammatory) or indirect (immune-mediated) HCV-dependent cerebral effects has been established. HCV infection can promote acute inflammatory response, pro-coagulative status and ischemic disorders, and neurodegeneration. These effects rely on cerebral HCV replication, possibly mediated by blood-brain barrier alterations. Further study is needed to better understand the HCV-related mechanisms of brain damage.
