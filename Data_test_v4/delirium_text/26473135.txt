26473135|t|Efficacy and Safety of Low Dose Ketamine and Midazolam Combination for Diagnostic Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in Children.
26473135|a|PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the effectiveness and safety of low-dose midazolam and ketamine combination for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) in children. METHODS: The study included the children (n=425, 10.78+-3.81 years) who underwent UGIE for diagnostic purpose during 1 year period. All children were sedated with low dose midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously. Effectiveness of the sedation and complications during the procedure and recovery period were recorded. RESULTS: Endoscopic procedure was successfully completed in 414 patients (97.4%; 95% confidence interval, 95.8-98.9). Mean+-standard deviation (SD) duration of procedure was 6.36+-1.64 minutes (median, 6.0 minutes; range, 4-12 minutes). Minor complications occurred during the procedure in 39.2% of the patients. The most common complication was increased oral secretion (33.1%). No major complications were observed in any patient. Age and Ramsay sedation scores of patients with complications during the procedure were lower than the others (9.49+-4.05 years vs. 11.61+-3.43 years, p=0.002 and 2.10+-1.46 vs. 4.37+-1.16, p=0.001). Mean recovery time was 22 minutes (range, 10-90 minutes; mean+-SD, 25+-12.32 minutes). Minor complications developed during recovery in 60.1% of the patients. The most common complication was transient double vision (n=127, 30.7%). Emergence reaction was observed in 5 patients (1.2%). CONCLUSION: The procedure was completed with high level of success without any major complication in our study. Combination of low-dose midazolam and ketamine is a suitable sedation protocol for pediatric endoscopists in UGIE.
