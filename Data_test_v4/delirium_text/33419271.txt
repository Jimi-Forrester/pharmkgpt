33419271|a|Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) represents a cluster of various vascular disorders with different pathological backgrounds. The advanced vasculature net of cerebral vessels, including small arteries, capillaries, arterioles and venules, is usually affected. Processes of oxidation underlie the pathology of CSVD, promoting the degenerative status of the epithelial layer. There are several classifications of cerebral small vessel diseases; some of them include diseases such as Binswanger's disease, leukoaraiosis, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and lacunar strokes. This paper presents the characteristics of CSVD and the impact of the current knowledge of this topic on the diagnosis and treatment of patients.
