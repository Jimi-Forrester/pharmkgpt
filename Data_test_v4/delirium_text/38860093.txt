38860093|t|A Comprehensive Review on Navigating the Neurological Landscape of COVID-19: Insights Into Etiopathogenesis and Clinical Management.
38860093|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a global health crisis with significant neurological implications. While initially characterized by respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 has been increasingly recognized for its diverse neurological manifestations, including encephalopathy, stroke, peripheral neuropathies, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the neurological landscape of COVID-19 is essential for elucidating its pathophysiology, optimizing clinical management, and improving patient outcomes. This comprehensive review provides insights into the etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, management strategies, and prognostic implications of neurological involvement in COVID-19. Mechanistic insights highlight the multifactorial nature of neurological complications involving direct viral invasion, immune-mediated mechanisms, and thrombotic events. Diagnostic challenges underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, while management strategies emphasize early recognition and appropriate intervention. Long-term neurological sequelae and prognostic factors are also examined, emphasizing the need for comprehensive follow-up and rehabilitation services. Finally, recommendations for future research prioritize efforts to elucidate underlying mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and evaluate rehabilitative interventions. By addressing these challenges, we can better understand and mitigate the neurological consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
