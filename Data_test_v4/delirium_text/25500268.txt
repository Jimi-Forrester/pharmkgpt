25500268|t|An alkaline phosphatase transport mechanism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration.
25500268|a|Systemic inflammation is associated with loss of blood-brain barrier integrity and neuroinflammation that lead to the exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. It is also associated specifically with the characteristic amyloid-beta and tau pathologies of Alzheimer's disease. We have previously proposed an immunosurveillance mechanism for epithelial barriers involving negative feedback-regulated alkaline phosphatase transcytosis as an acute phase anti-inflammatory response that hangs in the balance between the resolution and the progression of inflammation. We now extend this model to endothelial barriers, particularly the blood-brain barrier, and present a literature-supported mechanistic explanation for Alzheimer's disease pathology with this system at its foundation. In this mechanism, a switch in the role of alkaline phosphatase from its baseline duties to a stopgap anti-inflammatory function results in the loss of alkaline phosphatase from cell membranes into circulation, thereby decreasing blood-brain barrier integrity and functionality. This occurs with impairment of both amyloid-beta efflux and tau dephosphorylating activity in the brain as alkaline phosphatase is replenished at the barrier by receptor-mediated transport. We suggest systemic alkaline phosphatase administration as a potential therapy for the resolution of inflammation and the prevention of Alzheimer's disease pathology as well as that of other inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.
