35629347|t|The Use of Low-Dose Methadone as Add-On to Ongoing Opioid Treatment in Palliative Cancer Care-An Underrated Treatment?
35629347|a|The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of low-dose methadone treatment in palliative cancer care. In Sweden, methadone is quite common in specialized palliative care, where almost a tenth of patients are prescribed this drug. Negative attitudes towards methadone do not seem to prevent it from being used for pain management, and by starting with low doses and then increasing slowly and gradually, methadone can apparently be introduced safely. It is still uncertain whether methadone has a better analgesic effect than other opioids. However, for pain relief in cancer patients with severe and complex cancer-related pain, NMDA receptor inhibition with methadone may, in selected cases, be an attractive alternative, especially in the form of low-dose supplements to other ongoing opioids. Due to long half-life and complex metabolism, the use of methadone requires an experienced physician and solid follow-up. Continuous administration of opioids, including low-dose methadone, has been proven effective and safe in reducing pain in dying patients without increasing the risk of confusion, regardless of age.
