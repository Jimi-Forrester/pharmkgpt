35064353|t|Adolescent and young adult brain tumors: current topics and review.
35064353|a|The management of brain tumors developed in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) is challenging because of their histological heterogeneity and low incidence. The brain tumor and its treatment interventions can negatively affect neurological, neurocognitive, and endocrinological function, and dramatically affect the circumstances of AYA patients progressing to further education, employment, and marriage. Specific support is thus necessary to maintain the quality of life (QOL) of AYA brain tumor patients. AYA patients and survivors require active intervention and support for returning to school or work, progressing to further education, finding employment, and preserving fertility. Recent cancer genome profiling revealed that AYA gliomas include pediatric- and adult-type genetic alteration. Insights into the biology underlying the distribution of tumors in AYAs may influence the development of prospective trials. A more individualized view of brain tumors may influence stratification of patients' in future clinical studies as well as selection for molecular targeted therapy. Here I review strategies for achieving a better outcome to decrease late effects and improve QOL.
