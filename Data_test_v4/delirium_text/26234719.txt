26234719|t|Interaction of MIF Family Proteins in Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Damage and Their Influence on Clinical Outcome of Cardiac Surgery Patients.
26234719|a|AIMS: Cardiac surgery involves myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) with potentially deleterious consequences. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a stress-regulating chemokine-like cytokine that protects against I/R damage, but functional links with its homolog, d-dopachrome tautomerase (MIF-2), and the circulating soluble receptor CD74 (sCD74) are unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of MIF, MIF-2, sCD74, and MIF genotypes in patients scheduled for elective single or complex surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement. RESULTS: MIF and MIF-2 levels significantly increased intraoperatively, whereas measured sCD74 decreased correspondingly. Circulating sCD74/MIF complexes were detectable in 50% of patients and enhanced MIF antioxidant activity. Intraoperative MIF levels were independently associated with a reduced risk for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) (odds ratio 0.99 [0.98-1.00]; p=0.007). Circulating levels of MIF-2, but not MIF, were associated with an increased frequency of organ dysfunction and predicted the occurrence of AF (area under the curve [AUC]=0.663; p=0.041) and pneumonia (AUC=0.708; p=0.040). Patients with a high-expression MIF genotype exhibited a reduced incidence of organ dysfunction compared with patients with low-expression MIF genotypes (3 vs. 25; p=0.042). INNOVATION: The current study comprehensively highlights the kinetics and clinical relevance of MIF family proteins and the MIF genotype in cardiac surgery patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that increased MIF levels during cardiac surgery feature organ-protective properties during myocardial I/R, while the soluble MIF receptor, sCD74, may enhance MIF antioxidant activity. In contrast, high MIF-2 levels are predictive of the development of organ dysfunction. Importantly, we provide first evidence for a gene-phenotype relationship between variant MIF alleles and clinical outcome in cardiac surgery patients.
