32397080|t|Therapeutic Nanoparticles and Their Targeted Delivery Applications.
32397080|a|Nanotechnology offers many advantages in various fields of science. In this regard, nanoparticles are the essential building blocks of nanotechnology. Recent advances in nanotechnology have proven that nanoparticles acquire a great potential in medical applications. Formation of stable interactions with ligands, variability in size and shape, high carrier capacity, and convenience of binding of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances make nanoparticles favorable platforms for the target-specific and controlled delivery of micro- and macromolecules in disease therapy. Nanoparticles combined with the therapeutic agents overcome problems associated with conventional therapy; however, some issues like side effects and toxicity are still debated and should be well concerned before their utilization in biological systems. It is therefore important to understand the specific properties of therapeutic nanoparticles and their delivery strategies. Here, we provide an overview on the unique features of nanoparticles in the biological systems. We emphasize on the type of clinically used nanoparticles and their specificity for therapeutic applications, as well as on their current delivery strategies for specific diseases such as cancer, infectious, autoimmune, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, ocular, and pulmonary diseases. Understanding of the characteristics of nanoparticles and their interactions with the biological environment will enable us to establish novel strategies for the treatment, prevention, and diagnosis in many diseases, particularly untreatable ones.
