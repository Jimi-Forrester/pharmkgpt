38533435|a|The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on postoperative pain and early cognitive impairment in old male patients, who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). A total of 97 old patients, subjected to LC at the 980 Hospital of the Joint Service Support Force of the People's Liberation Army of China, were randomly divided into two groups, namely the DEX and normal saline groups. Patients in the DEX group received an intravenous infusion of 0.8 microg/kg DEX within 10 min following general anesthesia, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.5 microg/(kg/h). Furthermore, patients in the normal saline group were treated with an equivalent volume of normal saline. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tests at 6 h, 1, 2 and 3 days, postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and postoperative adverse events were recorded for both groups. In addition, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score was utilized to assess the pain level of all patients, while the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) scale was employed to analyze the postoperative recovery results. Therefore, the MoCA score was higher in the DEX group compared with the normal saline group at 6 h and day 1 postoperatively. Additionally, the MMSE score was higher at 6 h postoperatively in the DEX group compared with the normal saline group. Correspondingly, the incidence of POCD was lower in the DEX group compared with the normal saline group at 6 h and day 1, after LC (P<0.05). VAS score in resting state for patients in the DEX group was significantly lower compared with the normal-saline group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the QoR-15 scale score in patients in the DEX group was notably increased compared with the normal saline group on the first and second days after the operation (P<0.05). Overall, the present study verified that the continuous infusion of DEX at a rate of 0.5 microg/(kg/h) during LC could effectively reduce the incidence of early POCD and alleviate postoperative pain in old male patients, thus facilitating postoperative recovery.
