36609810|t|Thalamic pathology in frontotemporal dementia: Predilection for specific nuclei, phenotype-specific signatures, clinical correlates, and practical relevance.
36609810|a|BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) phenotypes are classically associated with distinctive cortical atrophy patterns and regional hypometabolism. However, the spectrum of cognitive and behavioral manifestations in FTD arises from multisynaptic network dysfunction. The thalamus is a key hub of several corticobasal and corticocortical circuits. The main circuits relayed via the thalamic nuclei include the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, the anterior cingulate circuit, and the orbitofrontal circuit. METHODS: In this paper, we have reviewed evidence for thalamic pathology in FTD based on radiological and postmortem studies. Original research papers were systematically reviewed for preferential involvement of specific thalamic regions, for phenotype-associated thalamic disease burden patterns, characteristic longitudinal changes, and genotype-associated thalamic signatures. Moreover, evidence for presymptomatic thalamic pathology was also reviewed. Identified papers were systematically scrutinized for imaging methods, cohort sizes, clinical profiles, clinicoradiological associations, and main anatomical findings. The findings of individual research papers were amalgamated for consensus observations and their study designs further evaluated for stereotyped shortcomings. Based on the limitations of existing studies and conflicting reports in low-incidence FTD variants, we sought to outline future research directions and pressing research priorities. RESULTS: FTD is associated with focal thalamic degeneration. Phenotype-specific thalamic traits mirror established cortical vulnerability patterns. Thalamic nuclei mediating behavioral and language functions are preferentially involved. Given the compelling evidence for considerable thalamic disease burden early in the course of most FTD subtypes, we also reflect on the practical relevance, diagnostic role, prognostic significance, and monitoring potential of thalamic metrics in FTD. CONCLUSIONS: Cardinal manifestations of FTD phenotypes are likely to stem from thalamocortical circuitry dysfunction and are not exclusively driven by focal cortical changes.
