34735712|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has dramatically impacted the global healthcare systems, constantly challenging both research and clinical practice. Although it was initially believed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited merely to the respiratory system, emerging evidence indicates that COVID-19 affects multiple other systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, most of the published clinical studies indicate that the confirmed CNS inflammatory manifestations in COVID-19 patients are meningitis, encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, acute transverse myelitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. In addition, the neuroinflammation along with accelerated neurosenescence and susceptible genetic signatures in COVID-19 patients might prime the CNS to neurodegeneration and precipitate the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Thus, this review provides a critical evaluation and interpretive analysis of existing published preclinical as well as clinical studies on the key molecular mechanisms modulating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration induced by the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the essential age- and gender-dependent impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS of COVID-19 patients are also discussed.
