38212621|t|Folate receptor overexpression induces toxicity in a diet-dependent manner in C. elegans.
38212621|a|Folate receptor (FR) alpha (FOLR1) and beta (FOLR2) are membrane-anchored folate transporters that are expressed at low levels in normal tissues, while their expression is strongly increased in several cancers. Intriguingly, although the function of these receptors in, for example, development and cancer has been studied intensively, their role in aging is still unknown. To address this, we utilized Caenorhabditis elegans, in which FOLR-1 is the sole ortholog of folate receptors. We found that the loss of FOLR-1 does not affect reproduction, physical condition, proteostasis or lifespan, indicating that it is not required for folate transport to maintain health. Interestingly, we found that FOLR-1 is detectably expressed only in uterine-vulval cells, and that the histone-binding protein LIN-53 inhibits its expression in other tissues. Furthermore, whereas knockdown of lin-53 is known to shorten lifespan, we found that the loss of FOLR-1 partially rescues this phenotype, suggesting that elevated folr-1 expression is detrimental for health. Indeed, our data demonstrate that overexpression of folr-1 is toxic, and that this phenotype is dependent on diet. Altogether, this work could serve as a basis for further studies to elucidate the organismal effects of abnormal FR expression in diseases such as cancer.
