33855161|t|Dementia or psychosis precipitated by social isolation? A brief case report in COVID-19 pandemic times.
33855161|a|BACKGROUND: The year 2020 was marked by the pandemic of COVID-19, which abruptly changed the ways of dealing with viral infections and social relationships. Cognitive, emotional, and neurological effects due to infection with this condition, as well as several health damages, are due to social isolation. AIM: To recognize the consequences of and reasons behind forced social isolation and related psychosis symptoms. METHOD: This is a case report of a healthy 70-year-old female patient who began to experience paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations after adopting strict measures that abruptly impacted her routine of activities outside the home, by confining herself at home overnight. The patient has agreed to the publication anonymously and signed an informed consent. RESULTS: The patient required rapid and home treatment with risperidone antipsychotics, and eventually had a total remission of symptoms. The suspicion of dementia or another organic cause was investigated and has so far been ruled out. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the situation was triggered by abrupt and unorganized social isolation during the pandemic. A literature review on the subject was carried out, finding pertinent information about psychosis, social isolation due to COVID-19, and the case described. The patient will follow a careful follow-up with a plan for withdrawal of antipsychotic medication after 6 asymptomatic months with monitoring of demented prodrome. It is necessary to study more about this topic and promote planning in case of a need to adopt extreme measures, such as isolation and lockdown.
