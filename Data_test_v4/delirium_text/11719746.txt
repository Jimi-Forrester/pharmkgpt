11719746|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) have become popular drugs of abuse. Acute overdose with either agent results in a well-recognized syndrome of central nervous system and respiratory depression. Recently, a withdrawal syndrome has been described for GHB. We report a severe form of GBL withdrawal, characterized by delirium, psychosis, autonomic instability, and resistance to benzodiazepine therapy. METHODS: We performed a chart review of consecutive admissions for GBL withdrawal in a regional toxicology treatment center. RESULTS: During a 6-month period, 5 patients presented with severe withdrawal attributed to abrupt GBL discontinuation. Patients manifested tachycardia, hypertension, paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and rapid fluctuations in sensorium. Test results for ethanol and routine drugs of abuse were negative. Initial treatment with high doses of lorazepam proved ineffective. Pentobarbital was then administered, resulting in excellent control of behavioral, autonomic, and psychiatric symptoms and in rapid reduction or avoidance of benzodiazepines. Median hospital stay was 5 days. No patient had respiratory depression or required mechanical ventilation. Patients were discharged on tapering doses of benzodiazepines or pentobarbital and were free of psychotic symptoms at follow-up. CONCLUSION: GBL discontinuation can result in severe withdrawal, necessitating ICU admission. Pentobarbital may be more effective than benzodiazepines at controlling delirium in patients with abnormal vital signs, paranoid delusions, and hallucinations as a result of GBL withdrawal.
