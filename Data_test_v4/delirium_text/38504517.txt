38504517|a|Epidemiological studies show that individuals who carry the relatively uncommon APOE epsilon2 allele rarely develop Alzheimer disease, and if they do they have a later age of onset, milder clinical course, and less severe neuropathological findings. The contrast is especially stark when compared with the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, APOE epsilon4, which has an age of onset several decades earlier, a more aggressive clinical course and more severe neuropathological findings, especially in terms of the amount of amyloid deposition. Here, we demonstrate that brain exposure to APOE2 via a gene therapy approach, which bathes the entire cortical mantle in the gene product after transduction of the ependyma, reduces Abeta plaque deposition, neurodegenerative synaptic loss, and, remarkably, reduces microglial activation in an APP/PS1 mouse model despite continued expression of human APOE4. This result suggests a promising protective effect of exogenous APOE2 and reveals a a cell non-autonomous effect of the protein on microglial activation which we go on to show is similar to plaque associated microglia in the brain of Alzheimer patients who inherit APOE2. These data raise the potential that an APOE2 therapeutic could be effective in Alzheimer disease even in individuals born with the risk epsilon4 allele.
