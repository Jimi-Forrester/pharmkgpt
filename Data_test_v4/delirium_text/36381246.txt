36381246|t|Does the regulation of skeletal muscle influence cognitive function? A scoping review of pre-clinical evidence.
36381246|a|Background: Cognitive impairment is a major challenge for elderlies, as it can progress in a rapid manner and effective treatments are limited. Sarcopenic elderlies have a higher risk of dementia. This scoping review aims to reveal whether muscle is a mediator of cognitive function from pre-clinical evidence. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to Feb 2nd, 2022, using the keywords (muscle) AND (cognition OR dementia OR Alzheimer) AND (mouse OR rat OR animal). The PRISMA guideline was used in this study. Results: A total of 17 pre-clinical studies were selected from 7638 studies. 4 studies reported that muscle atrophy and injury harmed memory, functional factors, and neurons in the brain for rodents with or without Alzheimer's disease (AD). 3 studies observed exercise induced muscle to secrete factors, including lactate, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), and cathepsin B, which plays essential roles in the elevation of cognitive functions and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Muscle-targeted treatments including electrical stimulation and intramuscular injections had effective remote effects on the hippocampus. 6 studies showed that muscle-specific overexpression of scFv59 and Neprilysin, or myostatin knockdown alleviated AD symptoms. 1 study showed that muscle insulin resistance also led to deficient hippocampal neurogenesis in MKR mice. Conclusions: The skeletal muscle is involved in the mediation of cognitive function. The evidence was established by the response in the brain (altered number of neurons, functional factors, and other AD pathological characteristics) with muscle atrophy or injury, muscle secretory factors, and muscle-targeted treatments. The translational potential of this paper: This study summarizes the current evidence in how muscle affects cognition in molecular levels, which supports muscle-specific treatments as potential clinical strategies to prevent cognitive dysfunction.
