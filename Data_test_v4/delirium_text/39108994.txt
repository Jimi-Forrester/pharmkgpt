39108994|a|Understanding the risks in the months following hospital discharge is crucial for healthcare professionals to ensure the need for assistance is met. However, this may be challenging in the case of patients living with a major neurocognitive disorder (PLMNCD). Thus, it is important to incorporate patients' and caregivers' experiences of the transition from hospital to home in the risk assessment. This multiple case study comprised 7 PLMNCD, their caregivers, and occupational therapists. Fifty-four interviews, conducted just before, as well as 3 weeks and 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge, were qualitatively analyzed. Results revealed that risk management during the hospital-to-home transition is a dynamic process aimed at establishing a satisfactory routine while avoiding adverse events. This risk management process, which identifies challenges over time and between stakeholders, involves (a) determining the seriousness and acceptability of risks, (b) reflecting on ways to manage risks, and (c) taking steps to manage risks. This knowledge will help to provide more appropriate care and services that strike a balance between safety and autonomy.
