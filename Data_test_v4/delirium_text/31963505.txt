31963505|t|The Challenge of Modulating Heparan Sulfate Turnover by Multitarget Heparin Derivatives.
31963505|a|This review comes as a part of the special issue "Emerging frontiers in GAGs and mimetics". Our interest is in the manipulation of heparan sulfate (HS) turnover by employing HS mimetics/heparin derivatives that exert pleiotropic effects and are interesting for interfering at multiple levels with pathways in which HS is implicated. Due to the important role of heparanase in HS post-biosynthetic modification and catabolism, we focus on the possibility to target heparanase, at both extracellular and intracellular levels, a strategy that can be applied to many conditions, from inflammation to cancer and neurodegeneration.
