38637739|a|PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest an association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the diverse stages of CKD and the cognitive performance of elderly American adults. METHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 were used. Multivariate adjusted logistic regression, subgroup analysis, and the restricted cubic spline model were used to assess the associations of CKD stage and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with cognitive performance. The measures used to evaluate cognitive function included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, the Animal Fluency test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST). RESULTS: This study included 2234 participants aged >= 60 years. According to the fully adjusted model, stages 3-5 CKD were significantly associated with the CERAD test score (OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.51, 0.97], p = 0.033), the Animal Fluency test score (OR = 0.64, 95% CI [0.48, 0.85], p = 0.005), and the DSST score (OR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.41, 0.88], p = 0.013). In addition, the incidence of poor cognitive function increased with decreasing eGFR, especially for individuals with low and moderate eGFRs. Both the DSST score (p nonlinearity < 0.0001) and the Animal Fluency test score (p nonlinearity = 0.0001) had nonlinear dose-response relationships with the eGFR. However, a linear relationship was shown between the eGFR and CERAD test score (p nonlinearity = 0.073). CONCLUSIONS: CKD, especially stages3-5 CKD, was significantly associated with poor cognitive performance in terms of executive function, learning, processing speed, concentration, and working memory ability. All adults with CKD should be screened for cognitive impairment.
