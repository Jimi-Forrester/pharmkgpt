35585424|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroprotective treatment strategies aiming at interfering with either inflammation or cell death indicate the importance of these mechanisms in the development of brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of minocycline on microglia/macrophage cell activity and its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory impact 14 days after aneurismal SAH in mice. METHODS: Endovascular filament perforation was used to induce SAH in mice. SAH + vehicle-operated mice were used as controls for SAH vehicle-treated mice and SAH + minocycline-treated mice. The drug administration started 4 h after SAH induction and was daily repeated until day 7 post SAH and continued until day 14 every second day. Brain cryosections were immunolabeled for Iba1 to detect microglia/macrophages and NeuN to visualize neurons. Phagocytosis assay was performed to determine the microglia/macrophage activity status. Apoptotic cells were stained using terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to estimate cytokine gene expression. RESULTS: We observed a significantly reduced phagocytic activity of microglia/macrophages accompanied by a lowered spatial interaction with neurons and reduced neuronal apoptosis achieved by minocycline administration after SAH. Moreover, the SAH-induced overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuronal cell death was markedly attenuated by the compound. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline treatment may be implicated as a therapeutic approach with long-term benefits in the management of secondary brain injury after SAH in a clinically relevant time window.
