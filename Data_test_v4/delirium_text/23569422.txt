23569422|t|Propofol-induced protection of SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide is associated with the HO-1 via the ERK pathway.
23569422|a|Propofol (2, 6-diisopropylphenol), is an anesthetic and routinely used for the humans sedation during surgery. The potent inducers of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant stress responsive to propofol were investigated. First, a dose of 25-100 microM propofol showed no significant cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells and pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with propofol (25-100 muM) for 8h prevented cell death and maintained cell integrity following exposure to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide by MTT assays. Then, an increase in the generation of ROS following hydrogen peroxide treatment was significantly attenuated by 8 h pre-treatment with propofol. Additionally, the potential roles of ERK, p 38 MAPK and JNK in the regulation of propofol-induced endogenous HO-1 expression in SH-SY5Y cells were estimated by Western blotting assays. Results showed that propofol significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, p 38 MAPK and JNK and antioxidant stress responsive to propofol was attenuated by the inhibition of ERK signaling biochemical inhibitors. These results suggest that the ERK pathway plays an important role in the regulation of propofol-mediated antioxidant effects in SH-SY5Y cells.
