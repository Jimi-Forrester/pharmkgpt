37877698|a|Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a class of rare hematological malignancies that result in the overproduction of myeloid lineage cells. These malignancies result in increased cytokine production and inflammation, which correlate with worsened symptom burden and prognosis. Other than bone marrow transplantation, there is no cure for myeloproliferative neoplasms. As such, treatments focus on reducing thrombotic risk, inflammation, and symptom burden. Because current pharmacological treatments carry significant side effects, there is a need to explore low-risk therapies that may modulate inflammation and alleviate symptom burden. One potential way to achieve this is adherence to a Mediterranean (MED) diet, which is rich in anti-inflammatory foods, reduces inflammatory biomarkers, and beneficially alters the gut microbiome. We performed a 15-week clinical trial of 28 individuals with MPN who were randomized to dietary counseling based on either a Mediterranean diet or standard U.S. Guidelines for Americans. Our primary objective was to determine whether MPN patients could adopt a Mediterranean eating pattern when supported with dietician counseling. As exploratory endpoints, we investigated the impact of diet and inflammation on the gut microbiome. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we found that microbiome diversity and composition were stable throughout the study duration in both cohorts. Furthermore, we discovered significant differences in the microbiomes between MPN subtypes, such as increased beta-dispersion in subjects with myelofibrosis. Lastly, we found several significant correlations between the abundance of multiple bacterial taxa and cytokine levels. Together, this study provides insight into the interaction between diet, inflammation, and the gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome serves as an interface between the host and the diet. Diet and the gut microbiome both play important roles in managing inflammation, which is a key aspect of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Studies have shown that a Mediterranean (MED) diet can reduce inflammation. Therefore, we longitudinally characterized the gut microbiomes of MPN patients in response to Mediterranean or standard 2020 US Guidelines for Americans dietary counseling to determine whether there were microbiome-associated changes in inflammation. We did not find significant changes in the gut microbiome associated with diet, but we did find several associations with inflammation. This research paves the way for future studies by identifying potential mechanistic targets implicated in inflammation within the MPN gut microbiome.
