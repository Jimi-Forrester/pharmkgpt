31593732|a|The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of selenium-chondroitin sulfate nanoparticles (CS@Se) on multi-target-directed therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CS@Se nanoparticles were successfully synthesized, and their therapeutic effects were studied in in vitro AD models. CS@Se effectively inhibited amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and protected SH-SY5Y cells from Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, CS@Se significantly decreased okadaic acid-induced actin cytoskeleton instability in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, CS@Se decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The Western blot results indicated that CS@Se attenuated the hyperphosphorylation of tau (Ser396/Ser404) by regulating the expression of GSK-3beta. In summary, this study demonstrated that CS@Se could inhibit the aggregation of Abeta, reduce damage to the cytoskeleton, mitigate oxidative stress and attenuate the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. CS@Se might be a potent multi-functional agent for the treatment of AD and thus warrants further research and evaluation.
