38256144|a|As the global population ages, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is steadily on the rise. PD demonstrates chronic and progressive characteristics, and many cases can transition into dementia. This increases societal and economic burdens, emphasizing the need to find effective treatments. Among the widely recognized causes of PD is the abnormal accumulation of proteins, and autophagy dysfunction accelerates this accumulation. The resultant Lewy bodies are also commonly found in Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting an increased potential for the onset of dementia. Additionally, the production of free radicals due to mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to neuronal damage and degeneration. The activation of astrocytes and the M1 phenotype of microglia promote damage to dopamine neurons. The drugs currently used for PD only delay the clinical progression and exacerbation of the disease without targeting its root cause, and come with various side effects. Thus, there is a demand for treatments with fewer side effects, with much potential offered by natural products. In this study, we reviewed a total of 14 articles related to herbal medicines and natural products and investigated their relevance to possible PD treatment. The results showed that the reviewed herbal medicines and natural products are effective against lysosomal disorder, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, key mechanisms underlying PD. Therefore, natural products and herbal medicines can reduce neurotoxicity and might improve both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD. Furthermore, these products, with their multi-target effects, enhance bioavailability, inhibit antibiotic resistance, and might additionally eliminate side effects, making them good alternative therapies for PD treatment.
