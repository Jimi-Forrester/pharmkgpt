7833797|t|Content and fatty acid composition of cardiolipin in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
7833797|a|The frontal, temporal and occipital cortex from human brains affected by Alzheimer's disease were analyzed for their contents and fatty acid compositions of cardiolipin. Phospholipids were purified using an HPLC system and cardiolipin was found to be present in the same amount (on a protein basis) as in age-matched controls. One-third of the total fatty acyl moieties of this phospholipid were saturated, one-third monounsaturated and one-third polyunsaturated. In affected brain regions the levels of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids displayed moderate decreases, not exceeding 10-15%. However, the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased by only 9%. These results demonstrate that the amount and structure of brain cardiolipin are not modified to any great extent in connection with Alzheimer's disease.
