10093576|a|HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 73-year-old woman in renal failure for the past 22 years had been on haemodialysis for 16 years. Because of hyperphosphataemia and peptic ulcers she had been on aluminium-containing antacids with a total intake over time of about 8 kg "pure" aluminium. Over the past 11 years she had biphasic symptoms of death anxieties and depression. She also had amnesic aphasia and some extrapyramidal symptoms as well as generalized convulsive seizures and recurrent falls. INVESTIGATIONS: Cranial computed tomography merely revealed signs of a microangiopathy and an age-related decrease in brain volume. The EEG showed intermittent changes while the CSF and ECG were unremarkable. There was no benzodiazepine or ethanol in the blood. TREATMENT AND COURSE: After excluding stroke with secondary epilepsy, uraemic encephalopathy was assumed to be the cause of the severe organic psychiatric syndrome. In the last few days before her death the patient had disturbance of consciousness and of breathing. She died during grotesque tossing movements, thought to be due to a brain stem stroke. Autopsy revealed high-grade myocardial hypertrophy caused by the hypertension, contracted kidney of vascular cause, hyperplasia of the parathyroid and calcification of the renal parenchyma as a sign of secondary parathyroidism. The CNS showed severe dialysis-associated encephalopathy with characteristic argyrophilic, aluminium-induced lysosomal intracytoplasmic inclusions in the choroid plexus epithelium, cortical glia and numerous neuron populations. Laser microprobe mass analysis (LAMMA) confirmed manifold increase in subcellular aluminium content, especially in the neuronal cytoplasm, also demonstrated by atom absorption spectrometry. Additional distinct deposition of beta A4-amyloid, typical of Alzheimer's disease, was probably age-related rather than associated with the dialysis and the aluminium uptake. CONCLUSION: Dialysis-associated encephalopathy must be taken into account as a possible cause of aetiologically uncertain neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients on chronic haemodialysis.
