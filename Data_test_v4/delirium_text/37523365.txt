37523365|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease has been identified as a risk factor for severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. However, whether the significant high risk of death from COVID-19 in people with Parkinson's disease is specific to the disease itself or driven by other concomitant and known risk factors such as comorbidities, age, and frailty remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical profiles and outcomes of people with Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes who tested positive for COVID-19 in the hospital setting in a multicentre UK-based study. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of Parkinson's disease patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test admitted to hospital between February 2020 and July 2021. An online survey was used to collect data from clinical care records, recording patient, Parkinson's disease and COVID-19 characteristics. Associations with time-to-mortality and severe outcomes were analysed using either the Cox proportional hazards model or logistic regression models, as appropriate. RESULTS: Data from 552 admissions were collected: 365 (66%) male; median (inter-quartile range) age 80 (74-85) years. The 34-day all-cause mortality rate was 38.4%; male sex, increased age and frailty, Parkinson's dementia syndrome, requirement for respiratory support and no vaccination were associated with increased mortality risk. Community-acquired COVID-19 and co-morbid chronic neurological disorder were associated with increased odds of requiring respiratory support. Hospital-acquired COVID-19 and delirium were associated with requiring an increase in care level post-discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This first, multicentre, UK-based study on people with Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonian syndromes, hospitalised with COVID-19, adds and expands previous findings on clinical profiles and outcomes in this population.
