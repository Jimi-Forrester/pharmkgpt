7897395|a|Concentrations of APP-like immunoreactivity have been determined by western blotting in a soluble fraction and two membrane fractions of brain cortex from demented patients (14 with Alzheimer's disease and 8 with other diagnoses). The concentration of APP in the soluble fraction correlated with the number of pyramidal neurones but not astrocytes or indices of interneurones. Experimental lesions in rats and quantitative autoradiography were used to investigate the cellular localisation of receptors. Lesions were produced by intrastriatal or intracortical injections of volkensin to destroy corticofugal and corticortical pyramidal neurons respectively. Volkensin treatment caused significant loss of pyramidal neurones which was accompanied by reduced binding to muscarinic cholinergic m1 receptors. [3H] 8-OH-DPAT (serotonin 1A receptors) binding was reduced only following intrastriatal volkensin. Results from the human and rat investigations are discussed in terms of the biology of cortical pyramidal neurones and drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
