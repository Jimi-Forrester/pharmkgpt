29036903|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis that dyshomeostasis between Abeta production and clearance is a very early, key molecular factor in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed and examined in the AD research field. Scientists have focused on seeking natural products or drugs to influence the dynamic equilibrium of Abeta, targeting production and clearance of Abeta. There is emerging evidence that resveratrol (Res), a naturally occurring polyphenol mainly found in grapes and red wine, acts on AD in numerous in vivo and in vitro models. Res decreases the amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), enhances clearance of amyloid beta-peptides, and reduces Abeta aggregation. Moreover, Res also protects neuronal functions through its antioxidant properties. This review discusses the action of Res on Abeta production, clearance and aggregation and multiple potential mechanisms, providing evidence of the useful of Res for AD treatment.
