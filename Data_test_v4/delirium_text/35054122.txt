35054122|t|Improvement of Gait in Patients with Stroke Using Rhythmic Sensory Stimulation: A Case-Control Study.
35054122|a|Patients with stroke suffer from impaired locomotion, exhibiting unstable walking with increased gait variability. Effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on unstable gait of patients with chronic stroke are unclear. This study aims to determine the effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on the gait of patients with chronic stroke. Twenty older adults with stroke and twenty age- and gender-matched healthy controls walked 60 m under four conditions: normal walking with no stimulation, walking with rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) through an earphone in the ear, walking with rhythmic somatosensory stimulation (RSS) through a haptic device on the wrist of each participant, and walking with rhythmic combined stimulation (RCS: RAS + RSS). Gait performance in the stroke group significantly improved during walking with RAS, RSS, and RCS compared to that during normal walking (p < 0.008). Gait variability significantly decreased under the RAS, RSS, and RCS conditions compared to that during normal walking (p < 0.008). Rhythmic sensory stimulation is effective in improving the gait of patients with chronic stroke, regardless of the type of rhythmic stimuli, compared to healthy controls. The effect was greater in patients with reduced mobility, assessed by the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI).
