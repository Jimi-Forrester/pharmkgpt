38646682|t|A Review on Tau Targeting Biomimetics Nano Formulations: Novel Approach for Targeting Alzheimer's Diseases.
38646682|a|Central nervous system disorders are prevalent, profoundly debilitating, and poorly managed. Developing innovative treatments for these conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, could significantly improve patients' quality of life and reduce the future economic burden on healthcare systems. However, groundbreaking drugs for central nervous system disorders have been scarce in recent years, highlighting the pressing need for advancements in this field. One significant challenge in the realm of nanotherapeutics is ensuring the precise delivery of drugs to their intended targets due to the complex nature of Alzheimer's disease. Although numerous therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's have been explored, most drug candidates targeting amyloid-beta have failed in clinical trials. Recent research has revealed that tau pathology can occur independently of amyloid-beta and is closely correlated with the clinical progression of Alzheimer's symptoms. This discovery suggests that tau could be a promising therapeutic target. One viable approach to managing central nervous system disorders is the administration of nanoparticles to neurons, intending to inhibit tau aggregation by directly targeting p-tau. In Alzheimer's disease, beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles hinder neuron transmission and function. The disease also triggers persistent inflammation, compromises the blood-brain barrier, leads to brain shrinkage, and causes neuronal loss. While current medications primarily manage symptoms and slow cognitive decline, there is no cure for Alzheimer's.
