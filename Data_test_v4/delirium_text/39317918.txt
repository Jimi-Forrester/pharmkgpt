39317918|a|The gut-brain axis plays an important role in mental health. The intestinal epithelial surface is colonized by billions of commensal and transitory bacteria, known as the Gut Microbiota (GM). However, potential pathogens continuously stimulate intestinal immunity when they find the place. The last two decades have witnessed several studies revealing intestinal bacteria as a key factor in the health-disease balance of the gut, as well as disease-emergent in other parts of the body. Various neurological processes, such as cognition, learning, and memory, could be affected by dysbiosis in GM. Additionally, the aging process and longevity are related to systemic inflammation caused by dysbiosis. Commensal GM affects brain development, behavior, and healthy aging suggesting that building changes in GM might be a potential therapeutic method. The innovation in GM dysbiosis is intervention by Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), which has been confirmed as a therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and is promising for other clinical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Additionally, FMT may be possible to promote healthy aging, and extend longevity. This review aims to connect dysbiosis, neurological disorders, and aging and the potential of FMT as a therapeutic strategy to treat these disorders, and to enhance the quality of life in the elderly.
