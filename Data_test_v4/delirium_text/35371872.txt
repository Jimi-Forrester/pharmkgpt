35371872|a|Introduction  Opioids are the mainstay of pain management in critically ill patients. However, recent attention to their adverse effects in the intensive care unit (ICU) has led to the use of strategies that aim to reduce these side effects. Among these strategies, there are multimodal analgesia protocols, which prioritize pain management and employ a combination of different analgesics to spare excessive doses of opioids and sedatives in continuous infusion. Objective The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multimodal analgesia protocol on clinical outcomes and consumption of sedatives and analgesics in two intensive care units. Methods  We conducted a single-center, quasi-experimental, retrospective, and prospective cohort study comparing clinical outcomes and consumption of sedatives and analgesics before and after the implementation of a multimodal pain management protocol in critically ill adult patients. We included 465 patients in 2017 (pre-intervention group) and 1508 between 2018 and 2020 (post-intervention group). Results In the analysis of the primary outcome, there was a significant reduction in mortality between 2017 and 2020 (27.7% - 21.7%, p=0.0134). There was no statistical difference in mechanical ventilation time or concerning the infection rate. Patients who received the multimodal analgesia protocol had a decrease of 24% regarding mean fentanyl intake and a progressive reduction in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) (8.4% - 19%). There was an increasing trend in the use of adjuvant analgesics and morphine in preemptive and therapeutic analgesia. Conclusion The implementation of a multimodal pain control protocol significantly reduced morbidity and mortality and the use of opioids in the ICU.
