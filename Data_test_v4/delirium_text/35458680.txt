35458680|a|Capsaicin is a natural compound found in chili peppers and is used in the diet of many countries. The important mechanism of action of capsaicin is its influence on TRPV1 channels in nociceptive sensory neurons. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of capsaicin in cardiovascular and oncological disorders have been described. Many recent publications show the positive effects of capsaicin in animal models of brain disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, capsaicin reduces neurodegeneration and memory impairment. The beneficial effects of capsaicin in Parkinson's disease and depression have also been described. It has been found that capsaicin reduces the area of infarction and improves neurological outcomes in animal models of stroke. However, both proepileptic and antiepileptic effects of capsaicin in animal models of epilepsy have been proposed. These contradictory results may be caused by the fact that capsaicin influences not only TRPV1 channels but also different molecular targets such as voltage-gated sodium channels. Human studies show that capsaicin may be helpful in treating stroke complications such as dysphagia. Additionally, this compound exerts pain-relieving effects in migraine and cluster headaches. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of capsaicin in disorders of the central nervous system.
