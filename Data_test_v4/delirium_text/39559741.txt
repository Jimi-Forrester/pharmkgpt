39559741|t|A Reappraisal on cortical myoclonus and brief Remarks on myoclonus of different Origins.
39559741|a|Myoclonus has multiple clinical manifestations and heterogeneous generators and etiologies, encompassing a spectrum of disorders and even physiological events. This paper, developed from a teaching course conducted by the Neurophysiology Commission of the Italian League against Epilepsy, aims to delineate the main types of myoclonus, identify potential underlying neurological disorders, outline diagnostic procedures, elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms, and discuss appropriate treatments. Neurophysiological techniques play a crucial role in accurately classifying myoclonic phenomena, by means of simple methods such as EEG plus polymyography (EEG + Polymyography), evoked potentials, examination of long-loop reflexes, and often more complex protocols to study intra-cortical inhibition-facilitation. In clinical practice, EEG + Polymyography often represents the first step to identify myoclonus, acquire signals for off-line studies and plan the diagnostic work-up.
