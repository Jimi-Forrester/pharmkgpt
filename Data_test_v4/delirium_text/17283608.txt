17283608|t|The role of neurotrophins and insulin on tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
17283608|a|Alterations in the structure and function of tau protein is the primary pathology of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these diseases, hyperphosphorylated tau protein forms aggregates which are deposited in the somadendritic regions of the neurons in the central nervous system. This series of events is toxic to neurons, and plays a crucial role in disease development. However, the events leading to the deregulation of tau protein in AD are not clear. Recently, there has been much research into the possible roles of neurotrophic factors in AD. AD brain exhibits changes in levels of different neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor. These neurotrophic factors are known to be important for the proper functioning of neurons, and their deregulation may play an important role in AD disease progression. Of particular interest, these neurotrophic factors may play a role in the regulation and proper function of tau protein. In this review, the roles of neurotrophic factors in AD and in the regulation of tau protein are discussed.
