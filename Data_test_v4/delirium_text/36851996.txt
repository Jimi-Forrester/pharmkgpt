36851996|a|Background: We aimed to investigate whether combined phosphorous (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and quantitative T 2 '  mapping are able to detect alterations of the cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and intracellular pH (pHi) as markers the of cellular energy metabolism in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Materials and methods: 32 patients with SVD and 17 age-matched healthy control subjects were examined with 3-dimensional 31P MRSI and oxygenation-sensitive quantitative T 2 '  mapping (1/ T 2 '   = 1/T2* - 1/T2) at 3 Tesla (T). PHi was measured within the white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in SVD patients. Quantitative T 2 '  values were averaged across the entire white matter (WM). Furthermore, T 2 '  values were extracted from normal-appearing WM (NAWM) and the WMH and compared between patients and controls. Results: Quantitative T 2 '  values were significantly increased across the entire WM and in the NAWM in patients compared to control subjects (149.51 +- 16.94 vs. 138.19 +- 12.66 ms and 147.45 +- 18.14 vs. 137.99 +- 12.19 ms, p < 0.05). WM T 2 '  values correlated significantly with the WMH load (rho=0.441, p = 0.006). Increased T 2 '  was significantly associated with more alkaline pHi (rho=0.299, p < 0.05). Both T 2 '  and pHi were significantly positively correlated with vascular pulsatility in the distal carotid arteries (rho=0.596, p = 0.001 and rho=0.452, p = 0.016). Conclusions: This exploratory study found evidence of impaired cerebral OEF in SVD, which is associated with intracellular alkalosis as an adaptive mechanism. The employed techniques provide new insights into the pathophysiology of SVD with regard to disease-related consequences on the cellular metabolic state.
