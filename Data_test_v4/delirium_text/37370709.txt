37370709|t|Long Term Outcome and Quality of Life of Intracranial Meningioma Patients Treated with Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy.
37370709|a|The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcome, including QoL, of patients with intracranial meningiomas WHO grade 1-3 who were treated with Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy (PBS PT) between 1997 and 2022. Two hundred patients (median age 50.4 years, 70% WHO grade 1) were analyzed. Acute and late side effects were classified according to CTCAE version 5.0. Time to event data were calculated. QoL was assessed descriptively by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and BN20 questionnaires. With a median follow-up of 65 months (range: 3.8-260.8 months) the 5 year OS was 95.7% and 81.8% for WHO grade 1 and grade 2/3, respectively (p < 0.001). Twenty (10%) local failures were observed. Failures occurred significantly (p < 0.001) more frequent in WHO grade 2 or 3 meningioma (WHO grade 1: n = 7, WHO grade 2/3: n = 13), in patients with multiple meningiomas (p = 0.005), in male patients (p = 0.005), and when PT was initiated not as upfront therapy (p = 0.011). There were no high-grade toxicities in the majority (n = 176; 88%) of patients. QoL was assessed for 83 (41.5%) patients and for those patients PT did not impacted QoL negatively during the follow-up. In summary, we observed very few local recurrences of meningiomas after PBS PT, a stable QoL, and a low rate of high-grade toxicity.
