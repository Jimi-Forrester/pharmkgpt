32854196|t|Hyperpolarized 129Xe Time-of-Flight MR Imaging of Perfusion and Brain Function.
32854196|a|Perfusion measurements can provide vital information about the homeostasis of an organ and can therefore be used as biomarkers to diagnose a variety of cardiovascular, renal, and neurological diseases. Currently, the most common techniques to measure perfusion are 15O positron emission tomography (PET), xenon-enhanced computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Here, we show how regional perfusion can be quantitively measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using time-resolved depolarization of hyperpolarized (HP) xenon-129 (129Xe), and the application of this approach to detect changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to a hemodynamic response in response to brain stimuli. The investigated HP 129Xe Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique produced perfusion images with an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10.35. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the first hemodynamic response (HDR) map was acquired in healthy volunteers using the HP 129Xe TOF imaging. Responses to visual and motor stimuli were observed. The acquired HP TOF HDR maps correlated well with traditional proton blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI. Overall, this study expands the field of HP MRI with a novel dynamic imaging technique suitable for rapid and quantitative perfusion imaging.
