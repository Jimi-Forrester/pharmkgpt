16928265|a|BACKGROUND: Aluminium is considered a bone toxic metal since poisoning can lead to aluminium-induced bone disease in patients with chronic renal failure. Healthy subjects with normal renal function retain 4% of the aluminium consumed. They might thus also accumulate aluminium and eventually be at risk of long-term low-grade aluminium intoxication that can affect bone health. METHODS: We therefore examined 62 patients with femoral neck fractures or osteoarthritis of the hip (age range 38-93), with the aim of examining whether aluminium in bone is associated with bone-mineral density (BMD), content (BMC) or width of the femoral neck measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). During operations bone biopsies were taken from the trabecular bone of the proximal femur. The samples were measured for their content of aluminium using a mass spectrometer. RESULTS: No significant association between the aluminium content in bone and femoral neck BMD, BMC or width could be found after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the accumulated aluminium content in bone during life does not substantially influence the extent of osteoporosis.
