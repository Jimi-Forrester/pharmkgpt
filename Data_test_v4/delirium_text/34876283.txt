34876283|t|Postoperative delirium and quality of life after transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement: A prospective observational study.
34876283|a|OBJECTIVE: In older patients, postoperative delirium is a frequently occurring complication after surgical aortic valve replacement, leading to an excess in postoperative morbidity and mortality. It remains controversial whether transcatheter aortic valve implantation and minimally invasive surgical aortic valve replacement can reduce the risk of postoperative delirium. This study aimed to compare the incidence of postoperative delirium after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement and the impact on long-term outcomes. METHODS: Between September 2018 and January 2020, we conducted an observational, prospective cohort study in patients aged 70 years or more undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement. The primary end point was the incidence of in-hospital postoperative delirium during 5 postoperative days assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary end points included perioperative inflammation, postoperative complications, health status (EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire 5 levels), and mortality up to 6 months. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement were compared using propensity weighting to account for important baseline differences (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II, age, and frailty). RESULTS: We included 250 patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 80 (+-5.8) years and a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score of 5 (+-4.7). In the propensity-weighted analysis, those undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (N = 166) had a higher incidence of postoperative delirium compared with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (N = 84) (51% vs 15%: P < .0001). Furthermore, patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement experienced more inflammation, a greater depth of anesthesia, and more intraoperative hypotension. After surgical aortic valve replacement, 41% of patients experienced an improved health status compared with 12% after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (P < .0001). No outcome differences were noted within the surgical aortic valve replacement groups. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is associated with a lower risk for postoperative delirium. Nevertheless, patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement experience the greatest improvement in quality of life. Heart teams should consider these outcomes in shared decision-making in the choice of transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement.
