35154589|a|INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory processes in the brain play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as celecoxib reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines. This double-blind study aimed to investigate the effects of adding celecoxib to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)on treating OCD. METHODS: Sixty patients who met the diagnosis criteria for OCD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -Fourth Edition- Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) were recruited in the present study. Two psychiatrists independently confirmed the diagnosis by performing structured interviews. The study participants included 23 patients who received SSRIs and celecoxib (400 mg twice daily) and 22 patients in the control group that received SSRIs and placebo. Moreover, at baseline, in weeks 4, 8, and 12, the explored patients were assessed by a psychiatrist using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BCOS). RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in the change of scores on the Y-BOCS in week 12, compared with the onset of the study between the study groups (t= -8.976, df=38, P=0.001). There was a significant difference between the study groups in obsession (F= 49.19, df= 1, P<=0.001), compulsion (F= 13.78, df= 1, P= 0.001), and OCD (F= 57.25, df= 1, P<=0.001), i.e., higher in the celecoxib group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that adjuvant treatment with celecoxib can further improve the symptoms of OCD in individuals receiving SSRIs.
