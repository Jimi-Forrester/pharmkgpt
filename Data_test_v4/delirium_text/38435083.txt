38435083|a|A new series of Zr(IV), V(IV), Ru(III), and Cd(II) complexes with the ligand N-((5-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-3-yl)methylene)-2-(p-tolylamino)acetohydrazide (H2L) have been prepared. FT-IR, 1H-NMR, electronic spectra, powder X-ray, and thermal behavior methods were applied to elucidate the structural composition of new compounds. Geometry optimization for all synthesized compounds was conducted using the Gaussian09 program via the DFT method, to obtain optimal structures and essential parameters. Moreover, the antibacterial and antitumor activity of the ligand and its complexes were studied, where the Cd(II) complex acquires probably the best antibacterial activity followed by the Ru(III) complex towards bacterial species than others when using ampicillin and gentamicin were used as standard drugs. The complexes exhibited interestingly antitumor potential against the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The cytotoxicity of the new complexes has been arranged to follow the order: Ru(III) complex > Cd(II) complex > Zr(IV) complex > V(IV) complex > ligand. Molecular docking was performed on the active site of ribosyltransferase and obtained good results. Structure-based molecular docking is used to identify a potential therapeutic inhibitor for NUDT5.
