31463522|a|Aluminium is biologically reactive and its ability to potentiate the immune response has driven its inclusion in both veterinary and human vaccines. Consequently, the need for unequivocal visualisation of aluminium in vivo has created a focused research effort to establish fluorescent molecular probes for this purpose. The most commonly used direct fluorescent labels for the detection of aluminium are morin (2',3,4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and lumogallion [4-chloro-3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenylazo)-2-hydroxybenzene-1-sulphonic acid]. While the former has gained popularity in the detection of aluminium in plants and predominantly within root tips, the latter boasts greater sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of aluminium in human cells and tissues. Herein, we have developed a simplified morin staining protocol using the autofluorescence quenching agent, Sudan Black B. This modified protocol improves tissue morphology and increases analytical sensitivity, which allows intracellular aluminium to be detected in monocytes and when co-localised with senile plaques in human brain tissue of donors diagnosed with familial Alzheimer's disease. Overall, our results demonstrate a simple approach to minimise false positives in the use of morin to unequivocally detect aluminium in vivo.
