29925852|t|NMR-based Metabolomic Techniques Identify the Toxicity of Emodin in HepG2 Cells.
29925852|a|Emodin is a natural anthraquinone derivative that is present in various herbal preparations. The pharmacological effects of emodin include anticancer, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and even antimicrobial activities. However, emodin also has been reported to induce hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. The mechanism of emodin's adverse effects is complicated and currently not well understood. This study aimed to establish a cell metabonomic method to investigate the toxicity of emodin and explore its potential mechanism and relevant targets. In the present study, metabonomic profiles of cell extracts and cell culture media obtained using the 1H NMR technique were used to assess emodin toxicity in HepG2 cells. Multivariate statistical analyses such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to characterize the metabolites that differed between the control and emodin groups. The results indicated that emodin resulted in differences in 33 metabolites, including acetate, arginine, aspartate, creatine, isoleucine, leucine and histidine in the cell extract samples and 23 metabolites, including alanine, formate, glutamate, succinate and isoleucine, in the cell culture media samples. Approximately 8 pathways associated with these metabolites were disrupted in the emodin groups. These results demonstrated the potential for using cell metabonomics approaches to clarify the toxicological effects of emodin, the underlying mechanisms and potential biomarkers. Our findings may help with the development of novel strategies to discover targets for drug toxicity, elucidate the changes in regulatory signal networks and explore its potential mechanism of action.
