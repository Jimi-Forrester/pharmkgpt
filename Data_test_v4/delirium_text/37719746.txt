We aimed to study the role of baicalin on neuronal pentraxin-1 (NPTX-1), neuronal pentraxin-2 (NPTX-2), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in AD model rats. Methods: The 30 male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three groups: the control group, the AD model group, and the AD + baicalin group. Then, the Morris water maze was used to verify the effect of baicalin on the memory and spatial learning of rats. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to observe the expression of NPTX-1, NPTX-2, and CRP in brain tissue. Results: Compared with the AD model group, the AD rats treated with baicalin spent significantly less time finding escape latencies (P = 0.008) and had longer cross-platform times in the target quadrant (P = 0.015). In addition, the AD + baicalin group had significantly higher numbers of hippocampal neurons compared with the AD model group (P < 0.05). Baicalin also obviously decreased the apoptosis of neurons. Moreover, compared with the AD model group, the NPTX-1 and CRP expression in the AD + baicalin group was significantly reduced (P = 0.000) while the expression of NPTX-2 in the brain tissue of AD rats was significantly increased (P = 0.000). Conclusions: Baicalin can play a therapeutic role by downregulating NPTX-1, upregulating NPTX-2, and downregulating CPR in AD model rats.
