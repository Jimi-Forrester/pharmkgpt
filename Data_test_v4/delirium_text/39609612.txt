39609612|t|TMBIM6/BI-1 is an intracellular environmental regulator that induces paraptosis in cancer via ROS and Calcium-activated ERAD II pathways.
39609612|a|Transmembrane B cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein inhibitor motif-containing (TMBIM) 6, also known as Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1), has been heavily researched for its cytoprotective functions. TMBIM6 functional diversity includes modulating cell survival, stress, metabolism, cytoskeletal dynamics, organelle function, regulating cytosolic acidification, calcium, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Clinical research shows TMBIM6 plays a key role in many of the world's top diseases/injuries (i.e., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, obesity, brain injury, liver disease, heart disease, aging, etc.), including cancer, where TMBIM6 expression impacts patient survival, chemoresistance, cancer progression, and metastasis. We show TMBIM6 is activated by, and undergoes, different conformational changes that dictate its function following a significant change in the cell's IntraCellular Environment (ICE). TMBIM6 agonism, following ICE change, can help the cell overcome multiple stresses including toxin exposure, viral infection, wound healing, and excitotoxicity. However, in cancer cells TMBIM6 agonism results in rapid paraptotic induction irrespective of the cancer type, sub-type, genotype or phenotype. Furthermore, the level of TMBIM6 expression in cancer did not dictate the level of paraptotic induction; however, it did dictate the rate at which paraptosis occurred. TMBIM6 agonism did not induce paraptosis in cancer via canonical routes involving p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK, UPR, autophagy, proteasomes, or Caspase-9. Instead, TMBIM6 agonism in cancer upregulates cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS, activates lysosome biogenesis, and induces paraptosis via ERAD II mechanisms. In xenograft models, we show TMBIM6 agonism induces rapid cancer cell death with no toxicity, even at high doses of TMBIM6 agonist (>450 mg/kg). In summary, this study shows TMBIM6's functional diversity is only activated by severe ICE change in diseased/injured cells, highlighting its transformative potential as a therapeutic target across various diseases and injuries, including cancer.
