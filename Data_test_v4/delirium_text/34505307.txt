34505307|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to examine the neuropsychological factors that may be related to the impaired gesture imitations in patients with dementia. METHODS: The imitation of unilateral finger and bimanual gestures was evaluated in 162 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 103 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The relationships of gesture imitation performance to global cognition, semantic fluency, phonemic fluency, figure copying, clock drawing, and trail-making test part A (TMT-A) scores were examined. RESULTS: Mean scores for unilateral finger imitation were significantly lower in DLB patients than in AD patients, and significantly more DLB patients showed impaired performance in unilateral finger imitation than AD patients. In contrast, the percentage of patients with impaired bimanual gesture imitation was not significantly different between AD and DLB patients. Unilateral finger imitation performance was predicted by pentagon copying in the AD patients, and was predicted by cube copying in the DLB patients. Bimanual gesture imitation performance was predicted by TMT-A scores and phonemic fluency in the AD patients but was predicted by TMT-A scores, cube copying, and parkinsonism severity in the DLB patients. DISCUSSION: Our study suggested that bimanual gesture imitation is a complex task that is supported by a wide range of neuropsychological processes, such as visuospatial attention, executive function, and visuomotor control, and therefore, it was easily impaired in early dementia. Unilateral finger imitation was more similar to constructional tasks, such as figure drawing, and was impaired more often in DLB patients than in AD patients.
