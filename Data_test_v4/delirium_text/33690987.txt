33690987|a|This article summarizes recommendations made by six pain specialists who discussed the rationale for ziconotide intrathecal analgesia (ITA) and the requirement for evidence-based guidance on its use, from a European perspective. Riemser Pharma GmbH (Greifswald, Germany), which holds the European marketing authorization for ziconotide, hosted the meeting. The group agreed that ITA is under-used in Europe, adding that ziconotide ITA has potential to be a first-line alternative to morphine; both are already first-line options in the USA. Ziconotide ITA (initiated using a low-dose, slow-titration approach) is suitable for many patients with noncancer- or cancer-related chronic refractory pain and no history of psychosis. Adopting ziconotide as first-line ITA could reduce opioid usage in these patient populations. The group advocated a risk-reduction strategy for all candidate patients, including compulsory prescreening for neuropsychosis, and requested US-European alignment of the licensed starting dose for ziconotide: the low-and-slow approach practiced in the USA has a better tolerability profile than the fixed high starting dose licensed in Europe. Of note, an update to the European Summary of Product Characteristics is anticipated in early 2021. The group acknowledged that the Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference (PACC) treatment algorithms for ziconotide ITA provide useful guidance, but recommendations tailored specifically for European settings are required. Before a consensus process can formally begin, the group called for additional European prospective studies to investigate ziconotide in low-and-slow dosing strategies, in different patient settings. Such data would enable European guidance to have the most appropriate evidence at its core.
