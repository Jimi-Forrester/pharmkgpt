METHOD: The clinical data of patients treated with PKP in our hospital from January 2018 to October 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. These patients were divided into female group and male group according to gender differences. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and activity function score (LAS) were recorded before operation, immediately after operation and 1 year after operation, and postoperative complications such as cement leakage and recurrent vertebral fracture were recorded. The above observation indexes between the 2 groups were statistically compared. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients (118 in female group and 53 in male group) were included. There was no other difference between the 2 groups except that thoracic vertebral fracture was more common in women (P < .05). The VAS of female group and male group were (7.14 +- 0.61) and (7.11 +- 0.51) before operation, (3.05 +- 0.66) and (2.89 +- 0.64) after operation, 1 year after operation (1.10 +- 0.50) and (1.02 +- 0.37). There was no difference in each period between the 2 groups (P > .05). But there was a significant decrease after operation, which was recognized between the 2 groups (P < .05); The activity scores of female group and male group were (3.08 +- 0.48) and (3.07 +- 0.43) before operation, (1.86 +- 0.42) and (1.85 +- 0.50) after operation, 1 year after operation (1.01 +- 0.92) and (1.02 +- 0.14). There was no difference in each period between the 2 groups (P > .05). But there was a significant decrease after operation, which was recognized between the 2 groups (P < .05). Postoperative cement leakage was revealed in 21 cases (12.28%), 16 cases (13.56%) in female group and 5 cases (9.43%) in male group, which was no significant difference between the 2 groups. During the 1-year follow-up, postoperative recurrent vertebral fracture was revealed in 4 cases (2.34%), 2 cases (1.69%) in the female group and 2 case (3.77%) in the male group, which was also no significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with PKP can immediately get pain relief and activity function improvement. PKP is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgery for both female and male patients.
