37108976|a|In China, dezocine is commonly employed as a partial agonist of mu/kappa opioid receptors during anesthesia induction for surgical patients, yet evidence supporting its causal association with emergence delirium is limited. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of intravenous dezocine administered during anesthesia induction on emergence delirium. The retrospective studied existing data containing medical records of patients undergoing an elective laparoscopy procedure and the study was conducted with ethics-board approval. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence delirium. Secondary outcomes included the VAS in the PACU and 24 h after surgery, the RASS score in the PACU, postoperative MMSE, hospital stay, and ICU stay. A total of 681 patients were analyzed, after being propensity score-matched, the dezocine and non-dezocine group each had 245 patients. Emergence delirium occurred in 26/245 (10.6%) of patients who received dezocine and 41/245 (16.7%) of patients did not receive dezocine. Patients on whom dezocine was used were associated with a significantly lower incidence of emergence delirium (absolute risk difference, -6.1%, 95% CI, -12% to -0.2%; relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.18-0.74). All secondary outcome measures and adverse outcomes were not significantly different. The use of dezocine during anesthesia induction was associated with a decreased incidence of emergence delirium after elective laparoscopic surgeries.
