20222985|t|PADI4 and tumourigenesis.
20222985|a|PADI4 post-translationally converts peptidylarginine to citrulline, a process called citrullination. Studies have demonstrated the high expression of PADI4 in various malignant tumour tissues. PADI4 is also expressed at high levels in the blood of patients with some malignant tumours. Thus far, citrullination of histone, cytokeratin, antithrombin and fibronectin have been confirmed to be involved in abnormal apoptosis, high coagulation, and disordered cell proliferation and differentiation, all of which are main features of malignant tumours. PADI4 is expressed in CD34+ stem cells in normal tissues, and many more CD34+ cells expressing PADI4 are present in tumour tissues. These findings suggest that PADI4 may play an important role in tumourigenesis.
