25878400|t|The utility of iron chelators in the management of inflammatory disorders.
25878400|a|Since iron can contribute to detrimental radical generating processes through the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, it seems to be a reasonable approach to modulate iron-related pathways in inflammation. In the human organism a counterregulatory reduction in iron availability is observed during inflammatory diseases. Under pathological conditions with reduced or increased baseline iron levels different consequences regarding protection or susceptibility to inflammation have to be considered. Given the role of iron in development of inflammatory diseases, pharmaceutical agents targeting this pathway promise to improve the clinical outcome. The objective of this review is to highlight the mechanisms of iron regulation and iron chelation, and to demonstrate the potential impact of this strategy in the management of several acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including cancer.
