31000183|t|Cognitive impairment and 30-day rehospitalization rate in patients with acute heart failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
31000183|a|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is one of the world leading causes of hospitalization and rehospitalization. Cognitive impairment has been identified as a risk factor for rehospitalization in patients with heart failure. However, previous studies reported mixed results. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between cognitive impairment and 30-day rehospitalization in patients with HF. METHOD: We performed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018 in the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Included studies were cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies or randomized controlled trials that compared the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in HF patients with cognitive impairment and those without. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I2 statistic using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Five studies with a total of 2,342 participants (1,004 participants had cognitive impairment) were included for meta-analysis. In random-effect model, cognitive impairment significantly increased the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in HF participants (pooled RR=1.63, 95%CI: 1.19-2.24], I2=64.2%, p=0.002). Subgroup analysis was performed on the studies that excluded patients with dementia. The results also showed that cognitive impairment significantly increased the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in participants with HF (pooled RR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.05-1.59, I2=0.0%, p=0.016), which was consistent with our overall analysis. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the presence of cognitive impairment is associated with 30-day rehospitalization in patients with HF.
