38175206|t|Geriatric distal femoral fractures: post-operative complications and nine-year mortality-a retrospective analysis of two tertiary trauma centres.
38175206|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the mortality at various post-operative intervals and explore influential variables for these outcomes in elderly patients with distal femur fractures (DFF). METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted across two tertiary care institutions, between 2014 and 2020. The primary outcomes were mortality rates at 30-day, six month, and one year post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included 1-year readmission and reintervention rates along with their correlated complications. RESULTS: A total of 37 DFF in 35 patients was analyzed; average age was 83.6 years (range, 65-98 years). The overall mortality rate at a maximum follow-up of 8.8 years was 74% (26/35 patients). The median survival time was 3.2 years and the survival probability at five years was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 43%). Mortality rates at 30 days, six months, and one year after surgery were 8.6% (3 patients), 23% (8 patients), and 34% (12 patients), respectively. Overall mortality rate was 64% (15/24 patients) for native distal femur fractures, and 92% (13/14 patients) for periprosthetic fractures (p = 0.109). Patients older than 85 years and male gender were identified as risk factors for mortality within the first year post-operatively. CONCLUSION: Elderly fractures have a high mortality at eight years of follow-up. Mortality at one year was much higher than in other studies of the same nature. We did not find statistically significant differences when comparing native bone fractures with periprosthetic fractures. Factors that impact mortality were being a man, advanced age, elevated index comorbidity, and dementia. There is no relationship between the time to be taken to the surgical procedure and mortality results.
