38152793|a|The most prevalent type of dementia, especially in older persons, is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has clinical signs of progressive cognitive decline and functional impairment. However, new research indicates that AD patients' dietary patterns and nutritional intake could hold the key to staving off some of the complications. Therefore, the primary aim of this investigation was to analyze various dietary patterns and the subsequent impact of the resulting nutritional intake on AD patients. Various online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were searched using appropriate keywords, reference searches, and citation searches. The databases were accessed using the search phrases "Alzheimer's disease," "dietary habits," "minerals," "nutritional profile," and "vitamins." Fifteen of the 21 investigations that we selected for our systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis revealed that micronutrient supplementation and some dietary patterns were helpful in alleviating a few of the symptoms of AD, especially with regard to the progression of dementia in the assessed patients. It was shown that dietary interventions and nutritional adjustments can considerably delay the onset of AD and the varying degrees of dementia that often accompany it. However, there were some areas of ambiguity in our findings because a few of the chosen studies did not document any noticeable improvements in the patient's conditions.
