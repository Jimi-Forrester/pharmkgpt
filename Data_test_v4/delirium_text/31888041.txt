31888041|t|Development and Predictors of Sarcopenic Dysphagia during Hospitalization of Older Adults.
31888041|a|The study aimed to investigate the impact of sarcopenia and sarcopenia-related conditions on the development of swallowing disorders during hospitalization. Older adult inpatients (n = 8768) without swallowing disorders in the premorbid period were studied. Sarcopenia-related conditions were evaluated in terms of nutritional status, physical status, and ambulatory conditions as well as hand-grip strength and muscle mass assessed by calf circumference. Development of swallowing disorders was defined based on food texture at discharge from the hospital. The patients' mean age was 76.1 +- 6.9 years. A total of 374 (4.3%) patients developed swallowing disorders during hospitalization. They were older, with poorer nutritional status, and had more decline of physical performance than those without swallowing disorders. Performance Status score (odds ratio (OR) = 1.28 (1.12-1.46) p < 0.001), ambulatory dependency (OR = 1.72 (1.09-2.71), p = 0.020), malnutrition score (OR = 0.92 (0.87-0.97), p = 0.002), insufficient nutritional intake (OR = 2.33 (1.60-3.40), p < 0.001), and length of stay (OR = 1.01 (1.00-1.01), p = 0.001) were independent contributing factors for swallowing disorder development in the multivariate analysis. The presence of possible sarcopenia was also a contributor to swallowing disorder development. In conclusion, swallowing disorders could develop in patients with possible sarcopenia and sarcopenia-related conditions during hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware of this risk and provide appropriate interventions to prevent sarcopenic dysphagia.
