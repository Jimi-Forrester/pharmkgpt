30940835|a|An early pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the brain, which largely consist of up to 43 amino acids long Abeta peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously identified a series of sialylated Tyr-10 O-glycosylated Abeta peptides, 15-20 residues long, from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and observed a relative increase of those in AD vs non-AD patients. We report here on the synthesis and use of an isotopically double-labeled Abeta1-15 glycopeptide, carrying the core 1 Galbeta3GalNAcalpha1-O-Tyr-10 structure, to (1) identify by HCD LC-MS/MS the definite glycan core 1 structure of immunopurified and desialylated Abeta glycopeptides in human CSF and to (2) establish a LC-MS/MS quantification method for desialylated Abeta1-15 (and Abeta1-17) glycopeptides and to (3) compare the concentrations of these Abeta glycopeptides in CSF from 20 AD patients and 20 healthy controls. Although we unambiguously identified the core 1 structures and Tyr-10 attachment sites of the glycopeptides, we did not observe any quantitative differences, determined through both peptide and oxonium ion fragments, of the desialylated Abeta1-15 or Abeta1-17 glycopeptides between the AD and non-AD group. The new quantitative glycoproteomic approach described, using double-labeled glycopeptide standards, will undoubtedly facilitate future studies of glycopeptides as clinical biomarkers but should also embrace sialylated Abeta standards to reveal specific sialylation patterns of individual Abeta glycopeptides in AD patients and controls.
