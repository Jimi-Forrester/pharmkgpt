8221282|a|Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) who live to be 40 years of age will demonstrate neuropathological changes that are consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to modern medical intervention, we are now observing an aging DS population. Middle-aged Down's syndrome adults are actually considered to be "very old," and it is not uncommon to observe a progressive loss of cognitive function and a decline in the ability to perform daily tasks consistent with that seen in Alzheimer's disease. At this stage, the DS individual will not be able to perform daily preventive dental care and may be unable to cooperate for professional dental care. Clinicians who care for DS adults must be aware of this problem when preparing their dental treatment plans, which must emphasize preventive care prior to the onset of dementia and the maintenance of that program during their patients' cognitive decline. In the latter stages of AD, it may be necessary to extract all the remaining teeth due to the inability of the individual or care giver to provide adequate oral hygiene to prevent dental caries or periodontal disease.
