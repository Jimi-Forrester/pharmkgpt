39434823|t|The Effect of FTY720 on Sphingolipid Imbalance and Cognitive Decline in Aged EFAD Mice.
39434823|a|Background: During Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, there is a decline in the bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Previous research showed that FTY720, an S1P mimetic, prevented cognitive decline and reduced ceramide levels in transgenic mice with familial AD carrying the human APOE4 gene (E4FAD) at 6-7 months of age. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore the protective effects of FTY720 at late-stage AD. Methods: Male mice aged 9.5 to 10.5 months were orally administered FTY720 (0.1 mg/kg) via oral gavage for 6 weeks. A pre-test of water maze was used for evaluating the pathological status. After 4 weeks of administration, memory, locomotion, and anxiety were assessed. Cortex samples were analyzed for amyloid-beta (Abeta) and sphingolipid levels. Results: Compared with APOE3 mice, APOE4, E3FAD and E4FAD mice exhibited significant memory deficits. After 6 weeks administration, FTY720 did not alleviate memory deficits in EFAD mice. Lipid analysis revealed that S1P was significantly reduced in EFAD mice (E3FAD or E4FAD) compared to controls (APOE3 and APOE4). Ceramide level alterations were predominantly dependent on APOE isoforms rather than AD transgenes. Interestingly, Cer (d18 : 1/22 : 1) was elevated in APOE4 mice compared to APOE3, and FTY720 reduced it. Conclusions: E4FAD and APOE4 mice exhibited significant spatial memory deficits and higher ceramide concentrations compared to APOE3 mice. FTY720 did not reverse memory deficits in E4FAD and APOE4 mice but reduced specific ceramide species. This study provides insights into the association between sphingolipids and APOE4 in advanced AD stages, exploring potential therapeutic targeting of sphingolipid metabolism.
