OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of different types of motor tasks in differentiating older persons with MCI and AD from healthy peers. METHODS: Older adults aged 60 years or over (n = 105; healthy = 39; MCI = 23; AD = 43) were evaluated by the floor maze test (FMT), the senior fitness test, and DT performance. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the accuracy of the tests. We also performed principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression analysis to explore the variance and possible associations of the variables within the sample. RESULTS: FMT (AUC = 0.84, sensitivity = 75.7%, specificity = 76.1%, p < 0.001) and DT (AUC = 0.87, sensitivity = 80.4%, specificity = 86.9%, p < 0.001) showed the highest performance for distinguishing MCI from AD individuals. Moreover, FMT presented better sensitivity in distinguishing AD patients from their healthy peers (AUC = 0.93, sensitivity = 94%, specificity = 85.6%, p < 0.001) when compared to the Mini-Mental State Examination. PCA revealed that the motor test performance explains a total of 73.9% of the variance of the sample. Additionally, the results of the motor tests were not influenced by age and education. CONCLUSION: Spatial navigation tests showed better accuracy than usual cognitive screening tests in distinguishing patients with neurocognitive disorders.
