37896069|t|Evaluation of Crocin Content and In Vitro Antioxidant and Anti-Glycation Activity of Different Saffron Extracts.
37896069|a|Crocin, a glycoside carotenoid that exhibits several health benefits, is mainly obtained from saffron (Crocus sativus L.), whose quality and content of phytochemicals can be strongly affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, in this work, the crocin content and in vitro antioxidant activity of saffron extracts obtained from three different varieties (Greek, Sicilian, and Iranian saffron) were assessed. Crocin content in saffron extracts was quantified via ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activity of saffron extracts was evaluated using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging test. The Maillard reaction was used to assess anti-glycation activity. Although the Sicilian and Iranian saffron extracts contained higher amounts of crocin (128 +- 6 ng/mL and 126 +- 4 ng/mL, respectively) compared to the Greek extracts (111 +- 2 ng/mL), ORAC values (50.9 +- 0.5) and % NO inhibition (35.2 +- 0.2) were higher for the Greek variety, which displayed a total phenolic content about two-fold greater than that of the other two extracts. Sicilian and Greek saffron had similar anti-glycation activities, while Iranian saffron was less effective. These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of saffron extracts could be ascribed to their naturally occurring complex mixture of phytochemicals, deserving further investigation as supplements to prevent pathological conditions induced by radical species.
