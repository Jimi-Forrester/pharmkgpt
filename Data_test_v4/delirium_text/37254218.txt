Among them, ZNF330/NOA36 stand out because it is a highly evolutionarily conserved nucleolar zinc-finger protein found in the genome of ancient animal phyla like sponges or cnidarians, up to humans. Firstly described as a human autoantigen, NOA36 is expressed in all tissues and human cell lines, and it has been related to apoptosis in human cells as well as in muscle morphogenesis and hematopoiesis in Drosophila. Nevertheless, further research is required to better understand the roles of this highly conserved protein. RESULTS: Here, we have investigated possible interactors of human ZNF330/NOA36 through affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Among them, NOA36 interaction with HSPA1 and HSPA8 heat shock proteins was disclosed and further validated by co-immunoprecipitation. Also, "Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog" (ERH), a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, was detected in the AP-MS approach. Furthermore, we developed a NOA36 knockout cell line using CRISPR/Cas9n in HEK293, and we found that the cell cycle profile was modified, and proliferation decreased after heat shock in the knocked-out cells. These differences were not due to a different expression of the HSPs genes detected in the AP-MS after inducing stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that NOA36 is necessary for proliferation recovery in response to thermal stress to achieve a regular cell cycle profile, likely by interaction with HSPA1 and HSPA8. Further studies would be required to disclose the relevance of NOA36-EHR interaction in this context.
