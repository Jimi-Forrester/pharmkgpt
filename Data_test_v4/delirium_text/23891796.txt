23891796|t|A carbon nanotube metal semiconductor field effect transistor-based biosensor for detection of amyloid-beta in human serum.
23891796|a|We have developed a carbon nanotube (CNT) film-based biosensor with a metal semiconductor field effect transistor structure (MESFET). A gold top gate was deposited on the middle of the CNT channel and probe antibodies were immobilized on the gold top gate with an antibody-binding protein, protein G or Escherichia coli outer membrane (OM) with autodisplayed Z-domains of protein A. These CNT-MESFET biosensors exhibited a higher sensitivity than the CNT-FET biosensor with probe antibodies immobilized using a chemical linker, since the orientation of immobilized antibodies was controlled by the antibody-binding proteins. In addition, nonspecific binding was effectively inhibited by E. coli OM. Using the CNT-MESFET biosensors with E. coli OM containing Z domain, we detected amyloid-beta (Abeta) in human serum, one of the biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta at the level of 1 pg/mL in human serum could be measured in real-time and without labeling, which was lower than a limit of detection for plasma Abeta using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. These results suggested that our CNT-MESFET biosensors might be applicable for an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
