37738287|t|A Visual Analog Scale for Self-Reported Quality of Life: A Comparison of VAS and QoL-AD in Older Adults.
37738287|a|PURPOSE: People with dementia (PWD) are one of the fastest-growing clinical populations for speech-language pathologists. Self-reported quality of life (QoL) assessments are critical patient-reported outcome measures that align with person-centered care principles. However, proxy-reporting is most often used due to assumptions that PWD cannot provide reliable self-report. Visual analog scales (VASs) have been successfully used with people with expressive and cognitive deficits to measure subjective constructs such as QoL, mood, and pain. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a VAS QoL assessment tool. METHODS: Twenty older adults free of cognitive impairment were assessed using the quality of life in Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) and the QoL-AD in combination with a VAS (VAS QoL-AD). The construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the VAS QoL-AD were assessed by performing both assessments twice, 4 weeks apart. RESULTS: Significant correlations between the overall VAS QoL-AD and the QoL-AD scale ratings, between most of the QoL-AD and VAS QoL-AD subtests, and between the first and second assessment scores were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated strong construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the VAS QoL-AD in people without dementia. These results warrant further research into the development of a dementia-specific, self-reported VAS QoL scale for PWD.
