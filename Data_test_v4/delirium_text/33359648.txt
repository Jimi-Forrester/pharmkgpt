33359648|t|A comprehensive understanding about the pharmacological effect of diallyl disulfide other than its anti-carcinogenic activities.
33359648|a|Diallyl disulfide (DADS), an oil-soluble sulfur compound that is responsible for the biological effects of garlic, displays numerous biological activities, among which its anti-cancer activities are the most famous ones. In recent years, the pharmacological effects of DADS other than its anti-carcinogenic activities have attracted numerous attentions. For example, it has been reported that DADS can prevent the microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response and depression-like behaviors in mice. In the cardiovascular system, DADS administration was found to ameliorate the isoproterenol- or streptozotocin-induced cardiac dysfunction via the activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. DADS administration can also produce neuroprotective effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and protect the heart, endothelium, liver, lung, and kidney against cellular or tissue damages induced by various toxic factors, such as the oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), ethanol, acetaminophen, Cis-Diammine Dichloroplatinum (CisPt), and gentamicin. The major mechanisms of action of DADS in disease prevention and/or treatment include inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular apoptosis. Mechanisms, including the activation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase A (PKA), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB) and the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), can also mediate the cellular protective effects of DADS in different tissues and organs. In this review, we summarize and discuss the pharmacological effects of DADS other than its anti-carcinogenic activities, aiming to reveal more possibilities for DADS in disease prevention and/or treatment.
