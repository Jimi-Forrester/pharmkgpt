35761385|t|The role of NURR1 in metabolic abnormalities of Parkinson's disease.
35761385|a|A constant metabolism and energy supply are crucial to all organs, particularly the brain. Age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), are associated with alterations in cellular metabolism. These changes have been recognized as a novel hot topic that may provide new insights to help identify risk in the pre-symptomatic phase of the disease, understand disease pathogenesis, track disease progression, and determine critical endpoints. Nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (NURR1), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of PD, and changes in NURR1 expression can have a detrimental effect on cellular metabolism. In this review, we discuss recent evidence that suggests a vital role of NURR1 in dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron development and the pathogenesis of PD. The association between NURR1 and cellular metabolic abnormalities and its implications for PD therapy have been further highlighted.
