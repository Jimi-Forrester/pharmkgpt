37629389|t|Relationship of Neural Correlates of Gait Characteristics and Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
37629389|a|Background: Some patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) experience gait disturbances. However, there are few reports on the relationship between gait disturbance and cognitive function in patients with MCI. Therefore, we investigated the neural correlates of gait characteristics related to cognitive dysfunction. Methods: Eighty patients diagnosed with MCI from three dementia centers in Gangwon-do, Korea, were recruited for this study. We defined MCI as a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of 0.5 or higher, with a memory domain score of 0.5 or greater. The patients were classified as having either higher or lower MMSE and the groups were based on their Mini Mental Status Examination z-scores. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the gait characteristics and cognitive impairment. Analyses included variables such as age, sex, years of education, number of comorbidities, body mass index, and height. Results: Gait velocity, step count, step length, heel-to-heel base support, swing and stance phase duration, and support time were associated with cognitive function. A decrease in gray matter volume in the right pericalcarine area was associated with gait characteristics related to cognitive dysfunction. An increase in the curvature of gray matter in the right entorhinal, right lateral orbitofrontal, right cuneus, and right and left pars opercularis areas was also associated with gait characteristics related to cognitive dysfunction. Conclusion: Since gait impairment is an important factor in determining activities of daily living in patients with mild cognitive impairment, the evaluation of gait and cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment is important.
