27915995|a|BACKGROUND: Immunization against beta-amyloid (Abeta) reduces cerebral Abeta deposits and improves cognitive capacities in transgenic mouse models, and thus has been considered a promising disease- modifying therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although clinical trials in AD patients have yielded evidence for clearance of parenchymal Abeta plaques, Abeta increases in blood vessels of treated patients. We hypothesize that an age-related decline in the mechanisms that clear Abeta from the brain might be at least in part responsible for the failure to purge and re-distribute Abeta. The expulsion of Abeta via the blood-brain barrier is mediated by specialized transport proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1/MDR1). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the absence of P-gp at the bloodbrain barrier on the effectiveness of Abeta peptide immunization in APP/PS1+/- P-gp ko mice. METHODS: Male APP/PS1+/- P-gp wt (n = 8) and APP/PS1+/- P-gp ko (n = 8) mice were actively immunized with human Abeta42. After behavioral testing animals were sacrificed at the age of 395 days (+/- 5 days) and antibody titres against Abeta were measured. Brains were dissected and soluble/insoluble cerebral Abeta was quantified, additionally the number of amyloid plaques and severity of amyloid angiopathy were evaluated. RESULTS: In immunized mice with intact P-gp, our results showed a significant reduction of soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42. Furthermore, immunization significantly reduced Abeta plaque burden. In contrast, immunized APP/PS1+/- P-gp ko mice lacking functional P-gp did not show a reduction of Abeta40 or Abeta42 accumulation in the brain except for the soluble form of Abeta42. Furthermore, after active immunization these mice displayed a stronger intracerebral amyloid angiopathy. CONCLUSION: The results show that the absence of P-gp results in a significant disturbance of Abeta removal from the brain and increased intraparenchymal cerebral amyloid angiopathy after immunization against Abeta. Our data indicate that the selective up-regulation of P-gp could enhance the efficacy of Abeta immunization in the treatment or prevention of AD.
