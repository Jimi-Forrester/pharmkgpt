35237039|a|Authorities and research institutions emphasise and encourage interdisciplinary research to meet complex societal health challenges as dementia. However, studies that describe an interdisciplinary approach for dementia research are limited. What does it take for research to become interdisciplinary? Is it enough to include researchers from different disciplines? This paper reflects on an interdisciplinary approach to dementia research. Based on existing literature and theories, we elaborate the concept of interdisciplinarity, and how the perspective can contribute and improve dementia care.
