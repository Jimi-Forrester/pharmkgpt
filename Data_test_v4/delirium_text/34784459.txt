34784459|a|BACKGROUND: Differences in the effects of propofol and dexmedetomidine sedation on electroencephalogram patterns have been reported previously. However, the reliability of the Bispectral Index (BIS) value for assessing the sedation caused by dexmedetomidine remains debatable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the BIS value and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. METHODS: Forty-two patients (age range, 20-80 years) who were scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this study. Spinal anesthesia was performed using 0.5% bupivacaine, which was followed by dexmedetomidine infusion (loading dose, 0.5-1 mug/kg for 10 min; maintenance dose, 0.3-0.6 mug/kg/h). The MOAA/S score was used to evaluate the level of sedation, and the Vital Recorder program was used to collect data (vital signs and BIS values). RESULTS: A total of 215082 MOAA/S scores and BIS data pairs were analyzed. The baseline variability of the BIS value was 7.024%, and the decrease in the BIS value was associated with a decrease in the MOAA/S score. The correlation coefficient and prediction probability between the two measurements were 0.566 (P < 0.0001) and 0.636, respectively. The mean +- standard deviation values of the BIS were 87.22 +- 7.06, 75.85 +- 9.81, and 68.29 +- 12.65 when the MOAA/S scores were 5, 3, and 1, respectively. Furthermore, the cut-off BIS values in the receiver operating characteristic analysis at MOAA/S scores of 5, 3, and 1 were 82, 79, and 73, respectively. CONCLUSION: The BIS values were significantly correlated with the MOAA/S scores. Thus, the BIS along with the clinical sedation scale might prove useful in assessing the hypnotic depth of a patient during sedation with dexmedetomidine.
