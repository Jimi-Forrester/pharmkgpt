33396967|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the result of the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide into amyloid fibrils and tau into neurofibrillary tangles. At the present time, there are no possible treatments for the disease. We have recently shown that diets enriched in phytonutrients show protection or limit the extent of damage in a number of neurological disorders. GrandFusion (GF) diets have attenuated the outcomes in animal models of traumatic brain injury, cerebral ischemia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In this study, we investigated the effect of GF diets in a mouse model of AD prior to the development of amyloid plaques to show how this treatment paradigm would alter the accumulation of Abeta peptide and related pathologic changes (i.e., inflammation, cathepsin B, and memory impairment). Administration of GF diets (2-4%) over a period of four months in APP/DeltaPS1 double-transgenic mice resulted in attenuation in Abeta peptide levels, reduction of amyloid load, and inflammation, increased cathepsin B expression, and improved spatial orientation. Additionally, treatment with GF diets increased nerve growth factor (NGF) levels in the brain and tempered the memory impairment in the animal model. These data suggest that GF diets may alter the development and progression of the mechanisms associated with the disease process to effectively modify AD pathogenesis.
