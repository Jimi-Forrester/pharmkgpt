36258220|a|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have identified common risk factors for cerebral stroke worldwide. Some of these factors include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, excessive drinking, and dyslipidemia. It is important to note, however, that genetic factors can also contribute to the occurrence of stroke. Here, we evaluated the association of ischemic stroke with rs12514417 polymorphism of the alcohol metabolizing gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 (ALDH7A1) and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Taiwan Biobank (TWB) data collected between 2008 and 2015 were available for 17,985 subjects. The odd ratios for stroke were obtained using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among eligible subjects (n = 17,829), 897 had ischemic stroke and 70 had hemorrhagic stroke. Subjects with ischemic stroke were older (mean +- SE, 58.45 +- 8.19 years vs. 48.33 +- 10.89 years, p < 0.0001) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) than the stroke-free individuals. The risk of ischemic stroke was significantly higher among subjects with the ALDH7A1 rs12514417 TG + GG genotype who also consumed alcohol at least 150 ml/week (odds ratio (OR), 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-2.72). We found that rs12514417 genotype and alcohol consumption (at least 150 ml/week) showed a significant interaction (p for interaction = 0.0266). Stratification based on alcohol exposure and ALDH7A1 rs12514417 genotypes indicated that ischemic stroke risk was significantly higher among alcohol drinkers with the TG + GG genotype than in those with the TT genotype (OR, 1.64, 95% CI: 1.15-2.33). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the combination of ALDH7A1 rs12514417 TG + GG genotype and alcohol exposure of at least 150 ml/week may increase the risk of ischemic stroke in Taiwanese adults.
