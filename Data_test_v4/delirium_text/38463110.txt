38463110|t|Point prevalence and clinical profile of patients with delirium admitted in internal medicine department at tertiary care centre in eastern Nepal: a descriptive cross-sectional study.
38463110|a|Introduction: Delirium, marked by acute disturbances in consciousness and cognition, remains underdiagnosed despite its significant impact on morbidity and mortality. This study investigates the point prevalence and clinical profile of delirium in patients at an eastern Nepal tertiary care centre. Methods: A 1-month descriptive cross-sectional study involved 152 Internal Medicine Department patients at BPKIHS, Dharan. Data, collected through face-to-face interviews and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), analyzed demographic details, clinical history, and laboratory findings. Ethical clearance and informed consent were obtained. Results: Among 152 participants, 13.2% exhibited delirium, with notable risk factors identified. Elderly patients (>=65 years) and those with nasogastric tubes faced higher risks. Significant associations were found with cardiovascular diseases (P=0.002), central nervous system diseases (P=0.015), and alcoholism (P=0.003). Laboratory findings revealed correlations with elevated creatinine, hyperuremia, and abnormal aspartate aminotransferase levels. The study emphasizes key contributors to delirium, providing valuable insights for clinicians in identifying, preventing, and managing delirium in a hospital setting. Conclusions: This study provides critical insights into delirium prevalence and profiles in Eastern Nepal. Identified risk factors underscore the importance of routine screenings and targeted interventions for at-risk populations. Study limitations, including sample size and single-centre focus, call for further research to validate findings and enhance our understanding of delirium's management across diverse healthcare settings. Overall, the study informs clinical practices and prompts broader exploration of delirium in healthcare contexts.
