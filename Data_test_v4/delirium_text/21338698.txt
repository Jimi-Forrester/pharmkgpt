21338698|a|Impaired axonal transport has been linked to the pathogenic processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which axonal swelling and degeneration are prevalent. The development of non-invasive neuroimaging methods to quantitatively assess in vivo axonal transport deficits would be enormously valuable to visualize early, yet subtle, changes in the AD brain, to monitor the disease progression and to quantify the effect of drug intervention. A triple transgenic mouse model of AD closely resembles human AD neuropathology. In this study, we investigated age-dependent alterations of the axonal transport rate in the triple transgenic mouse olfactory system, using fast multi-sliced T(1) mapping with manganese-enhanced MRI. The data show that impairment in axonal transport is a very early event in AD pathology in these mice, preceding both deposition of Abeta plaques and formation of Tau fibrils.
