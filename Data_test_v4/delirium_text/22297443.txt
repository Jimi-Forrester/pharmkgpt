22297443|a|Many pesticides used in agriculture have a negative effect on organisms. The group of hazardous pesticides includes the cholinesterase inhibitor bendiocarbamate. According to literature, bendiocarbamate has relatively low toxicity in mammals and vertebrates in general, since it does accumulate in their tissues and the cholinesterase activity returns to norm within 24 h after acute exposure. The present study focused on the influence of bendiocarbamate on rabbit thymus after its administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (BW) for the period of 3 months. The thymus was observed for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)-positive nerve fibers visualized by histochemical methods. Microscopic findings of BuChE-positive nerve fibers show the same density and the topography by the experimental and the control animals. On the other hand, AChE-positive nerve fibers in experimental animals after administration of bendiocarbamate is only poorly identified, suggesting that bendiocarbamate inhibits AChE but not BuChE.
