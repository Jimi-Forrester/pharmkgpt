29562540|t|Amsterdam Dementia Cohort: Performing Research to Optimize Care.
29562540|a|The Alzheimer center of the VU University Medical Center opened in 2000 and was initiated to combine both patient care and research. Together, to date, all patients forming the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort number almost 6,000 individuals. In this cohort profile, we provide an overview of the results produced based on the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. We describe the main results over the years in each of these research lines: 1) early diagnosis, 2) heterogeneity, and 3) vascular factors. Among the most important research efforts that have also impacted patients' lives and/or the research field, we count the development of novel, easy to use diagnostic measures such as visual rating scales for MRI and the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire, insight in different subgroups of AD, and findings on incidence and clinical sequelae of microbleeds. Finally, we describe in the outlook how our research endeavors have improved the lives of our patients.
