24375574|a|OBJECTIVES: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that vascular risk factors (VRFs) contribute to cognitive impairment in the elderly population. Prevention and administration of VRFs can be a vital strategy for delaying cognitive impairment. This study aimed to determine the impact of VRFs on cognitive function of the aged people from Chongqing, Southwest China. METHODS: A total of 597 participants (>=60 years) from hospital and community population were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Participants were screened for hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Blood pressure (BP) and blood lipid were also measured. Cognitive function was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating. Logistic regression analysis was used to look for VRFs impacting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Then we investigated the relationship between different types of vascular diseases and MCI. RESULTS: A total of 457 participants showed normal cognitive function and 140 participants showed MCI. After adjusting for age, gender, and education, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hypertension, CHD, systolic BP, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were independently associated with MCI; however, CVD, diastolic BP, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not associated with MCI. Moreover, vascular diseases significantly contributed to MCI compared with no vascular disease; however, no significant difference in incident MCI was found among different combinations of vascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension, CHD, TC, and LDL-C are independent risk factors for MCI. Moreover, patients with vascular diseases have a higher risk of MCI; however, the amount of vascular diseases does not increase the risk of MCI.
