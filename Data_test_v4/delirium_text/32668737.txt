32668737|a|The BC-box motif in suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6) promotes the neuronal differentiation of somatic stem cells, including epidermal stem cells. SOCS6 protein belongs to the group of SOCS proteins and inhibits cytokine signaling. Here we showed that epidermal stem cells were induced to differentiate into GABAnergic neurons by the intracellular delivery of a peptide composed of the amino-acid sequences encoded by the BC-box motif in SOCS6 protein. The BC-box motif (SLQYLCRFVI) in SOCS6 corresponded to the binding site of elongin BC. GABAnergic differentiation mediated by the BC-box motif in SOCS6 protein was caused by ubiquitination of JAK2 and inhibition of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, GABAnergic neuron-like cells generated from epidermal stem cells were transplanted into the brain of a rodent ischemic model. Then, we demonstrated that these transplanted cells were GAD positive and that the cognitive function of the ischemic model rodents with the transplanted cells was improved. This study could contribute to not only elucidating the mechanism of GABAnergic neuronal differentiation but also to neuronal regenerative medicine utilizing GABAnergic neurons.
