28485663|t|Can 8 months of daily tDCS application slow the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease? A case study.
28485663|a|This case study presents a patient with early-onset Alzheimer`s disease, who applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) daily for 8 consecutive months. This was a much higher frequency than previous tDCS studies. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted before the first tDCS session, after 5 months and after 8 months. After 8 months, the patient's immediate recall improved with 39%, whereas delayed recall improved 23%. Overall, the results revealed that patient's cognitive functions were stabilized. There may be slight possibility that tDCS could slow the cognitive decline in Alzheimer`s disease. This should be investigated in clinical trials.
