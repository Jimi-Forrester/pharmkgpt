37092449|t|Establishment and Functional Characterization of Murine Monoclonal Antibodies Recognizing Neuritin.
37092449|a|Neuritin represents a neurotrophic factor that is not only important in neuronal development and plasticity but also impacts endothelial angiogenesis, cell migration, tumor growth and the production of antibodies by B cells. We established monoclonal mouse anti-mouse neuritin antibodies by immunizing knock-out mice with two different neuritin-derived peptides. Because neuritin is well conserved between species, these new monoclonal antibodies recognize the neuritin of a wide variety of species, including human. Moreover, they not only recognize specifically surface-bound neuritin expressed by murine follicular regulatory T cells but also the block binding of recombinant neuritin to germinal center B cells. This suggests that these newly generated tools will be of great use in studying neuritin expression and function.
