38234393|t|Feasibility Study of the Boston Naming Test for the Arab Population.
38234393|a|Introduction The Boston Naming Test (BNT) is a widely used US neuropsychological evaluation of confrontation naming for the examination of adults and children with learning disabilities and diagnosis of communication disorders, aphasia, dementia, and acquired brain injury or dysfunction. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the practicality of the original English version of the 60-item BNT (BNT-60) on an Arab population and the need for a new adaptive Arabic version sensitive to cultural biases and to offer normative data that can serve as a reference for researchers and clinicians in the Gulf region, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Data relating to the familiarity degree of the BNT-60 were also collected. Methods This research involved 105 randomly selected and cognitively healthy college students who were native Arabic speakers recruited in Jeddah. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was administered with a cutoff score of 26. The participants were examined for naming accuracy, naming agreement, and familiarity in using the BNT-60. The data were then analyzed and compared with the findings from studies conducted in the United States. Results The BNT-60 was administered to 105 university students from the KSA, and the results were compared with the BNT-60 booklet norms (second edition). Their average performance was noticeably below the norms established by the original test standards. Compared with the participants in the US studies, the participants made approximately 65% more errors on the items including pretzel, wreath, beaver, harmonica, acorn, stilts, harp, hammock, knocker, pelican, muzzle, unicorn, funnel, accordion, asparagus, tripod, yoke, and trellis and 25% more errors on the items including seahorse, dart, igloo, sphinx, palette, and abacus. The item "boomerang" was not compared with the US sample because of differences in the version of the BNT, but the errors in naming this item were as frequent as those in naming the other misrecognized items. The internal consistency among the items' degrees of familiarity was also very high (alpha = 0.966), and a significant connection (r = 0.837, P < 0.001) was observed between object familiarity and naming accuracy. The Arabic-speaking population in the KSA and English-speaking population in the United States showed very different levels of familiarity with numerous items. Conclusion The participants' familiarity with the BNT objects varied depending on their culture and impacted their naming accuracy and overall scores on the test. Accordingly, the possibility of cultural biases should be considered when administering the BNT to the population of the KSA and the possibility of making changes so that the test better reflects the Arab culture as suggested.
