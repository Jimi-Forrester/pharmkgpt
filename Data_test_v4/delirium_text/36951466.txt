36951466|t|[C]PBB3 binding in Abeta(-) or Abeta(+) Corticobasal syndrome.
36951466|a|BACKGROUND: Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is associated with 4-repeat tauopathy and/or Alzheimer's disease pathologies. OBJECTIVES: To examine tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in CBS patients using positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: Eight CBS patients and three healthy individuals lacking amyloid pathology underwent PET with [C]PBB3 for tau imaging, and [C]AZD2184 for Abeta. Subcortical and cortical binding of [C]PBB3 was compared between Abeta(-) and Abeta(+) CBS patients and reference group. Postmortem analysis was done in one CBS patient. RESULTS: Three CBS patients were considered Abeta(+). Total binding was higher in all patients compared to the reference group. Similar regional binding profiles of [C]PBB3 in Abeta(+) and Abeta(-) CBS patients were found. Elevated [C]PBB3 binding in pallidum was observed in all CBS patients. Cortical [C]PBB3 binding was higher in Abeta(+) compared to Abeta(-) patients. Postmortem analysis of a CBS patient revealed corticobasal degeneration neuropathology and [C]PBB3 autofluorescence in some tau-positive structures. CONCLUSIONS: [C]PBB3 is elevated in CBS patients with binding in relevant areas capturing some, but not all, 4-repeat tauopathy in CBS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
