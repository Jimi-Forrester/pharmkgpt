34277281|t|Neuroimaging in Dementia With Lewy Bodies.
34277281|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common forms of dementia. It can present as neurocognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and concomitant symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. Early diagnosis remains one of the cornerstones of managing this form of neurocognitive disorder but, often, making an early and accurate diagnosis can prove to be challenging. For this article, our goal was to review the utility of various neuroimaging modalities in making a swift and accurate diagnosis of DLB. We used PubMed to look for helpful, informative, and peer-reviewed articles. We discussed the role of a plethora of different imaging techniques, ranging from structural imaging like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to molecular imaging (single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission to- tomography) as a diagnostic tool for DLB. We arrived at the conclusion that these novel neuroimaging modalities have already proven to be very helpful in ruling out differentials and making an early diagnosis of DLB. However, ongoing research is required to increase the diagnostic accuracy, leading to the early identification and treatment of DLB.
