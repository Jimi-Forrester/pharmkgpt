39987269|t|Perioperative assessment and management of frailty in elderly patients: a national survey of Italian anesthesiologists.
39987269|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of frailty is increasing as the global population continues to age. Frailty is associated with poor perioperative outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to examine current practices and perspectives of anesthesiogists in Italy on the provision of care for elderly surgical patients with frailty. METHODS: We conducted a national survey. Data were collected via an online questionnaire distributed by the Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI). Responses were collected over 24 weeks between October 2022 and March 2023. RESULTS: Seven-hundred thirteen anesthetists completed the survey. A total of 39.8% (277) of respondents were working in university hospitals. Frailty scoring was routinely performed in 51.8% of care settings. Only 26.3% of organizations surveyed had a dedicated pathway for perioperative management of frail elderly patients. The most common method for frailty assessment was the subjective assessment by the anesthesiologist (58.3%). More than half of the participants reported the use of ERAS items in most cases. Almost half of respondents reported the use of postoperative screening tools for delirium (45% of respondents). DISCUSSION: While these results point to the resistance to clinical implementation of frailty assessment, they also highlight the perceived need for careful management. This can help in identifying elderly patients who may require targeted perioperative management and in ensuring the preservation of cognitive and functional status.
