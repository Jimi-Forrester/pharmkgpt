31440456|a|Rotenone is a natural pesticide and environmental neurotoxin which mimics key aspects of Parkinson's disease. This study evaluated the effect of ethyl acetate extract of Capsicum annuum L. (C. annuum) in rotenone-intoxicated rats. Oral doses of C. annuum extract (50, 100 & 200 mg kg-1) and rotenone (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) were co-administered for 25 days during which rearing behavior was monitored. Biochemical alterations in the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), monoamine oxidase (MAO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH) were estimated. Decrease in rearing behavior resulting from rotenone exposure was ameliorated by 200 mg kg-1 of C. annuum. Furthermore, rotenone exposure significantly (P < 0.05) decreased TH and increased MAO levels respectively. Impaired brain antioxidant capacity, typified by significantly (P < 0.05) decreased GSH redox status and SOD levels were also observed in rotenone-treated rats. However, co-administration of C. annuum ameliorated rotenone-induced derangements and potentiated the effect of levodopa. These results taken together suggests that C. annuum protects against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity by modulating dopamine metabolism and GSH redox status in rat brain.
