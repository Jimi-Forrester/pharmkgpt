17452943|a|INTRODUCTION: DNA microarray is a powerful technology which can rapidly provide a high throughput and detailed view of the entire genome and transcriptome. In this review we discuss the basic principles behind gene expression microarrays, CGH arrays and DNA microarray genotyping, and their potential applications to neurological diseases. STATE OF THE ART: Microarray gene expression profiling is a reliable technology that has already been used with great success in the molecular classification of cancer. It is a very promising technology in the field of Neurooncology. One of the interesting characteristics of DNA microarrays is also that they can be used in a non-hypothesis-driven manner to discover new genomic characteristics that will enable to establish new pathophysiological hypotheses. Such a strategy has already yielded interesting new insights in the study of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease or neuromuscular diseases. With DNA microarray genotyping it is now possible to detect mutations in many genes simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: In Neurooncology DNA microarrays should help to establish a more accurate classification of brain tumors and recent studies have shown how gene expression profiling of brain tumors allows to uncover previously unrecognized patient subsets that differ in their survival. The applications of microarrays for the study of neurological diseases, like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease or neuromuscular diseases are also promising both for generating new pathophysiological hypotheses and for enabling new molecular classifications. DNA microarray genotyping is a powerful technology that should help to discover genetic factors associated with multifactorial neurological disorders and help to diagnose complex neurogenetic diseases. This technology should also facilitate the realization of pharmacogenomic studies in neurological diseases.
