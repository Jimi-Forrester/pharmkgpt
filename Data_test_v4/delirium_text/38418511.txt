38418511|a|The rise in the global population of older adults underscores the significance to investigate age-related cognitive disorders and develop early treatment modalities. Previous research suggests that non-invasive transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) can moderately improve cognitive decline in older adults. However, non-declarative cognition has received relatively less attention. This study investigates whether repeated (16-day) bilateral theta-gamma cross-frequency tACS targeting the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) enhances non-declarative memory. Computerized cognitive training was applied alongside stimulation to control for the state-of-the-brain. The Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task was employed to assess non-declarative functions such as visuomotor skill and probabilistic sequence learning. Results from 35 participants aged 55-82 indicated that active tACS led to more substantial improvements in visuomotor skills immediately after treatment, which persisted 3 months later, compared to sham tACS. Treatment benefit was more pronounced in older adults of younger age and those with pre-existing cognitive decline. However, neither intervention group exhibited modulation of probabilistic sequence learning. These results suggest that repeated theta-gamma tACS can selectively improve distinct non-declarative cognitive aspects when targeting the DLPFC. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of tACS in addressing deficits in learning and retaining general skills, which could have a positive impact on the quality of life for cognitively impaired older individuals by preserving independence in daily activities.
