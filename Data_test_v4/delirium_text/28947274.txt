28947274|a|BACKGROUND: Post-operative delirium is associated with increased short term morbidity and mortality. Limited data exists on long term outcomes for older adults with postoperative delirium. We hypothesize that postoperative delirium is associated with increased 5-year mortality. METHODS: Patients >=50 years undergoing elective operations with planned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were prospectively enrolled. The Confusion Assessment Method ICU (CAM-ICU) was used to diagnose delirium. The primary outcome variable was 5-year mortality. RESULTS: 172 patients were enrolled with an average age of 64 years. The overall incidence of delirium was 44% (75/172). At 5-years post-operatively, mortality was higher (59%, 41/70) in patients with delirium compared to patients without delirium (13%, 12/94, p < 0.001). These results remained true after multivariable risk adjustment, showing the odds of five year mortality following delirium were 7.35 fold greater (95% CI: 1.49-36.18). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is associated with increased long term mortality.
