33500491|a|Brain radiation can occur from treatment of brain tumors or accidental exposures. Brain radiation has been rarely considered, though, as a possible tool to alter protein levels involved in neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed possible molecular and neuropathology changes of phosphorylated-Tau (pTau), all-Tau forms, beta-tubulin, amyloid precursor protein (APP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1), myelin basic protein (MBP), and GAP43 in Frontal Cortex (FC), Hippocampus (H) and Cerebellum (CRB) of swine brains following total-body low-dose radiation (1.79 Gy). Our data show that radiated-animals had lower levels of pTau in FC and H, APP in H and CRB, GAP43 in CRB, and higher level of GFAP in H versus sham-animals. These molecular changes were not accompanied by obvious neurohistological changes, except for astrogliosis in the H. These findings are novel, and might open new perspectives on brain radiation as a potential tool to interfere with the accumulation of specific proteins linked to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders.
