33108925|a|BACKGROUND: Palliative sedation has been used to refer to the practice of providing symptom control through the administration of sedative drugs. The objective of this article was to characterise palliative sedation use in inpatients at a medium-stay palliative care unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 125 randomly selected patients (aged 15 or older) who had died in 2014. The Palliative Performance Scale was used to evaluate the functional status. RESULTS: Palliative sedation was documented in 34.4% of the patients and midazolam was the most commonly used sedative agent (86.0%). More than half (53.5%) of those who recieved sedation presented with delirium. Liver dysfunction was more frequent in the sedated patients (p=0.033) and patients with heart disease were less likely (p=0.026) to be sedated. CONCLUSION: Palliative sedation is an ethically accepted practice. It was commonly midazolam-induced, and differences were documented, among sedated and non-sedated patients, in terms of liver dysfunction and heart disease.
