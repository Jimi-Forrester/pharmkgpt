35570825|t|Identification of microRNA-mRNA regulatory network associated with oxidative DNA damage in human astrocytes.
35570825|a|The high lipid content of the brain, coupled with its heavy oxygen dependence and relatively weak antioxidant system, makes it highly susceptible to oxidative DNA damage that contributes to neurodegeneration. This study is aimed at identifying specific ROS-responsive miRNAs that modulate the expression and activity of the DNA repair proteins in human astrocytes, which could serve as potential biomarkers and lead to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases. Oxidative DNA damage was established after treatment of human astrocytes with 10muM sodium dichromate for 16 h. Comet assay analysis indicated a significant increase in oxidized guanine lesions. RT-qPCR and ELISA assays confirmed that sodium dichromate reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of the human base-excision repair enzyme, 8-deoxyguanosine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1). Small RNAseq data were generated on an Ion Torrent  system and the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using Partek Flow  software. The biologically significant miRNAs were selected using miRNet 2.0. Oxidative-stress-induced DNA damage was associated with a significant decrease in miRNA expression: 231 downregulated miRNAs and 2 upregulated miRNAs (p < 0.05; >2-fold). In addition to identifying multiple miRNA-mRNA pairs involved in DNA repair processes, this study uncovered a novel miRNA-mRNA pair interaction: miR-1248:OGG1. Inhibition of miR-1248 via the transfection of its inhibitor restored the expression levels of hOGG1. Therefore, targeting the identified microRNA candidates could ameliorate the nuclear DNA damage caused by the brain's exposure to mutagens, reduce the incidence and improve the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
