39129222|a|INTRODUCTION: In older adults, where sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment are common, mounting evidence suggests a potential connection between sleep and cognitive function, highlighting the significance of utilizing sleep as a biomarker for early detection of cognitive impairment to improve clinical outcomes in a noninvasive, cost-effective manner. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the relationship between sleep and cognitive function in older adults, encompassing both subjective and objective measures of sleep quality, duration, architecture, and sleep-disordered breathing. The authors consider the directionality of the associations observed in prospective and cross-sectional studies, exploring whether sleep disturbances precede cognitive decline or vice versa. Furthermore, they discuss the potential bidirectional relationships between sleep and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risks in older adults while also examining the neurodegenerative pathways of this relationship. EXPERT OPINION: Routine sleep monitoring in primary care settings has the potential to bolster early detection and treatment of sleep disturbance, and by extension, reduce the risk of dementia. Improving sleep assessment tools, such as wearables, provide scalable alternatives to traditional methods like polysomnography, potentially enabling widespread monitoring of sleep characteristics. Standardized measurement and inclusive participant recruitment are needed to enhance generalizability, while longitudinal studies are essential to understand the interaction between sleep and AD pathology.
