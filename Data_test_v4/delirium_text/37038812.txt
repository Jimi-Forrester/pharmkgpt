37038812|a|BACKGROUND: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is helpful in early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with advantages including no exposure to radioactivity, no injection of a contrast agent, more accessible, and relatively less expensive. OBJECTIVE: To establish the perfusion pattern of different dementia in Chinese population and evaluate the effectiveness of ASL in differentiating AD from cognitive unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). METHODS: Four groups of participants were enrolled, including AD, FTD, MCI, and CU based on clinical diagnosis from PUMCH dementia cohort. ASL image was collected using 3D spiral fast spin echo-based pseudo-continuous ASL pulse sequence with background suppression and a high resolution T1-weighted scan covering the whole brain. Data processing was performed using Dr. Brain Platform to get cerebral blood flow (ml/100g/min) in every region of interest cortices. RESULTS: Participants included 66 AD, 26 FTD, 21 MCI, and 21 CU. Statistically, widespread hypoperfusion neocortices, most significantly in temporal-parietal-occipital cortices, but not hippocampus and subcortical nucleus were found in AD. Hypoperfusion in parietal lobe was most significantly associated with cognitive decline in AD. Hypoperfusion in parietal lobe was found in MCI and extended to adjacent temporal, occipital and posterior cingulate cortices in AD. Significant reduced perfusion in frontal and temporal cortices, including subcortical nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex were found in FTD. Hypoperfusion regions were relatively symmetrical in AD and left predominant especially in FTD. CONCLUSION: Specific patterns of ASL hypoperfusion were helpful in differentiating AD from CU, MCI, and FTD.
