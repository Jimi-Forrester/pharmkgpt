36947950|a|BACKGROUND: The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents the most recent global healthcare crisis. While all healthcare systems suffered facing the immense burden of critically-ill COVID-19 patients, the levels of preparedness and adaptability differed highly between countries. AIM: to describe resource mobilization throughout the COVID-19 waves in Tunisian University Medical Intensive Care Units (MICUs) and to identify discrepancies in preparedness between the provided and required resource. METHODS: This is a longitudinal retrospective multicentre observational study conducted between March 2020 and May 2022 analyzing data from eight University MICUs. Data were collected at baseline and at each bed expansion period in relation to the nation's four COVID-19 waves. Data collected included epidemiological, organizational and management trends and outcomes of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 admissions. RESULTS: MICU-beds increased from 66 to a maximum of 117 beds. This was possible thanks to equipping pre-existing non-functional MICU beds (n = 20) and creating surge ICU-beds in medical wards (n = 24). MICU nurses increased from 53 to 200 of which 99 non-ICU nurses, by deployment from other departments and temporary recruitment. The nurse-to-MICU-bed ratio increased from 1:1 to around 1 8:1. Only 55% of beds were single rooms, 80% were equipped with ICU ventilators. These MICUs managed to admit a total of 3368 critically-ill patients (15% of hospital admissions). 33 2% of COVID-19-related intra-hospital deaths occurred within the MICUs. CONCLUSION: Despite a substantial increase in resource mobilization during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current study identified significant persisting discrepancies between supplied and required resource, at least partially explaining the poor overall prognosis of critically-ill COVID-19 patients.
