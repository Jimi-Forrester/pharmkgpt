36984520|t|Risk Factors for Emergency Department Presentations after the Initiation of Opioid Analgesics in Non-Cancer Patients in Korea: A Nationwide Study.
36984520|a|Background and Objectives: Opioid use in Korea is lower than in other developed countries. However, recent studies have reported an increase in opioid prescriptions and the number of chronic opioid users. The current status of adverse events (AEs) associated with opioid analgesics in Korea is unclear. This nested case-control study aimed to evaluate the influence of opioid analgesic use patterns on all emergency department (ED) visits and opioid-related ED visits after opioid analgesic initiation using the national claims database. Materials and Methods: Adult non-cancer patients who initiated non-injectable opioid analgesics (NIOA) between January 2017 and June 2018 were included. We defined the case group as patients who visited the ED within six months of opioid initiation, and the control group was selected in a 1:1 ratio using an exact matching method. Results: A total of 97,735 patients (13.58%) visited the ED within six months of NIOA initiation. Nearly 32% of cases were linked to opioid-related AEs. The most frequent AEs were falls and fractures (61.27%). After adjusting for covariates, opioid initiation at the ED was associated with all-cause or opioid-related ED visits (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.09-3.29; aOR = 3.82, 95% CI = 3.62-4.04, respectively). Chronic NIOA use was associated with all-cause and opioid-related ED visits (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.23-1.40; aOR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.39-1.76, respectively). Conclusion: This study found that 13% of non-cancer patients visited the ED within six months of NIOA initiation. In addition, the NIOA use pattern was significantly associated with all-cause and opioid-related ED visits.
