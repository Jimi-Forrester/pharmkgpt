36694233|t|Diagnosis, pathophysiology and preventive strategies for cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury: a narrative review.
36694233|a|Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of cardiac surgery and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, accompanied by a substantial economic burden. The pathogenesis of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is multifactorial and complex, with a variety of pathophysiological theories. In addition to the existing diagnostic criteria, the exploration and validation of biomarkers is the focus of research in the field of CSA-AKI diagnosis. Prevention remains the key to the management of CSA-AKI, and common strategies include maintenance of renal perfusion, individualized blood pressure targets, balanced fluid management, goal-directed oxygen delivery, and avoidance of nephrotoxins. This article reviews the pathogenesis, definition and diagnosis, and pharmacological and nonpharmacological prevention strategies of AKI in cardiac surgical patients.
