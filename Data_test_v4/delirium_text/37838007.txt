37838007|a|Progranulin is a secreted pro-protein that has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects and is necessary for maintaining lysosomal function. Mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia. Most pathogenic GRN mutations cause progranulin haploinsufficiency, so boosting progranulin levels is a promising therapeutic strategy. Progranulin is constitutively secreted, then taken up and trafficked to lysosomes. Before being taken up from the extracellular space, progranulin interacts with receptors that may mediate anti-inflammatory and growth factor-like effects. Modifying progranulin trafficking is a viable approach to boosting progranulin, but progranulin secretion and uptake by cells in the brain is poorly understood and may involve distinct mechanisms from other parts of the body. Understanding the cell types and processes that regulate extracellular progranulin in the brain could provide insight into progranulin's mechanism of action and inform design of progranulin-boosting therapies. To address this question we used microdialysis to measure progranulin in interstitial fluid (ISF) of mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Grn+/- mice had approximately 50% lower ISF progranulin than wild-type mice, matching the reduction of progranulin in cortical tissue. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence confirmed that microglia and neurons are the major progranulin-expressing cell types in the mPFC. Studies of conditional microglial (Mg-KO) and neuronal (N-KO) Grn knockout mice revealed that loss of progranulin from either cell type results in approximately 50% reduction in ISF progranulin. LPS injection (i.p.) produced an acute increase in ISF progranulin in mPFC. Depolarizing cells with KCl increased ISF progranulin, but this response was not altered in N-KO mice, indicating progranulin secretion by non-neuronal cells. Increasing neuronal activity with picrotoxin did not increase ISF progranulin. These data indicate that microglia and neurons are the source of most ISF progranulin in mPFC, with microglia likely secreting more progranulin per cell than neurons. The acute increase in ISF progranulin after LPS treatment is consistent with a role for extracellular progranulin in regulating inflammation, and may have been driven by microglia or peripheral immune cells. Finally, these data indicate that mPFC neurons engage in constitutive progranulin secretion that is not acutely changed by neuronal activity.
