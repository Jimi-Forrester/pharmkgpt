607798|t|Fat embolism syndrome in delirium tremens.
607798|a|Delirium tremens in a common feature in the alcoholic population. The Fat Embolism Syndrome (FES) is characterized by fever, encephalopathy, respiratory failure and skin petechiae. Fat embolism has been associated with alcoholics but the diagnosis was apparent only at autopsy. We present an alcoholic male who developed delirium tremens unresponsive to therapy, followed by features of the FES. Asterixis and Korsakoff's psychosis are newly described features of this syndrome. Corticosteroids were a definitive therapy in this case.
