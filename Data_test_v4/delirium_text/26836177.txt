26836177|t|Prevention Trials in Alzheimer's Disease: Current Status and Future Perspectives.
26836177|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Over the past 20 years, both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions have been studied for AD prevention, but the overall results have been disappointing. The majority of disappointing results have raised questions and great challenges for the future of AD prevention trials. Ongoing advances in the knowledge of pathogenesis, in the identification of novel targets, in improved outcome measures, and in identification and validation of biomarkers may lead to effective strategies for AD prevention. In this paper, we review the selection of participants and interventions, trial design, outcome assessments, and promising biomarkers in prevention trials, and summarize the lessons learned from completed trials and perspectives from ongoing trials in AD prevention. Selection of optimal participants and interventions, coupled with more refined outcomes and more efficient trial design, may have the capacity to deliver a new era of preventive discovery in this challenging area.
