36430920|t|The Crosstalk between HepG2 and HMC-III Cells: In Vitro Modulation of Gene Expression with Conditioned Media.
36430920|a|Epidemiological studies have postulated an inverse correlation between developing cancer and neurodegeneration. It is known that the secretome plays a vital role in cell-cell communication in health and disease; the microglia is the resident macrophage of the central nervous system which maintains neuronal integrity by adapting as the microenvironment changes. The present study aimed to identify, in a cell model, biomarkers that link neurodegenerative diseases to cancer or vice versa. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were used to characterize the effects on gene and protein expression of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) and human microglia (HMC-III) cells after exchanging part of their conditioned medium. Biomarkers of the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitophagy and inflammatory processes were evaluated. In both cell types, we observed the activation of cytoprotective mechanisms against any potential pro-oxidant or pro-inflammatory signals present in secretomes. In contrast, HepG2 but not HMC-III cells seem to trigger autophagic processes following treatment with conditioned medium of microglia, thus suggesting a cell-specific adaptive response.
