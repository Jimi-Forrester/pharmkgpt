33863320|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) has been found to increase the risk of postoperative complications in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD). However, few studies have investigated this by directly comparing patients with PD and those without PD. METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we reviewed all surgically treated ASD patients with at least 2 years of follow-up. Among them, 27 had PD (PD+ group). Clinical data were collected on early and late postoperative complications as well as any revision surgery. Radiographic parameters were evaluated before and immediately after surgery and at final follow-up, including sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral slope, and pelvic tilt. We compared the surgical outcomes and radiographic parameters of PD patients with those of non-PD patients. RESULTS: For early complications, the PD+ group demonstrated a higher rate of delirium than the PD- group. In terms of late complications, the rate of non-union was significantly higher in the PD+ group. Rates of rod failure and revision surgery due to mechanical complications also tended to be higher, but not significantly, in the PD+ group (p = 0.17, p = 0.13, respectively). SVA at final follow-up and loss of correction in SVA were significantly higher in the PD+ group. CONCLUSION: Extra attention should be paid to perioperative complications, especially delirium, in PD patients undergoing surgery for ASD. Furthermore, loss of correction and rate of non-union were greater in these patients.
