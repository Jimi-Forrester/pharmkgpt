24839913|t|Clinical profiles of dementia with Lewy bodies with and without Alzheimer's disease-like hypometabolism.
24839913|a|OBJECTIVES: It is well known that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type pathology is commonly present in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) brains and that the degree of AD-type pathology has an influence on the clinical characteristics of DLB. Although significant hypometabolism in the temporoparietal/precuneus on [(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans is considered to support a diagnosis of AD, some DLB patients also exhibit this metabolic pattern. The clinical significance of the metabolic pattern on DLB remains unknown. METHODS: Twenty-three DLB patients, 10 AD patients, and 11 controls underwent (18)F-FDG PET scans. According to the degree of hypometabolism in the parietal/precuneus regions, representing the AD-like metabolic pattern, 12 patients were placed in the DLB-AD(+) group and 11 patients were placed in the DLB-AD(-) group. The demographics and clinical variables were compared among the four groups. RESULTS: In addition to the parietal/precuneus regions, the DLB-AD(+) group exhibited significantly greater posterior cingulate hypometabolism than the DLB-AD(-) group, although occipital metabolism did not differ. The prevalence of visual hallucinations and extracampine hallucinations, and the Bender-Gestalt test score were significantly higher in the DLB-AD(+) group than the DLB-AD(-) group, although there were no differences in the demographics and other examined clinical variables between the two DLB groups. These clinical differences were absent in the DLB-AD(-) group, AD group, and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Parietal/precuneus hypometabolism may be associated with clinical characteristics in DLB patients. Further multiple imaging modalities that are sensitive to AD-type pathology are needed to reveal the neurobiological basis of the AD-like metabolic pattern.
