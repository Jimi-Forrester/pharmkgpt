31601189|a|BACKGROUND: Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) use has been studied in a variety of older adult populations across the world. We sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of PIM use in older drivers. METHODS: We applied the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria to baseline data collected from the "brown-bag" review of medications for participants of the Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) study to examine the prevalence and correlates of PIM use in a geographically diverse, community-dwelling sample of older drivers (n = 2949). Proportions of participants who used one or more PIMs according to the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria, and estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PIM use associated with participant characteristics were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 18.5% of the older drivers studied used one or more PIM. The most commonly used therapeutic category of PIM was benzodiazepines (accounting for 16.6% of the total PIMs identified), followed by nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (15.2%), antidepressants (15.2%), and first-generation antihistamines (10.5%). Compared to older drivers on four or fewer medications, the adjusted ORs of PIM use were 2.43 (95% CI 1.68-3.51) for those on 5-7 medications, 4.19 (95% CI 2.95-5.93) for those on 8-11 medications, and 8.01 (95% CI 5.71-11.23) for those on >=12 medications. Older drivers who were female, white, or living in urban areas were at significantly heightened risk of PIM use. CONCLUSION: About one in five older drivers uses PIMs. Commonly used PIMs are medications known to impair driving ability and increase crash risk. Implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce PIM use in older drivers may confer both health and safety benefits. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.
