33918416|t|S100A4 in the Physiology and Pathology of the Central and Peripheral Nervous System.
33918416|a|S100A4 is a member of the large family of S100 proteins, exerting a broad range of intracellular and extracellular functions that vary upon different cellular contexts. While S100A4 has long been implicated mainly in tumorigenesis and metastatization, mounting evidence shows that S100A4 is a key player in promoting pro-inflammatory phenotypes and organ pro-fibrotic pathways in the liver, kidney, lung, heart, tendons, and synovial tissues. Regarding the nervous system, there is still limited information concerning S100A4 presence and function. It was observed that S100A4 exerts physiological roles contributing to neurogenesis, cellular motility and chemotaxis, cell differentiation, and cell-to cell communication. Furthermore, S100A4 is likely to participate to numerous pathological processes of the nervous system by affecting the functions of astrocytes, microglia, infiltrating cells and neurons and thereby modulating inflammation and immune reactions, fibrosis as well as neuronal plasticity and survival. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge concerning the localization, deregulation, and possible functions of S100A4 in the physiology of the central and peripheral nervous system. Furthermore, we highlight S100A4 as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and acute injuries.
