26981075|t|SCYL pseudokinases in neuronal function and survival.
26981075|a|The generation of mice lacking SCYL1 or SCYL2 and the identification of Scyl1 as the causative gene in the motor neuron disease mouse model muscle deficient (Scyl1(mdf/mdf) ) demonstrated the importance of the SCY1-like family of protein pseudokinases in neuronal function and survival. Several essential cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking and nuclear tRNA export are thought to be regulated by SCYL proteins. However, whether deregulation of these processes contributes to the neurodegenerative processes associated with the loss of SCYL proteins is still unclear. Here, I briefly review the evidence supporting that SCYL proteins play a role in these processes and discuss their possible involvement in the neuronal functions of SCYL proteins. I also propose ways to determine the importance of these pathways for the functions of SCYL proteins in vivo.
