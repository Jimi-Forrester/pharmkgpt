34177047|t|Should we treat pain in the elderly palliative care cancer patients differently?
34177047|a|Opioids are considered the cornerstone of pain management in palliative care. Available data suggest that older patients use different analgesics and lower opioid doses compared to younger patients. However, it has not been elucidated yet whether such dosing is associated with worse pain levels or shorter survival in the palliative care setting. We evaluated the relationship among pain scores, quality of life, opioid dose, and survival in palliative care cancer patients in a hospice setting. A total of 137 palliative care cancer patients were analyzed prospectively. We divided patients into two groups using the age of 65 as a cut-off value. Younger patients exhibited significantly higher pain ratings (5.14 vs. 3.59, p=0.01), although older patients used almost 20 mg less oral morphine equivalent (OME) on arrival (p=0.36) and 55 mg OME/day less during the last week (p=0.03). There were no differences in survival between the two groups (17.36 vs. 17.58 days). The elderly patients also used nonsteroidal analgesics less often and paracetamol more often. Hence, using lower opioid doses in older palliative care cancer patients does not result in worse pain rating, and could be a plausible approach for pain management in this patient group.
