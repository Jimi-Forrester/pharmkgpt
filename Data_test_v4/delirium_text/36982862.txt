36982862|t|The Drp1-Mediated Mitochondrial Fission Protein Interactome as an Emerging Core Player in Mitochondrial Dynamics and Cardiovascular Disease Therapy.
36982862|a|Mitochondria, the membrane-bound cell organelles that supply most of the energy needed for cell function, are highly regulated, dynamic organelles bearing the ability to alter both form and functionality rapidly to maintain normal physiological events and challenge stress to the cell. This amazingly vibrant movement and distribution of mitochondria within cells is controlled by the highly coordinated interplay between mitochondrial dynamic processes and fission and fusion events, as well as mitochondrial quality-control processes, mainly mitochondrial autophagy (also known as mitophagy). Fusion connects and unites neighboring depolarized mitochondria to derive a healthy and distinct mitochondrion. In contrast, fission segregates damaged mitochondria from intact and healthy counterparts and is followed by selective clearance of the damaged mitochondria via mitochondrial specific autophagy, i.e., mitophagy. Hence, the mitochondrial processes encompass all coordinated events of fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis for sustaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Accumulated evidence strongly suggests that mitochondrial impairment has already emerged as a core player in the pathogenesis, progression, and development of various human diseases, including cardiovascular ailments, the leading causes of death globally, which take an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. The crucial factor governing the fission process is the recruitment of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase that regulates mitochondrial fission, from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane in a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent manner, where it is oligomerized and self-assembles into spiral structures. In this review, we first aim to describe the structural elements, functionality, and regulatory mechanisms of the key mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1, and other mitochondrial fission adaptor proteins, including mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), mitochondrial dynamics 49 (Mid49), and mitochondrial dynamics 51 (Mid51). The core area of the review focuses on the recent advances in understanding the role of the Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission adaptor protein interactome to unravel the missing links of mitochondrial fission events. Lastly, we discuss the promising mitochondria-targeted therapeutic approaches that involve fission, as well as current evidence on Drp1-mediated fission protein interactions and their critical roles in the pathogeneses of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
