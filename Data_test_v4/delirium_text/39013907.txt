39013907|a|Neuronal activity undergoes significant changes during vigilance states, accompanied by an accommodation of energy demands. While the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle has shown that lactate is the primary energy substrate for sustaining neuronal activity in multiple brain regions, its role in regulating sleep/wake architecture is not fully understood. Here we investigated the involvement of astrocytic lactate supply in maintaining consolidated wakefulness by downregulating, in a cell-specific manner, the expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) in the lateral hypothalamus of transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that reduced expression of MCT4 in astrocytes disrupts lactate supply to wake-promoting orexin neurons, impairing wakefulness stability. Additionally, we show that MCT2-mediated lactate uptake is necessary for maintaining tonic firing of orexin neurons and stabilizing wakefulness. Our findings provide both in vivo and in vitro evidence supporting the role of astrocyte-to-orexinergic neuron lactate shuttle in regulating proper sleep/wake stability.
