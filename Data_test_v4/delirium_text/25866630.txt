25866630|t|Chaperoned amyloid proteins for immune manipulation: alpha-Synuclein/Hsp70 shifts immunity toward a modulatory phenotype.
25866630|a|alpha-Synuclein (alphaSyn) is a 140-residue amyloid-forming protein whose aggregation is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). It has also been found to play a critical role in the immune imbalance that accompanies disease progression, a characteristic that has prompted the search for an effective alphaSyn-based immunotherapy. In this study, we have simultaneously exploited two important features of certain heat-shock proteins (HSPs): their classical "chaperone" activities and their recently discovered and diverse "immunoactive" properties. In particular, we have explored the immune response elicited by immunization of C57BL/6 mice with an alphaSyn/Hsp70 protein combination in the absence of added adjuvant. Our results show differential effects for mice immunized with the alphaSyn/Hsp70 complex, including a restrained alphaSyn-specific (IgM and IgG) humoral response as well as minimized alterations in the Treg (CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)) and Teff (CD4(+)Foxp3(-)) cell populations, as opposed to significant changes in mice immunized with alphaSyn and Hsp70 alone. Furthermore, in vitro-stimulated splenocytes from immunized mice showed the lowest relative response against alphaSyn challenge for the "alphaSyn/Hsp70" experimental group as measured by IFN-gamma and IL-17 secretion, and higher IL-10 levels when stimulated with LPS. Finally, serum levels of Th1-cytokine IFN-gamma and immunomodulatory IL-10 indicated a unique shift toward an immunomodulatory/immunoprotective phenotype in mice immunized with the alphaSyn/Hsp70 complex. Overall, we propose the use of functional "HSP-chaperoned amyloid/aggregating proteins" generated with appropriate HSP-substrate protein combinations, such as the alphaSyn/Hsp70 complex, as a novel strategy for immune-based intervention against synucleinopathies and other amyloid or "misfolding" neurodegenerative disorders.
