30546842|t|Highlights from the International Summit on Intellectual Disability and Dementia Implications for Brazil.
30546842|a|In October of 2016, an interdisciplinary group representing North and South American and European countries met in Glasgow, Scotland, to scrutinize universal issues regarding adults with intellectual disability (ID) affected by dementia and to produce recommendations and guidelines for public policy, practice, and further research. The aim of this paper is to apprise relevant outcomes of the Summit targeting Brazilian researchers, clinicians, and nongovernmental organizations in the field of ageing and dementia that are committed to developing the Brazilian national dementia plan. Three core themes were covered by the Summit: i) human rights and personal resources, ii) personalized services and caregiver support, and iii) advocacy and public impact. The exploration of the themes highlighted variations across countries, and revealed consensual views on matters such as international networks, guidance for practices, and advocacy on behalf of both people with ID affected by dementia, and their families. The authors outline the challenges Brazil must confront regarding ageing and dementia and proffer recommendations to address the needs of adults with ID affected by dementia within this scenario; both of which would help in developing the Brazilian national dementia plan.
