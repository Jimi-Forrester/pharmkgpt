36984847|t|Metabolic and Transcriptomic Changes in the Mouse Brain in Response to Short-Term High-Fat Metabolic Stress.
36984847|a|The chronic consumption of diets rich in saturated fats leads to obesity and associated metabolic disorders including diabetes and atherosclerosis. Intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) is also recognized to dysregulate neural functions such as cognition, mood, and behavior. However, the effects of short-term high-fat diets on the brain are elusive. Here, we investigated molecular changes in the mouse brain following an acute HFD for 10 days by employing RNA sequencing and metabolomics profiling. Aberrant expressions of 92 genes were detected in the brain tissues of acute HFD-exposed mice. The differentially expressed genes were enriched for various pathways and processes such as superoxide metabolism. In our global metabolomic profiling, a total of 59 metabolites were significantly altered by the acute HFD. Metabolic pathways upregulated from HFD-exposed brain tissues relative to control samples included oxidative stress, oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acid metabolism (e.g., branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and lysine metabolism), and the gut microbiome. Acute HFD also elevated levels of N-acetylated amino acids, urea cycle metabolites, and uracil metabolites, further suggesting complex changes in nitrogen metabolism. The observed molecular events in the present study provide a valuable resource that can help us better understand how acute HFD stress impacts brain homeostasis.
