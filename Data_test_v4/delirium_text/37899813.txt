37899813|t|Prediction of Prognosis Acute Pancreatitis with Inflammatory Markers and Patient Characteristics Compared to the Scoring System: Real-Life Data.
37899813|a|Objectives: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease with a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is one of the most common causes of hospitalization among gastrointestinal system diseases. Inflammatory and other factors that predict the severity of AP are very important for patient management. This study will analyze the factors associated with the severity of AP. Methods: The sample consisted of 514 patients. Demographic characteristics, comorbid diseases, causes of AP, body mass index (BMI), tobacco use, blood at admission, amylase, lipase, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), mean platelet volume, red cell distribution width, albumin, calcium, and CRP values at 48th h were recorded. The bedside index of severity in AP (BISAP), Ranson score, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values was calculated and recorded. The relationship between these parameters and the severity of AP was analyzed according to the Atlanta classification. Results: Participants had a mean age of 55+-17.8 years. More than half the participants were women (n=272, 52.9%). Biliary causes were the most common etiological causes (n=299, 58.2%). Most participants had mild pancreatitis (n=416, 80.9%). The severity of AP was associated with tobacco use, high BMI, thrombocytosis, high NLR, high PLR, high 48th h CRP, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio (AST/ALT ratio), and high Ranson and BISAP scores. Conclusion: Biochemical markers that give rapid results in the early period can provide information about the severity of AP. We may develop new scores by combining these parameters.
