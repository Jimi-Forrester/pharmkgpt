38290851|t|Temporal Alterations in White Matter in An App Knock-In Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
38290851|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and results in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. White matter (WM) is affected in AD and has implications for neural circuitry and cognitive function. The trajectory of these changes across age, however, is still not well understood, especially at earlier stages in life. To address this, we used the AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APPKI) mouse model that harbors a single copy knock-in of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene with three familial AD mutations. We performed in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study how the structural properties of the brain change across age in the context of AD. In late age APPKI mice, we observed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA), a proxy of WM integrity, in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus, anterior commissure (AC), neocortex, and hypothalamus. At the cellular level, we observed greater numbers of oligodendrocytes in middle age (prior to observations in DTI) in both the AC, a major interhemispheric WM tract, and the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and heavily affected in AD, prior to observations in DTI. Proteomics analysis of the hippocampus also revealed altered expression of oligodendrocyte-related proteins with age and in APPKI mice. Together, these results help to improve our understanding of the development of AD pathology with age, and imply that middle age may be an important temporal window for potential therapeutic intervention.
