31536324|t|Multimodal Imaging of Amyloid Plaques: Fusion of the Single-Probe Mass Spectrometry Image and Fluorescence Microscopy Image.
31536324|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. The formation of amyloid plaques by aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a primary event in AD pathology. Understanding the metabolomic features and related pathways is critical for studying plaque-related pathological events (e.g., cell death and neuron dysfunction). Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), due to its high sensitivity and ability to obtain the spatial distribution of metabolites, has been applied to AD studies. However, limited studies of metabolites in amyloid plaques have been performed due to the drawbacks of the commonly used techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MSI. In the current study, we obtained high spatial resolution (~17 mum) MS images of the AD mouse brain using the Single-probe, a microscale sampling and ionization device, coupled to a mass spectrometer under ambient conditions. The adjacent slices were used to obtain fluorescence microscopy images to locate amyloid plaques. The MS image and the fluorescence microscopy image were fused to spatially correlate histological protein hallmarks with metabolomic features. The fused images produced significantly improved spatial resolution (~5 mum), allowing for the determination of fine structures in MS images and metabolomic biomarkers representing amyloid plaques.
