18630621|t|[ECG changes in alcoholic intoxication].
18630621|a|Patients with acute alcohol intoxication often present with pathological electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. The changes are more frequent and prognostically more significant in chronic alcoholics, in patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD), in alcohol cardiomyopathy or another organic heart disease, but they can also occur in young and healthy individuals. The typical ECG changes in inebriety are disturbances of heart rate having the nature of electric impulse generation disorder or of impulse conduction pathology. In persons without clinical evidence of heart disease, they are classified as 'holiday heart syndrome'. The most frequent tachyarrhythmia is atrial fibrillation; less frequent but prognostically much more significant is torsades de pointes (TdP) polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. Among bradyarrhythmias, the most significant is alcohol-induced sinus bradycardia which may be manifested by recurrent syncope. The higher the blood alcohol concentration, the higher the occurrence of a significant extension of ECG intervals with possible manifestation of latent conduction disturbance or even sudden cardiac death. Apart from heart rate disturbances, ECG picture very often shows non-specific repolarisation changes. Ischaemia, which is mostly asymptomatic in the form of silent myocardial ischaemia, is worsened in alcohol-intoxicated IHD patients. The resulting ECG may be to a large extent influenced by states which often associate with inebriety, such as hypothermia, hypoglycaemia or electrolyte imbalance. ECG changes similar to those due to acute alcohol intoxication are also present in acute abstinence syndrome, especially in delirium tremens. There is convincing evidence that not only chronic alcoholism, but also single episodes of excessive alcohol consumption are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.
