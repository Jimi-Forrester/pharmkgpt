38156549|t|Aortic Characteristic Impedance and Suspected Mild Cognitive Impairment in a Community-Based Healthy Population.
38156549|a|BACKGROUND: Aging of the proximal aorta can lead to increased pressure and flow pulsatility in the cerebral microcirculation, which may cause cognitive impairment. This study investigated the association between aortic characteristic impedance (Zc), an indicator of regional stiffness of the proximal aorta, and suspected mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV). METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1461 healthy community residents (46.4% men; age range, 35-96 years [mean+-SD, 59.9+-11.8 years]) without a history of cardiovascular events or stroke were included in the study. Zc was estimated using applanation tonometry and echocardiography. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Education-adjusted cut points were used to define suspected MCI. Subjects with suspected MCI (n=493 [33.7%]) had significantly higher Zc and CFPWV than those without. In multivariable analysis, both Zc and CFPWV were inversely associated with Mini-Mental State Examination score. Zc (odds ratio per 1 SD, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.09-1.37] and CFPWV (odds ratio per 1 SD, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.01-1.38]) was also significantly associated with suspected MCI, after adjusting for age, sex, education level, mean arterial pressure, hypertension, diabetes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smoking status. In joint analysis, Zc was significantly associated with suspected MCI, but CFPWV was not. In the age subgroups of <50 years and 50 to 70 years, only Zc was significantly associated with suspected MCI. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that Zc was significantly associated with Mini-Mental State Examination score and suspected MCI, especially in younger and middle-aged adults. These findings suggest that Zc may be a useful biomarker for identifying individuals at risk for MCI.
