35757702|t|Schizophrenia and Inflammation Research: A Bibliometric Analysis.
35757702|a|Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder that involves inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to explore the field of inflammation-related research in SCZ from a bibliometric perspective. Methods: Regular and review articles on SCZ- and inflammation-related research were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database from its inception to February 19, 2022. R package "bibliometrix" was used to summarize the main findings, count the occurrences of the top keywords, visualize the collaboration network between countries, and generate a three-field plot. VOSviewer software was applied to conduct both co-authorship and co-occurrence analyses. CiteSpace was used to identify the top references and keywords with the strongest citation burst. Results: A total of 3,596 publications on SCZ and inflammation were included. Publications were mainly from the USA, China, and Germany. The highest number of publications was found in a list of relevant journals. Apart from "schizophrenia" and "inflammatory", the terms "bipolar disorder," "brain," and "meta-analysis" were also the most frequently used keywords. Conclusions: This bibliometric study mapped out a fundamental knowledge structure consisting of countries, institutions, authors, journals, and articles in the research field of SCZ and inflammation over the past 30 years. The results provide a comprehensive perspective about the wider landscape of this research area.
