22982398|t|Drug pipeline in neurodegeneration based on transgenic mice models of Alzheimer's disease.
22982398|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most important neurodegenerative disorders, bringing about huge medical and social burden in the elderly worldwide. Many aspects of its pathogenesis have remained unclear and no effective treatment exists for it. Within the past 20 years, various mice models harboring AD-related human mutations have been produced. These models imitate diverse AD-related pathologies and have been used for basic and therapeutic investigations in AD. In this regard, there are a wide variety of preclinical trials of potential therapeutic modalities using AD mice models which are of paramount importance for future clinical trials and applications. This review summarizes more than 140 substances and treatment modalities being used in transgenic AD mice models from 2001 to 2011. We also discuss advantages and disadvantages of each model to be used in therapeutic development for AD.
