7987673|t|Hageman factor and its binding sites are present in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease.
7987673|a|Hageman factor (HF) or factor XII participates in several defense systems of the body. These include coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement activation. We investigated the expression of HF and its mRNA in control and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, using immunohistochemistry and polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) techniques. HF mRNA was detected in control and AD brain extracts, indicating that HF can be produced by endogenous brain cells. HF-like immunoreactivity was present in residual serum of capillaries in both control and AD brain, consistent with its known presence in the circulation. In addition, AD senile plaques were stained. The staining was dramatically enhanced when AD sections were incubated with solutions containing HF, indicating that plaques contain not only HF but also binding sites for HF. The enhanced staining was eliminated by pretreatment of solutions with the HF-binding agent kaolin. It was also eliminated by pretreatment of sections with protamine, an agent which strongly binds to negative surfaces. These data suggest that negatively charged surfaces in plaques might bind HF in vivo. Since HF can be activated by contact with negative surfaces, locally released HF could be playing a role in initiating a variety of inflammatory responses in AD brain.
