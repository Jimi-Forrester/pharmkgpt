31879834|a|Cognitive decline, memory impairment and circadian rhythm disturbance are iconic manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a model of AD, show deficits in multiple learning and memory abilities, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral circadian rhythm, but whether circadian differences in cognitive performance and synaptic plasticity could be affected in AD remain unclear. Here, the cognitive behaviors of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were assessed by multiple behavior tests in the rest phase (light period) or active phase (dark period) of the day. The possible electrophysiological mechanism was subsequently investigated by in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) recording, and the locomotor activity rhythm of the mice was detected using wheel-running activities. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, APP/PS1 mice exhibited long-term spatial memory impairment and in vivo hippocampal LTP suppression. In addition, in APP/PS1 mice, circadian differences in new object recognition memory and LTP were lost, and the circadian difference in long-term spatial memory was decreased, accompanied by a less robust locomotor activity rhythm. These results indicate that the loss of circadian differences in new object recognition memory and the decrease in the circadian difference in long-term spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice, which are closely associated with the loss of the circadian difference in LTP and less robust locomotor activity, might occur early in the course of AD.
