In some cases, it is associated with various tumors; one of them is ovarian teratoma, which mostly affects women below the age of 30 years. Here, we report a case of ovarian teratoma associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis treated with both laparoscopic surgery and immunotherapy. Multidisciplinary approach is the cornerstone for the management of this syndrome.
