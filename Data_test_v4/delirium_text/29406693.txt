29406693|t|Comprehensive Profiling of Fecal Metabolome of Mice by Integrated Chemical Isotope Labeling-Mass Spectrometry Analysis.
29406693|a|Gut microbiota plays important roles in the host health. The host and symbiotic gut microbiota coproduce a large number of metabolites during the metabolism of food and xenobiotics. The analysis of fecal metabolites can provide a noninvasive manner to study the outcome of the host-gut microbiota interaction. Herein, we reported the comprehensive profiling of fecal metabolome of mice by an integrated chemical isotope labeling combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (CIL-LC-MS) analysis. The metabolites are categorized into several submetabolomes based on the functional moieties (i.e., carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, and thiol) and then analysis of the individual submetabolome was performed. The combined data from the submetabolome form the metabolome with relatively high coverage. To this end, we synthesized stable isotope labeling reagents to label metabolites with different groups, including carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, and thiol groups. We detected 2302 potential metabolites, among which, 1388 could be positively or putatively identified in feces of mice. We then further confirmed 308 metabolites based on our established library of chemically labeled standards and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. With the identified metabolites in feces of mice, we established mice fecal metabolome database, which can be used to readily identify metabolites from feces of mice. Furthermore, we discovered 211 fecal metabolites exhibited significant difference between Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and wild type (WT) mice, which suggests the close correlation between the fecal metabolites and AD pathology and provides new potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD.
