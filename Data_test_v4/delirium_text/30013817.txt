30013817|t|Delirium and Psychotic Symptoms Associated with Hyperglycemia in a Patient with Poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
30013817|a|Delirium, acute confusional states, and secondary psychosis have been associated with several medical conditions, including endocrine disorders. In the context of diabetes mellitus (DM), it has been mostly related to hypoglycemia and rarely occurs in association with hyperglycemia, outside of the context of a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis. Here, we describe a case of delirium and psychotic symptoms associated with hyperglycemia in a patient with poorly controlled Type 2 DM as an attempt to alert clinicians to this rare association. We also review the pathophysiological mechanisms that might lead to the onset of delirium in the context of hyperglycemia.
