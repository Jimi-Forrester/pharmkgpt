38260018|a|The severity of the pandemic and its consequences on health and social care systems were quite diverse and devastating. COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did a cross-sectional study of 3 months post-COVID consequences of 178 Cuban subjects. Our study has a unique CUBAN COVID-19 cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. We constructed a latent variable for pre-health conditions (PHC) through Item Response Theory (IRT) and for post-COVID neuropsychiatric symptoms (Post-COVID-NPS) through Factor Analysis (FA). There seems to be a potential causal relationship between determinants of CIBD and post-COVID-NPS in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The causal relationships accessed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that PHC (p < 0.001) and pre-COVID cognitive impairments (p < 0.001) affect the severity of COVID-19 patients. The severity of COVID-19 eventually results in enhanced post-COVID-NPS (p < 0.001), even after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, and pre-COVID-NPS). The highest loadings in PHC were for cardiovascular diseases, immunological disorders, high blood pressure, and diabetes. On the other hand, sex (p < 0.001) and pre-COVID-NPS including neuroticism (p < 0.001), psychosis (p = 0.005), cognition (p = 0.036), and addiction (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with post-COVID-NPS. The most common neuropsychiatric symptom with the highest loadings includes pain, fatigue syndrome, autonomic dysfunctionalities, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological symptoms. Compared to healthy people, COVID-19 patients with pre-health comorbidities or pre-neuropsychiatric conditions will have a high risk of getting severe COVID-19 and long-term post-COVID neuropsychiatric consequences. Our study provides substantial evidence to highlight the need for a complete neuropsychiatric follow-up on COVID-19 patients (with severe illness) and survivors (asymptomatic patients who recovered).
