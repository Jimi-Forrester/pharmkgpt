28198997|t|Randomized clinical trial of comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization in vascular surgery.
28198997|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing vascular surgery. Inadequate preoperative assessment and optimization may contribute to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Patients aged at least 65 years scheduled for elective aortic aneurysm repair or lower-limb arterial surgery were enrolled in an RCT of standard preoperative assessment or preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization. Randomization was stratified by sex and surgical site (aorta/lower limb). Primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures included new medical co-morbidities, postoperative medical or surgical complications, discharge to a higher level of dependency and 30-day readmission rate. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in the final analysis (control 91, intervention 85). Geometric mean length of stay was 5 53 days in the control group and 3 32 days in the intervention group (ratio of geometric means 0 60, 95 per cent c.i. 0 46 to 0 79; P < 0 001). There was a lower incidence of delirium (11 versus 24 per cent; P = 0 018), cardiac complications (8 versus 27 per cent; P = 0 001) and bladder/bowel complications (33 versus 55 per cent; P = 0 003) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to require discharge to a higher level of dependency (4 of 85 versus 12 of 91; P = 0 051). CONCLUSION: In this study of patients aged 65 years or older undergoing vascular surgery, preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay. Patients undergoing assessment and optimization had a lower incidence of complications and were less likely to be discharged to a higher level of dependency.
