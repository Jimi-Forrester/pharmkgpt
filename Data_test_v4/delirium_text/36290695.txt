36290695|t|Trends in Gliosis in Obesity, and the Role of Antioxidants as a Therapeutic Alternative.
36290695|a|Obesity remains a global health problem. Chronic low-grade inflammation in this pathology has been related to comorbidities such as cognitive alterations that, in the long term, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation or gliosis in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been related to the effect of adipokines, high lipid levels and glucose, which increase the production of free radicals. Cerebral gliosis can be a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases, and antioxidants could be an alternative for the prevention and treatment of neural comorbidities in obese patients. AIM: Identify the immunological and oxidative stress mechanisms that produce gliosis in patients with obesity and propose antioxidants as an alternative to reducing neuroinflammation. METHOD: Advanced searches were performed in scientific databases: PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, and the Science Citation index for research on the physiopathology of gliosis in obese patients and for the possible role of antioxidants in its management. CONCLUSION: Patients with obesity can develop neuroinflammation, conditioned by various adipokines, excess lipids and glucose, which results in an increase in free radicals that must be neutralized with antioxidants to reduce gliosis and the risk of long-term neurodegeneration.
