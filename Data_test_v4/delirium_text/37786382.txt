37786382|a|Comprehensive and accurate analysis of respiratory and metabolic data is crucial to modelling congenital, pathogenic and degenerative diseases converging on autonomic control failure. A lack of tools for high-throughput analysis of respiratory datasets remains a major challenge. We present Breathe Easy, a novel open-source pipeline for processing raw recordings and associated metadata into operative outcomes, publication-worthy graphs and robust statistical analyses including QQ and residual plots for assumption queries and data transformations. This pipeline uses a facile graphical user interface for uploading data files, setting waveform feature thresholds and defining experimental variables. Breathe Easy was validated against manual selection by experts, which represents the current standard in the field. We demonstrate Breathe Easy's utility by examining a 2-year longitudinal study of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model to assess contributions of forebrain pathology in disordered breathing. Whole body plethysmography has become an important experimental outcome measure for a variety of diseases with primary and secondary respiratory indications. Respiratory dysfunction, while not an initial symptom in many of these disorders, often drives disability or death in patient outcomes. Breathe Easy provides an open-source respiratory analysis tool for all respiratory datasets and represents a necessary improvement upon current analytical methods in the field. KEY POINTS: Respiratory dysfunction is a common endpoint for disability and mortality in many disorders throughout life. Whole body plethysmography in rodents represents a high face-value method for measuring respiratory outcomes in rodent models of these diseases and disorders. Analysis of key respiratory variables remains hindered by manual annotation and analysis that leads to low throughput results that often exclude a majority of the recorded data. Here we present a software suite, Breathe Easy, that automates the process of data selection from raw recordings derived from plethysmography experiments and the analysis of these data into operative outcomes and publication-worthy graphs with statistics. We validate Breathe Easy with a terabyte-scale Alzheimer's dataset that examines the effects of forebrain pathology on respiratory function over 2 years of degeneration.
