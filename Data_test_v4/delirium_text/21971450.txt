21971450|a|The presence of an ApoE epsilon4 allele (epsilon4+) increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies support an adverse relationship between epsilon4+ status and brain structure and function in mild cognitive impairment and AD; in contrast, the presence of an epsilon2 allele may be protective. Whether these findings reflect disease-related effects or pre-existing endophenotypes, however, remains unclear. The present study examined the influence of ApoE allele status on brain structure solely during middle-age in a large, national sample. Participants were 482 men, ages 51-59, from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). T1-weighted images were used in volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction methods to measure regional volume and thickness. Primary linear mixed effects models predicted structural measures with ApoE status (epsilon3/3, epsilon2/3, epsilon3/4) and control variables for effects of site, non-independence of twin data, age, and average cranial vault or cortical thickness. Relative to the epsilon3/3 group, the epsilon3/4 group demonstrated significantly thinner cortex in superior frontal and left rostral and right caudal midfrontal regions; there were no significant effects of epsilon4 status on any temporal lobe measures. The epsilon2/3 group demonstrated significantly thicker right parahippocampal cortex relative to the epsilon3/3 group. The ApoE epsilon4 allele may influence cortical thickness in frontal areas, which are later developing regions thought to be more susceptible to the natural aging process. Previous conflicting findings for mesial temporal regions may be driven by the inclusion of older individuals, who may evidence preclinical manifestations of disease, and by unexamined moderators of epsilon4-related effects. The presence of the epsilon2 allele was related to thicker cortex, supporting a protective role. Ongoing follow-up of the VETSA sample may shed light on the potential for age- and disease-related mediation of the influence of ApoE allele status.
