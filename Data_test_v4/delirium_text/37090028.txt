37090028|a|Treating neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, remains a significant challenge due to the limited neuroregeneration rate in the brain. The objective of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that external magnetic field (MF) stimulation of nerve growth factor functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide-gold (NGF-SPIO-Au) nanoparticles (NPs) can induce Ca2+ influx, membrane depolarization, and enhance neuron differentiation with dynamic MF (DMF) outperforming static MF (SMF) regulation. We showed the that total intracellular Ca2+ influx of PC-12 cells was improved by 300% and 535% by the stimulation of DMF (1 Hz, 0.5 T, 30min) with NGF-SPIO-Au NPs compared to DMF alone and SMF with NGF-SPIO-Au NPs, respectively, which was attributed to successive membrane depolarization. Cellular uptake performed with the application of sodium azide proved that DMF enhanced cellular uptake of NGF-SPIO-Au NPs via endocytosis. In addition, DMF upregulated both the neural differentiation marker (beta3-tubulin) and the cell adhesive molecule (integrin-beta1) with the existence of NGF-SPIO-Au NPs, while SMF did not show these effects. The results imply that noninvasive DMF-stimulated NPs can regulate intracellular Ca2+ influx and enhance neuron differentiation and neuroregeneration rate.
