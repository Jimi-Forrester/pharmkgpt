39813056|t|Stress Granule Induction in Rat Retinas Damaged by Constant LED Light.
39813056|a|Purpose: Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic biocondensates formed in response to various cellular stressors, contributing to cell survival. Although implicated in diverse pathologies, their role in retinal degeneration (RD) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate SG formation in the retina and its induction by excessive LED light in an RD model. Methods: Rat retinas were immunohistochemically analyzed for SG markers G3BP1 and eIF3, and SGs were also visualized by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Additionally, SGs were induced in primary retinal cell and eyeball cultures using sodium arsenite. Light exposure experiments used LED lamps with a color temperature of 5500 K and 200 lux intensity for short-term or two- to eight-day exposures. Results: SGs were predominantly detected in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and inner nuclear layer (INL) cells, with arsenite-induction verified in RGCs. SG abundance was higher in animals exposed to light for 2-8 days compared to light/dark cycle controls. RGCs consistently exhibited more SGs than INL cells, and INL cells more than outer nuclear layer (ONL) cells (Scheirer-Ray-Hare test: H = 13.2, P = 0.0103 for light condition, and H = 278.2, P < 0.00001 for retinal layer). These observations were consistent across four independent experiments, each with three animals per light condition. Conclusions: This study characterizes SGs in the mammalian retina for the first time, with increased prevalence after excessive LED light exposure. RGCs and INL cells showed heightened SG formation, suggesting a potential protective mechanism against photodamage. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the role of SGs in shielding against light stress and their implications in retinopathies.
