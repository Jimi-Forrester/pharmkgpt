8992372|a|Counselling the relatives of psychiatric patients is becoming increasingly important. This includes the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Since little is known about the organization and function of support groups for family caregivers of Alzheimer patients, in 1994 we wrote to all such groups known to us and asked them to fill in a questionnaire. The response rate was 85% (84/99), and 66 of the forms could be used for further analysis. The results were as follow: Most groups for relatives of Alzheimer patients admitted new members at any time. 69% had existed for more than 1 year and 19% for more than 5 years. 81% consisted of 6-15 participants. 73% of the groups met once in a month. Health professionals organized the groups in 65% of cases. The main topics were trading information about the disease and support as well as daily care requirements. 73% of the groups were associated with health institutions or nationwide support organizations. Public relations were managed by personal contacts and press reports; did the groups rarely advertise. Based on a review of the literature, the impact of structure upon the function of groups is discussed.
