26633030|t|Effect of Chaenomeles sinensis Extract on Choline Acetyltransferase Activity and Trimethyltin-Induced Learning and Memory Impairment in Mice.
26633030|a|The aim of this study was to search for a novel choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator from plants traditionally grown in Korea. An ethanol extract from Chaenomeles sinensis Koehne showed the highest ChAT-activating effect in vitro in an assay that used human neuroblastoma cells and [(14)C]acetyl-CoA. The active compound was speculated to be stearic acid methyl ester (SAME). In an in vivo experiment, C. sinensis extract and SAME improved trimethyltin (TMT)-induced deficits in learning and memory in mice as assessed by a Y-maze behavioral test and a passive avoidance test. The C. sinensis extract might attenuate the TMT-induced brain disorder. This study suggests that SAME from C. sinensis might be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
