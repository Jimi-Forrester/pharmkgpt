37729336|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with prolonged weaning and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs and under invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Between March of 2020 and July of 2021, we retrospectively recorded clinical and ventilatory characteristics of critically ill COVID-19 patients from the day of intubation to the outcome. We classified the patients regarding the weaning period in accordance with established criteria. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with prolonged weaning and mortality. RESULTS: The study involved 303 patients, 100 of whom (33.0%) had a prolonged weaning period. Most of the patients were male (69.6%), 136 (44.8%) had more than 50% of pulmonary involvement on chest CT, and 93 (30.6%) had severe ARDS. Within the prolonged weaning group, 62% died within 60 days. Multivariate analysis revealed that lung involvement greater than 50% on CT and delay from intubation to the first separation attempt from mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with prolonged weaning, whereas age and prolonged weaning were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged weaning can be used as a milestone in predicting mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Lung involvement greater than 50% on CT and delay from intubation to the first separation attempt from mechanical ventilation were identified as significant predictors of prolonged weaning. These results might provide valuable information for healthcare professionals when making clinical decisions regarding the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients who are on mechanical ventilation.
