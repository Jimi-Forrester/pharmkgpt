34884901|t|Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Nucleolar Proteins Relate to Localization and Function.
34884901|a|The process of phase separation allows for the establishment and formation of subcompartmentalized structures, thus enabling cells to perform simultaneous processes with precise organization and low energy requirements. Chemical modifications of proteins, RNA, and lipids alter the molecular environment facilitating enzymatic reactions at higher concentrations in particular regions of the cell. In this review, we discuss the nucleolus as an example of the establishment, dynamics, and maintenance of a membraneless organelle with a high level of organization.
