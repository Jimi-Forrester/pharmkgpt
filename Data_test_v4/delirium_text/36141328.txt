36141328|t|Effectiveness of Nurse-Led Interventions for the Prevention of Mental Health Issues in Patients Leaving Intensive Care: A Systematic Review.
36141328|a|This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nurse-led interventions for the prevention of mental health disorders after intensive care unit discharge through a systematic review of the literature. The searches were conducted in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases for studies pertaining to such interventions. Two independent reviewers analyzed the studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence. Six eligible articles were identified, all of which were regarding post-traumatic stress disorder after intensive care unit discharge. Some of the interventions were conducted during the admission and some after the discharge. One study found that multimedia education during admission improved anxiety and depression one week after discharge. The remaining five studies concluded that nurse-led interventions did not prevent mental health disorders three months to one year after intensive care unit discharge. Our review revealed a paucity of research into the effectiveness of nurse-led interventions for the prevention of mental health disorders after intensive care unit discharge. The timing and the content of these interventions, and the adequate training of nurses, appear to be key factors. Therefore, multidisciplinary interventions are likely to be more effective than those led by nurses alone.
