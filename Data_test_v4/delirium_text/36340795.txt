36340795|a|There is yet no effective drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is one of the world's most common neurodegenerative diseases. The Qin-Zhi-Zhu-Dan Formula (QZZD) is derived from a widely used Chinese patent drug-Qing-Kai-Ling Injection. It consists of Radix Scutellariae, Fructus Gardeniae, and Pulvis Fellis Suis. Recent study showed that QZZD and its effective components played important roles in anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress and preventing brain injury. It was noted that QZZD had protective effects on the brain, but the mechanism remained unclear. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of QZZD in the treatment of AD combining network pharmacology approach with experimental validation. In the network pharmacology analysis, a total of 15 active compounds of QZZD and 135 putative targets against AD were first obtained. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were then applied to clarify the biological mechanism. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of QZZD was proved, and a synthetic pathway-TNFR1-ERK1/2-NF-kappaBp65 signaling pathway was obtained. On the basis of the above discoveries, we further validated the protective effects QZZD on neurons with an APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model. Weight change of the mice was monitored to assess QZZD's influence on the digestive system; water maze experiment was used for evaluating the effects on spatial learning and memory; Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to detect the predicted key proteins in network pharmacology analysis, including Abeta, IL-6, NF-kappaBp65, TNFR1, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2. We proved that QZZD could improve neuroinflammation and attenuate neuronal death without influencing the digestive system in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice with dementia. Combining animal pharmacodynamic experiments with network pharmacology analysis, we confirmed the importance of inflammation in pathogenesis of AD, clarified the pharmacodynamic characteristics of QZZD in treating AD, and proved its neuroprotective effects through the regulation of TNFR1-ERK1/2-NF-kappaBp65 signaling pathway, which might provide reference for studies on treatment of AD in the future.
