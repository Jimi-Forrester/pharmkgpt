36304811|t|HIGH-DOSE INSULIN EUGLYCEMIC THERAPY.
36304811|a|Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers toxicity/poisoning are one of the most common causes of poisoning. More importantly, they are among the deadliest types of poisoning caused by cardiac drugs that emergency physicians can encounter. Common toxidrome caused by these medications includes the following symptoms: hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia, hypothermia, arrhythmia, and seizures. Treatment is usually complex, It consists of administration of various medications, such as crystalloids, intravenous calcium, glucagon, vasopressors/inotropes, and especially high-dose insulin euglycemic therapy. In this paper, we will review the mechanism for this type of treatment, propose a potential protocol for its application and address possible adverse effects. High-dose insulin euglycemic therapy should be an integral part of the treatment protocol for calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers toxicity.
