16327587|t|Case study: delirium in an adolescent girl with human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia.
16327587|a|Delirium and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia are well recognized neuropsychiatric consequences of HIV infection in adults. Almost nothing is known regarding the management of delirium in HIV-infected children and adolescents. HIV-related progressive encephalopathy is thought to represent the pediatric form of HIV-associated dementia; however, this condition occurs in HIV-infected infants and preschool children and is rapidly followed by death. This report describes the identification and treatment of apparent HIV-associated dementia complicated by delirium in an adolescent girl.
