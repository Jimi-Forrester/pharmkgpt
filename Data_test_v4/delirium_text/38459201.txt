38459201|a|This study aimed to investigate the biological activities of Lactobacillus gasseri SM 05 (L. gasseri) and Lacticaseibacillus casei subsp. casei PTCC 1608 (L. casei) in the black raspberry (Rubus dolichocarpus) juice (BRJ) environment, and also the anti-adhesion activity against Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) in fermented black raspberry juice (FBRJ). Results showed significant anti-adhesion activity in Caco-2 epithelial cells. In the anti-adhesion process, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) improve intestinal health by preventing the adhesion of pathogens. Adding LAB to BRJ produces metabolites with bacteriocin properties. Major findings of this research include improved intestinal health, improved antidiabetic properties, inhibition of degradation of amino acids, and increase in the nutritional value of foods that have been subjected to heat processing by preventing Maillard inhibition, and inhibition of oxidation of foodstuff by increased antioxidant activity of BRJ. Both species of Lactobacillus effectively controlled the growth of S. typhimurium during BRJ fermentation. Moreover, in all tests, as well as Maillard's and alpha-amylase inhibition, L. gasseri was more effective than L. casei. The phenolic and flavonoid compounds increased significantly after fermentation by both LAB (p < 0.05). Adding Stevia extract to FBRJ and performing the HHP process showed convenient protection of phenolic compounds compared to heat processing.
