37433922|t|Association between periodontitis and cognitive impairment in adults.
37433922|a|DESIGN: To summarize the data on association between periodontal diseases and cognitive impairment in adults this systematic review scrutinized various observational studies till September 2021. This review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines. The authors used PECO framework question,: population-Adults (18 years or older), exposure-adults suffering from periodontitis, comparator-adult group without periodontitis, outcome-adults at high risk for cognitive impairment. CASE/CONTROL SELECTION: Search for the literature was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Search was limited to human studies with no limitation to year of publication prior to September 2021. Search terms used were related to gingiva, oral bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, gum inflammation, periodontitis, dementia, neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease. Following research, all the studies providing association between periodontal diseases and neurodegenerative diseases with quantitative measures were included in the study. Non-human studies, studies on patients below 18 year old, studies related to influence of treatment and in subjects already suffering from neurological disease were excluded. After removing duplicates, eligible studies were identified and data extracted by two reviewers to make ensure inter examiner reliability and to prevent data entry errors. Data from the studies were tabulated as study design, sample characteristics, diagnosis, exposure biomarkers/measures, outcomes and results. DATA ANALYSIS: Methodological quality of studies was assessed by adapted Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Selection of study groups, comparability and exposure/outcome were used as parameters. Case-control and cohort studies were considered as high-quality studies if six or more stars were awarded out of nine maximum stars and four or more stars for cross-sectional studies out of six stars. Comparability among the groups was studied by taking into account primary factors for Alzheimer's disease such as age and sex and secondary factors like hypertension, osteoarthritis, depression, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. For cohort studies, 10 year follow up and dropout of <10% was considered to be successful. RESULTS: A total of 3693 studies were identified by two independent reviewers and finally 11 studies were included in the final analysis. Six cohort studies, three cross-sectional and two case-control studies were included after excluding remaining studies. Bias in studies was assessed by adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All included studies were of high methodological quality. Association between periodontitis and cognitive impairment was determined by using different criteria like International classification of disease, clinical measurement of periodontitis subjects, inflammatory biomarkers, microbes and antibodies. It was suggested that subjects with chronic periodontitis since 8 years or more, are at a higher risk of having dementia. Clinical measures of periodontal disease like probing depth, clinical attachment loss, alveolar bone loss were found to be positively associated with cognitive impairment. Inflammatory biomarkers and pre-existing elevated levels of serum IgG specific to periodontopathogens was reported to be associated with cognitive impairment. Within the limitations of the study, the authors concluded that though the patients with long-standing periodontitis are at greater risk for developing cognitive impairment by neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanism by which periodontitis can lead to cognitive impairment is still vague. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests a strong association between periodontitis and cognitive impairment. Still further studies should be done to explore the mechanism involved.
