31594221|t|Subtypes Based on Six Apolipoproteins in Non-Demented Elderly Are Associated with Cognitive Decline and Subsequent Tau Accumulation in Cerebrospinal Fluid.
31594221|a|Apolipoproteins (APOs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we aimed to investigate if patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) APOs (APOA-I, APOC-III, APOD, APOE, APOH, and APOJ) levels are associated with changes over time in cognition, memory performance, neuroimaging markers, and AD-related pathologies (CSF Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau) in non-demented older adults. At baseline, a total of 241 non-demented older adults with CSF APOs data was included in the present analysis. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis including the six CSF APOs was carried out. Among non-demented older adults, we identified two clusters. Compare with the first cluster, the second cluster had higher levels of APOs in CSF. Additionally, the second cluster showed a more benign disease course, including slower cognitive decline and slower p-tau accumulation in CSF. Our data highlight the importance of APOs in the pathogenesis of AD.
