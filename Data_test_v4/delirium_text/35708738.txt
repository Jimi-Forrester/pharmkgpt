35708738|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe new onset of generalized seizures in 3 young dogs following cessation of a benzodiazepine-containing sedation protocol to facilitate mechanical ventilation (MV) for hypoxemia. SERIES SUMMARY: Three dogs under 5 months of age underwent MV due to severe hypoxemia. All 3 dogs were sedated with a constant rate infusion of benzodiazepines as part of their sedation protocol to facilitate MV. All 3 dogs had an acute onset of generalized seizures within 36 hours of sedation cessation and weaning from MV. All 3 dogs' seizures were successfully managed with a slow, tapering course of benzodiazepines. One dog was additionally treated with levetiracetam at the time of initial seizure activity, which was discontinued 1 year following discharge and absence of ongoing seizure activity. All 3 dogs were discharged successfully with no reports of ongoing seizures or neurologic deficits after discharge. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: Young dogs managed with benzodiazepines to facilitate MV may have acute onset of generalized seizures following cessation, which can be successfully managed with short-term benzodiazepine therapy. The 3 cases in this series demonstrated a positive outcome and were successfully managed following acute onset of generalized seizure activity post-MV.
