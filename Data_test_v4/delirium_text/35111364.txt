35111364|t|Alzheimer Disease: Recent Updates on Apolipoprotein E and Gut Microbiome Mediation of Oxidative Stress, and Prospective Interventional Agents.
35111364|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a current public health challenge and will remain until the development of an effective intervention. However, developing an effective treatment for the disease requires a thorough understanding of its etiology, which is currently lacking. Although several studies have shown the association between oxidative damage and AD, only a few have clarified the specific mechanisms involved. Herein, we reviewed recent preclinical and clinical studies that indicated the significance of oxidative damage in AD, as well as potential antioxidants. Although several factors regulate oxidative stress in AD, we centered our investigation on apolipoprotein E and the gut microbiome. Apolipoprotein E, particularly apolipoprotein E-epsilon4, can impair the structural facets of the mitochondria. This, in turn, can minimize the mitochondrial functionality and result in the progressive build-up of free radicals, eventually leading to oxidative stress. Similarly, the gut microbiome can influence oxidative stress to a significant degree via its metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide. Given the various roles of these two factors in modulating oxidative stress, we also discuss the possible relationship between them and provide future research directions.
