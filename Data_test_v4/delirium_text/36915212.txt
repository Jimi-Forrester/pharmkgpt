36915212|t|alpha-Synuclein conformers reveal link to clinical heterogeneity of alpha-synucleinopathies.
36915212|a|alpha-Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy, are a class of neurodegenerative diseases exhibiting intracellular inclusions of misfolded alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn), referred to as Lewy bodies or oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions (Papp-Lantos bodies). Even though the specific cellular distribution of aggregated alphaSyn differs in PD and DLB patients, both groups show a significant pathological overlap, raising the discussion of whether PD and DLB are the same or different diseases. Besides clinical investigation, we will focus in addition on methodologies, such as protein seeding assays (real-time quaking-induced conversion), to discriminate between different types of alpha-synucleinopathies. This approach relies on the seeding conversion properties of misfolded alphaSyn, supporting the hypothesis that different conformers of misfolded alphaSyn may occur in different types of alpha-synucleinopathies. Understanding the pathological processes influencing the disease progression and phenotype, provoked by different alphaSyn conformers, will be important for a personalized medical treatment in future.
