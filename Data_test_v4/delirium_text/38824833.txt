38824833|a|Growth factor-derived peptides are bioactive molecules that play a crucial role in various physiological processes within the human body. Over the years, extensive research has revealed their diverse applications, ranging from antimicrobial properties to their potential in neuroprotection and treating various diseases. These peptides exhibit innate immune responses and have been found to possess potent antimicrobial properties against a wide range of pathogens. Growth factor-derived peptides have demonstrated the ability to promote neuronal survival, prevent cell death, and stimulate neural regeneration. As a result, they hold immense promise in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in the management of traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, growth factor-derived peptides have shown potential for supporting tissue repair and wound healing processes. By enhancing cell proliferation and migration, these peptides contribute to the regeneration of damaged tissues and promote a more efficient healing response. The applications of growth factor-derived peptides extend beyond their therapeutic potential in health; they also have a role in various disease conditions. For example, researchers have explored their influence on cancer cells, where some peptides have demonstrated anti-cancer properties, inhibiting tumor growth and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. Additionally, their immunomodulatory properties have been investigated for potential applications in autoimmune disorders. Despite the immense promise shown by growth factor-derived peptides, some challenges need to be addressed. Nevertheless, ongoing research and advancements in biotechnology offer promising avenues to overcome these obstacles. The review summarizes the foundational biology of growth factors and the intricate signaling pathways in various physiological processes as well as diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular ailments, and metabolic syndromes.
