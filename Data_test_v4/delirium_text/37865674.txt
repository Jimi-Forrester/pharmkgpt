37865674|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the brain deposition of insoluble amyloidogenic proteins, such as alpha-synuclein or Tau, and the concomitant deterioration of cell functions such as the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). The ALP is involved in the degradation of intracellular macromolecules including protein aggregates. ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes a group of diseases called lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) because of abnormal accumulation of lysosomal degradation substrates. Supporting the contribution of ALP defects in neurodegenerative diseases, deposition of amyloidogenic proteins occurs in LSD. Moreover, heterozygous mutations of several ALP genes represent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. The reciprocal contribution of alpha-synuclein accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction have been extensively studied. However, whether this adverse crosstalk also embraces Tau pathology needs more investigation. Here, we show in human primary fibroblasts that Tau seeds isolated from the brain of Alzheimer's disease induce Tau accumulation in acidic degradative organelles and lysosomal stress. Furthermore, inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme mutated in Gaucher's disease and a main risk for Parkinson's disease, causes lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and contributes to the accumulation of Tau. Considering the presence of Tau lesions in Parkinson's disease as well as in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, our data call for further studies on strategies to alleviate ALP dysfunction as new therapeutic opportunity for neurodegenerative diseases and LSD.
