15573284|a|PURPOSE: The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is a MR-based neuroimaging procedure aiming at the quantification of the structural integrity of brain tissue. Its contribution to the differential diagnosis of dementias was examined and discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of age-related dementias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients from a memory clinic were diagnosed by general physical and neuropsychiatric examination, and underwent neuropsychologic testing and neuroimaging using MRI. Their clinical diagnoses were based on standard operational research criteria. Additionally, the MTR in 10 defined regions of interest (ROI) was determined. This investigation was performed using a T1-weighted SE sequence. Average MTR values were determined in the individual ROI and their combinations and correlated with the age, gender, cognitive impairment and clinical diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were determined, as well as the rate of correct classifications. RESULTS: For cognitive healthy subjects, the MRT values correlate only mildly, though significantly, with age in the hippocampus and with gender in the dorsal corpus callosum. In contrast, the MTR in the frontal white matter correlates strongly and highly significantly with cognitive impairment in patients with dementia. The differential diagnostic assignment of Alzheimer's disease versus vascular dementia by MTR provides a correct classification of approximately 50 % to 70 %. PPV for no dementia vs. vascular dementia or the NPV for vascular vs. Alzheimer's disease are considerably higher exceeding 80 %. For no dementia vs. Alzheimer's disease, the NPV was over 90 %. CONCLUSION: MTR values indicate functional changes in the brain tissue between cognitive healthy and demented patients, and correlate with the cognitive loss, but not with age and gender. In principle, the MTR is suitable for the diagnosis of age-related dementias, but does not contribute substantially to the differential diagnosis of vascular dementia vs. Alzheimer's disease. The present results support the assumption of a synergy between vascular and degenerative components of age-related dementias.
