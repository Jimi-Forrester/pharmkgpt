8057391|t|Involvement of glutamate receptors, lipases, and phospholipases in long-term potentiation and neurodegeneration.
8057391|a|Glutamate is the primary excitatory amino acid in the mammalian central nervous system. Normal excitation of glutamate receptors initiates the stimulation of phospholipases and lipases with the generation of second messengers that are necessary for normal cell function. The overstimulation of glutamate receptors can initiate a cascade of biochemical events including stimulation of membrane phospholipid turnover, excessive calcium entry, abnormal phosphorylation, and proteolysis. These events may be responsible for neuronal injury and degeneration found in Alzheimer disease, ischemia, spinal cord trauma, epilepsy, and Huntington disease.
