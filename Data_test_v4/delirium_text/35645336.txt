35645336|t|Context-Dependent Regulation of Gene Expression by Non-Canonical Small RNAs.
35645336|a|In recent functional genomics studies, a large number of non-coding RNAs have been identified. It has become increasingly apparent that noncoding RNAs are crucial players in a wide range of cellular and physiological functions. They have been shown to modulate gene expression on different levels, including transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and translation. This review aims to highlight the diverse mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression by small noncoding RNAs in different conditions and different types of human cells. For this purpose, various cellular functions of microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), snoRNA-derived small RNAs (sdRNAs) and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) will be exemplified, with particular emphasis on the diversity of their occurrence and on the effects on gene expression in different stress conditions and diseased cell types. The synthesis and effect on gene expression of these noncoding RNAs varies in different cell types and may depend on environmental conditions such as different stresses. Moreover, noncoding RNAs play important roles in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections.
