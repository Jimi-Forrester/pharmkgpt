22869944|t|A comparison of propofol and thiopentone for electroconvulsive therapy.
22869944|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare propofol and thiopental as anesthetic agents for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with respect to seizure duration, stimulus charge, and clinical effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized, blinded study of 28 patients of depression treated with bilateral ECT. In group P (n = 14), sedation was achieved with propofol 1.5 mg/kg, whereas in group T (n = 14), it was achieved with thiopentone 3 mg/ kg IV. Succinylcholine 0.4 mg/kg intravenous was given in all patients as for neuromuscular blockade. RESULTS: The mean seizure duration of the patients in the thiopental group was 83 +- 34.43 seconds vs. 94.45 +- 21.37 seconds in the propofol group (P < 0.01). The energy delivered per treatment was 10.88 +- 4.78 J in the thiopental group vs. 12.20 +- 4.53 J in the propofol group (P < 0.05). Number of ECTs required were significantly higher in propofol group (9.71 +- 2.87) as compared to thiopental group (5.86 +- 0.36) P < 0.0001. No significant difference in duration of hospitalization was seen in both groups. The mean score on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 29.14 in the thiopental group vs. 29.57 in the propofol group (P > 0.05). The mean score on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was 7.14 in the thiopental group vs. 3.29 in the propofol group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Propofol significantly increases number of ECT required to treat although the patients received higher electrical charge and had longer seizure duration. BDI scores suggest this resulted in better outcome. Results, however, might be confounded by the differences in pharmacological treatment in the groups.
