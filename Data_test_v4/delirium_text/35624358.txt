35624358|t|A Countrywide Assessment of Omani Undergraduate Nursing Students' Palliative Care Knowledge and Attitudes Towards End-of-Life Care.
35624358|a|Palliative care (PC) is a vital part of the responses needed to address the outcomes of cancer and other non-communicable diseases such as chronic pain, terminal illnesses, and end-of-life situations. Until today, there is a significant lack of access to PC in most developing countries, where the majority of the global population lives. Deficiencies in nurses' knowledge and attitudes exacerbate the lack of access to PC and end-of-life care (EOLC) in these countries. This study was conducted in Oman to assess undergraduate nursing students' (NS) PC knowledge and attitudes towards EOLC. A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 276 NS in all undergraduate programs in Oman. The PC knowledge and attitude towards EOLC were measured using the PEACE-Q and FATCOD-B. The NS had a borderline level of PC knowledge but favorable attitudes towards EOLC. The NS were least knowledgeable about the philosophy of PC, delirium, side effects of opioids, cancer pain, and dyspnea. There were differences in PC knowledge and attitudes across programs. The findings highlight potential deficiencies and opportunities that can be utilized to augment future nursing human resources for PC and EOLC in Oman. We recommend a national interdisciplinary PC education and training consortium (NIPCET-C) to dialogue, develop, promote, monitor, and evaluate PC and EOLC education in Oman.
