METHODS: A longitudinal study was performed on patients admitted to 21 inpatient hospices/palliative care units (PCUs) in Japan. Patient symptoms were assessed at admission and in the last 3 days of life. Data on distressing events (unexpected death, bleeding) and received treatments (morphine prescriptions, continuous deep sedation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) were also obtained. Bereaved caregiver depression was assessed 6 months or more after patient death via mail survey using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore variables predicting bereaved caregiver depression. RESULTS: Of 1324 deceased patient-bereaved caregiver dyads, data were finally analyzed for 711 dyads. The proportion of probable depression (PHQ-9 scores >=10) in bereaved caregivers was 13.6% (91/671; 95% confidence interval: 11.0-16.2). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that patient hyperactive delirium at PCU admission was significantly associated with the development of bereaved caregiver depression (odds ratio: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-3.8). Bereaved caregiver perceived low social support (OR: 4.7, 95% CI: 2.2-10.0) and low preparedness for death (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.6-7.8) were also significantly associated with the development of depression. Other patient and bereaved caregiver variables had no association with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperactive delirium in terminally ill cancer patients was associated with bereaved caregiver depression. The development of effective strategies to reduce delirium-related agitation and to provide educational interventions for caregivers may be needed.
