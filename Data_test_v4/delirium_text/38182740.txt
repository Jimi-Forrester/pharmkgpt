38182740|t|Clinical evaluation of a novel plasma pTau217 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in Alzheimer's disease.
38182740|a|A growing literature suggests that plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at amino acid 217 (pTau217) performs similarly to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and PET imaging to detect amyloid pathology and to provide diagnostic and prognostic information in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a significant limiting factor thus far has been a lack of widely available immunoassays. We evaluated a novel pTau217 S-PLEX  assay developed by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD) in plasma from 131 individuals with AD confirmed by CSF biomarkers and controls. Technical performance of the assay was excellent with an LLOQ of 1.84 pg/mL and intra/interplate CVs of 5.5% (0.3-15.0%) and 5.7% (range 0.3-13.4%), respectively. The pTau217 plasma assay differentiated AD and controls with an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.0) and pTau217 levels were 3.9-fold higher in individuals with AD. This performance was significantly better than what was observed for plasma pTau181, performed in parallel, and comparable to published data on existing pTau217 assays. While further clinical validation and head-to-head comparisons are needed to fully establish the role for the novel pTau217 S-PLEX assay, these data demonstrate the utility of the assay to detect AD pathology.
