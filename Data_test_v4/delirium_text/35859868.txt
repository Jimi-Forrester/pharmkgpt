35859868|t|Development of Urea-Bond-Containing Michael Acceptors as Antitrypanosomal Agents Targeting Rhodesain.
35859868|a|Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. Rhodesain, a cysteine protease of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, has been identified as a valid target for the development of anti-HAT agents. Herein, we report a series of urea-bond-containing Michael acceptors, which were demonstrated to be potent rhodesain inhibitors with K i values ranging from 0.15 to 2.51 nM, and five of them showed comparable k 2nd values to that of K11777, a potent antitrypanosomal agent. Moreover, most of the urea derivatives exhibited single-digit micromolar activity against the protozoa, and the presence of substituents at the P3 position appears to be essential for the antitrypanosomal effect. Replacement of Phe with Leu at the P2 site kept unchanged the inhibitory properties. Compound 7 (SPR7) showed the best compromise in terms of rhodesain inhibition, selectivity, and antiparasitic activity, thus representing a new lead compound for future SAR studies.
