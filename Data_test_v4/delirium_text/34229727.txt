34229727|a|BACKGROUND: The immune pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain incompletely understood. Our recent study indicates that tissue-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) accumulate in the brain barriers of aged mice and that their activation alleviates aging-associated cognitive decline. The regulation and function of ILC2 in AD, however, remain unknown. METHODS: In this study, we examined the numbers and functional capability of ILC2 from the triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) and control wild-type mice. We investigated the effects of treatment with IL-5, a cytokine produced by ILC2, on the cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice. RESULTS: We demonstrate that brain-associated ILC2 are numerically and functionally defective in the triple transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD). The numbers of brain-associated ILC2 were greatly reduced in 7-month-old 3xTg-AD mice of both sexes, compared to those in age- and sex-matched control wild-type mice. The remaining ILC2 in 3xTg-AD mice failed to efficiently produce the type 2 cytokine IL-5 but gained the capability to express a number of proinflammatory genes. Administration of IL-5, a cytokine produced by ILC2, transiently improved spatial recognition and learning in 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSION: Our results collectively indicate that numerical and functional deficiency of ILC2 might contribute to the cognitive impairment of 3xTg-AD mice.
