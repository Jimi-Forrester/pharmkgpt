36672334|t|Role of Decompressive Surgery in Neurologically Intact Patients with Low to Intermediate Intraspinal Metastatic Tumor Burden.
36672334|a|BACKGROUND: Surgical decompression (SD) followed by radiotherapy (RT) is superior to RT alone in patients with metastatic spinal disease with epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) and neurological deficit. For patients without neurological deficit and low- to intermediate-grade intraspinal tumor burden, data on whether SD is beneficial are scarce. This study aims to investigate the neurological outcome of patients without neurological deficit, with a low- to intermediate-ESCC, who were treated with or without SD. METHODS: This single-center, multidepartment retrospective analysis includes patients treated for spinal epidural metastases from 2011 to 2021. Neurological status was assessed by Frankel grade, and intraspinal tumor burden was categorized according to the ESCC scale. Spinal instrumentation surgery was only considered as SD if targeted decompression was performed. RESULTS: ESCC scale was determined in 519 patients. Of these, 190 (36.6%) presented with no neurological deficit and a low- to intermediate-grade ESCC (1b, 1c, or 2). Of these, 147 (77.4% were treated with decompression and 43 (22.65%) without. At last follow-up, there was no difference in neurological outcome between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Indication for decompressive surgery in neurologically intact patients with low-grade ESCC needs to be set cautiously. So far, it is unclear which patients benefit from additional decompressive surgery, warranting further prospective, randomized trials for this significant cohort of patients.
