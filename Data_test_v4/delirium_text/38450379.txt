38450379|t|A cross-sectional observational study for ethno-geographical disparities in sleep quality, brain morphometry and cognition (a SOLACE study) in Indians residing in India, and South Asians and Europeans residing in the UK - a study protocol.
38450379|a|Introduction: As individuals age, their sleep patterns change, and sleep disturbances can increase the risk of dementia. Poor sleep quality can be a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Epidemiological studies show a connection between sleep quality and cognitive changes, with brain imaging revealing grey matter volume reduction and amyloid beta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. However, most research has focused on Europeans, with little attention to other ethnic groups. Methods: This is a cross sectional study comparing effects across countries and ethnicities. Group 1 (n = 193) will be Indians residing in India (new participant recruitment), Group 2 will be South Asians residing in UK and group 3 will be Europeans residing in the UK. For group 2 and 3 (n = 193), data already collected by UK-based Southall and Brent REvisited (SABRE) tri-ethnic study will be used. For group 1, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI) will be used for assessment of sleep quality, Indian Council of Medical Research (Neurocognitive ToolBox) (ICMR-NCTB) for cognition testing and a 3 T MRI cerebral scan for brain morphometry. The data will be compared to sleep, cognitive function and brain MRI parameters from SABRE. Discussion: Racial and ethnic differences can impact the relationships of cognitive function, sleep quality and brain structure in older adults. Earlier studies have highlighted higher prevalence of poor sleep among black individuals compared to white individuals. Genetic or epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to these variations. Socio-cultural and environmental factors, such as neighbourhood, migration, lifestyle, stress and perceived discrimination may influence sleep patterns. The aim of the study is to examine the ethnogeographic variations in sleep quality, cognitive performance and brain morphometry among Indians living in India, and South Asians and Europeans residing in the UK.
