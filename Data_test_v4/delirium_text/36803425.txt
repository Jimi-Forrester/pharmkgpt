36803425|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant tumors are more likely to have psychological problems due to their worries about their life expectancy. To understand the psychological status of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy better, the study was designed to investigate the current situation of anxiety and depression in elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy and to analyze its related factors. METHODS: A total of 126 elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy were selected as the research objects. The anxiety and depression of all subjects were evaluated by HADS (Hosptial Anxiety and Depression Scale). The correlation factors affecting the psychological state of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy were analyzed by linear regression method. RESULTS: The HADS-A score of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy was 8.79 +- 2.56, among which 37 patients were asymptomatic, 60 patients with suspicious symptoms, and 29 patients with definite symptoms. The HADS-D score was 8.40 +- 2.97, among which 61 patients were asymptomatic, 39 patients with suspicious symptoms, and 26 patients with definite symptoms. Multivariate analysis using linear regression method showed that FRAIL score, residence, and complication were significantly associated with anxiety and depression of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression in elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy were obvious. FRAIL score, regional differences, and the complication were the risk factors for anxiety and depression in elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy. Improving frailty, reducing regional differences, and preventing complications is beneficial to alleviate the adverse mood of elderly patients with malignant liver tumor undergoing hepatectomy.
