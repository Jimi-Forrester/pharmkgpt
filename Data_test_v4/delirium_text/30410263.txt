30410263|t|Coping Styles and Life Satisfaction in Palliative Care.
30410263|a|BACKGROUND: Patients in palliative care suffer variously due to underassessment of needs and suboptimal intervention, coupled with lack of access to palliative care. This study attempts to identify effective coping strategies which lead to life satisfaction, among those afflicted with terminal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study was carried out among terminally-ill cancer patients undergoing palliative care. Cancer patients receiving palliative care who give consent and were aged 18 years or older were included in the study. Those with cognitive deficits, delirium, or psychosis were excluded from the study. COPE scale, Temporal Satisfaction with Life Scale, and sociodemographic Performa were administered and analyzed. Pearson's r correlation coefficient test and multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate correlation and effect of coping strategies on life satisfaction. RESULTS: Religious coping was the most frequently used coping strategy by patients, followed by acceptance. Females showed higher problem-focused coping, whereas males had higher emotion-focused and avoidant coping strategies. Females manifested more religious coping. Males showed more acceptance of their illness. Those without a partner had significantly higher emotion-focused coping strategies and higher religious coping. Income, social support, and problem-oriented coping were positively related to quality of life. Life satisfaction showed significant negative correlation with denial, substance use, and venting utilized as coping methods. CONCLUSION: Problem-focused coping (religious coping and acceptance) was found to be more effective than other methods. Patients in palliative care could be instructed for the use of problem-focused coping. Such training might enhance their life satisfaction, helping them experience greater control over the course of illness.
