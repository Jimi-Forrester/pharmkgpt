26616436|a|Performance status (PS) frequently improves occurs in cancer patients who have been infused with their own lymphokine-activated killer T cells (LAK-T). In the present study, a culture supernatant of LAK-T (LAK-T sup) administered to 8-week-old rats caused neurogenesis as evidenced by increased 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining of brain tissues. Intravenous injection of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a major cytokine in LAK-T sup, had a similar effect. Furthermore, LAK-T sup induced Ca(++) increase in rat hippocampal brain slices that was detected in neuronal cells by emission of Fluo-8 NW at 520 nm. The same effect was observed with an rGM-CSF solution. GM-CSF may activate neuronal cells by stimulating the glial cells that surround and attach to them. If so, GM-CSF and LAK-T sup may improve the motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The neurogenerative effect of GM-CSF in LAK-T sup may also help improve brain function in aged adults including those with dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.
