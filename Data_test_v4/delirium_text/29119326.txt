29119326|t|Neurodegeneration and the ordered assembly of alpha-synuclein.
29119326|a|In 2017, it was 200 years since James Parkinson published 'An Essay on the Shaking Palsy' and 20 years since alpha-synuclein aggregation came to the fore. In 1998, multiple system atrophy joined Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies as the third major synucleinopathy. Here, we describe the work that led to the identification of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites and Papp-Lantos bodies. We also review some of the findings reported since 1997.
