35444455|a|Background: Postoperative delirium is the highest prevalence and life-threatening complication following geriatric surgery. The overall incidence rate varies from 5% to 52% of hospitalized surgical patients based on the type of surgery that often began in the postanesthesia care unit and continues up to 5 days post-surgery. Postoperative delirium manifests as a hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed subtype. The mechanism of delirium development is not clear, but it is accepted that delirium is a result of the patient's underlying vulnerabilities or risk factors combined with an outside stressor such as infection or surgery. Objective: To develop evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of postoperative delirium. Methods: Literature was searched from PubMed, CINAH, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases that are published from 2010 to 2021 by formulating inclusion and exclusion criteria. Filtering was made depending on methodological quality, outcome, and data on population. Finally, 11 meta-analysis, 11 systematic reviews, 7 interventional studies, 11 observational studies, and recommendations of the previous clinical practice guideline developed by the American and European are included in this review. Results: A total of 43 studies were considered in this evaluation. The development of this guideline was based on nine studies on risk stratification for postoperative delirium, eighteen studies on risk minimization and prevention for postoperative delirium, five studies on diagnosis for postoperative delirium, and eleven studies on treatments for postoperative delirium. Conclusion: Postoperative delirium management can be categorized into risk assessment, risk minimization, early diagnosis, and treatment. Early diagnosis is critical to trigger focused and effective treatment. Non-pharmacological interventions are the first-line management for both hypoactive and hyperactive postoperative with considering contributory factors and underlying causes. Antipsychotics should only be used for hyperactive delirium individuals who try to harm themselves. Current evidence suggested that dexmedetomidine can be used as a treatment option for postoperative delirium.
