39237374|t|Long-Term Impact of Delirium on the Risk of Dementia in Hospitalized Older Patients: A Real-World Multicenter Study.
39237374|a|BACKGROUND: The association between delirium and dementia has been suggested, but mostly in the postoperative setting. This study aims to explore this relationship in a broader inpatient population, leveraging extensive real-world data to provide a more generalized understanding. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic health records of 11,970,475 hospitalized patients aged over 60 from nine institutions in South Korea were analyzed. Patients with and without delirium were identified, and propensity score matching (PSM) was used to create comparable groups. A 10-year longitudinal analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model, which calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed, aggregating results from all nine medical institutions. Lastly, we conducted various subgroup and sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the consistency of our study results across diverse conditions. RESULTS: After 1:1 PSM, a total of 47,306 patients were matched in both the delirium and nondelirium groups. Both groups had a median age group of 75-79 years, with 43.1% being female. The delirium group showed a significantly higher risk of all dementia compared with the nondelirium group (HR: 2.70 [95% CI: 2.27-3.20]). The incidence risk for different types of dementia was also notably higher in the delirium group (all dementia or mild cognitive impairment, HR: 2.46 [95% CI: 2.10-2.88]; Alzheimer's disease, HR: 2.74 [95% CI: 2.40-3.13]; vascular dementia, HR: 2.55 [95% CI: 2.07-3.13]). This pattern was consistent across all subgroup and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium significantly increases the risk of onset for all types of dementia. These findings highlight the importance of early detection of delirium and prompt intervention. Further research studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms linking delirium and dementia.
