31437721|t|The neuritic plaque in Alzheimer's disease: perivascular degeneration of neuronal processes.
31437721|a|Cerebrovascular pathology is common in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The microvasculature is particularly vulnerable, with capillary-level microhemorrhages coinciding with amyloid beta deposits in senile plaques. In the current analysis, we assessed the relationship between cerebral microvessels and the neuritic component of the plaque in cortical and hippocampal 50- to 200-mum sections from 11 AD, 3 Down syndrome, and 7 nondemented cases in neuritic disease stages 0-VI. We report that 77%-97% of neuritic plaques are perivascular, independently of disease stage or dementia diagnosis. Within neuritic plaques, dystrophic hyperphosphorylated tau-positive neurites appear as clusters of punctate, bulbous, and thread-like structures focused around capillaries and colocalize with iron deposits characteristic of microhemorrhage. Microvessels within the neuritic plaque are narrowed by 1.0 +- 1.0 mum-4.4 +- 2.0 mum, a difference of 16%-65% compared to blood vessel segments with diameters 7.9 +- 2.0-6.4 +- 0.8 mum (p < 0.01) outside the plaque domain. The reduced capacity of microvessels within plaques, frequently below patency, likely compromises normal microlocal cerebrovascular perfusion. These data link the neuritic and amyloid beta components of the plaque directly to microvascular degeneration. Strategies focused on cerebrovascular antecedents to neuritic dystrophy in AD have immediate potential for prevention, detection, and therapeutic intervention.
