33322533|t|A Rational Insight into the Effect of Dimethyl Sulfoxide on TNF-alpha Activity.
33322533|a|Direct inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) action is considered a promising way to prevent or treat TNF-alpha-associated diseases. The trimeric form of TNF-alpha binds to its receptor (TNFR) and activates the downstream signaling pathway. The interaction of TNF-alpha with molecular-grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in an equal volumetric ratio renders TNF-alpha inert, in this state, TNF-alpha fails to activate TNFR. Here, we aimed to examine the inhibition of TNF-alpha function by various concentrations of DMSO. Its higher concentration led to stronger attenuation of TNF-alpha-induced cytokine secretion by fibroblasts, and of their death. We found that this inhibition was mediated by a perturbation in the formation of the functional TNF-alpha trimer. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a transient interaction between DMSO molecules and the central hydrophobic cavity of the TNF-alpha homodimer, indicating that a brief interaction of DMSO with the TNF-alpha homodimer may disrupt the formation of the functional homotrimer. We also found that the sensitizing effect of actinomycin D on TNF-alpha-induced cell death depends upon the timing of these treatments and on the cell type. This study will help to select an appropriate concentration of DMSO as a working solvent for the screening of water-insoluble TNF-alpha inhibitors.
