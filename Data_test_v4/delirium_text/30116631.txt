30116631|a|PURPOSE: As far as we know, during the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the activity of proteasome in retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE) gradually decreases. And a lot of research has shown that age-related macular degeneration is closely related to inflammation and autoimmune. Moreover, there are many cytokines (CKs) involved in the course of inflammation. In this study, we are going to investigate how the decrease of proteasome activity affects the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19). METHODS: Cultured ARPE-19 was treated with or without MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and the levels of IL-6 mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) in RPE at 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, and IL-6 protein in the culture medium at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, and 12 h were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein levels of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in the culture medium at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, and 12 h were also measured by ELISA. Then we tested which of cell signal pathways regulating the production of IL-6 were activated when we added MG132 into the medium by Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). After that, we put the inhibitors of these activated cell signal pathways into the medium individually to see which inhibitor can counteract the effect of upregulating the levels of IL-6 in the culture medium of RPE. RESULTS: MG132 decreased the secretion of MCP-1 in the culture medium of RPE, but it increased the expression of IL-6 mRNA in RPE and IL-6 protein level in the culture medium of RPE. MG132 treatment was also found to enhance the level of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) by Western blotting. More importantly, the effect of MG132 on upregulating the levels of IL-6 was inhibited by SB203580, an inhibitor of P38 MAP kinases. But the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, cannot prevent the effect of upregulating the levels of IL-6 by MG132 in the RPE culture medium. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, upregulates IL-6 production in RPE cells through the activation of P38 MAPKs.
