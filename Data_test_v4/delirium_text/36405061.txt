36405061|t|Pharmacological and analytical aspects of alkannin/shikonin and their derivatives: An update from 2008 to 2022.
36405061|a|Alkannin/shikonin (A/S) and their derivatives are naturally occurring naphthoquinones majorly found in Boraginaceae family plants. They are integral constituents of traditional Chinese medicine Zicao (roots of Lithospermum erythrorhizon). In last two decades significant increase in pharmacological investigations on alkannin/shikonin and their derivatives has been reported that resulted in discovery of their novel mechanisms in various diseases and disorders. This review throws light on recently conducted pharmacological investigations on alkannin/shikonin and their derivatives and their outputs. Various analytical aspects are also discussed and brief summary of patent applications on inventions containing alkannin/shikonin and its derivatives is also provided.
