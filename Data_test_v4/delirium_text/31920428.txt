31920428|a|In current study is done antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes I and II inhibition assays, screening of biological active compounds and electronic microscopy analysis of secretory canals of fruits, flowers, roots, and aerial parts extracts and essential oils of Angelica purpurascens. Phenolic constituents, antioxidant, and anti-lipid peroxidation potentials of variants were estimated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) processes. Cholinesterase inhibition effect was detected through Ellman's method. The GC/ Mass Spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography (GC)-flame Ionization Detector (FID) was used for essential oils analysis. NMR techniques was used for identification of the isolated compounds. The fruit hexane and dichloromethane fractions exhibited a greater antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. The dichloromethane fraction of fruit demonstrated the most higher acetylcholinesterase inhibition (39.86 +- 2.63%), while the fruit hexane fraction displayed the best inhibition towards butyrylcholinesterase (84.02 +- 1.28%). Cytosolic isoenzymes of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) I, and II isoenzymes were influentially suppressed by flower and fruit dichloromethane fractions with 1.650 and 2.020 microM IC50 values, respectively. The electronic microscopy analysis of secretory canals found that the small number of secretory canals were at leaf while the largest shape of secretory canals was at the fruit. The secretory canals of roots, aerial parts, and fruits include more monoterpene hydrocarbons, while the canals, existing in the flowers are qualified by a higher presence of sesquiterpenes beta-caryophyllene (12.1%), germacrene D (4.5%) and ether octyl acetate (11.9%). The highest level of monoterpene beta-phellandrene (47.6%) and limonene (8.2%) were found in the fruit essential oil. The next isolated compounds from fruits of A. purpurascens like stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, bergapten, and oxypeucedanin have shown high anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities.
