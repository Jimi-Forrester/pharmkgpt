38957734|t|Hepatic injury and hepatic failure adverse events in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine users reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.
38957734|a|3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is being investigated in controlled clinical trials for use as an adjunct medication treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. MDMA is metabolized by N-demethylation, primarily by CYP2D6, to its main inactive metabolite, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine. It is also metabolized to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 to its active metabolite, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. Considering the extensive hepatic metabolism and excretion, MDMA use in psychiatry raises concerns over drug-induced liver injury (DILI), a rare but dangerous event. Majority of the drugs withdrawn from the market for liver injury caused death or transplantation at frequencies under 0.01%. Unfortunately, markers for liver injury were not measured in most published clinical trials. At the same time, no visible DILI-related symptoms and adverse events were observed. Idiosyncratic DILI cases are rarely registered during clinical trials due to their rare nature. In this study, we surveyed a larger, over 1,500, and a more diverse set of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and found 23 cases of hepatic injury and hepatic failure, in which MDMA was reported to be taken in addition to one or more substances. Interestingly, 22 out of 23 cases had one or more listed drugs with a known DILI concern based on the FDA's DILIrank dataset. Furthermore, only one report had MDMA listed as the primary suspect. Considering the nearly 20 million doses of MDMA used annually, this single report is insufficient for establishing a significant association with DILI.
