29316547|a|BACKGROUND: Pain is often one of the most debilitating symptoms in patients with advanced oncological disease. Patients with localized pain due to malignancy refractory to medical treatment can benefit from selective percutaneous cordotomy that disconnects the ascending pain fibers in the spinothalamic tract. OBJECTIVES: Over the past year, we have been performing percutaneous radiofrequency cordotomy with the use of the O-Arm intraoperative imaging system that allows both 2D fluoroscopy and 3D reconstructed computerized tomography imaging. We present our experience using this technique, focusing on technical nuances and complications. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients who underwent percutaneous cordotomy between March 2016 and March 2017. RESULTS: Nineteen patients underwent percutaneous cordotomy procedures. Two patients developed intraoperative delirium and were unable to tolerate the procedure. In 16 out of 17 completed procedures, we achieved excellent immediate pain relief (94%). At 1 month after operation, 15 of the 17 (88%) patients were pain free, and at 3 months 5 out of 5 patients available for follow-up were still free of their original pain. Mirror pain developed in 6 of the 17 patients (35%), but was mild in 4 of these cases and controlled with medications. We experienced 1 serious complication (6%) of ipsilateral hemiparesis. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous cordotomy using the O-Arm is safe and effective in the treatment of intractable oncological pain.
