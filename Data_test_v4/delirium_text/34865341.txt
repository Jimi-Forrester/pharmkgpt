34865341|t|Non-achievement of the Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Goal in Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and a Very High Cardiovascular Disease Risk: A Multicenter Study in Vietnam.
34865341|a|BACKGROUND: Lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) level is important for reducing cardiovascular (CV) events. However, little is known about the management of LDL-c in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with the non-achievement of LDL-c goals in older T2DM patients with a very high risk of CV diseases. METHODS: This multicenter cross-sectional study measured the LDL-c levels of 733 T2DM outpatients from December 2019 to July 2020. The patients were aged >=60 years, had very high risks of CV disease, and had been on LDL-c-lowering therapy for 6 months or more. The goal of lipid concentrations were assessed based on the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. We applied logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with the non-achievement of the LDL-c goal. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 68.6+-7.2 years. In total, 654 patients (89.2%) did not achieve the aggressive LDL-c goal of <1.4 mmol/L. In the adjusted model, the factors associated with the non-achievement of the LDL-c goal were obesity defined by body mass index (odds ratio [OR]=2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-4.81; p=0.022) and high-intensity statin therapy (OR=0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.05; p<0.001), while age, sex, education level, smoking habit, and comorbidities were not associated. CONCLUSION: Older patients with T2DM who are at a very high CV disease risk are often unable to achieve their LDL-c goal. Obesity can increase the probability of not achieving the LDL-c goal, whereas high-intensity statin therapy can decrease this probability.
