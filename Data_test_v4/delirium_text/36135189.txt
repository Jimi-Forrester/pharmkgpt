36135189|t|Toxicity, Safety, and Efficacy Studies on Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Decidua basalis in Wistar Albino Rats by Intravenous and Subcutaneous Routes.
36135189|a|Ex vivo expanded decidua-basalis(DB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from single donors have demonstrated therapeutic benefits in in vitro and in vivo studies. In this report, the intravenous and subcutaneous administration of DB-MSCs obtained from five healthy donors was assessed considering clinical grade proliferation, accessibility, and toxic effects in Wistar albino rats. The ability of the obtained DB-MSCs for differentiating, as well as their expression of several cell surface markers and immunomodulatory activities, were all assessed. Clinical standard proliferated cells were administered to animals intravenously and subcutaneously in a series of preclinical models in order to assess their in vivo toxicity, general safety, and tumorigenic possibilities. We established that DB cells exhibit structural and functional traits with MSCs. At various doses supplied intravenously or subcutaneously, the research showed no fatality, abnormal response to therapy, or substantial pathological modifications in the rats. Furthermore, there was no indication of prenatal damage in the same animal species when the rats were repeatedly treated with DBMSCs. Thus, DBMSCs were demonstrated to be non-toxic, non-teratogenic, and non-tumorigenic. To determine whether they can be administrated to human patients without risk, more investigation is recommended.
