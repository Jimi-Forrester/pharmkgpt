31507644|a|BACKGROUND: Although kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for chronic kidney disease, the accompanying immunosuppressive treatment can induce severe neurotoxicity presenting, on rare occasions, as psychosis. However, a brain tumor synchronous with immunosuppressant neurotoxicity has never been reported in a kidney transplant recipient. Herein, we report the first case of possible tacrolimus neurotoxicity with a meningioma manifesting as manic-like psychosis after kidney transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old male presenting with acute psychotic mania was admitted to a psychiatric ward approximately 2 years after kidney transplantation. On brain magnetic resonance imaging, a tuberculum sellae meningioma was found, and hyperintense white matter lesions with possible tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity were seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Interestingly, the patient showed no visual field defects, and his blood tacrolimus concentration was within therapeutic ranges. After 3 weeks of adjunctive treatment with blonanserin, most of the symptoms had abated. CONCLUSIONS: The present case highlights the fact that neuroimaging studies are necessary to investigate underlying causes, as well as immunosuppressant neurotoxicity, which should all be considered when atypical psychiatric symptoms develop after organ transplantation. Further, this case suggests that the additional use of atypical antipsychotics while maintaining immunosuppressants may be effective for manic-like psychotic symptoms secondary to possible immunosuppressant neurotoxicity synchronous with a meningioma.
