33924322|a|The gut brain axis seems to modulate various psychiatric and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence has led to the assumption that the gut microbiome might contribute to or even present the nucleus of origin for these diseases. In this regard, modifiers of the microbial composition might provide attractive new therapeutics. Aim of our study was to elucidate the effect of a rigorously changed gut microbiome on pathological hallmarks of AD. 5xFAD model mice were treated by antibiotics or probiotics (L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus) for 14 weeks. Pathogenesis was measured by nest building capability and plaque deposition. The gut microbiome was affected as expected: antibiotics significantly reduced viable commensals, while probiotics transiently increased Lactobacillaceae. Nesting score, however, was only improved in antibiotics-treated mice. These animals additionally displayed reduced plaque load in the hippocampus. While various physiological parameters were not affected, blood sugar was reduced and serum glucagon level significantly elevated in the antibiotics-treated animals together with a reduction in the receptor for advanced glycation end products RAGE-the inward transporter of Abeta peptides of the brain. Assumedly, the beneficial effect of the antibiotics was based on their anti-diabetic potential.
