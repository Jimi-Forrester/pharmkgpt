37228142|t|Improve sleep in critically ill patients: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial for a multi-component intervention of environment control in the ICU.
37228142|a|INTRODUCTION: In critically ill patients, sleep and circadian rhythms are greatly altered. These disturbances have been associated with adverse consequences, including increased mortality. Factors associated with the ICU environment, such as exposure to inadequate light and noise levels during the day and night or inflexible schedules of daily care activities, have been described as playing an essential role in sleep disturbances. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the use of a multifaceted environmental control intervention in the ICU on the quantity and quality of sleep, delirium, and post-intensive care neuropsychological impairment in critically ill patients. METHODS: This is a prospective, parallel-group, randomized trial in 56 critically ill patients once they are starting to recover from their acute illness. Patients will be randomized to receive a multifaceted intervention of environmental control in the ICU (dynamic light therapy, auditory masking, and rationalization of ICU nocturnal patient care activities) or standard care. The protocol will be applied from enrollment until ICU discharge. Baseline parameters, light and noise levels, polysomnography and actigraphy, daily oscillation of plasma concentrations of Melatonin and Cortisol, and questionnaires for the qualitative evaluation of sleep, will be assessed during the study. In addition, all patients will undergo standardized follow-up before hospital discharge and at 6 months to evaluate neuropsychological impairment. DISCUSSION: This study is the first randomized clinical trial in critically ill patients to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent, non-pharmacological environmental control intervention on sleep improvement in ICU patients. The results will provide data about the potential synergistic effects of a combined multi-component environmental intervention in ICU on outcomes in the ICU and long term, and the mechanism of action.
