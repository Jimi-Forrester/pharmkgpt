33407187|t|Protocol for evaluation of perioperative risk in patients aged over 75 years: Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation-Multidisciplinary Trial (APPLE-MDT study).
33407187|a|BACKGROUND: With the extended life expectancy of the Chinese population and improvements in surgery and anesthesia techniques, the number of aged patients undergoing surgery has been increasing annually. However, safety, effectiveness, and quality of life of aged patients undergoing surgery are facing major challenges. In order to standardize the perioperative assessment and procedures, we have developed a perioperative evaluation and auxiliary decision-making system named "Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation-Multidisciplinary Trial (APPLE-MDT)". METHODS: We will conduct a perioperative risk evaluation and targeted intervention, with follow-ups at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the "Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation-Multiple Disciplinary Trial Path" (hereinafter referred to as the APPLE-MDT path) in surgical decision-making for aged patients (>=75 years) undergoing elective surgery under non-local anesthesia in the operating room. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the postoperative outcome and health economics of the APPLE-MDT path applied to the surgical decision-making of aged patients (>=75 years) undergoing elective surgery under non-local anesthesia and to optimize intervention strategies for aged patients undergoing surgery to reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications and improve the quality of life after surgery. DISCUSSION: It is necessary to formulate a reliable, effective, and concise evaluation tool, which can effectively predict the perioperative complications and mortality of aged patients, support targeted intervention strategies, and allow for a more comprehensive risk and benefit analysis, thereby forming an effective senile perioperative surgery management path. It is expected that the implementation of this protocol can reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications, improve the postoperative quality of life, shorten hospital stay, reduce hospitalization expenses, reduce social burden, and allow the elderly to have a good quality of life after surgery.
