38999902|t|Polyphenols in Cereals: State of the Art of Available Information and Its Potential Use in Epidemiological Studies.
38999902|a|Cereals are the basis of much of the world's daily diet. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the beneficial properties of wholegrains due to their content of phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols. Despite this, the existing data on polyphenolic composition of cereal-based foods reported in the most comprehensive databases are still not updated. Many cereal-based foods and phenolic compounds are missing, including pigmented ones. Observational epidemiological studies reporting the intake of polyphenols from cereals are limited and inconsistent, although experimental studies suggest a protective role for dietary polyphenols against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Estimating polyphenol intake is complex because of the large number of compounds present in foods and the many factors that affect their levels, such as plant variety, harvest season, food processing and cooking, making it difficult matching consumption data with data on food composition. Further, it should be taken into account that food composition tables and consumed foods are categorized in different ways. The present work provides an overview of the available data on polyphenols content reported in several existing databases, in terms of presence, missing and no data, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of methods for assessing cereal polyphenol consumption. Furthermore, this review suggests a greater need for the inclusion of most up-to-date cereal food composition data and for the harmonization of standardized procedures in collecting cereal-based food data and adequate assessment tools for dietary intake.
