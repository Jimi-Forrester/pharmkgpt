37679377|t|A systematic review and meta-analysis of the SIRT1 response to exercise.
37679377|a|Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a key physiological regulator of metabolism and a target of therapeutic interventions for cardiometabolic and ageing-related disorders. Determining the factors and possible mechanisms of acute and adaptive SIRT1 response to exercise is essential for optimising exercise interventions aligned to the prevention and onset of disease. Exercise-induced SIRT1 upregulation has been reported in animals, but, to date, data in humans have been inconsistent. This exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess various exercise interventions measuring SIRT1 in healthy participants. A total of 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis (13 single bout exercise, 21 training interventions). Studies were grouped according to tissue sample type (blood, muscle), biomarkers (gene expression, protein content, enzyme level, enzyme activity), and exercise protocols. A single bout of high-intensity or fasted exercise per se increases skeletal muscle SIRT1 gene expression as measured by qPCR or RT-PCR, while repeated resistance training alone increases blood SIRT1 levels measured by ELISA. A limited number of studies also show a propensity for an increase in muscle SIRT1 activity as measured by fluorometric or sirtuin activity assay. In conclusion, exercise acutely upregulates muscle SIRT1 gene expression and chronically increases SIRT1 blood enzyme levels.
