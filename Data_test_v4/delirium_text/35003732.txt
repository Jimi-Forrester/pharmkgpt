35003732|t|Predictors of hypoxemia after general anesthesia in the early postoperative period in a hospital in Ethiopia: an observational study.
35003732|a|BACKGROUND: Early postoperative hypoxemia is a common problem after general anesthesia. The identification of factors associated with an increased occurrence of it might help healthcare professionals to hypoxemia risk patients, therefore this study aims to assess the incidence and factors associated with early postoperative hypoxemia among surgical procedures. METHODS: A prospective cohort study design was conducted from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, on a total of 424 patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia in Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. The data was collected using a structured checklist. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to check the association. RESULTS: The incidence of early postoperative hypoxemia was 45.8%. Patients having a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2 and BMI of 30-39.9 kg/m2, patients having a chronic disease, current smokers, SPO2 reading before induction of less than 95%, emergency surgery, and the absence of oxygen therapy during the period of transfer and/or in the post anesthesia care unit were significantly associated with an increased risk of hypoxemia in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of early postoperative hypoxemia was high in Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Obese patients, patients having a chronic disease, current smokers, and lower oxygen saturations before induction, emergency surgery, and the absence of oxygen therapy were the main predictors of an increased occurrence of early postoperative hypoxemia.
