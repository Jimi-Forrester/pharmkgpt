38255283|a|Apigenin is a flavone widely present in different fruits and vegetables and has been suggested to possess neuroprotective effects against some neurological disorders. In this study, we systematically reviewed preclinical studies that investigated the effects of apigenin on learning and memory, locomotion activity, anxiety-like behaviour, depressive-like behaviour and sensorimotor and motor coordination in rats and mice with impaired memory and behaviour. We searched SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant articles. A total of 34 studies were included in this review. The included studies revealed that apigenin enhanced learning and memory and locomotion activity, exhibited anxiolytic effects, attenuated depressive-like behaviour and improved sensorimotor and motor coordination in animals with cognitive impairment and neurobehavioural deficit. Some of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of apigenin include activation of the ERK/CREB/BDNF signalling pathway; modulation of neurotransmitter levels and monoaminergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems; inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production; and attenuation of oxidative neuronal damage. These results revealed the necessity for further research using established doses and short or long durations to ascertain effective and safe doses of apigenin. These results also point to the need for a clinical experiment to ascertain the therapeutic effect of apigenin.
