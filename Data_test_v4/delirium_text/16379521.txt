16379521|t|A16-year-old girl with excited catatonia treated with low-dose oral Lorazepam.
16379521|a|A 16-year-old girl, who carried a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, presented with symptoms consistent with excited catatonia/delirious mania. We believe this is the first report of excited catatonia in a child under the age of 18. Her catatonic symptoms responded to low-dose oral lorazepam (higher doses led to worsening of her clinical status). This case highlights the importance of considering catatonia in the differential diagnosis of agitated delirium, even in pediatric populations, and it underscores the need for more data about the pathogenesis and treatment of catatonia.
