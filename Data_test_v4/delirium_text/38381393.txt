38381393|t|Post-sepsis psychiatric disorder: Pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment.
38381393|a|Post-sepsis psychiatric disorder, encompassing anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and delirium, is a highly prevalent complication secondary to sepsis, resulting in a marked increase in long-term mortality among affected patients. Regrettably, psychiatric impairment associated with sepsis is frequently disregarded by clinicians. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of post-sepsis mental disorder, including coronavirus disease 2019-related psychiatric impairment. The pathophysiology of post-sepsis psychiatric disorder is complex and is known to involve blood-brain barrier disruption, overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, programmed cell death, and impaired neuroplasticity. No unified diagnostic criteria for this disorder are currently available; however, screening scales are often applied in its assessment. Modifiable risk factors for psychiatric impairment post-sepsis include the number of experienced traumatic memories, the length of ICU stay, level of albumin, the use of vasopressors or inotropes, daily activity function after sepsis, and the cumulative dose of dobutamine. To contribute to the prevention of post-sepsis psychiatric disorder, it may be beneficial to implement targeted interventions for these modifiable risk factors. Specific therapies for this condition remain scarce. Nevertheless, non-pharmacological approaches, such as comprehensive nursing care, may provide a promising avenue for treating psychiatric disorder following sepsis. In addition, although several therapeutic drugs have shown preliminary efficacy in animal models, further confirmation of their potential is required through follow-up clinical studies.
