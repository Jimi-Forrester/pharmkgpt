30810314|a|In Alzheimer's disease, the density and spread of aggregated tau protein track well with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, making the imaging of aggregated tau a compelling biomarker. A structure-activity relationship exploration around an isoquinoline hit, followed by an exploration of tolerated fluorination positions, allowed us to identify 9 (JNJ-64326067), a potent and selective binder to aggregated tau with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and no apparent off-target binding. This was confirmed in rat and monkey positron emission tomography studies using [18F]9.
