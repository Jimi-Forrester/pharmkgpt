30928879|a|A novel series of triazole-based compounds have been designed, synthesised and evaluated as multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) against Alzheimer disease (AD). The triazole-based compounds have been designed to target four major AD hallmarks that include Abeta aggregation, metal-induced Abeta aggregation, metal dys-homeostasis and oxidative stress. Among the synthesised compounds, 6n having o-CF3 group on the phenyl ring displayed most potent inhibitory activity (96.89% inhibition, IC50 = 8.065 +- 0.129 muM) against Abeta42 aggregation, compared to the reference compound curcumin (95.14% inhibition, IC50 = 6.385 +- 0.009 muM). Compound 6n disassembled preformed Abeta42 aggregates as effectively as curcumin. Furthermore, 6n displayed metal chelating ability and significantly inhibited Cu2+-induced Abeta42 aggregation and disassembled preformed Cu2+-induced Abeta42 aggregates. 6n successfully controlled the generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) by preventing the copper redox cycle. In addition, 6n did not display cytotoxicity and was able to inhibit toxicity induced by Abeta42 aggregates in SH-SY5Y cells. The preferred binding regions and key interactions of 6n with Abeta42 monomer and Abeta42 protofibril structure was evaluated with molecular docking. Compound 6n binds preferably to the C-terminal region of Abeta42 that play a critical role in Abeta42 aggregation. The results of the present study highlight a novel triazole-based compound, 6n, as a promising MTDL against AD.
