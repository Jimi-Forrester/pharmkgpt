37589021|t|Genetic Phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Potential Therapy.
37589021|a|Years of intensive research has brought us extensive knowledge on the genetic and molecular factors involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to the mutations in the three main causative genes of familial AD (FAD) including presenilins and amyloid precursor protein genes, studies have identified several genes as the most plausible genes for the onset and progression of FAD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, sortilin-related receptor 1, and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 7. The apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele is reported to be the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD), and it also plays an important role in FAD. Here, we reviewed recent developments in genetic and molecular studies that contributed to the understanding of the genetic phenotypes of FAD and compared them with SAD. We further reviewed the advancements in AD gene therapy and discussed the future perspectives based on the genetic phenotypes.
