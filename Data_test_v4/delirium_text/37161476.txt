37161476|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the synaptic and neuronal loss, which results in cognitive impairment in particular learning and memory. Currently, AD is incurable and no single confirmative test can clinically be used to diagnose AD. In light of the complex and multifactorial nature of AD etiology, the development of multifunctional/multi-target drugs that act on multiple pathological pathways and mechanisms shows great therapeutic potential for intervention of this devastating disease. We report herein a multifunctional theranostic cyanine, SLCOOH, which serves not only as a highly sensitive fluorescent probe for real-time imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) contents in different age groups of transgenic (Tg) AD mice but also as an effective therapeutic agent for early AD intervention via multiple pathological targets in the AD mouse model. Remarkably, treatment with SLCOOH gives rise to multiple therapeutic benefits, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, a reduction in Abeta levels, a decrease in hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and tau depositions, and the alleviation of synaptic loss and dysfunctions in young triple Tg AD mice. Our results have demonstrated that in addition to superior Abeta imaging capability, SLCOOH exhibits versatile and effective multiple modes of drug action, signifying outstanding therapeutic potential to treat early onset AD. Our work also paves the way for the development of effective Abeta-targeted theranostic agents for AD.
