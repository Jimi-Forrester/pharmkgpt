28413194|a|Using PrPC-knockout cell lines, it has been shown that the inhibition of apoptosis through STI1 is mediated by PrPC-dependent SOD activation. Antioxidant PrPC may contribute to suppression of inflammasome activation. PrPC is functionally involved in copper metabolism, signal transduction, neuroprotection, and cell maturation. Recently several reports have shown that PrPC participates in trans-membrane signaling processes associated with hematopoietic stem cell replication and neuronal differentiation. In another role, PrPC also tends to function as a neurotoxic protein. Abeta oligomer, which is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has also been reported to act as a ligand of PrPC. However, the physiological role of PrPC as an Abeta42-binding protein is not clear. Actually, PrPC is critical in Abeta42-mediated autophagy in neurons. PrPC shows a beneficial role in lipid rafts to promote autophagy. Further search for PrPC-interaction molecules using Prnp-/- mice and various types of Prnp-/- cell lines under various conditions may elucidate other important PrPC important functions.
