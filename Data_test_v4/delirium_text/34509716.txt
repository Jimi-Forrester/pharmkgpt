34509716|a|Sphingolipids (SLs) are a unique class of nitrogen-linked lipids that are involved in membrane structure, cell signaling, and other important cellular processes. Abnormal sphingolipid metabolism is observed in several diseases including cancer, diabetes, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. However, the direct study of SLs has been hampered by their ubiquitous presence in cells and their complex metabolism. In the past few decades, efforts have been focused on creating synthetic probes and chemical tools to study SLs and decipher their roles in cellular biology. In this brief perspective, we seek to provide a concise snapshot of recently developed state-of-the-art chemical tools in SL research and the challenges that can be addressed through further development of SL probes.
