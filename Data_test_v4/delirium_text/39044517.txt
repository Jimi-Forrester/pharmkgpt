39044517|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and there is by far no effective treatment for it, especially in its late stage. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), known as a class of non-coding RNAs are widely observed in eukaryotic transcriptomes, and are reported to play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases including AD. circRNAs usually act as microRNA (miRNA) inhibitors or <<sponges>> to regulate the function of miRNAs, leading to subsequent changes in protein activities and functions. Accumulating evidence indicates that circRNAs can serve as potential biomarker in AD early prediction. The functional roles of circRNAs are very versatile including miRNAs binding - thus affecting downstream gene expression, generating abnormally translated protein peptides, and affecting epigenetic modifications which subsequently affect AD related gene expressions. Therefore, identifying AD-related circRNAs can contribute to AD early diagnosis and intervention. In this work, we collected and curated an AD-related circRNA dataset; by exploring the circRNAs' corresponding DNA loci distribution in chromatin 3D conformation (3D genome) and utilize the such 3D genome information, we were able to selected a concise yet predictively effective circRNA panel, based on which, significantly better AD prediction machine learning models were achieved.
