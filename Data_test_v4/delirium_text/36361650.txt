36361650|t|Oxylipins Associated with D3-Creatine Muscle Mass/Weight and Physical Performance among Community-Dwelling Older Men.
36361650|a|Poor physical function is highly prevalent with aging, and strongly associated with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight. Using metabolomics, we previously identified several triglycerides consisting mostly of polyunsaturated fatty acids that were higher in older adults with good mobility. Here, we sought to further investigate polyunsaturated fatty-acid-related metabolites, i.e., oxylipins, and their associations with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight, gait speed, grip strength, and the Short Physical Performance Battery among 463 older men from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). Oxylipins were measured in fasting serum using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Muscle mass was estimated using D3-creatine dilution and adjusted for body size. We used linear regression to determine oxylipins associated with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight and physical performance, while adjusting for age, education, physical activity, Western dietary pattern, fish oil supplementation, and multiple comparisons. Among 42 oxylipins, none were associated with grip strength and 3 were associated with the Short Physical Performance Battery. In contrast, 18 and 17 oxylipins were associated with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight and gait speed, respectively. A subset of associations between oxylipins and gait speed were partially attenuated by D3-creatine muscle mass/weight. Higher levels of fatty acid alcohol and ketone oxylipins tended to be most strongly associated with gait speed and D3-creatine muscle mass/weight, potentially reflecting anti-inflammatory activity from these select oxylipins in MrOS older men.
