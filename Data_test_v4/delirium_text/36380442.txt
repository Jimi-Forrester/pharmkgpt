36380442|a|Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are essential for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, macromolecules, and immune cells in the central nervous system. They play critical roles in modulating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional MLVs have been demonstrated to increase neuroinflammation by horizontally blocking the drainage of neurotoxic proteins to the peripheral lymph nodes. Conversely, MLVs protect against neuroinflammation by preventing immune cells from becoming fully encephalitogenic. Furthermore, evidence suggests that neuroinflammation affects the structure and function of MLVs, causing vascular anomalies and angiogenesis. Although this field is still in its infancy, the strong link between MLVs and neuroinflammation has emerged as a potential target for slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a brief history of the discovery of MLVs, introduces in vivo and in vitro MLV models, highlights the molecular mechanisms through which MLVs contribute to and protect against neuroinflammation, and discusses the potential impact of neuroinflammation on MLVs, focusing on recent progress in neurodegenerative diseases.
