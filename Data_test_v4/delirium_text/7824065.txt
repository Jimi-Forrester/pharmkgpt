7824065|a|Alzheimer's disease may arise from or produce oxidative damage in the brain. To assess the responses of the Alzheimer's brain to possible oxidative challenges, we assayed for glutathione, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in twelve regions of Alzheimer's disease and aged control brains. In addition, we determined levels of malondialdehyde to evaluate lipid peroxidation in these brain regions. Most brain regions showed evidence of a response to an oxidative challenge, but the cellular response to this challenge differed among brain regions. These data suggest that the entire Alzheimer's brain may be subject to an oxidative challenge, but that some brain areas may be more vulnerable than others to the consequent neural damage that characterizes the disease.
