23276831|t|Additional acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory property of diaryl pyrazoline derivatives.
23276831|a|MAO-B and AChE are the two validated targets for Alzheimer's disease. In pursuit of a single molecule hitting both the targets, we explored a set of previously reported extremely potent MAO-B selective inhibitors, for their additional AChE inhibitory activity. We performed molecular docking studies that formed the basis for in vitro enzyme assay, and provided necessary insights into their binding mode. Most of the compounds were found active at nano molar range, and are consistent with the docking results. The identified dual acting lead molecules may provide the basis for further exploring these chemical moieties.
