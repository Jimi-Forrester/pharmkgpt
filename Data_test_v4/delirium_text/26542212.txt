26542212|a|The traditional application of the sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerotis (tiger's milk mushroom) by the indigenous folks as tonic and remedy to treat a variety of ailments has been documented in Malaysia. Indigenous communities claimed to have consumed the decoction to boost their alertness during hunting. Mental alertness is believed to be related to neuronal health and neuroactivity. In the present study, the cell viability and neuritogenic effects of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium hot aqueous and ethanolic extracts, and crude polysaccharides on rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were studied. Interestingly, the hot aqueous extract exhibited neuritogenic activity comparable to NGF in PC-12 cells. However, the extracts and crude polysaccharides stimulated neuritogenesis without stimulating the production of NGF in PC-12 cells. The involvements of the TrkA receptor and MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in hot aqueous extract-stimulated neuritogenesis were examined by Trk (K252a) and MEK/ERK1/2 (U0126 and PD98059) inhibitors. There was no significant difference in protein expression in NGF- and hot aqueous extract-treated cells for both total and phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK. The neuritogenic activity in PC-12 cells stimulated by hot aqueous and ethanolic extracts, and crude polysaccharides of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium mimicking NGF activity via the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is reported for the first time.
