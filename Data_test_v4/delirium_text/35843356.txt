35843356|a|The RNA binding protein ELAVL4/HuD regulates the translation and splicing of multiple Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate genes. We generated ELAVL4 knockout (KO) human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to study the effect that ELAVL4 has on AD-related cellular phenotypes. ELAVL4 KO significantly increased the levels of specific APP isoforms and intracellular phosphorylated tau, molecular changes that are related to the pathological hallmarks of AD. Overexpression of ELAVL4 in wild-type neurons and rescue experiments in ELAVL4 KO cells showed opposite effects and also led to a reduction of the extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta)42/40 ratio. All these observations were made in familial AD (fAD) and fAD-corrected neurons. To gain insight into the molecular cascades involved in neuronal ELAVL4 signaling, we conducted pathway and upstream regulator analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic data from the generated neurons. These analyses revealed that ELAVL4 affects multiple biological pathways linked to AD, including those involved in synaptic function, as well as gene expression downstream of APP and tau signaling. The analyses also suggest that ELAVL4 expression is regulated by insulin receptor-FOXO1 signaling in neurons. Taken together, ELAVL4 expression ameliorates AD-related molecular changes in neurons and affects multiple synaptic pathways, making it a promising target for novel drug development.
