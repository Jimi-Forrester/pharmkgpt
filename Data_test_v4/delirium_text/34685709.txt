34685709|t|The Role of AhR in the Hallmarks of Brain Aging: Friend and Foe.
34685709|a|In recent years, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, has been considered to be involved in aging phenotypes across several species. This receptor is a highly conserved biosensor that is activated by numerous exogenous and endogenous molecules, including microbiota metabolites, to mediate several physiological and toxicological functions. Brain aging hallmarks, which include glial cell activation and inflammation, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence, increase the vulnerability of humans to various neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, many studies have implicated AhR signaling pathways in the aging process and longevity across several species. This review provides an overview of the impact of AhR pathways on various aging hallmarks in the brain and the implications for AhR signaling as a mechanism in regulating aging-related diseases of the brain. We also explore how the nature of AhR ligands determines the outcomes of several signaling pathways in brain aging processes.
