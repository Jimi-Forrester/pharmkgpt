39394443|a|Breast Cancer (BC) is the most common cause of cancer-associated deaths in females worldwide. Despite advancements in BC treatment driven by extensive characterization of its molecular hallmarks, challenges such as drug resistance, tumor relapse, and metastasis persist. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative treatment approaches with multi-modal efficacy to overcome these hurdles. In this context, natural bioactives are increasingly recognized for their pivotal role as anti-cancer compounds. This study focuses on predicting molecular targets for key herbal phytoconstituents-gallic acid, piperine, quercetin, resveratrol, and beta-sitosterol-present in the polyherbal formulation, Krishnadi Churna. Using an in-silico network pharmacology model, key genes were identified and docked against these marker compounds and controls. Mammary carcinoma emerged as the most significant phenotype of the putative targets. Analysis of an online database revealed that out of 135 predicted targets, 134 were mutated in breast cancer patients. Notably, ESR1, CYP19A1, and EGFR were identified as key genes which are known to regulate the BC progression. Docking studies demonstrated that the herbal phytoconstituents had similar or better docking scores than positive controls for these key genes, with convincing protein-ligand interactions confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, MM/GBSA and free energy landscape (FEL) analysis. Overall, this study highlights the predictive potential of herbal phytoconstituents in targeting BC genes, suggesting their promise as a basis for developing new therapeutic formulations for BC.
