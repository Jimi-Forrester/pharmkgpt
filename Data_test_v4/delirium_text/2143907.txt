2143907|t|Pictorial priming and cued recall in Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.
2143907|a|A picture fragment test was used to compare the priming and cued recall performances of patients with Huntington's disease (HD), patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), and neurologically intact normal control (NC) subjects. On the pictorial priming test, subjects were asked to say "the first thing you think of" when shown incompletely drawn pictures, half of which were previously exposed to the subject during an unrelated naming task. Normal controls and HD patients, but not DAT patients, demonstrated similar increases in their ability to identify fragmented versions of previously seen pictures relative to novel pictures. These results are consistent with the previously observed pattern of preserved and impaired verbal priming ability in HD and DAT patients, respectively. The NC subjects, as expected, also demonstrated better performance on the cued recall than on the priming version of the picture fragment test, whereas the HD patients evidenced the opposite relationship on these two tasks and DAT patients were found to be equally impaired on both tests. This finding provides further support for the notion that HD patients' memory impairment is characterized primarily by an inability to initiate systematic retrieval strategies.
