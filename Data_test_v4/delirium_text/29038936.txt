29038936|a|Background An interdisciplinary approach is fundamental for effective prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacists could play a role in identifying and resolving medication-related delirium. However, little is known about their role in delirium care. Objective The main purpose of this survey was to assess the current practice and opinions of pharmacists concerning their involvement in screening, prevention and treatment of delirium. Setting Pharmacists in public and private hospitals in Australia. Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a pilot tested web-based questionnaire which was distributed primarily via a link in the electronic newsletter of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia. Main outcome measure Number and proportion of respondents answering questions related to the practice and perceptions of pharmacists in delirium management. Results Responses from 106 pharmacists were included in the analysis. Most respondents believed that pharmacists could play a role in prevention (92%) and screening (62%) of patients for delirium. However, in practice only 8% of pharmacists reported that they had ever screened a patient for delirium using a validated tool and 79% indicated that pharmacists were never or rarely involved in delirium treatment. When pharmacists did make recommendations half of the respondents said that pharmacists' recommendations were frequently or always accepted by the delirium treating teams. Conclusion Hospital pharmacists are underutilised in the prevention and management of delirium. Strategies to increase their involvement in the prevention and management of delirium should be implemented.
