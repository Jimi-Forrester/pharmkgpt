33110669|a|OBJECTIVE: Whipple's procedure for periampullary tumors has significant risks and complications. Delayed gastric emptying has the highest rate. Although the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery defined (ISGPS) this entity, multiple definitions still exist among authors. This study aims to revise the definition. METHOD: Seventy-three consecutive patients were analyzed for complications, particularly delayed gastric emptying. All patients underwent a standardized surgery. Procedures used for total pancreatectomies and benign diseases were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients were included in the study. Intra-abdominal complications were observed in 15 (20.6%) patients. Grade C delayed gastric emptying was observed in only one (1.4%) patient. Grade A and B disease were observed in three (4.1%) patients. However, they responded well to conservative methods, causing no extra morbidity. CONCLUSION: Grade A and B delayed gastric emptying can be observed after any gastrointestinal surgery. These patients respond well to simple conservative methods with nasogastric intubation. Drainage of the intra-abdominal collection resolves the emptying problem (if any). Only grade C disease without other intra-abdominal complications can be accepted as a complication of this procedure. ISGPS definition does not include the cause. Thus, the definition and grading can be revised.
