30761001|t|Unraveling the Function of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 Network.
30761001|a|Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a recently cloned transmembrane protein, actually a serine/threonine kinase named after the Madagascar primate lemur due to the long intracellular C-terminal tail. LMTK2 is relatively little known, compared to other kinases but its role has been increasingly recognized. Published data show that LMTK2 regulates key cellular events, including endocytic trafficking, nerve growth factor signaling, apoptosis, and Cl- transport. Abnormalities in the expression and function of LMTK2 are associated with human disease, such as neurodegeneration, cancer and infertility. We summarized the current state of knowledge on LMTK2 structure, regulation, interactome, intracellular localization, and tissue expression and point out future research directions to better understand the role of LMTK2.
