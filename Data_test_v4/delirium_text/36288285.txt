36288285|a|Neuron-immune interaction through secreted factors contributes significantly to the complex microenvironment in the central nervous system that could alter cell functionalities and fates in both physiological and pathological conditions, which remains poorly characterized at the single-cell level. Herein, using a spatially patterned antibody barcode microchip, we realized the mapping of 12 different secretomes, covering cytokines, neurotrophic factors (NFs), and neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from high-throughput, paired single cells (>= 600) simultaneously under normal conditions and an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model induced with amyloid beta protein 1-42 (Abeta1-42). We applied the platform to analyze the secretion profiles from paired neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia single cells with human cell lines. We found that pairwise neuron-macrophage interaction would trigger immune responses and attenuate neuron cells' secretion, while neuron-microglia interaction generally results in opposite outcomes in secretion. When neuron cells are induced with Abeta1-42 protein into the AD model, both neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia interactions lead to increased cytokines and NDEs and decreased NFs. Further analysis of AD patients' serum showed that NDEs were significantly higher in patients' samples than in the control group, validating our observation from the interaction assay. Furthermore, we resolved previously undifferentiated heterogeneity underlying the secretions from single-neuron cells. We found that the NDE and NF secretion was less dependent on the paracrine signaling between one another and that secretions from neuron cells would attenuate after differentiation with Abeta1-42. This study demonstrates the mapping of the different secretomes from paired neuron-immune single cells, providing avenues for understanding how neurons and immune cells interact through the complex secretome network.
