39378762|a|The multifaceted nature of the neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) with several interconnected etiologies, and the absence of effective drugs, led herein to the development and study of a series of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs). The developed RIV-IND hybrids, derived from the conjugation of an approved anti-AD drug, rivastigmine (RIV), with melatonin analogues, namely indole (IND) derivatives, revealed multifunctional properties, by associating the cholinesterase inhibition of the RIV drug with antioxidant activity, biometal (Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(III)) chelation properties, inhibition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation (self- and Cu-induced) and of monoamine oxidases (MAOs), as well as neuroprotection capacity in cell models of AD and PD. In particular, two hybrids with hydroxyl-substituted indoles (5a2 and 5a3) could be promising multifunctional compounds that inspire further development of novel anti-neurodegenerative drugs.
