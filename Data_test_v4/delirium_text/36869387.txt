36869387|t|Pharmacokinetics and safety of two Voriconazole formulations after intravenous infusion in two doses in healthy Chinese subjects.
36869387|a|BACKGROUND: Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole that is used to prevent and treat invasive fungal infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic equivalency of a test formulation and reference formulation (Vfend ) of Voriconazole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-cycle, crossover phase I trial. The 48 subjects were equally divided into 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg groups. Within each group, the subjects were randomized 1:1 to the test or reference formulation.. After a 7-day washout period, crossover formulations were administered. The blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1.0, 1.33,1.42,1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0 h later in the 4 mg/kg group, while at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.08, 2.17, 2.33, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0 h later in the 6 mg/kg group. The plasma concentrations of Voriconazole were determined by Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The safety of the drug was evaluated. RESULTS: The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the ratio of geometric means (GMRs) of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-  in both 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg groups were within the prespecified bioequivalence limits between 80 ~ 125%. In the 4 mg/kg groups, 24 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. The mean Cmax was (2.552 +- 0.448) mug/mL, AUC0-t was (11.875 +- 7.157) h*mug/mL and AUC0-  was (12.835 +- 9.813) h*mug/mL after a single dose of 4 mg/kg test formulation. The mean Cmax was (2.615 +- 0.464) mug/mL, AUC0-t was (12.500 +- 7.257) h*mug/mL and AUC0-  was (13.416 +- 9.485) h*mug/mL after a single dose of 4 mg/kg reference formulation. In the 6 mg/kg groups, 24 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. The mean Cmax was (3.538 +- 0.691) mug/mL, AUC0-t was (24.976 +- 12.364) h*mug/mL and AUC0-  was (26.212 +- 14.057) h*mug/mL after a single dose of 6 mg/kg test formulation. The mean Cmax was (3.504 +- 0.667) mug/mL AUC0-t was (24.990 +- 12.455) h*mug/mL and AUC0-  was (26.160 +- 13.996) h*mug/mL after a single dose of 6 mg/kg reference formulation. Serious adverse event (SAE) was not observed. CONCLUSION: In both 4 mg/kg group and 6 mg/kg group, equivalent pharmacokinetic characteristics that satisfied the criteria of bioequivalence for both test and reference formulations of Voriconazole.
