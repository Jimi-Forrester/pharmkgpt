37495836|a|PURPOSE: Because of the common and increasing use of antipsychotics in older adults, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the causes of antipsychotic-related risk of falls in older adults. We also aim to provide information on the use of antipsychotics in dementia, delirium and insomnia, their adverse effects and an overview of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms associated with antipsychotic use and falls. Finally, we aim to provide information to clinicians for weighing the benefits and harms of (de)prescribing. METHODS: A literature search was executed in CINAHL, PubMed and Scopus in March 2022 to identify studies focusing on fall-related adverse effects of the antipsychotic use in older adults. We focused on the antipsychotic use for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, insomnia, and delirium. RESULTS: Antipsychotics increase the risk of falls through anticholinergic, orthostatic and extrapyramidal effects, sedation, and adverse effects on cardio- and cerebrovascular system. Practical resources and algorithms are available that guide and assist clinicians in deprescribing antipsychotics without current indication. CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing of antipsychotics should be considered and encouraged in older people at risk of falling, especially when prescribed for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, delirium or insomnia. If antipsychotics are still needed, we recommend that the benefits and harms of antipsychotic use should be reassessed within two to four weeks of prescription. If the use of antipsychotic causes more harm than benefit, the deprescribing process should be started.
