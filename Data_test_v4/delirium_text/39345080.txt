39345080|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the value of noise reduction management in the intensive care unit (ICU) in elderly patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) in the uremic phase. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, including 150 elderly patients with CRF in the uremic phase, who were treated in the ICU ward at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between January 2021 and August 2023. Among them, 73 were in the control group (routine ICU management), and 77 were in the observation group (routine ICU management + ICU noise reduction management). Anxiety, depression, sleep treatment, quality of life, blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and cortisol (COR) levels were compared between the two groups at baseline and 10 days after admission to the ICU. RESULTS: There was no statistical significance in the comparison of baseline data between the two groups of patients (P > 0.05). At 10 days, the sleep quality of patients in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Anxiety levels, as well as blood pressure, HR, and COR levels, were significantly lower (P < 0.05), whereas the quality of life was higher in the observation group than in the control group (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: ICU noise reduction management can effectively improve the sleep quality and quality of life of elderly patients with CRF in the uremic phase.
