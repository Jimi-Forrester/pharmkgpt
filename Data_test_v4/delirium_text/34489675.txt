34489675|t|Cognitive Decline Assessment: A Review From Medical Imaging Perspective.
34489675|a|Aging is a complex process that involves changes at both molecular and morphological levels. However, our understanding of how aging affects brain anatomy and function is still poor. In addition, numerous biomarkers and imaging markers, usually associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been clinically used to study cognitive decline. However, the path of cognitive decline from healthy aging to a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage has been studied only marginally. This review presents aspects of cognitive decline assessment based on the imaging differences between individuals cognitively unimpaired and in the decline spectrum. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between imaging markers and the change in their patterns with aging by using neuropsychological tests. Our goal is to delineate how aging has been studied by using medical imaging tools and further explore the aging brain and cognitive decline. We find no consensus among the biomarkers to assess the cognitive decline and its relationship with the cognitive decline trajectory. Brain glucose hypometabolism was found to be directly related to aging and indirectly to cognitive decline. We still need to understand how to quantify an expected hypometabolism during cognitive decline during aging. The Abeta burden should be longitudinally studied to achieve a better consensus on its association with changes in the brain and cognition decline with aging. There exists a lack of standardization of imaging markers that highlight the need for their further improvement. In conclusion, we argue that there is a lot to investigate and understand cognitive decline better and seek a window for a suitable and effective treatment strategy.
