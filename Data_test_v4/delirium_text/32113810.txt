32113810|t|Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients With Dementia.
32113810|a|BACKGROUND: There are few studies evaluating total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with dementia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of revision, complication, emergency department (ED) visitation, and discharge disposition in patients with dementia undergoing THA. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated patients from 2007 to 2017 using a national database. We evaluated complications in patients with a diagnosis of dementia undergoing primary THA for osteoarthritis. RESULTS: In patients with dementia undergoing THA, the 90-day complications were increased risk of revision, delirium, ED visitation, and skilled nursing facility disposition (P < .05). In patients with dementia undergoing THA, the 2-year complications were increased risk of delirium, ED visitation, and skilled nursing facility disposition (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Patients with dementia undergoing THA are at an increased risk of complications and 90-day resource utilization.
