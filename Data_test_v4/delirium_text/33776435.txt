33776435|t|Alzheimer's Disease Determination by a Dual Probe on Gold Nanourchins and Nanohorn Hybrids.
33776435|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative chronic disorder that causes dementia and problems in thinking, cognitive impairment and behavioral changes. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a peptide involved in AD progression, and a high level of Abeta is highly correlated with severe AD. Identifying and quantifying Abeta levels helps in the early treatment of AD and reduces the factors associated with AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research introduced a dual probe detection system involving aptamers and antibodies to identify Abeta. Aptamers and antibodies were attached to the gold (Au) urchin and hybrid on the carbon nanohorn-modified surface. The nanohorn was immobilized on the sensor surface by using an amine linker, and then a Au urchin dual probe was immobilized. RESULTS: This dual probe-modified surface enhanced the current flow during Abeta detection compared with the surface with antibody as the probe. This dual probe interacted with higher numbers of Abeta peptides and reached the detection limit at 10 fM with R2=0.992. Furthermore, control experiments with nonimmune antibodies, complementary aptamer sequences and control proteins did not display the current responses, indicating the specific detection of Abeta. CONCLUSION: Abeta-spiked artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed a similar response to current changes, confirming the selective identification of Abeta.
