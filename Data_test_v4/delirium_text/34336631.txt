34336631|t|Reliable and Rapid Smooth Extubation After "Ketamine-Propfol Mixture" for Induction of General Anesthesia in Laparoscopic Drilling of Polycystic Ovary: A Randomized, Double-blind, Comparative Study.
34336631|a|BACKGROUND: Ketofol's effect on hemodynamics and the airway response during inducing general anesthesia has been studied previously. However, ketofol's effect on the smoothness of extubation has not been studied yet. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess ketofol's effect on the smoothness of extubation and compare it with propofol for inducing general anesthesia. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, and controlled study was conducted on 106 class I and II female patients with the "American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASAPS)," aged 18 - 40 years, scheduled for laparoscopic drilling for polycystic ovary disease under general anesthesia. The patients were assigned to two groups of 53 patients each: Group KP = ketofol and Group P = propofol. RESULTS: There was an excellent sedation score during suction and extubation in the ketofol group. The airway response and smoothness of extubation were better in the ketofol group than in the propofol group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketofol as an induction anesthetic agent more effectively attenuated the airway response during extubation than only propofol.
