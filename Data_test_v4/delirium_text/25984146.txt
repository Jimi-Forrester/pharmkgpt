25984146|t|Case report: a rare cause of metabolic alkalosis.
25984146|a|A case of a 66-year-old white man with recent onset of oedema, hypertension, metabolic alkalosis and profound hypokalaemia is described. The initial laboratorial workup showed that urinary chloride concentration and potassium excretion were increased, suggesting a state of hyperaldosteronism. Nonetheless, renin activity was low and aldosterone levels were normal. The metabolic alkalosis seen in this case was due to a rare cause, the ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome. A literature review in the subject is presented.
