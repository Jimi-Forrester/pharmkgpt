16945213|a|Amyloid containing senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are histologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly the SP and NFT found in non-demented, age-matched individuals with ischemic heart disease and/or hypertension are morphologically and topographically identical to those in AD. Cholesterol plays a significant role in production and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and progression of AD. Cholesterol is also a major contributor in atherosclerotic changes and cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies acknowledged benefits of cholesterol-lowering statins in slowing down the progression of AD, improving cognitive status and significantly reducing risk of cardiovascular events. Accumulating evidence suggests that there is a chronic inflammatory reaction in the areas of the brain affected by AD and C-reactive protein (CRP) is identified as a key molecule of acute phase of inflammation. CRP is also a very sensitive marker for cardiovascular events and excellent prognostic tool in post-heart attack and post-coronary artery bypass surgery recovery. Here we report that cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin produces no significant change in CRP levels in treating AD patients who participated in ADCLT (AD cholesterol lowering trial).
