36483984|a|Objective: The objective is to explore the effectiveness and safety of CAR T-cell therapy in advanced relapsed/refractory central nervous system B-cell lymphoma and compare the impact of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) plus CAR T-cell therapy versus sequential CART therapy on the survival of patients. Methods: The retrospective analysis was based on the data of 17 patients with advanced relapsed/refractory central nervous system B-cell lymphoma. Bridging chemotherapy was applied before CAR T-cell infusion to further reduce the tumor burden. For patients with autologous hematopoietic stem cell successful collection, CD19/20/22CAR T-cell immunotherapy following ASCT was performed with the thiotepa-containing conditioning regimen, while sequential CD19/CD20/CD22CAR T-cell therapy was applied. For lymphodepletion, patients received bendamustine or fludarabine monotherapy or fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide pre-CART-cell infusion. Results: Out of the 17 patients, 8 completed ASCT plus CART cell therapy, while 9 patients completed CART cell alone therapy. In efficacy assessment at 3 months after infusion, the objective response rate (ORR) was 12/17 (71%) and the complete response rate (CRR) was 11/17 (65%). The CRR of the ASCT group and non-ASCT was 100% and 44.4%, respectively (P < 0.01). The median progression-free survival was 16.3 (2.6-24.5) months, and the median overall survival was 19.3 (6-24.5) months. Patients who underwent ASCT plus CART cell therapy had significantly longer PFS (P < 0.01) and OS (P < 0.01). Grade 3 or higher immune effector cell-associated neurologic toxicity syndrome (>=grade 3 ICANS) and cytokine release syndrome (>=grade 3 CRS) events occurred in 29% and 41% of the patients, respectively. No treatment-related death occurred. Conclusion: The CAR T-cell therapy could augment its efficacy in the treatment of advanced relapsed/refractory CNS B-cell lymphoma, while ASCT in combination with CART can induce durable responses and OS with a manageable side effect.
