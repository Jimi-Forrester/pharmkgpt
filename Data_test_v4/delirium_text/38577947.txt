38577947|a|Chronic neuroinflammation serves a key role in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Mitochondria serve as central regulators of neuroinflammation. In addition to providing energy to cells, mitochondria also participate in the immunoinflammatory response of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, by regulating processes such as cell death and inflammasome activation. Under inflammatory conditions, mitochondrial oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dynamics and calcium homeostasis imbalance may serve as underlying regulatory mechanisms for these diseases. Therefore, investigating mechanisms related to mitochondrial dysfunction may result in therapeutic strategies against chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The present review summarizes the mechanisms of mitochondria in chronic neuroinflammatory diseases and the current treatment approaches that target mitochondrial dysfunction in these diseases.
