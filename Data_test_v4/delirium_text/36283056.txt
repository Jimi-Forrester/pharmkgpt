36283056|t|Natural Language Processing CAM Algorithm Improves Delirium Detection Compared With Conventional Methods.
36283056|a|Delirium is known to be underdiagnosed and underdocumented. Delirium detection in retrospective studies occurs mostly by clinician diagnosis or nursing documentation. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of natural language processing-confusion assessment method (NLP-CAM) algorithm when compared to conventional modalities of delirium detection. A multicenter retrospective study analyzed 4351 COVID-19 hospitalized patient records to identify delirium occurrence utilizing three different delirium detection modalities namely clinician diagnosis, nursing documentation, and the NLP-CAM algorithm. Delirium detection by any of the 3 methods is considered positive for delirium occurrence as a comparison. NLP-CAM captured 80% of overall delirium, followed by clinician diagnosis at 55%, and nursing flowsheet documentation at 43%. Increase in age, Charlson comorbidity score, and length of hospitalization had increased delirium detection odds regardless of the detection method. Artificial intelligence-based NLP-CAM algorithm, compared to conventional methods, improved delirium detection from electronic health records and holds promise in delirium diagnostics.
