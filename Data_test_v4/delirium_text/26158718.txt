26158718|a|OBJECTIVE: Rejecting nursing or medication is an increasing challenge for professional care in elderly people. METHODS: This explorative study was part of the Gerontopsychiatry study Berlin (Gepsy-B), an investigation of the data of all older inpatients (>= 65 years) admitted to a psychiatric hospital within 3 years (1266 admissions). RESULTS: 150 cases (11.8 %) rejected care. 94 (7.4 %) refused nursing and 89 (7.0 %) medication intake. 79.3 % of them suffered from organic brain diseases, particularly from delirium superimposed on dementia (ICD-10 F05.1). Nursing was more often rejected by older and more severely cognitive impaired patients, while refusal of medication was associated with delusions. CONCLUSIONS: Resisting nursing and refusing medication are 2 separate behavioral syndromes that may also occur together.
