27530462|t|Synthesis of Strophasterol A Guided by a Proposed Biosynthesis and Innate Reactivity.
27530462|a|The synthesis of strophasterol A, a moderator of endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress in Alzheimer's disease, and the first member of a structurally unprecedented class of secosterols, was achieved through the implementation of a key step of its proposed biosynthesis and two C-H oxidations. Analysis of the innate reactivity of the intermediates enabled the identification of a novel way to prepare an alpha-chloro-gamma-hydroxy-delta-keto enone, as well as its vinylogous alpha-ketol rearrangement to a delta-keto carboxylic acid.
