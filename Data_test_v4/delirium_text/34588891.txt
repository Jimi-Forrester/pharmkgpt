Cognitive impairment was reported to be more than 40% among elderly individuals. AIM: To predict cognitive impairment among geriatric patients at Asir central hospital, Saudi Arabia and its relationship to health status. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive correlational study design was used to conduct this study. The study included a convenient sample of all geriatric patients (130) attending outpatient clinics of Asir central hospital in Abha city from the first of February to the mid of March 2020. Three tools were utilized to collect data pertinent to this study; Tool (I): structured geriatric patient's sociodemographic and clinical data interview questionnaire, Tool II: Geriatric Depression Scale Short-Form (GDS-SF) and Tool III: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Scale. RESULTS: The majority of the studied sample was in the age group between 60 and 69 years, and female, having a chronic disease, (31.6%) were having a mild cognitive impairment and (17%) were having severe cognitive impairment and there was an association between cognitive impairment levels and health status of the studied patients with no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION: Nearly one third were having a mild cognitive impairment and about one fifth were having severe cognitive impairment. There was a correlation between levels of cognitive impairment and health status of the studied patients. RECOMMENDATIONS: Health education programs to increase the awareness of the Saudi community about cognitive impairment and its risk factors are needed. Elderly cognitive screening services must be readily available for early diagnosis and early treatment of cognitive impairment.
