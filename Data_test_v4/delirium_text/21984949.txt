The AD brain is characterized by deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which is produced from amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretase (presenilin complex)-mediated sequential cleavage. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells potentially provide an opportunity to generate a human cell-based model of AD that would be crucial for drug discovery as well as for investigating mechanisms of the disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We differentiated human iPS (hiPS) cells into neuronal cells expressing the forebrain marker, Foxg1, and the neocortical markers, Cux1, Satb2, Ctip2, and Tbr1. The iPS cell-derived neuronal cells also expressed amyloid precursor protein, beta-secretase, and gamma-secretase components, and were capable of secreting Abeta into the conditioned media. Abeta production was inhibited by beta-secretase inhibitor, gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), and an NSAID; however, there were different susceptibilities to all three drugs between early and late differentiation stages. At the early differentiation stage, GSI treatment caused a fast increase at lower dose (Abeta surge) and drastic decline of Abeta production. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the hiPS cell-derived neuronal cells express functional beta- and gamma-secretases involved in Abeta production; however, anti-Abeta drug screening using these hiPS cell-derived neuronal cells requires sufficient neuronal differentiation.
