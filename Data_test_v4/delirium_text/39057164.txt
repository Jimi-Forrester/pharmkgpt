39057164|t|Review of CAR T-Cell Therapy in Multiple Myeloma: A Canadian Perspective.
39057164|a|Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy. In the context of the current standard of care therapies in Canada, outcomes among patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), particularly those with triple-class (or more) refractory disease remain poor. Immunotherapies have significantly changed the treatment landscape of MM. Since 2021, two BCMA-targeting CAR T-cell therapy products have been approved for RRMM-namely Idecabtagene vicleucel (Ide-cel) (ABECMA ) and Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Cilta-cel) (CARVYKTI ), both of which are available in the US and Europe. Although they have shown unprecedented efficacy in RRMM, their clinical and logistical limitations must be acknowledged. MM CAR T-cell therapy is likely to be approved in Canada soon. Therefore, it is timely that we review the latest evidence for commercially available CAR T-cell therapy in multiple myeloma, with a focus on its relevance and impact in the Canadian setting. There will be challenges to access and strategies must be in place to ensure equitable care for all Canadians with MM. Alongside haematologists working in the immune effector cell therapy programs, providers in the community will also play a role in the ongoing monitoring and management of long-term side effects including opportunistic infections and late neurotoxicity.
