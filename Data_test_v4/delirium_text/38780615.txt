38780615|t|Risk factors for pulmonary complications after colorectal cancer surgery: a Japanese multicenter study.
38780615|a|PURPOSE: Pulmonary complications (PC) are a serious condition with a 20% mortality rate. However, few reports have examined risk factors for PC after colorectal surgery. This study investigated the frequency, characteristics, and risk factors for PC after colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: Between January 2016 and December 2022, we retrospectively reviewed 3979 consecutive patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery in seven participating hospitals. Patients were divided into patients who experienced PC (PC group, n = 54) and patients who did not (non-PC group, n = 3925). Clinical and pathological features were compared between groups. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (1.5%) developed PC, of whom 2 patients (3.7%) died due to PC. Age was greater (80 years vs 71 years; p < 0.001), frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary distress was greater (9.3% vs 3.2%; p = 0.029), performance status was poorer (p < 0.001), the proportion of underweight was higher (42.6% vs 13.4%, p < 0.001), frequency of open surgery was greater (24.1% vs 9.3%; p < 0.001), and blood loss was greater (40 mL vs 22 mL; p < 0.001) in the PC group. Multivariate analysis revealed male sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.165, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.176-3.986; p = 0.013), greater age (OR 3.180, 95%CI 1.798-5.624; p < 0.001), underweight (OR 3.961, 95%CI 2.210-7.100; p < 0.001), and poorer ASA-PS (OR 3.828, 95%CI 2.144-6.834; p < 0.001) as independent predictors of PC. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed male sex, greater age, underweight, and poorer ASA-PS as factors associated with development of PC, and suggested that pre- and postoperative rehabilitation and pneumonia control measures should be implemented for patients at high risk of PC.
