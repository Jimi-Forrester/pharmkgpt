31402066|a|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess and compare the diagnostic performance of brief cognitive tests for cognitive impairment (CI) screening recommended by the Spanish guidelines for the integral care of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a phase iii study into the accuracy of diagnostic tests, including patients with suspected CI in a primary care setting. All patients completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mini Examen Cognoscitivo (MEC), the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), the Eurotest, the Fototest, and the Memory Alteration Test (M@T). CI was diagnosed independently by researchers blinded to scores on these tests. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The study included 141 individuals (86 with CI). The Eurotest and M@T (AUC +- SE: 0.91 +- 0.02 and 0.90 +- 0.02, respectively) took longer to administer (mean [SD]: 7.1 [1.8] and 6.8 [2.2] min, respectively) and have significantly better diagnostic performance compared to the MMSE, MEC, SPMSQ, and CDT, but not compared to MIS or Fototest (both with an AUC of 0.87 +- 0.03), with the latter taking less than half as long to administer (2.8 [0.8] min). The M@T and MIS only evaluate memory, and the latter cannot be administered to illiterate people. CONCLUSION: The most advisable tests for CI screening in primary care are the Eurotest, M@T, and Fototest, with the latter being the most efficient as it takes half as long to administer.
