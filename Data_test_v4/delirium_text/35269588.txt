35269588|t|Epigenetic Studies in the Male APP/BIN1/COPS5 Triple-Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
35269588|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a major health problem worldwide. The lack of efficacy of existing therapies for AD is because of diagnosis at late stages of the disease, limited knowledge of biomarkers, and molecular mechanisms of AD pathology, as well as conventional drugs that are focused on symptomatic rather than mechanistic features of the disease. The connection between epigenetics and AD, however, may be useful for the development of novel therapeutics or diagnostic biomarkers for AD. The aim of this study was to investigate a pathogenic role for epigenetics and other biomarkers in the male APP/BIN1/COPS5 triple-transgenic (3xTg) mouse model of AD. In the APP/BIN1/COPS5 3xTg-AD mouse hippocampus, sirtuin expression and activity decreased, HDAC3 expression and activity increased, PSEN1 mRNA levels were unchanged, PSEN2 and APOE expression was reduced, and levels of the pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 increased; levels of pro-inflammatory COX-2 and TNFalpha and apoptotic (NOS3) markers increased slightly, but these were non-significant. In fixed mouse-brain slices, immunoreactivity for CD11b and beta-amyloid immunostaining increased. APP/BIN1/COPS5 3xTg-AD mice are a suitable model for evaluating epigenetic changes in AD, the discovery of new epigenetic-related biomarkers for AD diagnosis, and new epidrugs for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.
