32264970|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has highlighted the importance of microglial and astrocyte responses in the pathological development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. METHODS: A perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) mouse model was generated by administering etomidate, and cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents were recorded to analyze neuronal activity. In addition, microglia and astrocytes were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting, and genes that were activated in these cells were identified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We observed dramatic cognitive impairment at 1 and 3 weeks after etomidate was administered to 18 month-old mice. Microglia and astrocytes isolated from the hippocampus showed significant microglial activation during the early pathological stage (i.e., 1 week after etomidate injection) and an A1-specific astrocyte response during the late pathological stage (i.e., 3 weeks after etomidate injection). Furthermore, when microglia were eliminated before etomidate was injected, the A1-specific astrocyte activation response was significantly reduced, and cognitive function improved. However, when microglia were eliminated after etomidate application, astrocyte activation and cognitive function were not significantly altered. In addition, activating microglia immediately after a sedative dose of etomidate was injected markedly increased A1-specific astrocyte activation and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: A1-specific astrocyte activation is triggered by activated microglia during the initial pathological stage of PND and induces long-term synaptic inhibition and cognitive deficiencies. These results improve our understanding of how PND develops and may suggest therapeutic targets.
