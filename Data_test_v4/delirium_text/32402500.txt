32402500|a|BACKGROUND: Front-loaded diazepam is used to rapidly control agitation in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Our institution began using front-loaded lorazepam in August 2017 secondary to a nation-wide shortage of intravenous (IV) diazepam. Currently, there are no studies comparing lorazepam to diazepam for frontloading in severe AWS. METHOD: Retrospective cohort study of all adults presenting to the emergency department with a diagnosis of AWS and prescribed the institution's alcohol withdrawal agitated delirium protocol 8 months pre and post shortage of IV diazepam were eligible inclusion for the study. Of these, 106 patients were front-loaded with diazepam and 70 patients were front-loaded with lorazepam. RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean change in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised scores 24 h pre and post front-loading in the two groups (-13.9 +- -8.08 vs. -13.1 +- -8.91, p = 0.534). Patients who received front-loaded lorazepam had an increased incidence of ICU-delirium (positive for the Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU: 75% with lorazepam vs. 52.6% with diazepam, p = 0.009) and a higher risk of over-sedation, but this did not reach statistical significance (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score < -1: 32.1% with lorazepam vs. 18.2% with diazepam, p = 0.063). CONCLUSION: Front-loaded lorazepam was similar to front-loaded diazepam in controlling AWS symptoms. Lorazepam's delayed onset of action should be considered when determining how quickly repeat doses are administered to avoid the potential for adverse drug events.
