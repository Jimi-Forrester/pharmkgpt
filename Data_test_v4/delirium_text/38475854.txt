38475854|a|The central nervous system (CNS) is home to neuronal and glial cells. Traditionally, glia was disregarded as just the structural support across the brain and spinal cord, in striking contrast to neurons, always considered critical players in CNS functioning. In modern times this outdated dogma is continuously repelled by new evidence unravelling the importance of glia in neuronal maintenance and function. Therefore, glia replacement has been considered a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy. Glial progenitors are at the center of this hope, as they are the source of new glial cells. Indeed, sophisticated experimental therapies and exciting clinical trials shed light on the utility of exogenous glia in disease treatment. Therefore, this review article will elaborate on glial-restricted progenitor cells (GRPs), their origin and characteristics, available sources, and adaptation to current therapeutic approaches aimed at various CNS diseases, with particular attention paid to myelin-related disorders with a focus on recent progress and emerging concepts. The landscape of GRP clinical applications is also comprehensively presented, and future perspectives on promising, GRP-based therapeutic strategies for brain and spinal cord diseases are described in detail.
