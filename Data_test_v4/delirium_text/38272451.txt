38272451|t|A Case of Acute Neurologic Deficit and Hypoglycemia in the Setting of Thyroid Storm and Diabetic Ketoacidosis: A New Clinical Scenario.
38272451|a|The simultaneous development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and thyroid storm (TS) is a rare but potentially lifethreatening condition that requires immediate and targeted treatment. However, their combined diagnosis poses a serious challenge because of the similarities between their clinical manifestations. To date, only a few dozen cases have been described; most of which have been linked to the progression of thyrotoxicosis or uncontrolled hyperglycemia as contributing factors. We present the case of a 37-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus and Graves' disease who presented with both TS and DKA. She was initially admitted to the emergency department as a suspected case of stroke. Severe hypoglycemia significantly lowered her alertness to TS and probably provoked a sharp hyperthyroid decompensation, thereby leading to subsequent DKA development.
