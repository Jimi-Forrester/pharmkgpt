36718737|t|High Attendance Rate of Family Members During Physician Rounds Is Predictive of Worse Clinical Outcomes: A Historic Cohort Study.
36718737|a|BACKGROUND: The prognosis of long-term clinical outcomes for each patient is of utmost importance. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between rates of family attendance during rounds and long-term outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a historic cohort study. RESULTS: We followed 200 consecutive patients for a median of 19 months. Within the group of patients that had family members present in > 75% of rounds, the 30-day re-hospitalization rate was tenfold higher (P = 0.017). The overall prognosis (including median survival length) of patients who had the highest rates of family attendance (> 75%) was significantly worse compared to patients who had lower rates (P = 0.028). High rates of family attendance were found to correlate with other established risk factors for long-term mortality, including advanced age (r = 0.231, P = 0.001) and in-hospital delirium. CONCLUSIONS: High family attendance during physician rounds in an internal medicine department is associated with worse patient prognosis.
