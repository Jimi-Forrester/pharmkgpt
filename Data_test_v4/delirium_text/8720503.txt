8720503|t|Increase in vasopressin binding sites in the human choroid plexus in Alzheimer's disease.
8720503|a|Vasopressin binding sites were determined in the choroid plexus of five Alzheimer's disease patients and five non-demented controls using the 125I-labelled linear V1a-antagonist. The Alzheimer's disease patients showed a twofold increase in the density of vasopressin binding sites, whereas the increase in the affinity constant Kd did not reach significance.
