38132149|t|Peptidyl Arginine Deiminases in Chronic Diseases: A Focus on Rheumatoid Arthritis and Interstitial Lung Disease.
38132149|a|Protein citrullination is accomplished by a broad enzyme family named Peptidyl Arginine Deiminases (PADs), which makes this post-translational modification in many proteins that perform physiological and pathologic mechanisms in the body. Due to these modifications, citrullination has become a significant topic in the study of pathological processes. It has been related to some chronic and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), interstitial lung diseases (ILD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and certain types of cancer, among others. Antibody production against different targets, including filaggrin, vimentin, and collagen, results in an immune response if they are citrullinated, which triggers a continuous inflammatory process characteristic of autoimmune and certain chronic diseases. PAD coding genes (PADI1 to PADI4 and PADI6) harbor variations that can be important in these enzymes' folding, activity, function, and half-life. However, few studies have considered these genetic factors in the context of chronic diseases. Exploring PAD pathways and their role in autoimmune and chronic diseases is a major topic in developing new pharmacological targets and valuable biomarkers to improve diagnosis and prevention. The present review addresses and highlights genetic, molecular, biochemical, and physiopathological factors where PAD enzymes perform a major role in autoimmune and chronic diseases.
