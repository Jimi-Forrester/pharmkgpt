33914828|a|INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a state of being vulnerable to adverse health outcomes such as falls, delirium, and disability in older people. Identifying frailty is important in a low-income setting to prevent it from progressing, reducing healthcare costs, increasing the chances of reversibility, and implementing effective interventions. The factors affecting frailty in older people living in old age homes could differ from those living in the community. This study was conducted to identify the factors associated with frailty in older people residing in old age homes and communities in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted from April to June 2019 in three districts of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Data were collected from 193 older people residing in old age homes and 501 residing in communities aged 60 and above using convenience sampling. Frailty was measured using the Groningen Frailty Indicator. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between independent variables and frailty. RESULTS: Frailty was more prevalent among older people in old age homes (71.5%) compared to those in the community (56.3%). Older people who were satisfied with their living environment had lower frailty scores in both old age homes (beta = -0.20, p<0.01) and the community (beta = -0.15, p<0.001). Those who had self-rated unhealthy lifestyle had higher frailty scores in both old age homes (beta = 0.45, p<0.001) and the community (beta = 0.25, p<0.001). In the community, those over 80 years of age had higher frailty scores (beta = 0.15, p<0.01) and those with higher education had lower scores (beta = -0.13, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The living environment and lifestyle are key modifiable risk factors of frailty, both in old age homes and the community. The findings suggest a need for lifestyle modification and reforms in building standards, especially in old age homes, to promote age-friendly communities.
