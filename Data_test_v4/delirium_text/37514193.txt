37514193|t|An In Vivo Electroencephalographic Analysis of the Effect of Riluzole against Limbic and Absence Seizure and Comparison with Glutamate Antagonists.
37514193|a|BACKGROUND: Riluzole (RLZ) has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in several neurological disorders. These neuroprotective effects seem to be mainly due to its ability to inhibit the excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission, acting on different targets located both at the presynaptic and postsynaptic levels. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated the effects of Riluzole (RLZ) against limbic seizures, induced by AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptor agonists in Sprague-Dawley rats, and in a well-validated genetic model of absence epilepsy, the WAG/Rij rat. Furthermore, in this latter model, we also studied the effect of RLZ in co-administration with the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, CPP, or the non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, THIQ-10c, on spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in WAG/Rij rats, to understand the potential involvement of AMPA and NMDA receptors in the anti-absence effect of RLZ. RESULTS: In Sprague-Dawley rats, RLZ pretreatment significantly reduced the limbic seizure severity induced by glutamatergic agonists, suggesting an antagonism of RLZ mainly on NMDA rather than non-NMDA receptors. RLZ also reduced SWD parameters in WAG/Rij rats. Interestingly, the co-administration of RLZ with CPP did not increase the anti-absence activity of RLZ in this model, advocating a competitive effect on the NMDA receptor. In contrast, the co-administration of RLZ with THIQ-10c induced an additive effect against absence seizure in WAG/Rij rats. CONCLUSIONS: these results suggest that the antiepileptic effects of RLZ, in both seizure models, can be mainly due to the antagonism of the NMDA glutamatergic receptors.
