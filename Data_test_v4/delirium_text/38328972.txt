38328972|a|BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether cognitive reserve can attenuate dementia risk among people with different genetic predispositions. AIMS: We aimed to examine the association between cognitive reserve and dementia, and further to explore whether and to what extent cognitive reserve may modify the risk effect of genetic factors on dementia. METHOD: Within the UK Biobank, 210 631 dementia-free participants aged >=60 years were followed to detect incident dementia. Dementia was ascertained through medical and death records. A composite cognitive reserve indicator encompassing education, occupation and multiple cognitively loaded activities was created using latent class analysis, categorised as low, moderate and high level. Polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer's disease were constructed to evaluate genetic risk for dementia, categorised by tertiles (high, moderate and low). Data were analysed using Cox models and Laplace regression. RESULTS: In multi-adjusted Cox models, the hazard ratio (HR) of dementia was 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.70) for high cognitive reserve compared with low cognitive reserve. In Laplace regression, participants with high cognitive reserve developed dementia 1.62 (95% CI 1.35-1.88) years later than those with low cognitive reserve. In stratified analysis by genetic risk, high cognitive reserve was related to more than 30% lower dementia risk compared with low cognitive reserve in each stratum. There was an additive interaction between low cognitive reserve and high genetic risk on dementia (attributable proportion 0.24, 95% CI 0.17-0.31). CONCLUSIONS: High cognitive reserve is associated with reduced risk of dementia and may delay dementia onset. Genetic risk for dementia may be mitigated by high cognitive reserve. Our findings underscore the importance of enhancing cognitive reserve in dementia prevention.
