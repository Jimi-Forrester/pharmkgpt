31024987|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are nearly universal in cognitive disorders. The mild behavioral impairment construct postulates that NPS may be the first symptom of impending dementia. METHODS: Participants were cognitively normal volunteers followed up approximately annually at Alzheimer's Disease Centers, who were assessed on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and had at least one follow-up visit during which they were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Descriptive statistics were used to determine sequencing of NPS presence with cognitive diagnoses. RESULTS: Data were available for 1998 participants who progressed to MCI or dementia. Over 59% developed NPS before the diagnosis of any cognitive disorder. Depression and irritability were the most common NPSs to precede cognitive diagnoses (24 and 21%, respectively). DISCUSSION: NPSs precede a cognitive diagnosis in most people who develop cognitive decline, both MCI and dementia. These individuals are an important group to focus clinical and research efforts.
