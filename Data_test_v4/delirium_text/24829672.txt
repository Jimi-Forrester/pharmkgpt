24829672|a|Protein calorie malnutrition (PCM) is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis and occurs in 50%-90% of these patients. Although the pathogenesis of PCM is multifactorial, alterations in protein metabolism play an important role. This article is based on a selective literature review of protein and sodium recommendations. Daily protein and sodium requirements of patients with cirrhosis have been the subject of many research studies since inadequate amounts of both can contribute to the development of malnutrition. Previous recommendations that limited protein intake should no longer be practiced as protein requirements of patients with cirrhosis are higher than those of healthy individuals. Higher intakes of branched-chain amino acids as well as vegetable proteins have shown benefits in patients with cirrhosis, but more research is needed on both topics. Sodium restrictions are necessary to prevent ascites development, but very strict limitations, which may lead to PCM should be avoided.
