34205777|t|Pro-Oxidative Effect of KIO3 and Protective Effect of Melatonin in the Thyroid-Comparison to Other Tissues.
34205777|a|Not only iodine deficiency, but also its excess may contribute to thyroid cancer. Potassium iodate (KIO3), which is broadly used in the salt iodization program, can increase oxidative damage to membrane lipids (lipid peroxidation, LPO) under experimental conditions, with the strongest damaging effect at KIO3 concentration of ~10 mM (corresponding to physiological iodine concentration in the thyroid). Melatonin is an effective antioxidant, which protects against KIO3-induced LPO in the thyroid. This study aimed to compare the protective effects of melatonin, used in the highest achievable in vitro concentration, against KIO3-induced oxidative damage to membrane lipids in various porcine tissues (thyroid, ovary, liver, kidney, brain, spleen, and small intestine). Homogenates were incubated in the presence of KIO3 (20; 15; 10; 7.5; 5.0; 0.0 mM) without/with melatonin (5 mM). The malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals (MDA + 4-HDA) concentration (LPO index) was measured spectrophotometrically. KIO3 increased the LPO in all examined tissues; in the thyroid, the damaging effect of KIO3 (10; and 7.5 mM) was lower than in other tissues and was not observed for the lowest concentration of 5 mM. Melatonin reduced LPO induced by KIO3 (10, 7.5, and 5 mM) in all tissues, and in the thyroid it was also protective against as high a concentration of KIO3 as 15 mM; the LPO level resulting from KIO3 + melatonin treatment was lower in the thyroid than in other tissues. In conclusion, the thyroid is less sensitive tothe pro-oxidative effects of KIO3 compared to other tissues. The strongest protective effect of melatonin was observed in the thyroid, but beneficial effects were significant also in other tissues. Melatonin should be considered to avoid the potential damaging effects of iodine compounds applied in iodine prophylaxis.
