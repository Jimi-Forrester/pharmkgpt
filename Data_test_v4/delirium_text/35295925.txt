35295925|t|Ethnobotany, Phytochemistry, Biological Activities, and Health-Promoting Effects of the Genus Bulbophyllum.
35295925|a|The genus Bulbophyllum is of scientific interest due to the phytochemical components and diverse biological activities found across species of the genus. Most Bulbophyllum species are epiphytic and located in habitats that range from subtropical dry forests to wet montane cloud forests. In many cultures, the genus Bulbophyllum has a religious, protective, ornamenting, cosmetic, and medicinal role. Detailed investigations into the molecular pharmacological mechanisms and numerous biological effects of Bulbophyllum spp. remain ambiguous. The review focuses on an in-depth discussion of studies containing data on phytochemistry and preclinical pharmacology. Thus, the purpose of this review was to summarize the therapeutic potential of Bulbophyllum spp. biocompounds. Data were collected from several scientific databases such as PubMed and ScienceDirect, other professional websites, and traditional medicine books to obtain the necessary information. Evidence from pharmacological studies has shown that various phytoconstituents in some Bulbophyllum species have different biological health-promoting activities such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and neuroprotective. No toxicological effects have been reported to date. Future clinical trials are needed for the clinical confirmation of biological activities proven in preclinical studies. Although orchid species are cultivated for ornamental purposes and have a wide traditional use, the novelty of this review is a summary of biological actions from preclinical studies, thus supporting ethnopharmacological data.
