39694170|a|BACKGROUND: Smoking is detrimental to health, with tobacco use being a critical factor in the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which progressively impairs brain function and poses a significant threat to public health. This study aims to examine the potential genetic alterations induced by smoking that are associated with AD and to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The research will provide theoretical foundations for targeted prevention and treatment strategies for AD. METHODS: This study analyzed datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to identify genes affected by tobacco smoke exposure and those altered in patients with AD relative to normal controls. We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses using OmicShare tools to screen for key pathways. Key genes were identified by constructing protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) in the STRING database with the aid of CytoHubba. Additionally, the binding activity of the proteins encoded by these key genes to nicotine, the main component of tobacco, was analyzed using molecular docking techniques. Finally, the analytical results were verified using Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS: The CTD identified 12,164 CE-related genes affected by tobacco smoke exposure. A comparison of these datasets yielded 94 common genes that were both influenced by tobacco and differentially expressed across all brain regions. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that these common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly enriched in the Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. The DEGs' PPI network, constructed using the STRING database, highlighted key genes such as HSP90AB1, SOS2, MAGI1, and YWHAZ. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that nicotine binds effectively to the protein structures of these key genes, primarily through amino acid residues such as Ser and Glu. Experimental validation showed that HSP90AB1 and YWHAZ exhibited notable expression discrepancies under varying concentrations of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments, particularly demonstrating a pronounced down-regulation trend at elevated concentrations. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that tobacco may impact the function of transmembrane transporter proteins and contribute to the development of AD by affecting key genes such as HSP90AB1 and YWHAZ, as well as signaling pathways like PI3K-AKT.
