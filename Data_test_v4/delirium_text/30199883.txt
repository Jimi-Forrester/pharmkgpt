30199883|t|Late-Life Depression versus Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: Alzheimer's Disease Incidence in 4 Years of Follow-Up.
30199883|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic power of late-life depression (LLD) compared with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) for the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 4 years of follow-up. METHODS: We estimated the incidence of AD in 60 patients presenting with aMCI, 115 patients suffering of LLD treated with antidepressants with good compliance, and 66 healthy control (HC) patients, followed for 4 years. RESULTS: The risk to develop AD, within 4 years, was 68.33% for aMCI and 49.57% for LLD. In AD patients 5.60% deteriorated without depression, and 72.20% deteriorated with depression after 4 years of follow-up (p < 0.0001). No HC patients deteriorated to AD or any other dementia type. CONCLUSION: In our results, aMCI was the first predictive condition that increased the risk to develop AD. Depression is a potentially preventable medical condition across the lifespan and may be a modifiable risk factor.
