38003389|t|The Unfolded Protein Response in a Murine Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Looking for Predictors.
38003389|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most frequent type of dementia worldwide, and aging is the most important risk factor for the sporadic form of the pathology. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the main cellular actor involved in proteostasis, appears significantly compromised in AD due to the accumulation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein and the phosphorylated Tau protein. Increasing protein misfolding activates a specific cellular response known as Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which orchestrates the recovery of ER function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of UPR in a murine model of AD induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta1-42 oligomers at 3 or 18 months. The oligomer injection in aged animals induced memory impairment, oxidative stress, and the depletion of glutathione reserve. Furthermore, the RNA sequencing and the bioinformatic analysis performed showed the enrichment of several pathways involved in neurodegeneration and protein regulations. The analysis highlighted the significant dysregulation of the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6). In turn, ER stress affected the PI3K/Akt/Gsk3beta and MAPK/ERK pathways, highlighting Mapkapk5 as a potential marker, whose regulation could lead to the definition of new pharmacological and neuroprotective strategies to counteract AD.
