38988189|t|Socioemotional Dysfunction From Temporal Lobe Involvement in Frontotemporal Dementia: A Preliminary Report.
38988189|a|OBJECTIVE: Socioemotional changes, rather than cognitive impairments, are the feature that defines behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Investigators have attributed the socioemotional changes in bvFTD and other dementias to frontal lobe dysfunction; however, recent work implies a further contribution from right anterior temporal disease. The authors evaluated relationships between regional brain atrophy and socioemotional changes in both bvFTD and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). METHODS: This study explored the neuroanatomical correlations of performance on the Socioemotional Dysfunction Scale (SDS), an instrument previously shown to document socioemotional changes in bvFTD, among 13 patients with bvFTD not preselected for anterior temporal involvement and 16 age-matched patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). SDS scores were correlated with volumes of regions of interest assessed with tensor-based morphometric analysis of MRI images. RESULTS: As expected, the bvFTD group had significantly higher SDS scores overall and smaller frontal regions compared with the EOAD group, which in turn had smaller volumes in temporoparietal regions. SDS scores significantly correlated with lateral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy, and a regression analysis that controlled for diagnosis indicated that SDS scores predicted lateral ATL volume. Within the bvFTD group, higher SDS scores were associated with smaller lateral and right ATL regions, as well as a smaller orbitofrontal cortex. Within the EOAD group, higher SDS scores were associated with a smaller right parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that, in addition to orbitofrontal disease, there is a prominent right and lateral ATL origin of socioemotional changes in bvFTD and further suggests that right parietal involvement contributes to socioemotional changes in EOAD.
