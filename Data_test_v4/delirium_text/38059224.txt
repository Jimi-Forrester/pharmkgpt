38059224|t|Incidence, predictors, and impact of acute post-operative pain after cranial neurosurgery: A prospective cohort study.
38059224|a|Objectives: Pain is common after craniotomy. Its incidence and predictors in developing nations are not adequately studied. We aimed to assess the incidence, predictors, and impact of acute post-operative pain after intracranial neurosurgeries. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in adult patients undergoing intracranial neurosurgeries. After patient consent, ethics committee approval, and study registration, we assessed the incidence of post-operative pain using numerical rating scale (NRS) score. Predictors and impact of pain on patient outcomes were also evaluated. Results: A total of 497 patients were recruited during 10-month study period. Significant (4-10 NRS score) post-operative pain at any time-point during the first 3 days after intracranial neurosurgery was reported by 65.5% (307/469) of patients. Incidence of significant pain during the 1st post-operative h, on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd post-operative days was 20% (78/391), 50% (209/418), 38% (152/401), and 24% (86/360), respectively. Higher pre-operative NRS score and pain during the 1st h post-operatively, predicted the occurrence of pain during the first 3 days after surgery, P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively. Pain was significantly associated with poor sleep quality on the first 2 post-operative nights (P < 0.001). Patient satisfaction score was higher in patients with post-operative pain, P = 0.002. Conclusion: Every two in three patients undergoing elective intracranial neurosurgery report significant pain at some point during the first 3 postoperative days. Pre-operative pain and pain during 1st post-operative h predict the occurrence of significant post-operative pain.
