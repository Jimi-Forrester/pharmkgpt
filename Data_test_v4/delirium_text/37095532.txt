37095532|a|BACKGROUND: The intent of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of thoracolumbar interfascial plane block (TLIP) for pain control after lumbar spinal surgery. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published on PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to February 10, 2023, comparing TLIP with no or sham block or wound infiltration for lumbar spinal surgeries were included. Pain scores, total analgesic consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs were eligible. Comparing TLIP with no block or sham block, the meta-analysis showed a significant decrease of pain scores at rest and movement at 2 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h. Pooled analysis of four studies showed a significant difference in pain scores at rest between TLIP and wound infiltration group at 8 h but not at 2 h, 12 h, and 24 h. Total analgesic consumption was significantly reduced with TLIP block as compared to no block/sham block and wound infiltration. TLIP block also significantly reduced PONV. GRADE assessment of the evidence was moderate. CONCLUSION: Moderate quality evidence indicates that TLIP blocks are effective in pain control after lumbar spinal surgeries. TLIP reduces pain scores at rest and movement for up to 24 h, reduces total analgesic consumption, and the incidence of PONV. However, evidence of its efficacy as compared to wound infiltration of local anesthetics is scarce. Results should be interpreted with caution owing low to moderate quality of the primary studies and marked heterogeneity.
