22338577|t|Platelet activation in Alzheimer's disease: from pathophysiology to clinical value.
22338577|a|Vascular risk factors and atherosclerosis are critically involved in dementia development of both vascular and Alzheimer's type. However, the exact mechanisms linking atherosclerosis and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still unknown. As platelet activation and adhesion on vascular wall is the first step of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, it appears tempting to hypothesize that platelets could be the link between vascular risk factors/ atherosclerosis and AD. In recent years, much work has been accomplished to elucidate the role of platelets in AD. The present review will summarize and highlight the latest findings of this research area and provide novel insight and understanding in the association between platelet activation and AD.
