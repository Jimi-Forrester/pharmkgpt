16923667|t|Risk factors for delirium tremens: a retrospective chart review.
16923667|a|A retrospective chart review was performed within an inpatient VA hospital setting in an attempt to identify risk factors for delirium tremens (DTs). Cases of delirium tremens were compared to cases where patients' alcohol withdrawal during hospitalization did not progress to DTs. Significant differences were found in regard to prior histories of DTs and laboratory values at admission. The amount and duration of benzodiazepine use during hospitalization, antipsychotic use during hospitalization, and length of hospitalization were also statistically different between the groups. While not reaching statistical significance, there were differences in reason for admission and relapse rate upon follow-up between the groups.
