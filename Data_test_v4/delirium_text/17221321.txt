17221321|t|Relevance of donepezil in enhancing learning and memory in special populations: a review of the literature.
17221321|a|This review discusses the laboratory and clinical research supporting the rationale for the efficacy of donepezil (Aricept USA) in enhancing cognition in autism, Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, traumatic brain injury, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. While preliminary animal models have shown effective, human studies exclusive of Alzheimer disease are sparse. Although attention and memory are unlikely a sole operation of the cholinergic system, evidence indicates a promising direction for further examination of this hypothesis in autism. Studies that examine changes in operationally defined behaviors and reliable and valid measure of changes in attention and memory are needed.
