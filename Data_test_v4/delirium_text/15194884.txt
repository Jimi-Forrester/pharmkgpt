15194884|a|Genome-wide expression profiling has identified significant alterations in the abundance of specific mRNA populations in Alzheimer's disease brain when compared to age-matched controls. Increases in the expression of certain brain genes are in contrast to the majority of expressed RNAs (55-67%), which are down-regulated. The data presented here shows, that at the level of mRNA abundance, there is marked up-regulation in a family of stress-related genes that have significant potential to promote angiogenesis. This supports the hypothesis of an advancement in angiogenic signaling in Alzheimer's disease brain. Angiogenesis, perhaps as the result of dysfunctional cerebral vasculature, may be both a consequence and a contributory factor to the etiopathology of the Alzheimer's disease process.
