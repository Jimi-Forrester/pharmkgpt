38152514|t|Emergence Patterns from General Anesthesia after Epilepsy Surgery: An Observational Pilot Study.
38152514|a|Objective Emergence from anesthesia starts from the limbic structures and then spreads outwards to brainstem, reticular activating systems, and then to the cortex. Epilepsy surgery often involves resection of limbic structures and hence may disrupt the pattern of emergence. The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of emergence from anesthesia following epilepsy surgery and to determine associated variables affecting the emergence pattern. Setting and Design  Tertiary care center, prospective observational study. Materials   and Methods We conducted a prospective observation pilot study on adult patients undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy for epilepsy. Anesthesia management was standardized in all patients, and they were allowed to wake up with "no touch" technique. Primary outcome of the study was the pattern of emergence (normal emergence, agitated emergence, or slow emergence) from anesthesia. Secondary outcomes were to explore the differences in preoperative neuropsychological profile and limbic structure volumes between the different patterns of emergence. Quantitative variables were analyzed using Student's t -test. Qualitative variables were analyzed using chi-square test. Results  Twenty-nine patients completed the study: 9 patients (31%) had agitated emergence, and 20 patients had normal emergence. Among the agitated emergence, 2 patients had Riker scale of 7 indicating violent emergence. Patient demographics, anesthetic used, neuropsychological profile, and limbic structure volumes were similar between normal emergence and agitated emergence groups. However, two patients who had severe agitation (Riker scale of 7) had the lowest intelligence quotient. Conclusion  Our pilot study showed that emergence agitation is not uncommon in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. However, due to smaller sample size, the role of preoperative neuropsychologic profile and hippocampal volumes in predicting the pattern of emergence is inconclusive.
