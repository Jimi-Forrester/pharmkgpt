34204159|a|By upregulation of cell adhesion molecules and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, cells of the neurovascular unit, including pericytes and endothelial cells, actively participate in neuroinflammatory reactions. As previously shown, both cell types can activate inflammasomes, cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) through the canonical pathway, while pericytes only through the noncanonical pathway. Using complex in vitro models, we demonstrate here that the noncanonical inflammasome pathway can be induced in CECs as well, leading to a further increase in the secretion of active interleukin-1beta over that observed in response to activation of the canonical pathway. In parallel, a more pronounced disruption of tight junctions takes place. We also show that CECs respond to inflammatory stimuli coming from both the apical/blood and the basolateral/brain directions. As a result, CECs can detect factors secreted by pericytes in which the noncanonical inflammasome pathway is activated and respond with inflammatory activation and impairment of the barrier properties. In addition, upon sensing inflammatory signals, CECs release inflammatory factors toward both the blood and the brain sides. Consequently, CECs activate pericytes by upregulating their expression of NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), an inflammasome-forming pattern recognition receptor. In conclusion, cerebral pericytes and endothelial cells mutually activate each other in inflammation.
