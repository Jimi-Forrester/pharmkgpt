36119292|a|Studies show nearly half to two-thirds of the children in India to be deficient in vitamin B12. Meningitis is a major disease in Indian children with studies attributing up to 22% of under-five deaths to meningitis and pneumonia. India is one of the countries with the highest mortality in absolute numbers due to meningitis. Usually, the diagnosis of each of these entities is straightforward. The presence of meningeal signs, papilledema, seizures, and altered sensorium often suggests meningitis. And vitamin B12 deficiency has a myriad of clinical presentations. At times, encephalopathy secondary to cobalamin deficiency may be confused with infection. Here, we present a case that presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of central nervous system infection but turned out to be cobalamin deficiency eventually. To our knowledge, this is the first presentation of cobalamin deficiency presented with features suggestive of meningitis.
