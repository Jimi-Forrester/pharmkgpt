38578353|a|BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial Ts translation elongation factor (TSFM) is an enzyme that catalyzes exchange of guanine nucleotides. By forming a complex with mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), TSFM participates in mitochondrial protein translation. We have previously reported that TUFM regulates translation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) via ROS (reactive oxygen species)-dependent mechanism, suggesting a potential role in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which led to the speculation that TSFM may regulate APP processing in a similar way to TUFM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that in cultured cells, knockdown or overexpression TSFM did not change protein levels in BACE1 and APP. Besides, the levels of cytoplasmic ROS and mitochondrial superoxide, in addition to ATP level, cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were not significantly altered by TSFM knockdown in the short term. Further transcriptome analysis revealed that expression of majority of mitochondrial genes were not remarkably changed by TSFM silencing. The possibility of TSFM involved in cardiomyopathy and cancer development was uncovered using bioinformatics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, short-term regulation of TSFM level in cultured cells does not cause a significant change in proteins involved in APP processing, levels in ROS and ATP associated with mitochondrial function. Whereas our study could contribute to comprehend certain clinical features of TSFM mutations, the roles of TSFM in cardiomyopathy and cancer development might deserve further investigation.
