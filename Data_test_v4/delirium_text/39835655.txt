39835655|t|Medication Management of Patients With Cancer Undergoing Surgery From Preadmission to Discharge: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review.
39835655|a|AIM(S): To identify and synthesise available evidence about regular medication management processes, from preadmission to discharge from hospital, in patients with cancer undergoing surgery. DESIGN: Mixed-methods systematic review. METHODS: Studies published from inception of each database until February 2023 were screened, utilising four main search concepts. The JBI methodology for mixed-methods systematic review was followed in this review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science. RESULTS: Eight out of 717 screened studies were included. Two themes related to patients' medication management were identified. Preoperative factors such as polypharmacy, potentially inappropriate medications, delirium-inducing medications and preoperative discontinuation-requiring medications were associated with several postoperative complications in patients with cancer. Additionally, pharmacist-led interventions and collaborative efforts between nurses and patients were shown to improve the medication management process across the perioperative pathway. CONCLUSION: This systematic review emphasises the necessity of effectively managing regular medication, especially before surgery, to mitigate postoperative complications in patients with cancer. It offers critical insights into how involving pharmacists and nurses enhances medication management outcomes, benefiting health care professionals and institutions aiming to optimise perioperative medication therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: Enhancing patients' regular medication management through comprehensive reviews before surgery, and improving collaborative practices among pharmacists, nurses and patients via targeted interventions introduced by health care organisations, ensure safe medication use throughout the perioperative pathway. IMPACT: Improving regular medication management process can reduce risk of medication errors and adverse drug events and enhance postoperative outcomes. REPORTING METHOD: SWiM reporting guidelines. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.
