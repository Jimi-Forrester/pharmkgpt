38929127|t|Selenium as a Modulator of Redox Reactions in the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases.
38929127|a|Cardiovascular diseases stand as the predominant global cause of mortality, exerting a profound impact on both life expectancy and its quality. Given their immense public health burden, extensive efforts have been dedicated to comprehending the underlying mechanisms and developing strategies for prevention and treatment. Selenium, a crucial participant in redox reactions, emerges as a notable factor in maintaining myocardial cell homeostasis and influencing the progression of cardiovascular disorders. Some disorders, such as Keshan disease, are directly linked with its environmental deficiency. Nevertheless, the precise extent of its impact on the cardiovascular system remains unclear, marked by contradictory findings in the existing literature. High selenium levels have been associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension, while lower concentrations have been linked to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Although some trials have shown its potential effectiveness in specific groups of patients, large cohort supplementation attempts have generally yielded unsatisfactory outcomes. Consequently, there persists a significant need for further research aimed at delineating specific patient cohorts and groups of diseases that would benefit from selenium supplementation.
