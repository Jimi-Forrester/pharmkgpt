11436129|a|The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene (LRP) is a good candidate gene for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Its protein is involved in the physiopathology of AD and has been found in senile plaques; on the other hand, LRP is located in 12q, a region in which genetic linkage to AD was reported. Two common polymorphisms, a tetranucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region and a single nucleotide polymorphism at position 766 in exon 3, were found to be associated with AD, but contradictory results were obtained in subsequent association studies. In the absence of clear hypotheses concerning the association of these polymorphisms with AD and their functional role, our objective was to test the association between AD and the two LRP polymorphisms in a large French case-control sample (274 Caucasian AD patients and 290 matched controls) using haplotype analysis. First, the separate study of each polymorphism showed no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between AD cases and controls. Second, strong linkage disequilibrium was found between alleles of the two polymorphisms in controls and in cases and the linkage disequilibrium between the 91 bp and C alleles were opposite in cases and in controls. Third, we found that the frequency of the 91-C haplotype was higher in cases than in controls, but the type I error was 0.061, slightly higher than the conventional one of 5%. The haplotype frequencies did not vary significantly as a function of age and APOE epsilon4 status. One interest in this study is the use of the haplotype analysis, which can be used to combine information from several polymorphisms, taking into account their dependence.
