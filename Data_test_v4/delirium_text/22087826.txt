22087826|a|Flavonoids are new promising potential natural compounds for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Actually most promising drugs for symptomatic treatment of AD are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI). Flavonoids with AChE inhibitory activity and due to their well known antioxidant activity could be new multipotent drugs for AD treatment. This work focuses on natural and synthetic flavonoids inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Over, all this review refers to 128 flavonoids, which are classified in chemical structure, and summarizes 64 references.
