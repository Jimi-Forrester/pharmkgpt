36922825|t|Individualized flow-controlled versus conventional pressure-controlled ventilation in on-pump heart surgery (FLOWVENTIN HEARTSURG): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
36922825|a|BACKGROUND: In on-pump cardiac surgery, lungs are at high risk of periprocedural organ impairment because of atelectasis formation, ventilator-induced lung injury, and hyperinflammation due to the cardiopulmonary bypass which results in postoperative pulmonary complications in half of this patient population. The new ventilation mode flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) uniquely allows full control of ins- and expiratory airway flows. This approach reduces the mechanical power of invasive ventilation as a possible cause of ventilator-induced lung injury. The scope of FLOWVENTIN HEARTSURG is to compare perioperative individualized FCV with best clinical practice pressure-controlled ventilation (PVC) modes in patients with elective on-pump cardiac surgery procedures. We hypothesize that the postoperative inflammatory response can be reduced by the perioperative application of FCV compared to PCV. METHODS: FLOWVENTIN HEARTSURG is a single-center, randomized, parallel-group trial with two intervention arms: perioperative PCV modes (n = 70, PCV group) with an individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg predicted bodyweight compared to perioperative FCV (n = 70, FCV group) with an individualized PEEP and driving pressure, resulting in a liberal tidal volume. As the primary study endpoint interleukin 8 plasma level is assessed 6 h after cardiopulmonary bypass as a surrogate biomarker of systemic and pulmonary inflammation. As secondary aims clinically relevant patient outcomes are analyzed, e.g., perioperative lung function regarding oxygenation indices, postoperative pulmonary and extra-pulmonary complications, SIRS-free days as well as ICU and total inpatient stays. As additional sub-studies with an exploratory approach perioperative right ventricular function parameters are assessed by echocardiography and perioperative lung aeration by electrical impedance tomography. DISCUSSION: Current paradigms regarding protective low tidal volume ventilation are consciously left in the FCV intervention group in order to reduce mechanical power as a determinant of ventilator-induced lung injury in this high-risk patient population and procedures. This approach will be compared in a randomized controlled trial with current best clinical practice PCV in FLOWVENTIN HEARTSURG. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00018956 .
