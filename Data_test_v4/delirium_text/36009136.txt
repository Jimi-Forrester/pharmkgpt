36009136|t|Electroencephalogram Features of Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders in Elderly Patients: A Narrative Review of the Clinical Literature.
36009136|a|Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common postoperative complication, particularly in older patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, a non-invasive technique with a high spatial-temporal resolution, can accurately characterize the dynamic changes in brain function during the perioperative period. Current clinical studies have confirmed that the power density of alpha oscillation during general anesthesia decreased with age, which was considered to be associated with increased susceptibility to PND in the elderly. However, evidence on whether general anesthesia under EEG guidance results in a lower morbidity of PND is still contradictory. This is one of the reasons that common indicators of the depth of anesthesia were limitedly derived from EEG signals in the frontal lobe. The variation of multi-channel EEG features during the perioperative period has the potential to highlight the occult structural and functional abnormalities of the subcortical-cortical neurocircuit. Therefore, we present a review of the application of multi-channel EEG monitoring to predict the incidence of PND in older patients. The data confirmed that the abnormal variation in EEG power and functional connectivity between distant brain regions was closely related to the incidence and long-term poor outcomes of PND in older adults.
