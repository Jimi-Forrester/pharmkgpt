33329053|t|The Role of Basement Membranes in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.
33329053|a|Dementia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by cognitive decline in multiple domains, often leading to functional impairment in activities of daily living, disability, and death. The most common causes of age-related progressive dementia include Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), however, mixed disease pathologies commonly occur, as epitomized by a type of small vessel pathology called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In CAA patients, the small vessels of the brain become hardened and vulnerable to rupture, leading to impaired neurovascular coupling, multiple microhemorrhage, microinfarction, neurological emergencies, and cognitive decline across multiple functional domains. While the pathogenesis of CAA is not well understood, it has long been thought to be initiated in thickened basement membrane (BM) segments, which contain abnormal protein deposits and amyloid-beta (Abeta). Recent advances in our understanding of CAA pathogenesis link BM remodeling to functional impairment of perivascular transport pathways that are key to removing Abeta from the brain. Dysregulation of this process may drive CAA pathogenesis and provides an important link between vascular risk factors and disease phenotype. The present review summarizes how the structure and composition of the BM allows for perivascular transport pathways to operate in the healthy brain, and then outlines multiple mechanisms by which specific dementia risk factors may promote dysfunction of perivascular transport pathways and increase Abeta deposition during CAA pathogenesis. A better understanding of how BM remodeling alters perivascular transport could lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CAA patients.
