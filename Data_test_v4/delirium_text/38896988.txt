38896988|a|Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, resulting from deficits in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Whilst the role of insulin in the peripheral nervous system has been ascertained in countless studies, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) is emerging only recently. Brain insulin has been lately associated with brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, understanding the role of insulin as a common risk factor for mental and somatic comorbidities may disclose novel preventative and therapeutic approaches. We evaluated general metabolism (glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and polydipsia) and cognitive capabilities (attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory), in adolescent, young adult, and adult male and female TALLYHO/JngJ mice (TH, previously reported to constitute a valid experimental model of T2DM due to impaired insulin signaling). Adult TH mice have also been studied for alterations in gut microbiota diversity and composition. While TH mice exhibited profound deficits in cognitive flexibility and altered glucose metabolism, we observed that these alterations emerged either much earlier (males) or independent of (females) a comprehensive constellation of symptoms, isomorphic to an overt T2DM-like phenotype (insulin resistance, polydipsia, higher energy expenditure, and altered lipid metabolism). We also observed significant sex-dependent alterations in gut microbiota alpha diversity and taxonomy in adult TH mice. Deficits in insulin signaling may represent a common risk factor for both T2DM and CNS-related deficits, which may stem from (partly) independent mechanisms.
