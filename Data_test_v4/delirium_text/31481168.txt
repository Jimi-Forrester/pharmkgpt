31481168|a|Although a substantial body of research has identified brain MRI measures as important markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, progression, and treatment response, most of that research has been performed in non-Hispanic white American populations, leading to questions about the utility of the brain MRI measures among individuals of other races or ethnicities. African American individuals in particular are under-represented in AD research, and may exhibit differences in prevalence of AD risk factors, prevalence of AD, incidence of AD, the clinical course of cognitive decline, and AD neuropathology, each of which could influence the utility of brain MRI markers. Unfortunately, while current evidence suggests that African Americans exhibit poorer brain health late in life based on brain MRI measurements, several other aspects of brain MRI markers in this population are unclear, including trajectories of brain MRI markers leading up to old age, relationships between traditional brain health risk factors and brain MRI findings, and the status of brain MRI markers as correlates of cognitive impairment. This unclear state of affairs highlights the urgency of future research in which large numbers of older African American adults contribute longitudinal brain MRI measurements concurrent with clinical, cognitive, and molecular biomarker measurements, ideally in the context of AD preventive or therapeutic trials.
