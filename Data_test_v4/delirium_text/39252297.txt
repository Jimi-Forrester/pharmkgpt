39252297|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) is a common occurrence in pediatric postanesthesia events, leading to negative outcomes. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), as an anesthesia adjuvant, has shown promise in preventing ED in adult surgeries, and it has been increasingly used in pediatric surgical settings. However, its effectiveness in other postanesthesia events, such as MRI examinations and ambulatory surgery centers, remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to assess the safety and efficacy of DEX in preventing ED in various pediatric postanesthesia events beyond surgery. METHODS: Prospective randomized controlled trials were searched in Pubmed, Web of Science, and EBSCO until October 13, 2023. Comparisons were made between DEX and other sedatives or analgesics in different postanesthesia events (including surgery operations, the examination of MRI, day surgery, and invasive action). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on drug delivery methods, medication timing, DEX dosages, use of analgesics, event types, and recovery time. RESULTS: A total of 33 trials involving 3395 patients were included. DEX significantly reduced the incidence of ED (odds ratios [OR] = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-0.27, I2 = 37%, P < .00001). Intranasal delivery of DEX was the most effective (OR 0.18, 95% CI: 0.10-0.32, P < .00001, I2 = 0%). DEX also showed benefits in day surgery and mask insertion events (OR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14-0.26, P = .001, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: DEX demonstrates superior efficacy in preventing ED in pediatric postanesthesia events compared to other sedatives and analgesics. Its use is recommended in various settings for its safety and effectiveness in managing ED.
