33839636|t|[Descriptive study of delirium in the emergency department].
33839636|a|OBJECTIVE: To better understand the clinical, functional and analytical variables associated with delirium in emergencies and their evolution in order to obtain an improvement in the therapeutic approach of the elderly patient, thus preventing morbidity and mortality in this type of patient. DESIGN: This is a prospective descriptive study of acute confusional syndrome in the emergency department. SITE: General University Hospital of Ciudad Real. PARTICIPANTS: All patients from the emergency department with a diagnosis of delirium were included in the 24-h interval following admission to the geriatric service. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: An analysis of the variables of the data set (sociodemographic and clinical variables) was performed, calculating frequency tables for qualitative variables and descriptive statistics for quantitative variables. Subsequently, statistical inference techniques have been used. RESULTS: The most frequent medical antecedent were neurological pathology and hypertension, followed by rheumatologic diseases. The main reasons for consultation were deterioration in general condition, dyspnea, decreased level of consciousness, and fever. Highlight the incidence of polypharmacy, especially drugs such as diuretics, benzodiazepines or hypnotics. In relation to the main etiology, the role of urinary and respiratory infections is noteworthy. CONCLUSIONS: Highlight the fundamental role of neurological diseases (especially dementia), hypertension, polypharmacy (inappropriate use of benzodiazepines and hypnotics) and urinary and respiratory infections as treatable and/or preventable factors of delirium in Primary Care patients in our setting.
