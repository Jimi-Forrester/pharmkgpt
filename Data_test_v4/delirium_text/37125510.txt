37125510|a|Among the greatest general challenges in bioengineering is to mimic human physiology. Advanced efforts in tissue engineering have led to sophisticated 'brain-on-chip' (BoC) microfluidic devices that can mimic structural and functional aspects of brain tissue. BoC may be used to understand the biochemical pathways of neurolgical pathologies and assess promising therapeutic agents for facilitating regenerative medicine. We evaluated the potential of microfluidic BoC devices in various neurological pathologies, such as Alzheimer's, glioblastoma, traumatic brain injury, stroke and epilepsy. We also discuss the principles, limitations and future considerations of BoC technology. Results suggest that BoC models can help understand complex neurological pathologies and augment drug testing efforts for regenerative applications. However, implementing organ-on-chip technology to clinical practice has some practical limitations that warrant greater attention to improve large-scale applicability. Nevertheless, they remain to be versatile and powerful tools that can broaden our understanding of pathophysiological and therapeutic uncertainties to neurological diseases.
