39893023|t|Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Management in the Age of Amyloid Monoclonal Antibodies.
39893023|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and for providers the term AD is often avoided, favoring generic terms like memory loss or dementia. This is partly not only by limitations in using diagnostics and busy clinics but also by a sense that an AD diagnosis will not lead to a meaningful change in management. However, a turning point has occurred with advancements in diagnostics and disease-modifying therapies. Additionally, AD prevention therapies are not too far into the future. This review will cover AD clinical presentation and symptomatic management with focus on AD diagnostics and disease-modifying therapies.
