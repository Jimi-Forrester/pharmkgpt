38519128|t|Role of GLR-1 in age-dependent short-term memory decline.
38519128|a|As the global elderly population grows, age-related cognitive decline is becoming an increasingly significant healthcare issue, often leading to various neuropsychiatric disorders. Among the many molecular players involved in memory, AMPA-type glutamate receptors are known to regulate learning and memory, but how their dynamics change with age and affect memory decline is not well understood. Here, we examined the in vivo properties of the AMPA type glutamate receptor GLR-1 in the AVA interneuron of the C. elegans nervous system during physiological aging. We found that both total and membrane-bound GLR-1 receptor levels decrease with age in wild-type worms, regardless of their location along the axon. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we also demonstrated that a reduction in GLR-1 abundance correlates with decreased local, synaptic GLR-1 receptor dynamics. Importantly, we found that reduced GLR-1 levels strongly correlate with the age-related decline in short-term associative memory. Genetic manipulation of GLR-1 stability, either by deleting msi-1 or expressing a ubiquitination-defective GLR-1 (4KR) variant, prevented this age-related reduction in receptor abundance and improved short-term memory performance in older animals, which reached performance levels similar to those of young animals. Overall, our data indicate that AMPA-type glutamate receptor abundance and dynamics are key factors in maintaining memory function, and that changes in these parameters are linked to age-dependent short-term memory decline.Significance statement AMPA-type glutamate receptors are pivotal in synaptic transmission and plasticity, and their dysregulation is linked to neurological conditions and age-related cognitive decline. Despite their importance, the mechanisms regulating these receptors are not fully understood. In this study, we examined age-related changes in the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans and assessed its impact on short-term memory decline. Our data show a significant reduction in both the abundance and local turnover of total and membrane-bound GLR-1 receptors as animals age. This decline closely correlates with decreased performance in aversive olfactory memory tasks in older animals. Importantly, inhibiting GLR-1 degradation effectively mitigates short-term memory decline in aged animals.
