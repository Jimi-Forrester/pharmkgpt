38504290|a|BACKGROUND: Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) plays a critical role in mitochondrial dynamics. Partial inhibition of this protein is protective in experimental models of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The protective mechanism has been attributed primarily to improved mitochondrial function. However, the observations that Drp1 inhibition reduces protein aggregation in such neurological disorders suggest the involvement of autophagy. To investigate this potential novel protective mechanism of Drp1 inhibition, a model with impaired autophagy without mitochondrial involvement is needed. METHODS: We characterized the effects of manganese (Mn), which causes parkinsonian-like symptoms in humans, on autophagy and mitochondria by performing dose-response studies in two cell culture models (stable autophagy HeLa reporter cells and N27 rat immortalized dopamine neuronal cells). Mitochondrial function was assessed using the Seahorse Flux Analyzer. Autophagy flux was monitored by quantifying the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, as well as the levels of other autophagy proteins. To strengthen the in vitro data, multiple mouse models (autophagy reporter mice and mutant Drp1+/- mice and their wild-type littermates) were orally treated with a low chronic Mn regimen that was previously reported to increase alpha-synuclein aggregation and transmission via exosomes. RNAseq, laser captured microdissection, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, stereological cell counting, and behavioural studies were used. RESULTS IN VITRO: data demonstrate that at low non-toxic concentrations, Mn impaired autophagy flux but not mitochondrial function and morphology. In the mouse midbrain, RNAseq data further confirmed autophagy pathways were dysregulated but not mitochondrial related genes. Additionally, Mn selectively impaired autophagy in the nigral dopamine neurons but not the nearby nigral GABA neurons. In cells with a partial Drp1-knockdown and Drp1+/- mice, Mn induced autophagic impairment was significantly prevented. Consistent with these observations, Mn increased the levels of proteinase-K resistant alpha-synuclein and Drp1-knockdown protected against this pathology. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that improved autophagy flux is a separate mechanism conferred by Drp1 inhibition independent of its role in mitochondrial fission. Given that impaired autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are two prominent features of neurodegenerative diseases, the combined protective mechanisms targeting these two pathways conferred by Drp1 inhibition make this protein an attractive therapeutic target.
