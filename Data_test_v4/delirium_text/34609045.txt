34609045|a|Our previous research has found that miRNA-22 can inhibit the occurrence of pyroptosis by targeting GSDMD and decrease the production and release of inflammatory factors. In consideration of the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), MSCs-EV were loaded with miRNA-22 (EV-miRNA-22) to investigate the inhibitory effect of EV-miRNA-22 on the inflammatory response in SCI in rats in this study. LPS/Nigericin (LPS/NG) was used to induce pyroptosis in rat microglia in vitro. Propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed to observe cell permeability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay was adopted to detect cytotoxicity, flow cytometry was conducted to detect pyroptosis level, immunofluorescence (IF) staining was utilized to observe the expression level of GSDMD (a key protein of pyroptosis), Western blot was performed to detect the expression of key proteins. For animal experiments, the T10 spinal cord of rats was clamped by aneurysm clip to construct the SCI model. BBB score, somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) were performed to detect nerve function. HE staining and Nissl staining were used to detect spinal cord histopathology and nerve cell damage. EV-miRNA-22 could inhibit the occurrence of pyroptosis in microglia, suppress the cell membrane pore opening, and inhibit the release of inflammatory factors and the expression of GSDMD. In addition, EV-miRNA-22 showed higher pyroptosis-inhibiting ability than EV. Consequently, EV-miRNA-22 could inhibit the nerve function injury after SCI in rats, inhibit the level of inflammatory factors in the tissue and the activation of microglia. In this study, we found that miRNA-22-loaded MSCs-EV (EV-miRNA-22) could cooperate with EV to inhibit inflammatory response and nerve function repair after SCI.
