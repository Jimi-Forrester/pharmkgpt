11056693|a|BACKGROUND: Size, weight and technical difficulties limit the use of ponderous strip chart electroencephalographs (EEGs) for real time evaluation of brain wave function in modern intensive care units (ICUs). Portable, computer processed, bedside EEGs provide real time brain wave appraisal for some brain functions during therapeutic neuromuscular blockade when the visual clues of the cerebral function disappear. RESULTS: Critically ill ICU patients are frequently placed in suspended animation by neuromuscular blockade to improve hemodynamics in severe organ system failure. Using the portable bedside EEG monitor, several cerebral functions were monitored continuously during sedation of selected patients in our ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The processed EEG is able to continuously monitor the end result of some therapeutics at the neuronal level when natural artifacts are suppressed or eliminated by neuromuscular blockade. Computer processed EEG monitoring may be the only objective method of assessing and controlling sedation during therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis.
