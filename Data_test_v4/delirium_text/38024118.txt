38024118|t|Effectiveness of the Stress Process Model-Based Program in Dementia Caregiving (DeCare-SPM) for Family Caregivers: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
38024118|a|This paper aims to describe a randomized controlled trial protocol evaluating the effectiveness, cost, and process of a stress process model-based program in dementia caregiving (DeCare-SPM) for family caregivers. Family caregivers of individuals with dementia will be recruited from memory clinics and community settings and randomly assigned to either DeCare-SPM or usual care. DeCare-SPM comprises three face-to-face sessions (ie, problem-based coping, emotion-based coping, meaning-based coping), and a fourth session (ie, social support) including weekly telephone-based consultation for four weeks and then monthly face-to-face boosters. Outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), and at one (T1), three (T2), and six months (T3). The primary outcome is positive aspects of caregiving and secondary outcomes are caregiving (ie, sense of competence, caregiver burden, social support, anxiety, depression, and quality of life), dementia-related (ie, care dependency, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life), and stress-related biomarkers of blood and saliva. In addition, process and economic evaluations will be performed. Mixed-effects models will be used to assess intervention effects. Content analysis will be performed on the qualitative data. This paper described the protocol for comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness, cost, and process of the theory-driven DeCare-SPM to inform how and why interventions work. It highlights the need to reduce challenges and enhance the positive aspects of dementia care. The DeCare-SPM will provide evidence-based insights into how to support and empower family caregivers in their important roles, thereby, leading to improved dementia care.
