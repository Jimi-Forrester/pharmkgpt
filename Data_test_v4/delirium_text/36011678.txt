36011678|t|Hemodialysis Treatment for Patients with Lithium Poisoning.
36011678|a|BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis is often recommended to treat severe lithium poisoning. Nevertheless, the application rate of hemodialysis in patients with lithium poisoning is varied across different groups and the effect of hemodialysis is still undetermined. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the hemodialysis rate of patients with lithium poisoning and to explore the clinical features of lithium-poisoned-patients treated or untreated with hemodialysis. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2019, 36 patients treated at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for the management of lithium poisoning were stratified according to whether they were treated with hemodialysis (n = 7) or not (n = 29). RESULTS: The patients were aged 50.7 +- 18.1 years. The poisoning patterns were acute on chronic (61.1%), chronic (25.0%) and acute (13.9%). The precipitating factors of dehydration and infection were noted in 36.1% and 25.0% of patients, respectively. Bipolar disorder (72.2%), depressive disorder (27.8%) and psychotic disorder (11.1%) were the top three psychiatric comorbidities. The hemodialysis group not only had a lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (p = 0.001) but also had a higher respiratory failure rate (p = 0.033), aspiration pneumonia rate (p = 0.033) and acute kidney injury network (AKIN) score (p = 0.002) than the non-hemodialysis group. Although none of the patients died of lithium poisoning, the hemodialysis group required more endotracheal intubation (p = 0.033), more intensive care unit admission (p = 0.033) and longer hospitalization (p = 0.007) than the non-hemodialysis group. CONCLUSION: The analytical results revealed zero mortality rate and low hemodialysis rate (1.9%). Compared with patients without hemodialysis, patients receiving hemodialysis suffered severer lithium-associated complications and needed a more intensive care unit admission and longer hospital stay.
