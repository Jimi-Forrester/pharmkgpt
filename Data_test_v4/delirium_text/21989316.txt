DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: Nursing home (NH). PARTICIPANTS: One hundred one residents with dementia. MEASUREMENTS: NH residents with dementia were assessed on the presence of clinical depression using Provisional Diagnostic Criteria for Depression of Alzheimer's Disease. The MADRS and CSDD were administered in a structured interview with professional primary caregivers. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed no significant differences between areas under the empirical curve for MADRS and CSDD. Imputation of a lowest possible item score for missing items revealed larger areas than three other methods (significant result only for CSDD). A MADRS cutoff score of ">13" yielded the highest sum of sensitivity (78%) and specificity (66%). A CSDD cutoff score of ">6" yielded the highest sum of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (49%). Both scales showed high negative predictive values up to 100% and low positive predictive values not exceeding 50%. CONCLUSION: The proxy-based MADRS and CSDD did not differ in distinguishing depressed from nondepressed NH residents and may be used for screening purposes. For missing items, imputation of a lowest possib le item score may be applied. The MADRS and CSDD may be better used for ruling out rather than for ruling in depression.
