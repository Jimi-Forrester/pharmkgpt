13129929|a|Autocatalytic cleavage of lithostathine leads to the formation of quadruple-helical fibrils (QHF-litho) that are present in Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that such fibrils also occur in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases, where they form protease-K-resistant deposits and co-localize with amyloid plaques formed from prion protein. Lithostathine does not appear to change its native-like, globular structure during fibril formation. However, we obtained evidence that a cluster of six conserved tryptophans, positioned around a surface loop, could act as a mobile structural element that can be swapped between adjacent protein molecules, thereby enabling the formation of higher order fibril bundles. Despite their association with these clinical amyloid deposits, QHF-litho differ from typical amyloid fibrils in several ways, for example they produce a different infrared spectrum and cannot bind Congo Red, suggesting that they may not represent amyloid structures themselves. Instead, we suggest that lithostathine constitutes a novel component decorating disease-associated amyloid fibrils. Interestingly, [6,6']bibenzothiazolyl-2,2'-diamine, an agent found previously to disrupt aggregates of huntingtin associated with Huntington's disease, can dissociate lithostathine bundles into individual protofilaments. Disrupting QHF-litho fibrils could therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy to combat clinical amyloidoses.
