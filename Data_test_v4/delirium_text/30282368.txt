30282368|t|Reappraisal of Abeta40 and Abeta42 Peptides Measurements in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
30282368|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are currently included in the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD), in particular, decreased concentrations of amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) in the CSF, coupled with increased levels of tau and phosphorylated tau proteins, are supportive of AD diagnosis. To date, the quantification of Abeta42 levels with antibody-dependent immunoassay shows a marked variability among different laboratories and is also affected by different pre-analytical factors, suggesting that part of Abeta42 peptides might be aggregated and thus undetected by antibodies. To bypass an antibody-dependent measurement, we determined the Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels by immunoblot. We analyzed CSF samples from 35 patients with clinical diagnosis of probable AD and from 15 age-matched normal controls; CSF Abeta levels were determined by two different ELISA kits and by immunoblot analysis. Abeta40 levels measured by ELISA were comparable to those obtained by immunoblot, whereas CSF concentrations of Abeta42 measured by ELISA were significantly lower compared to values obtained by immunoblot quantification. Biochemical analysis, following 1D- and 2D-PAGE analysis, showed that the qualitative composition of Abeta peptides in the CSF is similar in AD and controls but different from that of AD brain tissues. Moreover, sedimentation velocity in sucrose gradient of CSF and brain homogenate from AD demonstrated that Abeta42 in CSF is different from Abeta42 in brain in terms of solubility and aggregation state.
