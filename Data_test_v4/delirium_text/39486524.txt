39486524|a|With advancement in human microbiome research, an increasing number of scientific evidences have endorsed the key role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Microbiome dysbiosis, characterized by altered diversity and composition, as well as rise of pathobionts influence not only various gut disorder but also central nervous system disorders such as AD. On the basis of accumulated evidences of past few years now it is quite clear that the gut microbiota can control the functions of the central nervous system (CNS) through the gut-brain axis, which provides a new prospective into the interactions between the gut and brain. The main focus of this review is on the molecular mechanism of the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the brain through the gut-brain axis, and on the onset and development of neurological disorders triggered by the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Due to microbiota dysbiosis the permeability of the gut and blood brain barrier is increased which may mediate or affect AD. Along with this, bacterial population of the gut microbiota can secrete amyloid proteins and lipopolysaccharides in a large quantity which may create a disturbance in the signaling pathways and the formation of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the pathogenesis of AD. These topics are followed by a critical analysis of potential intervention strategies targeting gut microbiota dysbiosis, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, metabolites, diets and fecal microbiota transplantation. The main purpose of this review includes the summarization and discussion on the recent finding that may explain the role of the gut microbiota in the development of AD. Understanding of these fundamental mechanisms may provide a new insight into the novel therapeutic strategies for AD.
