33227075|a|BACKGROUND: Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the WHO as a Global Public Health Emergency the COVID-19 pandemic has been hyped by the media. AIM: To review the literature on COVID-19 pandemic hype, losers and gainers. Method: Literature on COVID-19 pandemic hype, January to August 2020, was retrieved from pubmed, google scholar and news media, and reviewed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 Pandemic has been hyped directly by highly disturbing messages from the WHO, news of famous people getting infected and dying because of the coronavirus, and highlighted news in media. Indirect hype has been by fake news and verambitious attempt to contain the virus. There have been many losers and gainers of the corona hype. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic hype has caused huge loss to the world community, but substantial gains are also being witnessed. Media coverage should be balanced. Intensive public awareness programs coupled with best possible medical treatment to symptomatic cases are recommended.
