35092372|a|BACKGROUND: The current disadvantages (high cost, toxicity, resistance) of chemotherapy for gastric cancer opted people for alternative therapy from natural source. Curcumin (natural product) possess multiple biological activities but low bio-availability limits their uses as therapeutic. The Nano-formulation of curcumin increased the bioavailability and productivity of anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties. The present study was initiated to determine the anti-cancer and anti-bacterial effect of Nano curcumin against gastric cancer and H. pylori. METHODS: Curcumin loaded PLGA nanoparticles (CUR-NPs) was prepared by single emulsion solvent evaporation method. The MIC were determined using agar dilution method to find the anti-H. Pylori activity of Nano curcumin. The cytotoxicity of Nano curcumin was evaluated by MTT assay and the apoptotic effect (cell cycle arrest and morphology change) was shown by PI staining and microscopy. RESULTS: The MIC of nanocurcumin and curcumin for all four H. pylori strains were 8 microg/ml and 16 microg/ml respectively. The inhibition rate of gastric cancer cells after treatment with curcumin was increased from 6% to 67% for 24h, from 8% to 75% for 48h, from 10% to 83% for 72h. In case of nanocurcumin, the inhibition rate increased from 7% to 69% for 24h, 11% to 87% for 48h and 16% to 97% for 72h. The IC50 of curcumin and Nano-curcumin were 24.20 microM and 18.78 microM respectively for 72 h. The population of cells in sub-G0 population increased from 4.1% in the control group to 24.5% and 57.8% when treated with curcumin and nanocurcumin respectively. After 72h of treatment with nanocurcumin, the apoptotic cells population increased as compared to native curcumin treated cells. CONCLUSION: The Nano curcumin might be used as a potential therapeutics against gastric cancer and H. Pylori. There is need of further in vivo study in order to validate CUR-NPs activity.
