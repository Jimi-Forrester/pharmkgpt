31147877|t|Pericytes in Alzheimer's Disease: Novel Clues to Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy Pathogenesis.
31147877|a|Pericytes in the central nervous system attract growing attention of neurobiologists because of obvious opportunities to use them as target cells in numerous brain diseases. Functional activity of pericytes includes control of integrity of the endothelial cell layer, regeneration of vascular cells, and regulation of microcirculation. Pericytes are well integrated in the so-called neurovascular unit (NVU) serving as a platform for effective communications of neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and pericytes. Contribution of pericytes to the establishment and maintaining the structural and functional integrity of blood-brain barrier is confirmed in numerous experimental and clinical studies. The review covers current understandings on the role of pericytes in molecular pathogenesis of NVU/BBB dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease with the special focus on the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, deregulation of cerebral angiogenesis, and progression of BBB breakdown seen in Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration.
