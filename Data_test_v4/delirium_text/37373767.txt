37373767|t|Association of Temporalis Muscle Mass with Early Cognitive Impairment in Older Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke.
37373767|a|The prognostic value of temporal muscle mass has been studied in various neurological disorders. Herein, we investigated the association between temporal muscle mass and early cognitive function in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This study included 126 patients with acute cerebral infarction aged >=65 years. Temporal muscle thickness (TMT) was measured using T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging at admission for acute stroke. Within 2 weeks of stroke onset, skeletal mass index (SMI) and cognitive function were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. Pearson's correlation analyzed the correlation between TMT and SMI, and multiple linear regression analyzed independent predictors of early post-stroke cognitive function. TMT and SMI were significantly positively correlated (R = 0.36, p < 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, TMT was an independent predictor of early post-stroke cognitive function, stratified by the MoCA score (beta = 1.040, p = 0.017), age (beta = -0.27, p = 0.006), stroke severity (beta = -0.298, p = 0.007), and education level (beta = 0.38, p = 0.008). TMT may be used as a surrogate marker for evaluating skeletal muscle mass because it is significantly associated with post-stroke cognitive function during the acute phase of ischemic stroke; therefore, TMT may help detect older patients at a high risk of early post-stroke cognitive impairment.
