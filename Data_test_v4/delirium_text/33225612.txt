33225612|a|AIMS: To identify transcriptome signatures underlying epileptogenesis in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS: Robust rank aggregation analysis was used to integrate multiple microarrays in rodent models of TLE and determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in acute, latent, and chronic stages. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction analysis were performed to explore the potential functions of the DEGs and identify hub genes with the highest intramodular connectivity. The association between hub genes and hippocampal sclerosis/seizure frequency was analyzed using publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets from TLE patients. We subsequently established a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model in rats and validated mRNA expression of hub genes by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The DEGs in the acute, latent, and chronic phases of TLE in animal models were prominently enriched in inflammatory response. Hub genes identified in the acute phase mainly participated in biological processes including inflammation, blood-brain barrier damage, and cell adhesion. The hub genes in the latent phase were related to microglia/macrophage activation (Emr1 and Aif1) and phagocytosis (Cd68, Tyrobp, and Lyz). In the chronic phase, the hub genes were associated with activation of complements and microglia/macrophages. We further found that some hub genes identified in human TLE, such as Tlr2, Lgals3, and Stat3, were positively correlated with seizure frequency. Other hub genes, including Lgals3 and Serpine1, were associated with hippocampus sclerosis. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the mRNA levels of hub genes in rat hippocampus were significantly up-regulated after SE induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrated analysis identified hub genes in different stages of epilepsy. The functional annotations suggest that the activation and phagocytic activities of microglia/macrophages may play critical roles in epileptogenesis of TLE.
