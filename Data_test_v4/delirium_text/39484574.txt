39484574|t|beta-Amyloid impairs Proteasome structure and function. Proteasome activation mitigates amyloid induced toxicity and cognitive deficits.
39484574|a|Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia globally, affecting around 50 million people and marked by cognitive decline and the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau. The limited treatment options and numerous failed clinical trials targeting beta-amyloid (Abeta) highlight the need for novel approaches. Lowered proteasome activity is a consistent feature in AD, particularly in the hippocampus. Impaired proteasome function in AD is hypothesized to stem from direct inhibition by beta-amyloid or hyperphosphorylated tau, disrupting critical neuronal processes such as memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Objectives: This study tests the hypothesis that AD related deficits are driven in part by impaired proteasome function as a consequence of inhibition by Abeta. We evaluated how proteasome function is modulated by Abeta and the capacity of two proteasome-activating compounds, TAT1-8,9-TOD and TAT1-DEN to rescue Abeta-induced impairment in vitro, as well as survival deficits in cell culture and Abeta-induced cognitive deficits in Drosophila and mouse models. Results: Our study demonstrates that oligomeric beta-amyloid binds to the 20S proteasome and impairs its activity and conformational stability. The oligomers also destabilize the 26S proteasome to release the free 20S proteasome. Treatment with proteasome activators TAT1-8,9TOD and TAT1-DEN rescue the 20S proteasome function and reduces cell death caused by Abeta42 toxicity in SK-N-SH cells. In Drosophila models overexpressing Abeta42, oral administration of proteasome agonists delayed mortality and restored cognitive function. Chronic treatment with TAT1-DEN protected against deficits in working memory caused by Abeta42 in mice and in hAPP(J20) mice with established deficits, acute TAT1-DEN treatment significantly improved spatial learning, with treated mice performing comparably to controls. Conclusions: Abeta has dual impacts on 20S and 26S proteasome function and stability. Proteasome activation using TAT1-8,9TOD and TAT1-DEN shows promise in mitigating AD-like deficits by protecting against amyloid toxicity and enhancing proteasome function. These findings suggest that targeting proteasome activity could be a viable therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further investigation into the broader impacts of proteasome modulation on AD pathology.
