35036144|a|BACKGROUND: There is a need for a large-scale screening test that can be used to detect dementia in older individuals at an early stage. Olfactory identification deficits have been shown to occur in the early stages of dementia, indicating their usefulness in screening tests. This study investigated the utility of an olfactory identification test as a screening test for mild cognitive dysfunction in community-dwelling older people. METHODS: The subjects were city-dwelling individuals aged over 65 years but under 85 years who had not been diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The Japanese version of the Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen was used to evaluate cognitive function. Based on the results, the subjects were divided into two groups: healthy group and cognitively impaired group. Olfactory identification abilities based on the Japanese version of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were 182 participants in total: 77 in the healthy group and 105 in the cognitively impaired group. The mean olfactory identification test score of the cognitively impaired group was significantly lower than that of the healthy group. The cognitive impairment test score was significantly correlated with the olfactory identification test score. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectional olfactory identification deficits at baseline in community-dwelling older adults reflected cognitive dysfunction. Assessing olfactory identification ability might be useful as a screening test for mild cognitive dysfunction in community-dwelling older people.
