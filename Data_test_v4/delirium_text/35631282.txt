35631282|t|Formulation, Characterization and Optimization of beta-Glucan and Pomegranate Juice Based Films for Its Potential in Diabetes.
35631282|a|The aim of this study was to develop films based on beta-glucans in association with pomegranate juice for its potential in metabolic disorders such as diabetes due to plenty of bioactive compounds from the film composition. Initially, a Box-Behnken design was generated by varying the level of beta-glucan content (0.5, 1, 1.5 g), sodium alginate (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 g) and pomegranate juice (10, 20, 30 mL) for development of films. Subsequently, glycerin was added as 25% of the total dry matter. The optimization of the films prepared by the solvent casting method was conducted based on the different responses such as: water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), water vapor permeability (WVP), thickness, density, moisture content, solubility, film opacity and color. The water activity profile and FT-IR analysis were performed in all tests. The model was used to determine the optimal experimental values considering that the optimal film will make a sustained contribution to diabetes. The optimal values of the film sample made of beta-glucans, sodium alginate, pomegranate juice and glycerin make it befitting for packaging dry powdered pharmaceuticals. Finally, antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, UV barrier properties and microcrack and pore detections through SEM were also investigated for the optimal film sample.
