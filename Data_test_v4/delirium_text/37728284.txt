37728284|t|Slow-growing WNT medulloblastoma with atypical magnetic resonance imaging findings: illustrative case.
37728284|a|BACKGROUND: Medulloblastomas, with four molecular subgroups, are generally rapid-growing tumors with significant contrast enhancement and well-defined margins. However, each subgroup's clinical features, including disease time course and imaging characteristics, are not well defined. OBSERVATIONS: The authors describe the case of a 15-year-old female who presented with a 7-month history of impaired left-hand movement and was found to have a lesion on the dorsal side of the fourth ventricle. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the patient's first presentation showed diffuse hyperintense signal without apparent mass, and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging showed very slight contrast enhancement. In 1 month, her symptoms progressed, and follow-up MRI revealed an increase in the size of the lesion, showing greater diffusion restriction and contrast enhancement. She underwent gross-total resection, and pathology was consistent with classic medulloblastoma. Genetic analysis of the tumor confirmed the wingless (WNT) molecular subgroup. Adjuvant chemotherapy and proton beam therapy were performed. At the 18-month follow-up, MRI showed no recurrence of disease. LESSONS: Slow-growing medulloblastoma is very rare and not known to be associated with a specific molecular subgroup. Here, the authors report a case of slow-growing WNT medulloblastoma, indicating that slow growth may be a feature of this subgroup.
