35927745|t|Evaluation of prediction effect of perfusion index for supraclavicular brachial plexus block in children: protocol for a randomized trial.
35927745|a|BACKGROUND: Pulse perfusion index (PI) reflects blood perfusion. It has been reported that PI can be used to evaluate the effect of nerve block, but currently, it is mainly focused on awake adults. In pediatric general anesthesia, it has been reported that PI can evaluate the effect of the sacral block. Still, there is a lack of relevant research on the impact of brachial plexus blocks. Our objective is to assess the prediction effects of PI on the success of supraclavicular brachial plexus block in pediatric patients under sevoflurane or propofol general anesthesia. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a mono-center, parallel, 2-arm randomized superiority trial. One hundred four children aged 1 month to 12 years who undergo upper limb surgery will be enrolled in this study. According to anesthesia induction and maintenance medication, they will be divided into sevoflurane and propofol groups. The PI values of the index and little finger will be recorded on the blocked and non-blocked sides of supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCB) in all children. The primary outcome is to assess the effects of PI on the success of supraclavicular brachial plexus block in pediatric patients under sevoflurane or propofol general anesthesia. The secondary outcome includes mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and correlation between baseline PI and 10 min after SCB (PI ratio). DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence on the changes in PI after SCB in sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia in children. SCB may lead to changes in PI values under sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. After the children wake up at the end of the surgery, the changes in PI values on the block side and non-block side may be helpful to judge the effect of nerve block when excluding the influence of anesthetics.
