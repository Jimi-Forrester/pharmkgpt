36987294|t|Humic-Based Polyelectrolyte Complexes for Dust Suppression.
36987294|a|The present study proposes a novel application of humic substance-aminosilsesquioxane polyelectrolyte complexes (HS-ASQ) as dust suppressants. These complexes are synthesized through the reaction between humic substances (HS) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of active silanol groups that can bind to mineral surfaces and condense, forming gels. The HS-ASQ compositions were found to have a high sorption capacity for dust particles and could form coatings on their surface without cementing the dust, making them potentially useful for environmental applications. The viscosity of the HS-ASQ compositions can be controlled by adding carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), which also enhances their dust suppression abilities. Different compositions of HS-ASQ were synthesized by varying the proportions of APTES and CMC, and dust treated with these samples was assessed for its resistance to wind erosion using a laboratory-scale setup. Treatment with the HS-ASQ composition resulted in substantial reductions in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 microm and 2.5 microm, respectively) of up to 77% and 85%, respectively, compared to the control.
