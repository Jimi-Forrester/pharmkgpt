32825436|t|The Protective Role of Prenatal Alpha Lipoic Acid Supplementation against Pancreatic Oxidative Damage in Offspring of Valproic Acid-Treated Rats: Histological and Molecular Study.
32825436|a|BACKGROUND: Sodium valproate (VPA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) licensed for epilepsy and used during pregnancy in various indications. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a natural compound inducing endogenous antioxidant production. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal administration of VPA on the pancreas of rat offspring and assess the potential protective role of ALA co-administration during pregnancy. METHODS: Twenty-eight pregnant female albino rats were divided into four groups: group I (negative control), group II (positive control, ALA treated), group III (VPA-treated), and group IV (VPA-ALA-treated). The pancreases of the rat offspring were removed at the fourth week postpartum and prepared for histological, immune-histochemical, morphometric, molecular, and oxidative stress marker studies. RESULTS: In group III, there were pyknotic nuclei, vacuolated cytoplasm with ballooning of acinar, alpha, and beta cells of the pancreas. Ultrastructural degeneration of cytoplasmic organelles was detected. Additionally, there was a significant increase in oxidative stress, a decrease in insulin-positive cell percentage, and an increase in glucagon positive cells in comparison to control groups. Moreover, VPA increased the gene expression of an apoptotic marker, caspase-3, with a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional factor. Conversely, ALA improved oxidative stress and apoptosis in group VI, and a consequent improvement of the histological and ultrastructure picture was detected. CONCLUSION: ALA co-administration with VPA significantly improved the oxidative stress condition, histological and morphometric picture of the pancreas, and restored normal expression of related genes, including Nrf2, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Administration of alpha-lipoic acid has a protective effect against VPA-induced pancreatic oxidative damage via its cytoprotective antioxidant effect.
