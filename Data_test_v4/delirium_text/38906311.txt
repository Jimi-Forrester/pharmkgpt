38906311|a|One of important characteristics of Alzheimer's disease is a persistent oxidative/nitrosative stress caused by pro-oxidant properties of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and chronic inflammation in the brain. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is easily oxidized under oxidative stress. Numerous data indicate that oxidative modifications of GAPDH in vitro and in cell cultures stimulate GAPDH denaturation and aggregation, and the catalytic cysteine residue Cys152 is important for these processes. Both intracellular and extracellular GAPDH aggregates are toxic for the cells. Interaction of denatured GAPDH with soluble Abeta results in mixed insoluble aggregates with increased toxicity. The above-described properties of GAPDH (sensitivity to oxidation and propensity to form aggregates, including mixed aggregates with Abeta) determine its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
