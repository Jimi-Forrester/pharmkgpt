38867877|t|Cerebral haemorrhage in the patient with atrial fibrillation: do we employ the direct oral anticoagulants without waiting too long?
38867877|a|Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared haemorrhagic complication of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), although the risk is significantly lower with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with warfarin. Intracranial haemorrhage is generally considered, by clinicians, to be an absolute contraindication to starting or resuming OAT in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). On the other hand, the pivotal trials with DOACs excluded patients with previous ICH. Observational studies actually indicate a net clinical benefit in favour of DOAC in patients with AF and previous ICH. This benefit is confirmed by randomized clinical trials which, however, have the limitation of the small number of cases, but larger clinical trials comparing DOACs vs. aspirin or no therapy are underway. While OAT is certainly contraindicated in patients with lobar ICH and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, in other cases, the decision must be made in the individual patient through an accurate balance between thromboembolic risk and haemorrhagic risk and a multidisciplinary cardio-neurological evaluation.
