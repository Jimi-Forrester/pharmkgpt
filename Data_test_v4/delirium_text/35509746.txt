35509746|t|Primary Varicella or Herpes Zoster? An Educational Case Report From the Primary Care Clinic.
35509746|a|Varicella-zoster virus is a pathogenic virus that can present itself as a primary infection or secondary infection, also known as herpes zoster. Recently, there has been a re-emergence of this vaccine-preventable disease due to gaps in vaccination. Primary varicella in immunocompetent adults is highly uncommon, and it could result in severe complications within this population. Given this delicate scenario, family physicians should be well trained to recognize the characteristic cutaneous lesions of varicella and dictate adequate management for these patients to obtain the best possible outcome and prevent life-threatening complications. We present the case of a 43-year-old immunocompetent woman with the onset of a generalized pruritic dermatosis characterized primarily by the presence of macules, vesicles, and crusts. The patients' lesions were compatible with primary varicella, and serological studies confirmed the diagnosis. Given the absence of acute complications in this individual, supportive treatment and close follow-up were the therapeutic modalities. This article focuses on the educational discussion of the primary differential diagnosis, evaluation for possible complications, and management of this uncommon clinical scenario. We also reinforce the importance of immunization in preventing re-emergent diseases as a critical element within primary care management.
