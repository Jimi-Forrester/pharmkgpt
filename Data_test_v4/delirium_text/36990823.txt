36990823|a|The restriction of family accompaniment of hospitalised patients has consequences for the patient, family and professionals. The aim of this study was to analyse the opinion of healthcare professionals on the family presence in the care and recovery of hospitalised geriatric patients. A descriptive, observational, multicentre study was carried out by means of a survey addressed to professionals from hospitals in Madrid. A total of 314 professionals (43.6% nurses, 26.1% nursing assistants, 15.6% doctors) from different hospitals responded. Eighty percent (95%CI: 75%-84%) stated that the restriction of visits hindered the patient's recovery and 84% (95%CI: 80%-88%) stated that the family care cannot be substituted by professionals, although it can be improved through training and increased staffing (91%). Seventy percent think that when patients are alone, they eat and drink less, suffer more bronchial aspiration and delirium, and have greater difficulty in hygiene and mobilisation. Healthcare professionals recognised that the care provided by patients' relatives facilitates their recovery.
