36619835|a|Due to the need for face-to-face administration of many cognitive screening tests, it is not always feasible to screen large-scale samples. Objective: This study aimed to assess the discriminant validity of the Persian version of Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (P-TICS-m) and Mini-Mental State Examination in the middle-aged Iranian population. Methods: The P-TICS-m and MMSE were administered to 210 randomly selected middle-aged community-dwelling adults who had been registered in the Neyshabur Longitudinal Study on Ageing. Participants also underwent psychological examination by two neurologists to assess cognitive impairment based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria. To evaluate the discriminant validity of P-TICS-m and MMSE with DSM-V criteria, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated. Results: The mean age of the participants was 59.6+-6.8 years. The TICS and MMSE were highly correlated (r=0.635, p<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+, and LR- to discriminate cognitive impairment were, respectively, 83%, 92%, 68%, 96%, 10, and 0.182 for MMSE and 100%, 13%, 19%, 100%, 1.16, and 0 for TICS-m. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results showed no statistically significant differences between P-TICS-m and MMSE. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the TICS-m test can be used as a screening tool instead of the MMSE. Due to the low specificity and low PPV of the TICS-m compared to MMSE, the diagnosis should be confirmed using definitive diagnostic tests when a subject is classified as having cognitive impairment.
