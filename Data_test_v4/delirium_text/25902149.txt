25902149|t|Relationship between Adiponectin Gene Polymorphisms and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.
25902149|a|In recent years, researchers have found that adiponectin (ANP) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and low serum concentrations of ANP are associated with AD. Higher plasma ANP level have a protective effect against the development of cognitive decline, suggesting that ANP may affect AD onset. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence supports the crucial role of ANP in the pathogenesis of AD. To study the relationship between ANP gene polymorphisms (rs266729, -11377C>G and rs1501299, G276T) and late-onset AD (LOAD), we carried out a case-control study that included 201 LOAD patients and 257 healthy control subjects. Statistically significant differences were detected in the genotype and allelotype frequency distributions of rs266729 and rs1501299 between the LOAD group and the control group, with a noticeable increase in the G and T allelotype frequency distributions in the LOAD group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis using recessive model and additive model revealed that the rs266729 GG and rs1501299 TT genotypes are associated with a greater risk of LOAD. Haplotype analysis identified four haplotypes: CG, CT, GG, and GT. The frequencies of the CT and GG haplotypes were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between the LOAD group and control group, whereas the CG and GT haplotypes were significantly different (P < 0.05), suggesting a negative correlation between the CG haplotype and LOAD onset (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.57-0.96, P = 0.022), and a positive correlation between the GT haplotype and LOAD onset (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.42-3.68, P = 0.005). Therefore, we speculated that the rs266729 and rs1501299 of ANP gene polymorphisms and the GT and CG haplotypes were associated with LOAD.
