31729244|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore what sources of well-being are rated meaningful by older adults in residential care and how they are related to two important well-being outcomes. METHOD: Two cross-sectional questionnaire studies were conducted in a sample of care residents without cognitive disability (n = 329) and with Alzheimer's disease (n = 104). Structural equation modelling was used to test a hypothesized and exploratory model of different sources as predictors of presence of meaning in life (POM) and satisfaction with life (SWL). RESULTS: Family and Health were rated most meaningful by residents with and without dementia. In both studies, the hypothesized model showed adequate fit with the data. For cognitively intact residents, Personal Growth, Spirituality/Religion, and Interpersonal Relationships predicted POM, while Family and Leisure predicted SWL. Exploratory testing identified Leisure as a possible additional predictor of POM. For residents with Alzheimer's disease, Personal Growth and Society/Community predicted POM, while Family predicted SWL. CONCLUSION: For older adults in residential care, many sources of well-being remain highly meaningful and some are directly related to the experience of meaning and life satisfaction. Both for residents with and without dementia, continued or increased investment in moments that foster personal growth and family relationships might be especially valuable.
