37684310|t|Development and validation of a clinical score for early diagnosis of constipation in critically ill children.
37684310|a|Constipation affects almost 50% of critically ill pediatric patients and is related to their morbidity and mortality. However, little attention is paid to it and it is diagnosed late and when there are already complications. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a score to identify critically ill children with high risk of constipation 48 h after admission. A single center two phase-study was carried out; the first one (retrospective observational study) to develop the score and the second one to validate it in another prospective observational study. Children between 15 days of life and 18 years old admitted to the PICU for more than 3 days were included. Demographic and clinical data during the first 48 h after PICU admission were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis and ROC curves were used to develop and validate the score. Data from 145 patients (62.8% boys) with a mean age of 34.9 +- 7.3 months were used to develop the score. Independent factors identified to develop the score were: weight > 7 kg, admission to PICU after surgery, need of vasoconstrictors, doses of fentanyl >= 2 mcg/kg/h, and initiation of enteral nutrition later than 48 h after admission. Two cut-off values were identified to set low constipation risk (< 5.7 points) and high constipation risk (> 6.2 points). This score was validated in 124 patients showing a sensibility of 63.2%, specificity of 95.5% and a positive/negative predictive values (P/NPV) of 100% and 82.1% respectively to identify constipated patients. This is the first score to identify high constipation risk in critically ill children. This score is easy to apply, and internal validation has shown a PPV of 100%.
