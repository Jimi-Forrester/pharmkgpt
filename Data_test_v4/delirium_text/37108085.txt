37108085|t|Cholinergic Antagonists and Behavioral Disturbances in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
37108085|a|Cholinergic antagonists interfere with synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and are involved in pathological processes in patients with neurocognitive disorders (NCD), such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In this commentary, we will briefly review the current knowledge on the impact of cholinergic burden on BPSD in persons with NCD, including the main pathophysiological mechanisms. Given the lack of clear consensus regarding symptomatic management of BPSD, special attention must be paid to this preventable, iatrogenic condition in patients with NCD, and de-prescription of cholinergic antagonists should be considered in patients with BPSD.
