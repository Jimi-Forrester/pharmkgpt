38854540|t|Tinospora cordifolia Extract Enhances Dextromethorphan Bioavailability: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease.
38854540|a|Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers (Menispermaceae) is a traditional rejuvenator and a conventional medicine used to manage oxidative stress-related diseases, including those associated with the central nervous system. Decreased dextromethorphan (DEM) metabolism is necessary for high bioavailability and application against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since T. cordifolia stem extract (TCE) can potentially inhibit several metabolic enzymes, it can also enhance dextromethorphan bioavailability. This study investigates the potential of TCE to improve DEM's bioavailability and efficacy for the management of AD. In silico analysis was carried out to find the inhibition potential of phytocomponents of T. cordifolia for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The LC-MS method was revalidated for the analysis of DEM and metabolite dextrorphan (DEX) in the presence of quinidine (QN). The ratio of DEM to DEX was estimated with varying doses of TCE following pharmacokinetic analysis. Network pharmacology analysis was carried out to understand the complementary potential of phytocomponents. This was further validated in the scopolamine-induced dementia model through behavioral and histopathological analyses. TCE (100 mg/kg) for 14 days increased the DEM to DEX ratio by 2.8-fold compared to QN treatment. While T max was comparable to that of QN treatment at this dose (100 mg/kg) of TCE, it increased significantly at the higher dose (400 mg/kg) of TCE pretreatment. All other pharmacokinetic parameters were also enhanced at this dose with a 4.7-fold increase in DEM/DEX compared with QN. Network pharmacology analysis indicated the ability of TCE to target multiple factors associated with AD. Furthermore, it improved spatial memory and reduced hyperactivity in rodents better than the combination of QN and DEM.
