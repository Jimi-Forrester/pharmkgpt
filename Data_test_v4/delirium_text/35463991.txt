35463991|t|Structural Effects of pH Variation and Calcium Amount on the Microencapsulation of Glutathione in Alginate Polymers.
35463991|a|Reduced glutathione (GSH) has a high antioxidant capacity and is present in nearly every cell in the body, playing important roles in nutrient metabolism, antioxidant defense, and regulation of cellular events. Conversely, alginate is a macromolecule that has been widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, biomedical, and textile industries due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity, and nonimmunogenicity as well as for its capabilities of retaining water and stabilizing emulsions. The primary goal of this study was to characterize and optimize the formation of a molecular complex of calcium alginate with GSH using a computational approach. As methods, we evaluated the influence of varying the amount of calcium cations at two different pHs on the structural stability of Ca2+-alginate complexes and thus on GSH liberation from these types of nanostructures. The results showed that complex stabilization depends on pH, with the system having a lower Ca2+ amount that produces the major GSH release. The systems at pH 2.5 retain more molecules within the calcium-alginate complex, which release GSH more slowly when embedded in more acidic media. In conclusions, this study demonstrates the dependence of the amount of calcium and the stabilizing effect of pH on the formation and subsequent maintenance of an alginate nanostructure. The results presented in this study can help to develop better methodological frameworks in industries where the release or capture of compounds, such as GSH in this case, depends on the conditions of the alginate nanoparticle.
