32824376|t|The Non-Fibrillating N-Terminal of alpha-Synuclein Binds and Co-Fibrillates with Heparin.
32824376|a|The intrinsically disordered protein alpha-synuclein (aSN) is, in its fibrillated state, the main component of Lewy bodies-hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Additional Lewy body components include glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In humans, heparan sulfate has, in an age-dependent manner, shown increased levels of sulfation. Heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is a relevant mimic for mature heparan sulfate and has been shown to influence aSN fibrillation. Here, we decompose the underlying properties of the interaction between heparin and aSN and the effect of heparin on fibrillation. Via the isolation of the first 61 residues of aSN, which lacked intrinsic fibrillation propensity, fibrillation could be induced by heparin, and access to the initial steps in fibrillation was possible. Here, structural changes with shifts from disorder via type I beta-turns to beta-sheets were revealed, correlating with an increase in the aSN1-61/heparin molar ratio. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that heparin and aSN1-61 co-exist in the final fibrils. We conclude that heparin can induce the fibrillation of aSN1-61, through binding to the N-terminal with an affinity that is higher in the truncated form of aSN. It does so by specifically modulating the structure of aSN via the formation of type I beta-turn structures likely critical for triggering aSN fibrillation.
