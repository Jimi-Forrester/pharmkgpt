2063065|t|[Different clinical types of degenerative aphasia].
2063065|a|The authors report 3 cases of slowly progressive aphasia with different language disturbances: anomia, pure word deafness and Broca's aphasia. All patients were independent in daily life activities. Insight, judgement and overall behaviour were intact. There was no major disturbance of other cognitive functions, but psychometric tests showed mild deficits suggesting widespread involvement. CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging showed focal dilatation of the left sylvian fissure. A positron emission tomographic study showed left perisylvian hypometabolism. A review of the literature yielded an increasing number of cases of this degenerative syndrome affecting dominant hemisphere language areas. Our cases confirm the clinical heterogeneity of degenerative aphasia. Postmortem neuropathological examinations are rare and many causes are found: Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease or aspecific gliosis.
