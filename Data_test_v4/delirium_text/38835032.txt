38835032|a|BACKGROUND: Gastrodin (GAS), a main bioactive component of the herbal plant, Gastrodia elata Blume, has shown to have beneficial effects on neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease in animal studies and migraine in clinical studies. Inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex having a core of pattern recognition receptor and has been implicated in the development of neuroinflammatory diseases. Gastrodin has shown to modulate the activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This study investigated the effects of GAS on the intensity of mechanical allodynia and associated changes in NLRP3 inflammasome expression at the spinal level using L5/6 spinal nerve ligation model (SNL) in rats. METHODS: Intrathecal (IT) catheter implantation and SNL were used for drug administration and pain model in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effect of gastrodin or MCC950 (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor) on mechanical allodynia was measured by von Frey test. Changes in NLRP3 inflammasome components and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and cellular expression were examined in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion. RESULTS: The expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components was found mostly in the neurons in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion. The protein and mRNA levels of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, and IL-1beta were upregulated in SNL animals compared to Sham animals. IT administration of GAS significantly attenuated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and the intensity of SNL-induced mechanical allodynia. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, MCC950, also attenuated the intensity of allodynia, but the effect is less strong and shorter than that of GAS. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1beta is greatly increased and mostly found in the neurons at the spinal level in SNL model, and IT gastrodin exerts a significant anti-allodynic effect in SNL model partly through suppressing the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome.
