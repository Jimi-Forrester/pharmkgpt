38025730|t|Gender-specific linkages: frailty, polypharmacy, anti-cholinergic burden, and 5-year mortality risk-a real-world analysis.
38025730|a|Background: With higher age, frailty escalates the risk of falls, unexpected physical dysfunction, hospitalization, and mortality. Polypharmacy in the older population is a major challenge that not only increases medical costs, but also may worsen the risk of hospitalization and death. More importantly, the properties of anti-cholinergic drugs contribute various negative effects. This study aimed to investigate the sex difference in the association of polypharmacy, anticholinergic burden, and frailty with mortality. Methods: Participants older than 65 years who attended the geriatric outpatient clinic of the study center between January 2015 and July 2020 were invited to participate in this retrospective study. Comprehensive geriatric assessment data were collected and the phenotype of frailty was determined by Fried's criteria. Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier curve were used to identify risk factors of 5-year survival along with intergroup differences in the risks. Results: Of the 2,077 participants, 47.5% were female. The prevalence of frailty and the rate of polypharmacy were 44.7% and 60.6%, respectively. Higher age, male sex, low body mass index, low Mini-Mental State Examination scores, low activities of daily living, frailty status, polypharmacy, and a high Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and greater anticholinergic burden were significant risk factors that were associated with the 5-year all-cause mortality. Male patients with frailty exhibited the highest risks of mortality compared with male patients without frailty and female patients with or without frailty. Polypharmacy was significantly associated with a higher 5-year mortality rate in the frail male group compared with the non-frail male. In frail female group, individuals with a higher anticholinergic burden (as indicated by the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale) from drug usage exhibited an elevated 5-year mortality rate. Conclusions: Polypharmacy and greater anticholinergic burden, synergistically interacted with frailty and intensified the 5-year mortality risk in a gender-specific manner. To mitigate mortality risks, clinicians should prudently identify polypharmacy and anticholinergic burden in the older population.
