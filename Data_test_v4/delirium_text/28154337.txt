28154337|t|Investigation of Mental Disorders in Lung Cancer Outpatients: A Retrospective Analysis.
28154337|a|Cancer patients often develop mental conditions, including anxiety and depressive disorder. And, patients with chemotherapy often exhibit mental changes including anxiety and depressive disorder. Furthermore, it is well known that the frequency of delirium is increased in cancer patients receiving terminal care. Thus, the psychiatric and cognitive functions of cancer survivors are significantly influenced by their quality of life. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis to identify the risk factors for psychiatric disorders in lung cancer survivors. Most lung cancer survivors that were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders had stage 4 disease. In addition, it was found that an increase in disease stage and high doses of opioids are associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders in lung cancer survivors. These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the mental changes experienced by lung cancer patients during disease progression.
