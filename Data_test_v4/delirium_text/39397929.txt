39397929|a|Oxidative stress and diabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Natural reduced water contains active hydrogen (hydrogen radicals), eliminates reactive oxygen species, and has antidiabetic effects. However, whether natural reduced water affects human cognitive function is unknown. Therefore, we implemented a double-blind intervention experiment in which participants consumed 1 L of natural reduced water or tap water daily for 6 months. The participants were healthy older adults living in Japan. The intervention group showed significant improvements in cognitive functions of attention function (p < 0.01) and short-term memory (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the continuous intake of natural reduced water improves several cognitive functions.
