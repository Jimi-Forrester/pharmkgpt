8047277|t|Lack of association between apolipoprotein E allele epsilon 4 and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
8047277|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a protein involved in the transport of lipids and a component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaques. There are three common alleles of the apoE gene, designated epsilon 2, epsilon 3 and epsilon 4. An association between familial and sporadic AD and the epsilon 4 allele was recently reported. We have investigated Swedish Alzheimer patients and controls. The epsilon 4 allele frequency in familial and sporadic cases and in controls was 47, 22 and 18%, respectively. There was no significant difference between sporadic AD and controls but in familial cases the increased epsilon 4 allele frequency previously reported was confirmed.
