36732015|a|Accumulating evidence indicates that insulin-mediated signaling in the brain may play important roles in regulating neuronal function. Alterations to insulin signaling are associated with the development of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Also, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have been associated with seizure activity and brain injury. In recent work, we found that insulin increased inhibitory GABAA -mediated tonic currents in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this work, we used local field potential recordings and calcium imaging to investigate the effect of insulin on seizure-like activity in PFC slices. Seizure-like events (SLEs) were induced by perfusing the slices with magnesium-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the proconvulsive compound 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). We found that insulin decreased the frequency, amplitude, and duration of SLEs as well as the synchronic activity of PFC neurons evoked by 4-AP. These insulin effects were mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and mimicked by gaboxadol (THIP), a delta GABAA receptor agonist. The effect of insulin on the number of SLEs was partially blocked by L-655,708, an inverse agonist with high selectivity for GABAA receptors containing the alpha5 subunit. Our results suggest that insulin reduces neuronal excitability by an increase of GABAergic tonic currents. The physiological relevance of these findings is discussed.
