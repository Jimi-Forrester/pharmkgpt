Methods: This study aimed to establish potential associations between hub genes and subtypes for the treatment of metastatic osteosarcoma. Differentially expressed genes were extracted from patients diagnosed with metastatic osteosarcoma and a control group of non-metastatic patients, using the publicly available gene expression profile (GSE21257). The intersection of these gene sets was determined by focusing on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes sourced from the GeneCards database. We conducted various analytical techniques, including functional and pathway enrichment analysis, WGCNA analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and assessment of immune cell infiltration, using the intersecting genes. Through this analysis, we identified potential hub genes. Results: Osteosarcoma subtype models were developed using molecular consensus clustering analysis, followed by an examination of the associations between each subtype and hub genes. A total of 138 potential differentially expressed genes related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were identified. These genes were further investigated using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) pathways. Additionally, the PPI interaction network revealed 38 interaction relationships among the top ten hub genes. The findings of the analysis revealed a strong correlation between the extent of immune cell infiltration and both osteosarcoma metastasis and the expression of hub genes. Notably, the differential expression of the top ten hub genes was observed in osteosarcoma clusters 1 and 4, signifying their significant association with the disease. Conclusion: The identification of ten key genes linked to osteosarcoma metastasis and endoplasmic reticulum stress bears potential clinical significance. Additionally, exploring the molecular subtype of osteosarcoma has the capacity to guide clinical treatment decisions, necessitating further investigations and subsequent clinical validations.
