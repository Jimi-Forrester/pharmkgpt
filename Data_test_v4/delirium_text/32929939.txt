32929939|a|The immune mechanisms of cognitive impairment are considered. Various causal relationships of the development of immune and neurodegenerative disorders, including vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are analyzed. It has been shown that age-related adaptive restructuring of immunity leads to the fact that lymphocytic immunity as a whole begins to work in an intermediate metastable state. The dominant role of immune factors in the development of VD and AD is highlighted. It is concluded that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is associated with a decrease in antibody activity. The number of cytokines in aging animals is significantly reduced which leads to a decrease in the level of the immune response of the cell.
