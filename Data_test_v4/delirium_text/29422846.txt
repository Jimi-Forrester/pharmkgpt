29422846|t|Statokinetic Dissociation (Riddoch Phenomenon) in a Patient with Homonymous Hemianopsia as the First Sign of Posterior Cortical Atrophy.
29422846|a|We report a 60-year-old woman with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) who presented with left homonymous hemianopsia persisting for 5 years; the patient's condition was observed using static, but not kinetic, perimetry. This statokinetic dissociation of hemianopsia, which is often called Riddoch syndrome, might have been caused by a dysfunction of the right primary visual and visual association cortices, representing a functional imbalance within a disturbed visual cortex. In patients with PCA and visual field defects, both static and kinetic perimetry may be useful for understanding the extent of degeneration in the visual cortex, in addition to examinations of unilateral neglect.
