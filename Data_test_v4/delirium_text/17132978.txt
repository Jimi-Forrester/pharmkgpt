17132978|t|Cognitive change in Parkinson disease.
17132978|a|Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting 1 in 100 individuals over the age of 60. Dementia in the setting of PD (PDD) may be among the most debilitating symptoms associated with disease progression. Estimates of cognitive decline and dementia in PD suggest that up to 14% per year of patients over age 65 with PD will develop some cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, PDD is not well characterized and the relationship of PDD to Alzheimer disease remains unclear. PDD has been proposed as part of a spectrum with dementia with Lewy bodies, and PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease. It is uncertain, however, whether there is a meaningful distinction between the different disorders. It has also been difficult to gain understanding of the interaction of motor and non-motor symptoms that affect quality of life in PD and confound cognitive and psychomotor performance. This review will examine the clinical, cognitive, neuropsychiatric features of cognitive deficits associated with PD, discuss their pathologic basis and propose avenues for future research.
