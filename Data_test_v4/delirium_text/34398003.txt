34398003|a|ABSTRACT: Several viral infections are known to increase the risk of dementia through brain cell damage and systemic infection. The association between hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections and dementia was evaluated using a national sample cohort from South Korea. Using the national cohort study from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we extracted data for patients with HBV or HCV infection and for matched control participants. The controls were matched to the patients according to age, sex, income, region of residence, and past medical histories. The incidence of HCV infection was higher in the dementia group (1.0% [113/11,228]) than in the control group (0.8% [364/44,912], P = .043). However, there was no difference in the incidence of HBV infection in the dementia and control groups. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for HCV infection was 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.54, P = .043) in the dementia group. According to the subgroup analysis by sex, the adjusted ORs for HCV infection were 1.04 (95% CI = 072-1.49, P = .851) in men and 1.38 (95% CI = 1.06-1.79, P = .016) in women. We concluded that the incidence of HCV infection was higher (with a higher OR) in women with dementia than in matched control participants in South Korea.
