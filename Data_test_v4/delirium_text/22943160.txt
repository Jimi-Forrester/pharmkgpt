22943160|a|BACKGROUND: Norway has a higher incidence of hip fractures than any other country. For older individuals, a hip fracture may cause dramatic changes in health status like incontinence and daily activities. Patients with hip fractures are at high risk of urinary incontinence (UI) after surgical repair. A urinary indwelling catheter (UIC) is inserted preoperatively, but should be removed within 24 hours. Our aims were to identify indicators that might predict clinical challenges related to urinary incontinence 1 year after hip fractures. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were patients with hip fracture age 65 years or older. They were admitted form their own home to two acute-care hospitals during 2004-2006. We used the Resident Assessment Instrument for Acute Care. RESULTS: A total of 331 patients were included. Thirty-five (11%) had UIC 72 hours after surgery. These patients had more frequently experienced delirium, urinary tract infection, cognitive impairment and discouragement than their counterparts. After 12 months, patients with previous UI had lower functioning levels than those with no previous UI. They had moved four times more frequently to a nursing home and had over twice the mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patient with UI should be followed up with a multidisciplinary team after discharged from hospital.
