25137638|a|Although the N-terminal region of Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides plays dual roles as metal-coordinating sites and conformational modulator, few studies have been performed to explore the effects of mutations at this region on the overall conformational ensemble of Abeta and the binding propensity of metal ions. In this work, we focus on how three familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (D7H, D7N, and H6R) alter the structural characteristics and thermodynamic stabilities of Abeta42 using molecular dynamics simulations. We observe that each mutation displays increased beta-sheet structures in both N and C termini. In particular, both the N terminus and central hydrophobic region of D7H can form stable beta-hairpin structures with its C terminus. The conserved turn structure at Val24-Lys28 in all peptides and Zn2+-bound Abeta42 is confirmed as the common structural motif to nucleate folding of Abeta. Each mutant can significantly increase the solvation free energy and thus enhance the aggregation of Abeta monomers. The correlation dynamics between Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(17-42) fragments are elucidated by linking the domain motions with the corresponding structured conformations. We characterize the different populations of correlated domain motions for each mutant from a more macroscopic perspective, and unexpectedly find that Zn2+-bound Abeta42 ensemble shares the same populations as Abeta42, indicating that the binding of Zn2+ to Abeta follows the conformational selection mechanism, and thus is independent of domain motions, even though the structures of Abeta have been modified at a residue level.
