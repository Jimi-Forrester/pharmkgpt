32585949|t|Solid-Contact Potentiometric Sensors Based on Stimulus-Responsive Imprinted Polymers for Reversible Detection of Neutral Dopamine.
32585949|a|Herein, we present for the first time a novel potentiometric sensor based on the stimulus-responsive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as a selective receptor for neutral dopamine determination. This smart receptor can change its capabilities to recognize according to external environmental stimuli. Therefore, MIP-binding sites can be regenerated in the polymeric membrane by stimulating with stimulus after each measurement. Based on this effect, reversible detection of the analyte via potentiometric transduction can be achieved. MIPs based on 4-vinylphenylboronic acid as the functional monomer were prepared as the selective receptor. This monomer can successfully bind to dopamine via covalent binding and forming a five- or six-membered cyclic ester in a weakly alkaline aqueous solution. In acidic medium, the produced ester dissociates and regenerates new binding sites in the polymeric membrane. The proposed smart sensor exhibited fast response and good sensitivity towards dopamine with a limit of detection 0.15 microM over the linear range 0.2-10 microM. The selectivity pattern of the proposed ISEs was also evaluated and revealed an enhanced selectivity towards dopamine over several phenolic compounds. Constant-current chronopotentiometry is used for evaluating the short-term potential stability of the proposed ISEs. The obtained results confirm that the stimulus-responsive MIPs provide an attractive way towards reversible MIP-based electrochemical sensors designation.
