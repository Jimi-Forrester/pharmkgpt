38155547|t|Increased A1 astrocyte activation-driven hippocampal neural network abnormality mediates delirium-like behavior in aged mice undergoing cardiac surgery.
38155547|a|Delirium is the most common neurological complication after cardiac surgery with adverse impacts on surgical outcomes. Advanced age is an independent risk factor for delirium occurrence but its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Although increased A1 astrocytes and abnormal hippocampal networks are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, whether A1 astrocytes and hippocampal network changes are involved in the delirium-like behavior of aged mice remains unknown. In the present study, a mice model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion mimicking cardiac surgery and various assessments were used to investigate the different susceptibility of the occurrence of delirium-like behavior between young and aged mice and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that surgery significantly increased hippocampal A1 astrocyte activation in aged compared to young mice. The high neuroinflammatory state induced by surgery resulted in glutamate accumulation in the extrasynaptic space, which subsequently decreased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and increased the PV interneurons inhibition through enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors' tonic currents in the hippocampus. These further induced the abnormal activities of the hippocampal neural networks and consequently contributed to delirium-like behavior in aged mice. Notably, the intraperitoneal administration of exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, downregulated A1 astrocyte activation and alleviated delirium-like behavior in aged mice, while IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, and C1q in combination administered intracerebroventricularly upregulated A1 astrocyte activation and induced delirium-like behavior in young mice. Therefore, our study suggested that cardiac surgery increased A1 astrocyte activation which subsequently impaired the hippocampal neural networks and triggered delirium development.
