38865349|t|Photocontrolled Reversible Amyloid Fibril Formation of Parathyroid Hormone-Derived Peptides.
38865349|a|Peptide fibrillization is crucial in biological processes such as amyloid-related diseases and hormone storage, involving complex transitions between folded, unfolded, and aggregated states. We here employ light to induce reversible transitions between aggregated and nonaggregated states of a peptide, linked to the parathyroid hormone (PTH). The artificial light-switch 3-{[(4-aminomethyl)phenyl]diazenyl}benzoic acid (AMPB) is embedded into a segment of PTH, the peptide PTH25-37, to control aggregation, revealing position-dependent effects. Through in silico design, synthesis, and experimental validation of 11 novel PTH25-37-derived peptides, we predict and confirm the amyloid-forming capabilities of the AMPB-containing peptides. Quantum-chemical studies shed light on the photoswitching mechanism. Solid-state NMR studies suggest that beta-strands are aligned parallel in fibrils of PTH25-37, while in one of the AMPB-containing peptides, beta-strands are antiparallel. Simulations further highlight the significance of pi-pi interactions in the latter. This multifaceted approach enabled the identification of a peptide that can undergo repeated phototriggered transitions between fibrillated and defibrillated states, as demonstrated by different spectroscopic techniques. With this strategy, we unlock the potential to manipulate PTH to reversibly switch between active and inactive aggregated states, representing the first observation of a photostimulus-responsive hormone.
