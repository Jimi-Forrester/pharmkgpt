37517197|t|Nucleoside analogues: N-glycosylation methodologies, synthesis of antiviral and antitumor drugs and potential against drug-resistant bacteria and Alzheimer's disease.
37517197|a|Nucleosides have gained significant attention since the discovery of the structure of DNA. Nucleoside analogues may be synthesized through multiple synthetic pathways, however the N-glycosylation of a nucleobase is the most common method. Amongst the different classical N-glycosylation methodologies, the Vorbruggen glycosylation is the most popular method. This review focuses on the synthesis and therapeutic applications of several FDA approved nucleoside analogues as antiviral and anticancer agents. Moreover, this review also focuses on the potential of these compounds as new antibacterial and anti-Alzheimer's disease agents, offering an overview of the most recent research in these fields.
