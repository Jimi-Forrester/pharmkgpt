36582660|t|Physiological Mechanisms and Associated Pathophysiology of Dysphagia in Older Adults.
36582660|a|Dysphagia can be a common secondary sequela of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders in older adults. Early screening, identification, and management of dysphagia is essential to avoid serious complications, including malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia; and promote quality of life. Although individuals of all ages may experience swallowing difficulties, dysphagia and its complications are more common in older adults. This literature review aims to provide an overview of the physiological mechanisms of normal swallowing in healthy individuals and age-related changes to swallowing function, the pathophysiology of dysphagia associated with three common neurological disorders affecting older adults (stroke, Parkinson's disease, and dementia), and implications for interdisciplinary clinical practice. Increased awareness of these issues may contribute to a more timely and efficient identification of older adults with dysphagia and to improve overall dysphagia management.
