37807189|t|A - 65 Neuropsychological Sequela of Late-Onset Epilepsy in Older Adults: a Case Study.
37807189|a|OBJECTIVE: Late-onset epilepsy is increasingly recognized as playing a role in cognitive decline during aging. Late-onset epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (ad) appear to share pathological links mediated by vascular changes and tau pathology (Sen et al., 2020). Current literature has established a bi-directional association between ad and epilepsy with each being a risk factor of the other (Zhang et al., 2022). The present case illustrates the complexity of differential diagnosis in older adults presenting with progressive memory decline and late-onset epilepsy. METHOD: Clinical interviews with the patient and his wife, a review of medical records including neuroimaging results, neuropsychological history questionnaire, and neuropsychological assessment. RESULTS: 59-year-old male with a three-to-four-year history of focal seizures and slowly progressive memory decline. Medical history was void of vascular risk factors. Family history of memory disorders was denied. Brain MRI scans were read as unremarkable. However, video EEG revealed independent sharp waves from bilateral temporal areas. Neuropsychological assessment revealed deficits in verbal memory, confrontation naming, and semantic fluency but otherwise intact cognition. Per family, the patient displayed increased irritability, apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to be increasingly aware of the growing incidence of late-onset epilepsy with aging and its symbiotic role in the risk for ad. Mechanistic evidence will be reviewed such as similar network hyperexcitability along with the accumulation of amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau-protein.
