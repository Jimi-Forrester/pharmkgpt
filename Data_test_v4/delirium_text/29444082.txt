29444082|t|S100B as an antagonist to block the interaction between S100A1 and the RAGE V domain.
29444082|a|Ca2+-binding human S100A1 protein is a type of S100 protein. S100A1 is a significant mediator during inflammation when Ca2+ binds to its EF-hand motifs. Receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) correspond to 5 domains: the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, C2, C1, and V domains. The V domain of RAGE is one of the most important target proteins for S100A1. It binds to the hydrophobic surface and triggers signaling transduction cascades that induce cell growth, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the interaction between S100A1 and the RAGE V domain. We found that S100B could interact with S100A1 via NMR 1H-15N HSQC titrations. We used the HADDOCK program to generate the following two binary complexes based on the NMR titration results: S100A1-RAGE V domain and S100A1-S100B. After overlapping these two complex structures, we found that S100B plays a crucial role in blocking the interaction site between RAGE V domain and S100A1. A cell proliferation assay WST-1 also supported our results. This report could potentially be useful for new protein development for cancer treatment.
