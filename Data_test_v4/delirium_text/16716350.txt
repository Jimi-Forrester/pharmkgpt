16716350|t|Transthyretin: no association between serum levels or gene variants and schizophrenia.
16716350|a|It has been proposed that schizophrenia results from an environmental insult in genetically predisposed individuals. Environmental factors capable of modulating transcriptional activity and their carriers could link the genetic and environmental components of schizophrenia. Among these is transthyretin (TTR), a major carrier of thyroid hormones and retinol-binding protein (RBP). Retinoids and thyroid hormones regulate the expression of several genes, both during development and in the adult brain. Decreased TTR levels have been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with depression and Alzheimer's disease, and the absence of TTR influences behavior in mice. DNA variants capable of altering TTR ability to carry its ligands, either due to reduced transcription of the gene or to structural modifications of the protein, may influence development of the central nervous system and behavior. In the present study we searched for variants in the regulatory and coding regions of the TTR gene, and measured circulating levels of TTR and RBP. We found a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), ss46566417, 18 bp upstream of exon 4. Neither this SNP nor the previously described rs1800458 were found associated with schizophrenia. In addition, serum TTR and RBP levels did not differ between mentally healthy and schizophrenic individuals. In conclusion, our data does not support an involvement of the TTR gene in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
