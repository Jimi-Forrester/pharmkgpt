35451738|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important regulatory role in various diseases. However, the role of lncRNAs in brain ischemic tolerance (BIT) induced by cerebral ischemic preconditioning (CIPC) is still unknown. The lncRNA profile of rat cortical astrocytes pretreated with ischemic preconditioning was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The results of Cell-Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay showed that a novel lncRNA, NONRATT009133.2, which we referred to as brain ischemia-related factor (BIRF), was highly correlated with BIT. Through bioinformatics analysis, we predicted that BIRF, miR-330-5p, and GLT-1 (also named Slc1a2) might constitute a ceRNA regulatory network in the induction of BIT. We found that BIRF was upregulated by CIPC, which promoted GLT-1 expression and BIT induction. BIRF could directly bind to miR-330-5p. Furthermore, miR-330-5p directly targeted GLT-1, and miR-330-5p inhibited both GLT-1 expression and BIT induction in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, BIRF acts as a molecular sponge to competitively bind to miR-330-5p with GLT-1 mRNA, while the miR-330-5p inhibitor reversed all the effects of BIRF siRNA on GLT-1 expression and neuronal vitality. Taken together, our results demonstrate the important roles of the BIRF/miR-330-5p/GLT-1 axis in the induction of BIT by CIPC. BIRF may be a potentially effective therapeutic strategy against stroke injury.
