39576820|t|The Role of Epileptic Activity in Alzheimer's Disease.
39576820|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Epileptic seizures or epileptic activity have been detected in AD, and people with epilepsy have a higher risk of dementia compared to the general population. This suggests that seizures or epileptic activity might often coexist with AD. It is increasingly evident that epileptic activity or seizures are common but often overlooked comorbidities of AD. However, the causal relationship between seizures, epileptic activity and cognitive decline remains uncertain. Experimental data show that amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Tau protein can cause neuronal hyperexcitability and has epileptogenic effects. Neural network hyperexcitation regulates the ratio of Abeta isoforms and is linked to the initiation of AD, indicating a shared mechanism. Clinical studies suggest that cognitive impairment accelerates in AD patients with seizures or epileptic activity. This review discusses the relationship between epileptic seizures and AD, the impact of epileptic activity in AD, and potential treatments.
