33157915|t|Therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest during living-donor liver transplant surgery: A case report.
33157915|a|RATIONALE: Therapeutic hypothermia is an effective medical treatment for neurological recovery after cardiac arrest. Here, we describe a case of successful mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest during living-donor liver transplantation. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old woman with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was admitted for living-donor liver transplantation. Cardiac arrest occurred during the anhepatic phase. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, spontaneous circulation returned, but the bispectral index level remained below 10 until the end of surgery. DIAGNOSES: Neurological injury caused by global cerebral hypoperfusion was suspected. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia for 24hours after resuscitation targeting a core body temperature of 34 C with surface cooling using ice bags. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered consciousness about 22 hours after the event. However, she showed symptoms of delirium even when discharged. At the 3-month follow-up exam, she showed no specific neurological complications. The transplanted liver showed no problems with regeneration. LESSONS: Mild therapeutic hypothermia may be safely adopted in cases of cardiac arrest in liver transplant patients and is beneficial for neurological recovery.
