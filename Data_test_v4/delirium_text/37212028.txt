37212028|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence shows that Abeta oligomers, the intermediates during aggregation, rather than the fully mature fibrils are the most toxic species of Abeta and the key contributors to neurodegeneration. Abeta oligomers have been considered as both biomarkers and drug targets for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. However, the high heterogeneity and metastability of oligomers make it difficult to determine their exact pathogenic mechanisms. Recent developments in Abeta oligomer-targeting agents and techniques have provided great opportunities for overcoming the existing limitations. This review introduces the formation, structure, and toxicity of Abeta oligomers and categorizes the Abeta oligomer-targeting agents based on their chemical biological applications, including recognition and detection of Abeta oligomers for diagnosis, intervention of Abeta oligomerization for treatment, and stabilization of Abeta oligomers for pathogenic studies. The design strategies and working mechanisms of the representative examples published in the past five years are highlighted. Finally, future development directions and challenges of Abeta oligomer targeting are tentatively proposed.
