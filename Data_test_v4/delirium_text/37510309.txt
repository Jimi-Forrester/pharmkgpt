37510309|t|APOE Gene Associated with Dementia-Related Traits, Depression, and Anxiety in the Hispanic Population.
37510309|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a main cause of dementia, is commonly seen in aging populations with a strong genetic component. AD is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders; it is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Specific demographic factors and genetic variants have been identified in non-Hispanic populations; however, limited studies have observed the Hispanic population. Therefore, we focused on investigating a known gene, APOE, associated with AD-related phenotypes and two psychiatric diseases (depression and anxiety) within the U.S. Hispanic population in our current study. A total of 1382 subjects were studied based on data collected from the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC, N = 1320) and the Initial Study of Longevity and Dementia from the Rio Grande Valley (ISLD-RGV, N = 62). Questionnaires regarding demographics, medical history, and blood/saliva samples were collected. We genotyped the APOE gene. The current findings indicated that APOE-epsilon4 was associated with not only AD (p < 0.0001) but also with anxiety (p < 0.0001) and depression (p = 0.0004). However, APOE-epsilon3 was associated with depression (p = 0.002) in the Hispanic population. We provide additional evidence in which APOE-epsilon4 increased the risk for AD in Hispanics. For the first time, APOE alleles show increased risks for anxiety and depression in Hispanics. Further research is warranted to confirm the current findings.
