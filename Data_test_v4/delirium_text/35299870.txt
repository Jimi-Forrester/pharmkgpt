35299870|a|Inorganic arsenic is a xenobiotic entering the body primarily through contaminated drinking water and food. There are defined mechanisms that describe arsenic's association with increased cancer incidence, however mechanisms explaining arsenic exposure and neurodevelopmental or aging disorders are poorly defined. In recent years, arsenic effects on epigenome have become a particular focus. We hypothesize that human relevant arsenic exposure during particular developmental windows, or long-term exposure later in life induce pathophysiological neural changes through epigenomic alterations, in particular histone methylation profile, manifesting as cognitive decline. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were continually exposed to sodium arsenite (100 microg/L) in drinking water prior to mating through weaning of the experimental progeny. A second cohort of aged APP/PS mice were chronically exposed to the same level of arsenic. Cognitive testing, histological examination of brains and genome-wide methylation levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 examined after ChIP-seq were used to determine the effects of arsenic exposure. Developmental arsenic exposure caused significantly diminished cognition in wild-type mice. The analysis of ChIP-seq data and experiments with mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrated that epigenetic changes induced by arsenic exposure translated into gene expression alterations associated with neuronal development and neurological disease. Increased hippocampal amyloid plaques levels of APP/PS mice and cognitive decline provided evidence that arsenic exposure aggravated an existing Alzheimer's disease-like phenotype. We show developmental arsenic exposure significantly impacts histone modifications in brain which remain present into adulthood and provide a potential mechanism by which developmental arsenic exposure influences cognitive functions. We also show that human relevant, chronic arsenic exposure has deleterious effects on adult APP/PS mice and exacerbates existing Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms. The results demonstrate how developmental arsenic exposure impacts the brain epigenome, leading to altered gene expression later in life.
