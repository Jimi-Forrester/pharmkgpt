36836553|a|Most patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) are older. In addition, current geriatric oncology guidelines suggest that all cancer patients aged over 70 years should undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), with the identification of frailty syndrome being crucial for clinical decisions. Frailty can be associated with lower quality of life (QoL) and interfere with the feasibility or side effects of oncology treatments. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to evaluate frailty syndrome and associated alterations related to CGA impairment by searching in different academic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus). The identified articles were reviewed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 165 articles consulted, 7 met our inclusion criteria. Analysis of data related to frailty syndrome in patients with mPCa showed a prevalence between 30-70% depending on the tool used. Additionally, frailty was associated with other CGA assessments and QoL evaluation outcomes. In general terms, CGA scores for patients with mPCa were lower than those for patients without metastasis. Furthermore, functional QoL appeared to be worse for patients with metastasis, and global QoL (burden) was more strongly associated with frailty. CONCLUSION: Frailty syndrome was related to a poorer QoL in patients with mPCa and its evaluation should be considered in clinical decision-making and when choosing the most appropriate active treatment, if any, to increase survival.
