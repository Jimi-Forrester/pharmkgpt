11097338|t|Apolipoprotein E polymorphisms and concentration in chronic diseases and drug responses.
11097338|a|Apolipoprotein (apo) E is an important circulating and tissue protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis and many other functions. The common polymorphism in the coding region of the gene, four polymorphisms in the promoter region, other additional single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as several apo E variants have been identified. The common coding polymorphism strongly influences the lipid metabolism and the circulating concentration of apo E itself. This polymorphism is at the origin of the implication of apo E in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, but also of the relation of apo E with longevity. Probably due to its many metabolic and functional consequences, apo E polymorphism has been shown to influence the responses of patients to several drugs (fibrates, statins, hormone replacement therapy, anti-Alzheimer drugs) or environmental interventions (black tea, alcohol, diet). Apo E genotyping may be clinically helpful in defining the risk of patients and their responses to therapeutics. Finally, circulating apo E concentration appears to be altered in diseases and can be modulated by some of the drugs cited above. This parameter can thus also give interesting clinical information and could be a therapeutic target, providing it is validated. At the present time, we cannot exclude that apo E concentration may be the most prominent apo E parameter to be considered in health and disease, while apo E polymorphisms would represent only secondary parameters influencing apo E concentration.
