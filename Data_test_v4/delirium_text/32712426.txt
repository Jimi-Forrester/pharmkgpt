32712426|a|Concerning the letter by Moriguchi et al., we describe our experience with a case of encephalopathy with and atypical damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient with severe infection due to the SARS-CoV2 virus. A 56-year-old woman, without previous pathologies, developed cough, fever, and respiratory failure for five days, after returning from a 6-day trip to Venice. Chest radiography shows a large bilateral interstitial infiltrate. In the first 24 hours, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for severe respiratory failure and positive protein chain reaction-PCR in nasal exudate. She needed intubation for ten days. In the first 48 hours outside the ICU, she developed an acute confusional syndrome (hyperactive delirium). Neurological examination showed temporal-spatial disorientation and incoherent fluent speech. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized hypovoltaic activity. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed a bilateral and symmetrical increase in the supratentorial white matter's signal intensity, with a discrete thickening of both temporal lobes, with a slight increase in signal intensity and a sequence of normal diffusion. The lumbar puncture showed no changes (glucose 71 mg/dL, protein 30 mg/dL, 1 leukocyte). Within 72 hours of starting symptoms, she was neurologically asymptomatic. Our final diagnosis was an inflammatory encephalopathy related to a SARS-CoV2 infection.
