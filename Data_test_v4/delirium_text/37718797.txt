37718797|t|Integration and Evaluation of a Community-Level Dementia Screening Program in Kenya (DEM-SKY): A Protocol.
37718797|a|BACKGROUND: In Kenya, many people are currently living with dementia without a formal diagnosis or support; often attributing symptoms to normal aging or as a consequence of past behaviors. Dementia screening is not commonplace within Kenya. Improving the supply (or opportunity) of dementia screening within the region may promote uptake, thus leading to more people to seek a formal diagnosis and subsequently receive support within the Kenyan healthcare system. Community Healthcare Workers (CHWs) have successfully demonstrated their value in delivering health interventions within Kenya and have strong links within local communities. OBJECTIVE: To integrate and evaluate a community-level dementia screening program among older adults in rural Kenya. METHODS: Through leveraging this resource, we will deliver dementia screening to older adults (>=60 years) within Makueni County, Kenya over a 6-month period. Here, we present a protocol for the process evaluation of a dementia screening in Kenya (DEM-SKY) program. The process evaluation seeks to understand the adoption, implementation, continuation, and implementation determinants, using quantitative and qualitative measures. CONCLUSIONS: Gaining perspectives of different participants involved in the program (i.e., older adults, CHWs, hospital staff, and trainers), will ensure that we understand the reason for successful (or unsuccessful) delivery of DEM-SKY.
