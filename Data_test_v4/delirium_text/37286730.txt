37286730|t|Comprehensive analysis of the coding and non-coding RNA transcriptome expression profiles of hippocampus tissue in tx-J animal model of Wilson's disease.
37286730|a|Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a genetic basis. The predominant non-motor symptom of WD is cognitive dysfunction, although the specific genetic regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Tx-J mice, with an 82% sequence homology of the ATP7B gene to the human gene, are considered the most suitable model for WD. This study employs deep sequencing to investigate the differences in RNA transcript profiles, both coding and non-coding, as well as the functional characteristics of the regulatory network involved in WD cognitive impairment. The cognitive function of tx-J mice was evaluated using the Water Maze Test (WMT). Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiles were analyzed in the hippocampal tissue of tx-J mice to identify differentially expressed RNAs (DE-RNAs). Subsequently, the DE-RNAs were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, as well as DE-circRNAs and lncRNAs-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) expression networks, and coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC) networks. To elucidate their biological functions and pathways, the PPI and ceRNA networks were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. A total of 361 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs), comprising 193 up-regulated and 168 down-regulated mRNAs, 2627 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DE-lncRNAs), consisting of 1270 up-regulated and 1357 down-regulated lncRNAs, and 99 differentially expressed circular RNAs (DE-circRNAs), consisting of 68 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated circRNAs, were observed in the tx-J mice group when compared to the control mice group. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses revealed that DE-mRNAs were enriched in cellular processes, calcium signaling pathways, and mRNA surveillance pathways. In contrast, the DE-circRNAs-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was enriched for covalent chromatin modification, histone modification, and axon guidance, whereas the DE-lncRNAs-associated ceRNA network was enriched for dendritic spine, regulation of cell morphogenesis involved in differentiation, and mRNA surveillance pathway. The study presented the expression profiles of lncRNA, circRNA, and mRNA in the hippocampal tissue of tx-J mice. Furthermore, the study constructed PPI, ceRNA, and CNC expression networks. The findings are significant in comprehending the function of regulatory genes in WD associated with cognitive impairment. These results also offer valuable information for the diagnosis and treatment of WD.
