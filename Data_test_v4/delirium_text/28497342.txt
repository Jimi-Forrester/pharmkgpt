28497342|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive condition, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen. Biochemically the disease is characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, in addition to cholinergic dysfunction in the central nervous system. The role of the cholinergic neurotransmission in AD is the basis of the widely accepted cholinergic hypothesis. Some of the most relevant therapies for the treatment of the disease are based on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor activity; however, these therapies are not effective to stop the disease progression, but only can temporarily slow down the worsening of dementia symptoms, and improve quality of life of patients and their caregivers. In recent years, plant alkaloids extracted from Amaryllidaceae family have received great attention due to the well-known anti cholinergic activity. In this context, the purpose of this study was to apply the docking molecular in silico analysis aiming to examine the recombinant human AChE enzyme (rhAChE) inhibitory activity displayed by different alkaloids from Amaryllidaceae family. Overall, the present results support the idea that alkaloids reported in this research are capable of interacting with rhAChE-binding sites.
