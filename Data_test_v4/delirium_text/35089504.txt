35089504|t|In Vivo 13C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for Assessing Brain Biochemistry in Health and Disease.
35089504|a|Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique that contributes to the elucidation of brain biochemistry. 13C MRS enables the detection of specific neurochemicals and their neuroenergetic correlation with neuronal function. The synergistic outcome of 13C MRS and the infusion of 13C-labeled substrates provide an understanding of neurometabolism and the role of glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Moreover, 13C MRS provides a window into the altered flux rate of different pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the glutamate/glutamine/GABA cycle, in health and in various diseases. Notably, the metabolic flux rate of the TCA cycle often decreases in neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, 13C MRS can be used to investigate several psychiatric and neurological disorders as it directly reflects the real-time production and alterations of key brain metabolites. This review aims to highlight the chronology, the technological advancements, and the applications of 13C MRS in various brain diseases.
