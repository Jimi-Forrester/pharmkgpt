36567971|a|This paper describes the gangliopexy method, a method for creating a new center of local neurohumoral regulation, based on the formation of new connections discovered between the nervous system and the vascular system. The prospects for the development of this method are studied. At the same time, novel concepts about the cycles of nitric oxide and the superoxide anion radical are introduced. A possible role of these cycles is examined in the protection of cells and the body as a whole against oxidative and nitrosative stress, which develops when (in 5-30% of cases) destructive changes in the displaced ganglion lead to vascular complications and an increased risk of mortality. Mechanisms that can protect nerve cells, prevent the development of destructive changes in these cells and reduce the risk of mortality are also investigated.
