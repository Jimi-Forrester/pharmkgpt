39520951|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by cognitive impairments. With the intensification of population aging, AD has become a major health concern affecting the elderly. Kaixinsan, a classical traditional Chinese formula, consists of Ginseng Panax et Rhizoma, Polygalae Radix, Poria and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, and is commonly used in clinical for treating memory decline. However, its mechanism remains unclear, which hinders its popularization and application. METHOD: Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to evaluate the effect of Kaixinsan on improving learning and memory ability in SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8, an AD model mice) mice. Nissl staining, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and western blotting (Bax and Bcl-2) were used to confirm the effect of Kaixinsan on the neuronal structure and apoptosis of SAMP8 mice. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was performed to identify the distribution components in brain tissue after administration of Kaixinsan extraction. Based on the identified brain distribution components, the mechanism of Kaixinsan improving the cognitive function was predicted by network pharmacology. Then, using HSP60 as a mitochondrial marker and RBFOX3 as a neuronal marker, immunofluorescence co-localization was used to confirm the effect of Kaixinsan on neuronal mitochondria quantity in SAMP8 mice. Western blotting was employed to access the expression of predicted proteins (AMPK, CaMKKbeta, PGC-1alpha and HSP90) implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis. To further confirm the mechanism of Kaixinsan, SH-SY5Y cell injury model induced by amyloid beta - protein fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35) was replicated and the effect of Kaixinsan - containing serum on apoptosis in injured SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by flow cytometer. The expression level of apoptosis-associated proteins (Bax and Bcl-2) and mitochondrial homeostasis related proteins (AMPK, CaMKKbeta, PGC-1alpha and HSP90) in the presence or absence of CaMKKbeta inhibitor (STO-609) were compared. RESULTS: The results indicate that Kaixinsan can improve the cognitive function of SAMP8 mice, alleviate the hippocampal tissue lesions and inhibit neuron apoptosis. Seventeen brain distribution components of Kaixinsan were identified. Based on the brain distribution components of Kaixinsan, the results of network pharmacology suggest that Kaixinsan may regulate mitochondrial homeostasis through the CaMKKbeta-AMPK-PGC-1alpha signaling axis. In vivo experiments indicated that Kaixinsan could reverse neuronal mitochondrial loss in SAMP8 mice by upregulating CaMKKbeta, AMPK, HSP90 and PGC-1alpha to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and increase the number of neuronal mitochondria. Additionally, the in vitro experiments demonstrated that Kaixinsan can inhibit apoptosis of Abeta25-35 injured SH-SY5Y cells and upregulate mitochondrial homeostasis-related proteins CaMKKbeta, AMPK and PGC-1alpha. However, in addition to CaMKKbeta inhibitors, the neuroprotective effect disappeared. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that Kaixinsan can improve the cognitive function of SAMP8 mice by regulating CaMKKbeta-AMPK-PGC-1alpha signaling axis to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibit neuronal apoptosis.
