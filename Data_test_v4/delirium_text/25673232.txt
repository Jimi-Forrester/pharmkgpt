25673232|a|BACKGROUND: Nurses have the key roles to detect delirium in hospitalized older patients but under-recognition of delirium among nurses is prevalent. The objectives of this study were to identify the under-recognition rate of delirium by intensive care nurses (ICU) using Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and factors associated with under-recognition. METHODS: Participants were older patients aged >=65 years who were admitted to the ICU of Srinagarind Medical School, Khon Kaen, Thailand from May 2013 to August 2014. Baseline characteristics were collected. Delirium was rated by a trained clinical researcher using the CAM-ICU. Demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to analyze the outcomes. RESULTS: Delirium occurred in 44 of 99 patients (44.4 %). Nurses could not identify delirium in 29.6 % of patients compared with researchers. Pre-existing dementia and depression were found in 47.7 % of patients. Pneumonia or other causes of respiratory failure were the most common causes of admission to ICU (47.7 %). Independent factors associated with under-recognition by nurses were identified-heart failure [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 77.8; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.5-2,543, p = 0.01] and pre-existing taking treatment with benzodiazepines (adjusted OR, 22.6; 95 % CI 1.8-85, p = 0.01). DISCUSSION: Under-recognition of delirium is a frequent issue. New independent factors associated with under-recognition were identified. Awareness of delirium in the patients with these factors is recommended. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the finding of high under-recognition rates of delirium among hospitalized older adults in ICU. Patients with heart failure and receiving benzodiazepines were identified as barriers of recognition of delirium.
