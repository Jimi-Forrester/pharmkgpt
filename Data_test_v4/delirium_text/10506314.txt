10506314|a|After surgical operations delirium can occur as a serious and possible lethal complication in about 5-15% of patients. Additionally, risk factors such as old age, polymedication, organic and psychiatric diseases raise the incidence. After open-heart and orthopedic surgery more than half of the patients are affected. Delirium has negative effects on postoperative mobilization and reconvalescence and prolongs treatment on the ward. It is discussed in the literature that delirium may induce dementia in older patients. The correction of metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the therapy of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, belongs to prophylactic treatment. Environmental conditions which facilitate reorientation of the patient after operation have beneficial effects. Some success has been achieved by using the nootropic substance piracetam as a prophylactic. In acute treatment, the butyrophenon-neuroleptic haloperidol is the drug of choice. In delirium caused by intoxication with anticholinergic agents, physostigmin is indicated. Benzodiazepines, clonidine and clomethiazole are used in particular for the treatment of withdrawal delirium.
