37377355|a|West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic flavivirus transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Severe forms of West Nile disease (WND) can curse with meningitis, encephalitis or acute flaccid paralysis. A better understanding of the physiopathology associated with disease progression is mandatory to find biomarkers and effective therapies. In this scenario, blood derivatives (plasma and serum) constitute the more commonly used biofluids due to its ease of collection and high value for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, the potential impact of this virus in the circulating lipidome was addressed combining the analysis of samples from experimentally infected mice and naturally WND patients. Our results unveil dynamic alterations in the lipidome that define specific metabolic fingerprints of different infection stages. Concomitant with neuroinvasion in mice, the lipid landscape was dominated by a metabolic reprograming that resulted in significant elevations of circulating sphingolipids (ceramides, dihydroceramides and dihydrosphingomyelins), phosphatidylethanolamines and triacylglycerols. Remarkably, patients suffering from WND also displayed an elevation of ceramides, dihydroceramides, lactosylceramides and monoacylglycerols in their sera. The dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism by WNV may provide new therapeutic opportunities and supports the potential of certain lipids as novel peripheral biomarkers of WND progression.
