19621322|a|INTRODUCTION: The adult brain of mammals preserves the capacity to generate new neurons from neural stem/progenitor cells. The new neurons become part of the already-existing networks by means of a process called 'neurogenesis in the adult brain', which is restricted to regions of the brain with a high degree of plasticity and which are associated to functions that are impaired in Alzheimer's disease. DEVELOPMENT: Despite increasing knowledge, there are still many questions surrounding these neurogenic phenomena, their regulation and their real therapeutic potential in cases of neurodegeneration such as the one referred to here. CONCLUSIONS: We have reviewed the subject of neurogenesis of the adult brain from both the pre-clinical point of view (experimental modelling) and the therapeutic perspective within the framework of Alzheimer's disease.
