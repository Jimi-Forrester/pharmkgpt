30078280|a|Objective: To observe the effect of hydromorphone on emergence agitation of children anesthetized by Sevoflurane. Methods: One hundred patients without any analgetic, aged 3 to 7 years, ASA I-II, undergoing strabismus surgery in Beijing Tongren Hospital from March, 2017 to December, 2017 were selected and they were randomly divided into two groups(n=50), H group and F group by random number table. After standardized tidal volume method induction by 8% sevoflurane and oxygen, suiltable laryngeal mask was inserted, and each patient was left spontaneously breathing anesthetized by 2.5%-3.0% sevoflurane.Ten minutes before the surgery, patients in H group were administered a dose of 0.01 mg/kg hydromorphone (diluted to 5 ml with normal saline) by pump control injection in 10 min, whereas patients in F group administered a dose of 1 mug/kg fentanyl in the same way. After the surgery , the patient was sent to postanesthesia care unit. A nurse who was blinded measured the vital signs, pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium(PAED) score, face legs activity cry consolability behavioral pain assessment tool(FLACC) score, the time of opening the eyes and departing from postanesthesia care unit(PACU), and the occurence rates of hypoxemia, swirl or nausea, drowsiness, and other scores. Results: The incidence of emergence agitation(EA) in H group was lower than in F group, whether EA was defined as PAED>10 (18.0% vs 28.0%, P>0.05) or PAED>12(12.0% vs 24.0%, P>0.05), there were not significant differences between them. The ratio of patients whose PAED>15 in F group was 12.0%, while the ratio of H group was 0, there was significant difference between the two groups(P=0.027). The occurrence rates of swirl, glossocoma in H group were 0 and 10.0% while those of F group were all 6.0%, there were no significant differences between the two groups(P>0.05). Conclusions: Comparing with fentanyl, hydromorphone can prevent the occurrence rate of EA of the children anesthetized by sevoflurane equally, even decrease the occurrence rate of the severe EA more observably, and reduce postoperation pain more significantly with less occurrence rate of swirl or nausea. Glossocoma need be paid attention to when HM is administered.
