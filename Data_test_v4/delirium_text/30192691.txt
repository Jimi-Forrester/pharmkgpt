30192691|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of dementia. The changes in white matter integrity and antioxidant enzymes levels are crucial in onset and progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). To elucidate the changes in cognitive performance, white matter integrity, oxidative stress marker, for early detection of prodromal state of AD. Fifty cases of MCI and controls (55-75 years) were subjected to Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) followed by estimation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation in serum of MCI and control population. The MMSE scores of MCI subjects were (28+-2 - 22.6+-1) as compared with controls (28+-1- 29+-1). DTI metrics fractional anisotropy (FA) values in right and left frontal lobe, fornix, corpus callosum, while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in right temporal lobe, hippocampus head, corpus callosum right, and forcep major were significantly altered in MCI as compared with controls. Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase level were lower while lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased in patients with MCI as compared with controls. The study emphasized that changes in neuro-psychological performance, white matter integrity and antioxidant enzymes level provide early signature for diagnosis of MCI.
