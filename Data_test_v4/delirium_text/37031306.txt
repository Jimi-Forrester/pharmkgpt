37031306|a|Inhibition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is a promising approach for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is produced by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase in endosomes via sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Abeta and APP have a common feature to readily cluster to form multimers. Here, using multivalent peptide library screens, we identified a tetravalent peptide, LME-tet, which binds APP and Abeta via multivalent interactions. In cells, LME-tet-bound APP in the plasma membrane is transported to endosomes, blocking Abeta production through specific inhibition of beta-cleavage, but not gamma-cleavage. LME-tet further suppresses Abeta aggregation by blocking formation of the beta-sheet conformation. Inhibitory effects are not observed with a monomeric peptide, emphasizing the significance of multivalent interactions for mediating these activities. Critically, LME-tet efficiently reduces Abeta levels in the brain of AD model mice, suggesting it may hold promise for treatment of AD.
