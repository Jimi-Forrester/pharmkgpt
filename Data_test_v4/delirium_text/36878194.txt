36878194|a|INTRODUCTION: A rapidly increasing number of patients with dementia present a serious social problem. Recently, the incidence of epilepsy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing, drawing attention to the pathological relationship between the two conditions. Clinical studies have suggested the protective action of antiepileptic agents on dementia; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of multiple antiepileptic drugs using tau aggregation assay systems to determine the effects of antiepileptic agents on tau aggregation, a major neuropathological finding associated with AD. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of seven antiepileptic agents on intracellular tau aggregation using a tau-biosensor cell-based high-throughput assay. Next, we tested these agents in a cell-free tau aggregation assay using Thioflavin T (ThT). RESULTS: The assay results revealed that phenobarbital inhibited tau aggregation, whereas sodium valproate, gabapentin, and piracetam promoted tau aggregation. In the cell-free tau aggregation assay using ThT, we confirmed that phenobarbital significantly inhibited tau aggregation. CONCLUSION: Antiepileptic drugs may modify the tau pathology in AD in a neural activity-independent manner. Our finding may provide an important insight into the optimization of antiepileptic drug therapy in older adults with dementia.
