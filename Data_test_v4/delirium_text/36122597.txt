36122597|a|Microalgae are highly photosynthetic unicellular organism that have increased demand in the recent days owing to the presence of valuable cellular metabolites. They are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, rich in species diversity and are capable of generating significant biomass by efficiently using CO2, light and other nutrients like nitrogen, phosphate etc., The microalgal biomass has upsurged in economic potential and is used as both food and feed in many countries across the world, accounting for more than 75 % of annual microalgal biomass production in the past decades. The microalgal cells are sustainable resource that synthesize various secondary metabolites such as carotenoids, polysaccharides, polyphenols, essential amino acids, sterols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Microalgae and its derived compounds possess significant pharmacological and biological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory and anti-obesity. Because of their potential health promoting properties, the utilization of microalgae and its derived substances in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries has skyrocketed in recent years. In this context, the current review discusses about the benefits of microalgae and its bioactive compounds against several neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
