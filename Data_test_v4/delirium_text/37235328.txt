37235328|t|A Review of Rickettsial Diseases Other Than Scrub Typhus in India.
37235328|a|Rickettsial diseases (RD) are widely reported all over the world. Scrub typhus (ST) is a major tropical infection which is well documented all over India. Therefore, the index of suspicion of scrub typhus is high among physicians with regard to patients presenting with acute febrile illness (AFI) and acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) in India. Rickettsial diseases other than ST (non-ST RDs), which include spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses and typhus group (TG) rickettsioses are not uncommon in India, but the index of suspicion is not as high as ST unless there is a history of the presence of fever with rashes and/or recent arthropod bites. This review aims to look into the Indian scenario on the epidemiology of non-ST RDs, especially the SFG and TG rickettsioses based on various investigations, spectrum of clinical presentation, challenges and gaps in knowledge to suspect and diagnose these infections.
