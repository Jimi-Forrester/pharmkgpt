Aggregation of the Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into insoluble fibrils is closely associated with AD. Here, we use biophysical techniques to study a peptide-based approach to target Abeta amyloid aggregation. A peptide construct, NCAM-PrP, consists of a largely hydrophobic signal sequence linked to a positively charged hexapeptide. The NCAM-PrP peptide inhibits Abeta amyloid formation by forming aggregates which are unavailable for further amyloid aggregation. In a membrane-mimetic environment, Abeta and NCAM-PrP form specific heterooligomeric complexes, which are of lower aggregation states compared to Abeta homooligomers. The Abeta:NCAM-PrP interaction appears to take place on different aggregation states depending on the absence or presence of a membrane-mimicking environment. These insights can be useful for the development of potential future therapeutic strategies targeting Abeta at several aggregation states.
