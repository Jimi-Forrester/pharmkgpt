28870815|a|Cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagy recycles cellular components and digests intracellular components including Abeta. The Ca2+- and Mg2+-permeable transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channel underlies the constitutive Ca2+ influx in some cells. Since we already reported that TRPM7 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx regulates basal autophagy, we hypothesize that the activation of TRPM7 channel could increase basal autophagy and consequently decrease Abeta. In this study, we showed that naltriben (NTB), a specific TRPM7 channel activator, induced Ca2+ influx and activated autophagic signaling in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. NTB also promoted co-localization of LC3 and APP, and reduced Abeta. Furthermore, we found that an early-onset familial AD-associated presenilin1 DeltaE9 (PS1 DeltaE9) mutant cells had attenuated basal autophagy. NTB was able to recover autophagy and decrease Abeta in PS1 DeltaE9 cells. Our results show that the activating TRPM7 channel may prevent AD-related Abeta neuropathology via modulating Ca2+-regulated basal autophagy.
