34324978|t|The protective, rescue and therapeutic potential of multi-target iron-chelators for retinitis pigmentosa.
34324978|a|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases in which mutations result in the initial loss of night vision, followed by complete blindness. There is currently no effective therapeutic option for RP patients. Given the extremely heterogeneous nature of RP, any causative gene-specific therapy would be practical in a small fraction of patients with RP. Non-gene-specific therapeutics that is applicable to the majority of RP patients regardless of causative mutations may have an enormous impact on RP treatment. Several theories including apoptosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have been proposed as possible underlying mechanisms for photoreceptor death in RP. We have designed and synthesized a series of iron-chelating compounds that possess diverse pharmacological properties and can act in a non-gene-specific manner on multiple pathological features ascribed to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and RP. In this review, we discuss the multiple effects of several brain-permeable multi target iron-chelating compounds on photoreceptor degeneration in a mouse model of human RP. Specifically, we focus on the anti-apototic, neuroprotective and neurorescue effects of the compound VK28, M30 and VAR10303 on the histologic and functional preservation of photoreceptors in a mouse model of RP. We consider such drugs as potential therapeutic agents for RP patients.
