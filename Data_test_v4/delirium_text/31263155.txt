31263155|a|Accumulation of iron has been associated with the pathobiology of various disorders of the central nervous system. Our previous work has shown that hephaestin (Heph) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) double knockout (KO) mice induced iron accumulation in multiple brain regions and that this was paralleled by increased oxidative damage and deficits in cognition and memory. In this study, we enriched astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from the cerebral cortex of neonatal wild-type (WT), Heph KO and Cp KO mice. We demonstrated that Heph is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes, while Cp is mainly expressed in astrocytes. Iron efflux was impaired in Cp KO astrocytes and Heph KO oligodendrocytes and was associated with increased oxidative stress. The expression of Heph, Cp, and other iron-related genes was examined in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes both with and without iron treatment. Interestingly, we found that the expression of the mRNA encoding ferroportin 1, a transmembrane protein that cooperates with CP and HEPH to export iron from cells, was positively correlated with Cp expression in astrocytes, and with Heph expression in oligodendrocytes. Our findings collectively demonstrate that HEPH and CP are important for the prevention of glial iron accumulation and thus may be protective against oxidative damage.
