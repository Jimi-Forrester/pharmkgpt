33904956|a|PURPOSE: Frailty is associated with a higher risk for negative postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to determine the association between the screening tool of the Dutch safety management system, Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem (VMS) 'frail elderly' and postoperative complications in a gynecological population. METHODS: This cohort study included women aged 70 years or older, who were scheduled for any kind of gynecological surgery. VMS screening data (including risk for delirium, falling, malnutrition, and functional impairment) were extracted from the electronic patient records. VMS score could range between 0 and 4 patients with a VMS score of one or more were considered frail. Data on possible confounding factors and complications within 30 days after surgery, classified with the Clavien-Dindo classification, were collected. Regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: 157 women were included with a median age of 74 years (inter quartile range 71-79). Most patients underwent prolapse surgery (52%) or hysterectomy (31%). Forty-one patients (26%) experienced any postoperative complication. Sixty-two patients (39%) were considered frail preoperatively by the VMS screening tool. Frailty measured with the VMS screening tool was not independently associated with postoperative complications in multivariable analysis (Odds ratio 1.18; 95% CI 0.49-2.82). However, a recent fall in the last 6 months (n = 208) was associated with postoperative complications (Odds ratio 3.90; 95% CI 1.57-9.66). CONCLUSION: An independent association between frailty, determined by the VMS screening tool 'Frail elderly', and postoperative complications in gynecological surgery patients could not be confirmed. A recent fall in the last 6 months seems associated with postoperative complications.
