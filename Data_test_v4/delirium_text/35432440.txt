35432440|a|Background/Aims: Many motor impairments are present in older adults with cognitive decline. One of them is the impairment of hand dexterity and bimanual coordination that result in poor functional ability in the activities of daily living (ADL). This study investigated the effects of hand dexterity and bimanual coordination declination on the sub-domains of ADL in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Thirty-one senior individuals with MCI were recruited in this study. The Purdue Pegboard Test was used to measure hand dexterity, and bimanual coordination was assessed by the continuous circle-drawing task. Their ADL were assessed with the General Activity Daily Living questionnaire. Results: The correlations analysis showed an association between the dominant hand and bimanual dexterity with the domestic domain of ADL and all conditions of hand dexterity with the complex domain of ADL. Moreover, the multiple regression analysis showed that the predictor of the greatest effect for domestic and complex domains was dominant hand dexterity. Discussion/Conclusion: These results revealed that dominant hand dexterity strongly affected domestic and complex ADL in older adults with MCI. There were age-related changes regarding lateral asymmetrical motor reduction, especially in cognitive tasks. However, complex tasks involving cognitive function may need dominant, nondominant and bimanual hand dexterity.
