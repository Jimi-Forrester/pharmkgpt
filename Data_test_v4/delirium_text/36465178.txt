36465178|t|SIRT6 in Aging, Metabolism, Inflammation and Cardiovascular Diseases.
36465178|a|As an important NAD+-dependent enzyme, SIRT6 has received significant attention since its discovery. In view of observations that SIRT6-deficient animals exhibit genomic instability and metabolic disorders and undergo early death, SIRT6 has long been considered a protein of longevity. Recently, growing evidence has demonstrated that SIRT6 functions as a deacetylase, mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase and long fatty deacylase and participates in a variety of cellular signaling pathways from DNA damage repair in the early stage to disease progression. In this review, we elaborate on the specific substrates and molecular mechanisms of SIRT6 in various physiological and pathological processes in detail, emphasizing its links to aging (genomic damage, telomere integrity, DNA repair), metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion and lipid synthesis, lipolysis, thermogenesis), inflammation and cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury). In addition, the most recent advances regarding SIRT6 modulators (agonists and inhibitors) as potential therapeutic agents for SIRT6-mediated diseases are reviewed.
