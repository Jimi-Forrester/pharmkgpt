26084734|a|Benefits of dietary moderation when on a Mediterranean diet type (MD) have been known for well over half a century. In the past, there has been a vigorous renewal of interest in preventive potential of MD. This review is unique, by focusing on the very recent confirmatory data on the MD, all published within the first half of 2014. Benefits of MD in preventing and reducing cardiovascular disorders (CVD), known before, have been strongly confirmed. While there is little doubt regarding potential benefit of MD for obesity, diabetes type II, metabolic syndrome and fatty liver, critical evaluation has to be aimed at reported benefits of MD in such widely metabolic diverse disorders as cancer, pulmonary disease and cognition defects, including Alzheimer disease (Ref. 20).
