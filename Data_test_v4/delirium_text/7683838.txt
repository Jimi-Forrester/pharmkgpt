7683838|a|Alcohol withdrawal symptoms in 19 male alcoholics were objectively evaluated and classified and circadian variation in their plasma 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations was determined at 3 different intervals after cessation of drinking. Circadian variations in plasma 5-HIAA level exhibited phase advances in alcoholic patients compared with normal controls and were different depending on the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Plasma 5-HIAA in patients with delirium tremens showed significantly higher levels during the abstention period, possibly suggesting peculiarity in their serotonergic metabolism.
