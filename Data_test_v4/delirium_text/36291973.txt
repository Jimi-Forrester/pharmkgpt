36291973|t|Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in a Patient Suffering from Post-COVID Syndrome with Dyspnea: A Case Report.
36291973|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term health consequences following COVID-19 disease constitute an increasing problem worldwide. A considerable number of patients still suffer from various symptoms, most commonly dyspnea, months or even years after the acute infection. In these patients, a classical pulmonary function test often yields no significant findings. Subsequently, treating those patients is a challenge for any physician as there are currently no evidence-based treatment plans. CASE AND METHODS: We reported the case of a 58-year-old patient who was still suffering from resting dyspnea six months after severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The dyspnea was so pronounced that the patient was supplied with home oxygen, which they used as needed. The regional distribution of ventilation in the lungs was studied twice utilizing noninvasive electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The first examination showed distinct inhomogeneities of regional ventilation, a regional ventilation delay (RVD) of 15%, and pronounced pendelluft phenomena. Seven weeks after treatment with budesonide and physical therapy, the patient reported a clear subjective improvement in complaints. Accordingly, the regional distribution of ventilation also improved. CONCLUSION: Electrical impedance tomography might be a promising method to assess lung function in post-COVID patients; however, controlled and larger studies are necessary.
