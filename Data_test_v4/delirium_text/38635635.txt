38635635|t|CNS autoimmune response in the MAM/pilocarpine rat model of epileptogenic cortical malformation.
38635635|a|The development of seizures in epilepsy syndromes associated with malformations of cortical development (MCDs) has traditionally been attributed to intrinsic cortical alterations resulting from abnormal network excitability. However, recent analyses at single-cell resolution of human brain samples from MCD patients have indicated the possible involvement of adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of these disorders. By exploiting the MethylAzoxyMethanol (MAM)/pilocarpine (MP) rat model of drug-resistant epilepsy associated with MCD, we show here that the occurrence of status epilepticus and subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures in the malformed, but not in the normal brain, are associated with the outbreak of a destructive autoimmune response with encephalitis-like features, involving components of both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. The MP brain is characterized by blood-brain barrier dysfunction, marked and persisting CD8+ T cell invasion of the brain parenchyma, meningeal B cell accumulation, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by antineuronal antibodies. Furthermore, the therapeutic treatment of MP rats with the immunomodulatory drug fingolimod promotes both antiepileptogenic and neuroprotective effects. Collectively, these data show that the MP rat could serve as a translational model of epileptogenic cortical malformations associated with a central nervous system autoimmune response. This work indicates that a preexisting brain maldevelopment predisposes to a secondary autoimmune response, which acts as a precipitating factor for epilepsy and suggests immune intervention as a therapeutic option to be further explored in epileptic syndromes associated with MCDs.
