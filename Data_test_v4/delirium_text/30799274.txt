30799274|a|Recent advances in generating three-dimensional (3D) organoid systems from stem cells offer new possibilities for disease modeling and drug screening because organoids can recapitulate aspects of in vivo architecture and physiology. In this study, we generate isogenic 3D midbrain organoids with or without a Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 G2019S mutation to study the pathogenic mechanisms associated with LRRK2 mutation. We demonstrate that these organoids can recapitulate the 3D pathological hallmarks observed in patients with LRRK2-associated sporadic Parkinson's disease. Importantly, analysis of the protein-protein interaction network in mutant organoids revealed that TXNIP, a thiol-oxidoreductase, is functionally important in the development of LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease in a 3D environment. These results provide proof of principle for the utility of 3D organoid-based modeling of sporadic Parkinson's disease in advancing therapeutic discovery.
