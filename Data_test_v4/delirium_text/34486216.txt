34486216|a|Untangling the most selective kinase inhibitors via pharmacological intervention remains one of the challenging affairs to date. In accordance to this drift, herein we describe the design and synthesis of a set of new heterocyclic analogs consisting of 6,7-dimethyl Quinoxaline, appended to a connector, employing Schiff base strategy (Compounds I-IX). The compounds were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and the kinase inhibition assay were performed on few prime members of the CMGC family namely the GSK3beta, DYRK1A and CLK1 receptors, respectively, that have been known to be directly involved in hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Interestingly the biological evaluation results revealed that Compounds IV and V, with bromo/chloro functionalities in the aromatic core were advantaged of being highly selective towards the target GSK3beta over others. To strengthen our analysis, we adopted molecular modelling studies, where compounds IV/V were redocked in the same grid 4AFJ, as that of the reference ligand, 5-aryl-4-carboxamide-1,3-oxazole. Surprisingly, our investigation underpinned that for both the compounds IV/V, a primary H-bonding existed between the designed molecules (IV/V) and Val 135 residue in the receptor GSK3beta, in line with the reference ligand. We attribute this interaction to instigate potency in the compounds. Indeed the other non-covalent interaction, between the derivative's aromatic nucleus and Arg 141/Thr 138 in the receptor GSK3beta, might have been responsible for enhancing the selectivity in the targets. Overall, we feel that the present work depicts a logical demonstration towards fine tuning the efficacy of the inhibitors through systematic adjustment of electron density at appropriate positions in the aromatic ring be it the main quinoxaline or the other aromatic nucleus. Thus this pathway offers a convenient strategy for the development of efficient therapeutics for diversified neurodegenerative diseases like that of Alzheimer's.
