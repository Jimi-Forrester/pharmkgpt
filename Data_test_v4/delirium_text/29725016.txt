29725016|a|Delta-secretase cleaves both APP and Tau to mediate the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how aging contributes to an increase in delta-secretase expression and AD pathologies remains unclear. Here we show that a CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPbeta), an inflammation-regulated transcription factor, acts as a key age-dependent effector elevating both delta-secretase (AEP) and inflammatory cytokines expression in mediating pathogenesis in AD mouse models. We find that C/EBPbeta regulates delta-secretase transcription and protein levels in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta in young 3xTg mice increases delta-secretase and accelerates the pathological features including cognitive dysfunctions, which is abolished by inactive AEP C189S. Conversely, depletion of C/EBPbeta from old 3xTg or 5XFAD mice diminishes delta-secretase and reduces AD pathologies, leading to amelioration of cognitive impairment in these AD mouse models. Thus, our findings support that C/EBPbeta plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis via increasing delta-secretase expression.
