10416034|t|Plasma ubiquinol-10 as a marker for disease: is the assay worthwhile?
10416034|a|Ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 were measured in plasma of patients with several pathologies known to be associated with increased oxidative stress. Plasma ubiquinol-10, expressed as a percentage of total ubiquinol-10 + ubiquinone-10, was found to be significantly lower in hyperlipidaemic patients and in patients with liver diseases than in age-matched control subjects. In contrast, no decrease in ubiquinol-10 was detected in plasma of patients with coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. Except for ubiquinol-10, no other lipophilic antioxidant was found to be decreased in patients with liver diseases. These data suggest that the level of ubiquinol-10 in human plasma may serve as a marker for liver dysfunction, reflecting its diminished reduction by the liver rather than increased consumption by oxidants.
