12613131|t|Age- or stage-appropriate? Recreation and the relevance of Piaget's theory in dementia care.
12613131|a|In this study, the immediate effects (within 10 minutes) of age- and stage-appropriate activities and two control activities were observed in 56 dementia sufferers. Compared with the control activities, the two experimental treatment conditions elicited greater reductions in agitation and negative emotion and increases in positive emotion and duration of activity. Stage-appropriate activity was superior to age-appropriate activity in increasing positive emotion and had about the same effect in reducing negative emotion and agitation. The study also addressed the idea that people with Alzheimer's disease may regress through Piaget's stages of cognitive development and thus display the play interests associated with each stage. There was a significant relationship between cognitive level and type of Piagetian play observed; however, Piaget's descriptions of play were not entirely appropriate for persons with with Alzheimer's disease.
