33917266|t|Emerging Role of C5 Complement Pathway in Peripheral Neuropathies: Current Treatments and Future Perspectives.
33917266|a|The complement system is a key component of innate immunity since it plays a critical role in inflammation and defense against common pathogens. However, an inappropriate activation of the complement system is involved in numerous disorders, including peripheral neuropathies. Current strategies for neuropathy-related pain fail to achieve adequate pain relief, and although several therapies are used to alleviate symptoms, approved disease-modifying treatments are unavailable. This urgent medical need is driving the development of therapeutic agents for this condition, and special emphasis is given to complement-targeting approaches. Recent evidence has underscored the importance of complement component C5a and its receptor C5aR1 in inflammatory and neuropathic pain, indicating that C5a/C5aR1 axis activation triggers a cascade of events involved in pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathy and painful neuro-inflammatory states. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this signaling in peripheral neuropathy are not fully known. Here, we provide an overview of complement pathways and major components associated with dysregulated complement activation in peripheral neuropathy, and of drugs under development targeting the C5 system. C5/C5aR1 axis modulators could represent a new strategy to treat complement-related peripheral neuropathies. Specifically, we describe novel C5aR allosteric modulators, which may potentially become new tools in the therapeutic armory against neuropathic pain.
