36570535|t|Elevated serum uric acid is associated with cognitive improvement in older American adults: A large, population-based-analysis of the NHANES database.
36570535|a|Background: The many studies revealing a connection between serum uric acid (SUA) and dementia have reported conflicting results. This study sought to investigate the relations between SUA and cognitive function in older adults. Materials and methods: The sample was 2,767 American adults aged >=60 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2014. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease test, animal fluency test, digit symbol substitution test, and composite z-score. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between SUA and cognitive function. Results: SUA level and cognitive function were significantly, positively correlated. Age significantly correlated with the association between SUA and cognitive function. Conclusion: These findings support a connection between SUA and cognition, showing a positive link between SUA and cognitive scores among older American adults. We contend that a slight rise in uric acid within the normal range is advantageous for enhanced cognition. To confirm the precise dose-time-response relation, more tests will be needed.
