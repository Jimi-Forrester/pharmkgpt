33003454|t|Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-A Good Tool to Prospectively Assess Disability after a Second Contralateral Hip Fracture?
33003454|a|The aim of this study was to determine the outcome for patients who sustain a second hip fracture compared with those who sustain a first fracture, and to define the optimal measure to evaluate functional outcome after second hip fracture. METHODS: 343 patients with acute hip fractures who presented during a 12 month period were included in the study. Patients with a first (318 patients, 78.10 +/- 7.53 years) and second (25 patients, 78.96 +/- 6.02) hip fracture were compared regarding all baseline variables. Regression analysis was also performed to assess the independent relationship between the presence of a second hip fracture and observed outcome variables at discharge (physical disability, complications, length of stay, and mortality) and one-year after surgery (physical disability and mortality). RESULTS: Disability when performing instrumentalized activities of daily living (IADL) at one-year follow-up is independently related to the presence of a second hip fracture. There were no other statistically significant relationships between the presence of a second hip fracture and other observed outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a second hip fracture showed worse functional outcome at one-year follow-up when measured with the IADL scale. No increased short-nor long-term mortality rates were found in patients with a secondary hip fracture. IADL is a good tool to assess disability after a second hip fracture and could be thus a more reliable outcome measure when investigating differences in functional recovery in patients with a second hip fracture compared to conventionally used ADL scales.
