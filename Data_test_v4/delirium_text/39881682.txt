39881682|t|Static and dynamic brain functional connectivity patterns in patients with unilateral moderate-to-severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
39881682|a|Background and purpose: Asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and vascular cognitive impairment, affecting cognitive function across multiple domains. This study aimed to explore differences in static and dynamic intrinsic functional connectivity and temporal dynamics between patients with ACS and those without carotid stenosis. Methods: We recruited 30 patients with unilateral moderate-to-severe (stenosis >= 50%) ACS and 30 demographically-matched healthy controls. All participants underwent neuropsychological testing and 3.0T brain MRI scans. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was used to calculate both static and dynamic functional connectivity. Dynamic independent component analysis (dICA) was employed to extract independent circuits/networks and to detect time-frequency modulation at the circuit level. Further imaging-behavior associations identified static and dynamic functional connectivity patterns that reflect cognitive decline. Results: ACS patients showed altered functional connectivity in multiple brain regions and networks compared to controls. Increased connectivity was observed in the inferior parietal lobule, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe. dICA further revealed changes in the temporal frequency of connectivity in the salience network. Significant differences in the temporal variability of connectivity were found in the fronto-parietal network, dorsal attention network, sensory-motor network, language network, and visual network. The temporal parameters of these brain networks were also related to overall cognition and memory. Conclusions: These results suggest that ACS involves not only changes in the static large-scale brain network connectivity but also dynamic temporal variations, which parallel overall cognition and memory recall.
