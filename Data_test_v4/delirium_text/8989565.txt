8989565|a|So far, microglial activation in cerebral ischemia has only been studied in different animal models. We have investigated the activation of microglial cells in human cerebral ischemia. As a marker for the activation of these "brain macrophages," we have used the macrophage inhibitor factor-related-proteins MRP-8 and MRP-14, which belong to the calcium binding S-100 protein family. The proteins can be detected on microglial cells in bacterial encephalitis and Alzheimer's disease but have so far not been studied in non-inflammatory diseases, in which microglial activation also occurs. Antibodies against MRP-8 and -14 detected ramified microglial cells within the first 3 days after cerebral infarction. Labeled cells were found selectively in the periinfarctional area. To support the notion that these cells belong to the locally activated resident microglial population, we studied their proliferation rate by staining the Ki-67 antigen with the antibody MIB-1. Double-labeling clearly showed that in the early phase of cerebral infarction microglial cells in the periinfarctional area express MRP-8 and -14 and also proliferate. Surprisingly, MRPs are expressed no longer than 3 days post infarction. This indicates that the activation of the resident microglia is an early step of tissue reaction after cerebral infarction. Additionally, we found evidence that microglial cells contribute to the population of phagocytes only during the first 3 days post infarction. The majority of lipid phagocytes found in the later stages are obviously recruited from the blood-borne macrophage pool.
