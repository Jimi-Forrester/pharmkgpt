38069453|t|Long way up: rethink diseases in light of phase separation and phase transition.
38069453|a|Biomolecular condensation, driven by multivalency, serves as a fundamental mechanism within cells, facilitating the formation of distinct compartments, including membraneless organelles that play essential roles in various cellular processes. Perturbations in the delicate equilibrium of condensation, whether resulting in gain or loss of phase separation, have robustly been associated with cellular dysfunction and physiological disorders. As ongoing research endeavors wholeheartedly embrace this newly acknowledged principle, a transformative shift is occurring in our comprehension of disease. Consequently, significant strides have been made in unraveling the profound relevance and potential causal connections between abnormal phase separation and various diseases. This comprehensive review presents compelling recent evidence that highlight the intricate associations between aberrant phase separation and neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and infectious diseases. Additionally, we provide a succinct summary of current efforts and propose innovative solutions for the development of potential therapeutics to combat the pathological consequences attributed to aberrant phase separation.
