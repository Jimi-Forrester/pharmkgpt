31635106|a|Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONPs) present unique properties making them one of the most used NPs in the biomedical field. Nevertheless, for many years, growing production and use of IONPs are associated with risks that can affect human and the environment. Thus, it is essential to study the effects of these nanoparticles to better understand their mechanism of action and the molecular perturbations induced in the organism. In the present study, we investigated the toxicological effects of IONPs (gamma-Fe2O3) on liver, lung and brain proteomes in Wistar rats. Exposed rats received IONP solution during 7 consecutive days by intranasal instillation at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. An iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics was used to study proteomic variations at the level of the three organs. Using this proteomic approach, we identified 1565; 1135 and 1161 proteins respectively in the brain, liver and lung. Amon them, we quantified 1541; 1125 and 1128 proteins respectively in the brain, liver and lung. Several proteins were dysregulated comparing treated samples to controls, particularly, proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, cellular metabolism, immune system stimulation, inflammation process, response to oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and neurodegenerative diseases.
