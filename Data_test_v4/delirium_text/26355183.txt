26355183|t|Antidepressants in Elderly Patients with Major and Minor Depression: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines
26355183|a|While clinical trials of antidepressants may include some individuals over the age of 65, it is not clear that evidence of safety and efficacy in such subgroup analyses are reflective of this age group more broadly. The generalizability of outcome data across populations can potentially be uncertain and the comparative efficacy of different antidepressants in older adults could potentially differ than what is seen in younger populations. As well, age-related changes that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs can affect the safety and potential harms with antidepressants in older adults. Older adults are at increased risk of anticholinergic side effects (common to a number of antidepressant classes), and orthostatic and sedative effects. These effects can exacerbate underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, delirium and can increase the risk of falls and fractures. The purpose of this Rapid Review is to summarize the evidence of clinical efficacy and harms associated with antidepressant in older adults, and guidelines regarding their use in the population.
