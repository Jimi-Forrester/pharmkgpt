37742497|a|Protein misfolding with subsequent formation of cross-beta-sheet-rich fibrils is a well-known pathological hallmark of various neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence suggests that specific protein conformations may be the primary drivers of disease progression, differentiation of which remains a challenge with conventional methods. We have previously described a unique phenomenon of light-induced fluorescence enhancement and spectral changes of the amyloid dyes K114 and BSB, and demonstrated its utility in characterizing different amyloid fibrils. In this study, we further characterize and explore the potential of photoconversion, coupled with dual-probe staining, for improved detection of heterogeneity of amyloids using silk fibers and 5xFAD mouse brain sections. BSB and K114 were paired with either Nile Red or MCAAD-3, aiming to increase the sensitivity and specificity of staining and misfolded protein detection via complementary binding and FRET. Principal component analysis of spectral data revealed significant differences between various amyloids, and was able to detect subtle amyloid pathology in the 5xFAD mouse background brain parenchyma.
