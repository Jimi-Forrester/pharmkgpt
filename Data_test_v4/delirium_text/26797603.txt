26797603|t|Statin Therapy and the Development of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy--A Rodent in Vivo Approach.
26797603|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by vascular deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) with a higher incidence of cerebral microbleeds (cMBs) and spontaneous hemorrhage. Since statins are known for their benefit in vascular disease we tested for the effect on CAA. METHODS: APP23-transgenic mice received atorvastatin-supplemented food starting at the age of eight months (n = 13), 12 months (n = 7), and 16 months (n = 6), respectively. Controls (n = 16) received standard food only. At 24 months of age cMBs were determined with T2*-weighted 9.4T magnetic resonance imaging and graded by size. RESULTS: Control mice displayed an average of 35 +- 18.5 cMBs (mean +- standard deviation), compared to 29.3 +- 9.8 in mice with eight months (p = 0.49), 24.9 +- 21.3 with 12 months (p = 0.26), and 27.8 +- 15.4 with 16 months of atorvastatin treatment (p = 0.27). In combined analysis treated mice showed lower absolute numbers (27.4 +- 15.6, p = 0.16) compared to controls and also after adjustment for cMB size (p = 0.13). CONCLUSION: Despite to a non-significant trend towards fewer cMBs our results failed to provide evidence for beneficial effects of long-term atorvastatin treatment in the APP23-transgenic mouse model of CAA. A higher risk for bleeding complications was not observed.
