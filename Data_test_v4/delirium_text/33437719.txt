33437719|a|Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, elderly individuals (with the chronological age of 65 years and above) are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection complications due to altered immune system response and the higher rate of underlying comorbidities. A vast majority of mortalities are reported in elderly patients; thus, this study aimed to evaluate complications of COVID-19 in elderly patients. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to MOOSE guidelines. Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed databases were searched for published articles related to COVID-19 in the elderly up to March 26, 2020. Search MeSh terms included "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "2019-nCoV", "SARS-CoV-2", "comorbidity", "elderly", and "geriatrics". Results: In total 1360 potentially relevant articles were screened, of which 35 were relevant and their full texts were considered for the review. Organ damages to the pulmonary system, cardiovascular, liver, and renal system are more prevalent in the elderly with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the chance of multiorgan involvement is more common among elderly patients, preventive, multidisciplinary, and holistic evaluations are essential to reduce disease consequences. Conclusion: More attention needs to be paid to elderly individuals in the quarantine. Social contact should be made and maintained through online facilities, media, and phone calls to ensure patients' mental health during this stressful situation. Also, they should be provided with enough food and medications by their families or friends. Also, providing social and volunteer services might play an important role in the mental health of those patients who have no social network.
