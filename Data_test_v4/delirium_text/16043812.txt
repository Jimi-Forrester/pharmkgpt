16043812|t|Familial Alzheimer disease: decreases in CSF Abeta42 levels precede cognitive decline.
16043812|a|CSF amyloid beta-peptide 42 (Abeta42) levels in presymptomatic subjects with pathogenic mutations in the PS1 gene are significantly lower than in an age-matched control group. Consequently, in these subjects, there is a window of opportunity estimated as at least 4 to 12 years to evaluate the ability of any putative prophylactic therapy to decrease, arrest, or reverse abnormalities in Abeta42 metabolism many years before clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease are otherwise likely to occur.
