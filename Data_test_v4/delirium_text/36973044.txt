36973044|t|Accelerated Brain Volume Loss Caused by Anti-beta-Amyloid Drugs: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
36973044|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate brain volume changes caused by different sub-classes of anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) drugs trialled in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Clinicaltrial.gov databases were searched for clinical trials of anti-Abeta drugs. This systematic review and meta-analysis included adults enrolled in randomized controlled trials of anti-Abeta drugs (n=8062 to 10279). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) randomized controlled trials of patients treated with anti-Abeta drugs that have demonstrated to favourably change at least one biomarker of pathological Abeta; and (2) detailed MRI data sufficient to assess the volumetric changes in at least one brain region. MRI brain volumes were used as the primary outcome measure; brain regions commonly reported include the hippocampus, lateral ventricle and whole brain. Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) were investigated when reported in clinical trials. Of the 145 trials reviewed, 31 were included in the final analyses. RESULTS: A meta-analysis on the highest dose of each trial on hippocampus, ventricle, and whole brain revealed drug-induced acceleration of volume changes that varied by anti-Abeta drug class. Secretase inhibitors accelerated atrophy to the hippocampus (mean difference: -37.1 microL [-19.6% relative to change in placebo]; 95% confidence interval: -47.0 to -27.1) and whole brain (-3.3mL [-21.8% relative to change in placebo]; 95% confidence interval: -4.1 to 2.5). Conversely, ARIA-inducing monoclonal antibodies accelerated ventricular enlargement (mean difference: +2.1mL [+38.7% relative to change in placebo]; 95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 2.8) where a striking correlation between ventricular volume and ARIA frequency was observed (r=0.86, p=6.22x10-7). Mild Cognitively Impaired participants treated with anti-Abeta drugs were projected to have a material regression toward brain volumes typical of Alzheimer's dementia ~8 months earlier than if they were untreated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the potential for anti-Abeta therapies to compromise long-term brain health by accelerating brain atrophy, and provide new insight into the adverse impact of ARIA. Six recommendations emerge from these findings.
