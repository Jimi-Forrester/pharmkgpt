37528989|a|Background: When methadone is used to treat cancer pain, the Japanese health insurance system recommends to determine the starting dose according to the equivalency conversion table based on the morphine-equivalent daily dose (MEDD) of prior opioids proposed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Owing to the wide range in variability of the conversion table, methadone increases the incidence of daytime sleepiness. Objective: To identify the factors associated with daytime sleepiness and propose a conversion ratio from pretreatment MEDD to oral methadone that decreases the risk of daytime sleepiness. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: One hundred patients who started oral methadone to relieve cancer pain at Ashiya Municipal Hospital (Hyogo, Japan) from January 1, 2013, to August 31, 2022, were enrolled. Measurements: The primary endpoint, the conversion ratio from pretreatment MEDD to oral methadone without daytime sleepiness, was determined using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The incidence of daytime sleepiness within seven days of methadone initiation was 40.0%. The factors identified as contributing to daytime sleepiness were pretreatment MEDD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.941, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.916-0.966, p <0.001) and methadone dose (OR: 1.395, 95% CI: 1.178-1.652, p <0.001). The conversion ratio from pretreatment MEDD to oral methadone was 0.24, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.909 (p <0.001). Conclusions: Daytime sleepiness developed when methadone dose is high relative to pretreatment MEDD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest the conversion ratio from pretreatment MEDD to oral methadone without causing daytime sleepiness.
