31278012|t|Animal Models of Psychosis in Alzheimer Disease.
31278012|a|Psychosis in Alzheimer Disease (AD) represents a distinct clinicopathologic variant associated with increased cognitive and functional morbidity and an accelerated disease course. To date, extant treatments offer modest benefits with significant risks. The development of new pharmacologic treatments for psychosis in AD would be facilitated by validated preclinical models with which to test candidate interventions. The current review provides a brief summary of the process of validating animal models of human disease together with a critical analysis of the challenges posed in attempting to apply those standards to AD-related behavioral models. An overview of phenotypic analogues of human cognitive and behavioral impairments, with an emphasis on those relevant to psychosis, in AD-related mouse models is provided, followed by an update on recent progress in efforts to translate findings in the pathophysiology of psychotic AD into novel models. Finally, some future directions are suggested to expand the catalogue of psychosis-relevant phenotypes that may provide a sturdier framework for model development and targets for preclinical treatment outcomes.
