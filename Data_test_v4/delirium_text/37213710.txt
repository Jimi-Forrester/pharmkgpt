37213710|a|OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain or spine examines the findings as well as the time interval between the onset of symptoms and other adverse effects in coronavirus disease that first appeared in 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The goal of this study is to look at studies that use neuroimaging to look at neurological and neuroradiological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We try to put together all of the research on how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes neurological symptoms and cognitive-behavioral changes and give a full picture. RESULTS: We have categorized neuroimaging findings into subtitles such as: headache and dizziness; cerebrovascular complications after stroke; Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH); Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs); encephalopathy; meningitis; encephalitis and myelitis; altered mental status (AMS) and delirium; seizure; neuropsychiatric symptoms; Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and its variants; smell and taste disorders; peripheral neuropathy; Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); and myopathy and myositis. CONCLUSION: In this review study, we talked about some MRI findings that show how COVID-19 affects the nervous system based on what we found.
