39522061|t|Family perspectives on delirium information provision in an inpatient setting.
39522061|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is common in older hospitalised patients and is associated with significant distress in family members who witness it. Education-based interventions can support the family of people with delirium. This study aimed to understand the perspective of family members of people with delirium regarding the information they received and opportunities for improvement. METHODS: We performed 10 semi-structured interviews of 11 family members (one mother-daughter dyad) of people with delirium greater than 65 years of age across two sub-acute Geriatric Evaluation and Management units in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were inductively analysed by the lead investigator to identify themes related to the information provided and opportunities for improvement. RESULTS: We identified three themes related to delirium information provision: (1) delirium knowledge is not common; (2) information should consider the broad complex of the person; and (3) lived experience of delirium was helpful. We identified five themes with regard to opportunities to improve delirium information provision: (1) Good communication skills are important; (2) Regular communication is helpful; (3) Family wish to be present and know how to be involved; (4) Information provision should include prognosis; (5) Written information can support verbal information. CONCLUSIONS: Information provision to family members should take into account their existing knowledge and experience and consider their family member as a whole. High quality, regular, written and oral communication from health-care professionals is likely to prove helpful.
