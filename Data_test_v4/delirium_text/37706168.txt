37706168|t|Assessing the impact of palliative care admission of end-of-life cancer adults.
37706168|a|Background: There is evidence that early admission to the palliative care (PC) program in adult cancer patients improves symptoms management, reduces unplanned hospital admissions, minimizes aggressive cancer treatments, and enables patients to make decisions about their end-of-life (EOL) care. Objectives: This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether late admission to a PC program is associated with aggressive treatment at the EOL in adult patients with oncological diseases from their admission until death. Design/Methods: The study evaluated the aggressiveness in EOL management in patients with advanced stage oncological diseases who died between 2017 and 2019. The study population was divided into two groups based on the time of admission to the PC program. Aggressiveness at the EOL was measured using five criteria: treatment, hospital admission and duration, emergency department care, and/or intensive care unit utilization. Results: The study found a significant difference in the rate of aggressive EOL treatments between late admission to PC care and early admission [adjusted EOL 79.6% versus 70.4%; relative risk (RR): 1.98, 90% CI: 1.08-3.59, p: 0.061]; In the analysis of secondary variables, a significant association was observed between early admission to PC and the suspension of active treatments at the EOL, leading to a decrease in aggressiveness (77% versus 55.8%; RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.14-1.67, p: 0.004). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that early referral to PC services is associated with less aggressive treatment at the EOL, including suspension of active treatments.
