35499254|t|Characterizing Cognition in Everyday Life of Older Adults With Subjective Cognitive Decline.
35499254|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the subjective experience of worsening cognition with no objective cognitive impairment, poses a heightened risk for dementia. This study aimed to characterize cognition in the everyday life of people with SCD, is crucial for understanding and preventing further functional and cognitive decline. One hundred and thirty-five older adults (age 70.7+-6.7) with SCD were assessed using functional-cognition measures: Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version (BRIEF-A), and Multiple Errands Test (MET). The resulted showed that older adults with SCD reported lower memory satisfaction (Hedges's g = 0.41) on the MMQ, and worse metacognition on the BRIEF-A (Hedges's g = 0.63) compared with published normative data. They completed an average of only 6/12 required tasks on the MET. The findings show functional difficulties related to SCD and inform the development of occupational therapy intervention for this population.
