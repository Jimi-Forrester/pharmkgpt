33606037|t|Darier Disease - A Multi-organ Condition?
33606037|a|Darier disease is a severe, rare autosomal dominant inherited skin condition caused by mutations in the ATP2A2 gene encoding sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Since sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 is expressed in most tissues, and intracellular calcium homeostasis is of fundamental importance, it is conceivable that other organs besides the skin may be involved in Darier disease. This review focusses on the association of Darier disease with other organ dysfunctions and diseases, emphasizing their common molecular pathology. In conclusion, Darier disease should be considered a systemic condition that requires systemic and disease mechanism targeted treatments.
