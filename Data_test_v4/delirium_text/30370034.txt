30370034|a|Several studies have reported that minimally- invasive total hip arthroplasty (MISTHA) may significantly reduce postoperative pain and results in faster postoperative rehabilitation when compared with the traditional lateral or posterior approach. Regarding bilateral hip osteoarthritis, there is still no consensus whether simultaneous bilateral MIS-THA can be established as the treatment of choice. Therefore, we searched the international databases of Pubmed, Medline, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using the key words minimally invasive bilateral total hip arthroplasty. From the initial 23 articles we found five clinical studies which met our inclusion criteria. From the perspective of possible intra- and postoperative complications, one-stage bilateral MIS THA was equally safe or safer than two-stage interventions. In addition, from a clinical outcome perspective, the one-stage procedure can be considered to be preferable. Higher blood transfusion requirements, which were expected following the standard bilateral simultaneous THA, seemed to be minimized with the simultaneous bilateral MIS THA. The supine position of the patient minimized the mean operation time. Approaches using the lateral decubitus position of the patient should be avoided in simultaneous bilateral THA due to the increased operation time. There is a lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials, comparing simultaneous bilateral MIS THA with staged bilateral MIS THA. Although simultaneous bilateral MIS THA seems to be efficacious, cost-effective and safe, more clinical trials are required to establish its superiority over the sequential MIS THA.
