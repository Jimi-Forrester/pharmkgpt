35754792|t|TMED2/9/10 Serve as Biomarkers for Poor Prognosis in Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma.
35754792|a|Background: Head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high incidence and poor prognosis. Transmembrane emp24 structural domain (TMED) proteins are involved in protein transport and vesicle budding processes, which have implicated various malignancies' progression. However, the roles of TMEDs in HNSC, especially in terms of development and prognosis, have not been fully elucidated. Methods: We applied TIMER 2.0, UALCAN, GEPIA 2, Kaplan-Meier plotter, GEO, The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), cBioPortal, Linkedomics, Metascape, GRNdb, STRING, and Cytoscape to investigate the roles of TMED family members in HNSC. Results: Compared with normal tissues, the mRNA expression levels of TMED1/2/4/5/7/8/9/10 were significantly increased in the TCGA HNSC dataset. And we combined GEPIA 2 and Kaplan-Meier Plotter to select TMED2/9/10 with prognostic value. Then we detected the levels of mRNA in the GEO HNSC database and the protein expression in HPA. It was found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of TMED2/9/10 were increased in HNSC. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that TMED2/9/10 and their co-expressed genes promoted the malignant behavior of tumors by participating in biological processes such as intracellular transferase complex, protein transport, focal adhesion, intracellular protein processing. Single-cell analysis and immune infiltration analysis suggested that immune responses of cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells might be associated with prognosis. Finally, the transcription factors-genes network and protein-protein functional interaction network pointed to genes such as X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and TMED7, which might cooperate with TMED2/9/10 to change the progression of HNSC. Conclusions: Our study implied that TMED2/9/10 and related genes mightjointly affect the prognosis of HNSC, providing specific clues for further experimental research, personalized diagnosis strategies, and targeted clinical therapy for HNSC.
