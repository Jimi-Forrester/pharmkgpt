38535505|t|Quantitative Proteomics Reveal Region-Specific Alterations in Neuroserpin-Deficient Mouse Brain and Retina: Insights into Serpini1 Function.
38535505|a|Neural regeneration and neuroprotection represent strategies for future management of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or glaucoma. However, the complex molecular mechanisms that are involved in neuroprotection are not clearly understood. A promising candidate that maintains neuroprotective signaling networks is neuroserpin (Serpini1), a serine protease inhibitor expressed in neurons which selectively inhibits extracellular tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasmin and plays a neuroprotective role during ischemic brain injury. Abnormal function of this protein has been implicated in several conditions including stroke, glaucoma, AD, and familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB). Here, we explore the potential biochemical roles of Serpini1 by comparing proteome changes between neuroserpin-deficient (NS-/-) and control mice, in the retina (RE), optic nerve (ON), frontal cortex (FC), visual cortex (VC), and cerebellum (CB). To achieve this, a multiple-plex quantitative proteomics approach using isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) technology was employed followed by functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis. We detected around 5000 proteins in each tissue and a pool of 6432 quantified proteins across all regions, resulting in a pool of 1235 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering highlighted similarities and differences in the retina compared to various brain regions, as well as differentiating NS-/- proteome signatures from control samples. The visual cortex revealed the highest number of DEPs, followed by cerebellar regions. Pathway analysis unveiled region-specific changes, including visual perception, focal adhesion, apoptosis, glutamate receptor activation, and supramolecular fiber organization in RE, ON, FC, VC, and CB, respectively. These novel findings provide comprehensive insights into the region-specific networking of Serpini1 in the central nervous system, further characterizing its potential role as a neuroprotective agent.
