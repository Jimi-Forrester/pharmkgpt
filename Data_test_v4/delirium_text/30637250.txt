30637250|a|BACKGROUND: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a complex surgical procedure with a high morbidity rate. The serious complications are major risk factors for poor long-term surgical outcome. Studies have reported an association between early postoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and prediction of severe complications after abdominal surgery. However, there have been no studies on the use of early postoperative PNI for predicting serious complications following PD. AIM: To analyze the risk factors and early postoperative PNI for predicting severe complications following PD. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 238 patients who underwent PD at our hospital between January 2007 and December 2017. The postoperative complications were classified according to the Dindo-Clavien classification. Grade III-V postoperative complications were classified as serious. The risk factors for serious complications were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall complications were detected in 157 of 238 patients (65.9%) who underwent PD. The grade III-V complication rate was 26.47% (63/238 patients). The mortality rate was 3.7% (9/238 patients). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative serum albumin [odds ratio (OR): 0.883, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.96; P < 0.01] and PNI on postoperative day 3 < 40.5 (OR: 2.77, 95%CI: 1.21-6.38, P < 0.05) were independent factors associated with grade III-V postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: Perioperative albumin is an important factor associated with serious complications following PD. Low early postoperative PNI (< 40.5) is a predictor for serious complications.
