37438638|t|Extracellular Vesicles Play a Central Role in Cerebral Venous Disease-Associated Brain Atrophy.
37438638|a|Cerebral venous abnormalities, distinct from traditional arterial diseases, have been linked to brain atrophy in a previous community-based cohort study, specifically in relation to the reduction of deep medullary veins (r-DMVs). To better understand the properties and biological functions of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cerebral venous disease-associated brain atrophy, EVs are extracted from the serum of both participants with r-DMV and normal controls and analyzed their proteomic profiles using Tandem Mass Tag label quantitation analysis. Phenotypic experiments showed that EVs from individuals with r-DMVs are able to disrupt the normal functions of neurons, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, and induce A1 reactive astrocytes. Additionally, this study provided a comprehensive characterization of the proteomic profile of DMV EVs and found that the collagen hydroxyproline is upregulated, while complement C3 is downregulated in the r-DMV group, suggesting that r-DMV may not be a simple pathological phenomenon and highlighting the potential involvement of EVs in the progression of brain atrophy in r-DMVs which has implications for the development of future therapeutic strategies.
