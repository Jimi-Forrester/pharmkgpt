9200512|t|Immunoreactivity of presenilin-1 in human, rat and mouse brain.
9200512|a|Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) D3G6 and C8A5, specific for amino acid residues 160-168 of S182 protein, immunolabeled neurons, ependymal and choroid plexus cells, and myocytes in brain sections from normal subjects and people with Alzheimer disease or Down syndrome and in rats and mice. Oligodendroglia, microglia, and the majority of astrocytes were negative. S182 protein or a fragment of the protein detected with these mAbs is not a constituent of amyloid-beta deposits or tangles.
