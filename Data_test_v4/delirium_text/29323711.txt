29323711|a|Since the success of combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1-infected individuals are now living much longer. This increased life expectancy is accompanied by a higher prevalence of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders. Rising too is the incidence in these patients of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease such as increased deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta). Although neurons are major sources of Abeta in the brain, astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells, therefore, even a small level of astrocytic Abeta metabolism could make a significant contribution to brain pathology. Neprilysin (NEP) is a decisive/crucial regulator of Abeta levels. We evaluated the effects of HIV-1 on Abeta deposition and the expression and activity of NEP in primary human astrocytes. Specifically, no differences in intracellular amyloid deposits were found between infected and control cells. However, primary cultures of infected astrocytes showed more extracellular Abeta levels compared to controls. This was accompanied by reduced expression of NEP and to a significant decrease in its activity. These results indicate that the presence of HIV-1 in the brain could contribute to the increase in the total burden of cerebral Abeta.
