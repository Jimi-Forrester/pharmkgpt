33126411|t|The Role of PPARs in Disease.
33126411|a|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors that function as ligand-activated transcription factors. They exist in three isoforms: PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma. For all PPARs, lipids are endogenous ligands, linking them directly to metabolism. PPARs form heterodimers with retinoic X receptors, and upon ligand binding, they modulate the gene expression of downstream target genes, depending on the presence of co-repressors or co-activators. This results in a complex, cell type-specific regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. PPARs are linked to metabolic disorders and are interesting pharmaceutical targets. PPARalpha and PPARgamma agonists are already in clinical use for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes, respectively. More recently, PPARbeta/delta activation came into focus as an interesting novel approach for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and associated cardiovascular diseases; however, this has been limited due to the highly controversial function of PPARbeta/delta in cancer. This Special Issue of Cells brings together the most recent advances in understanding the various aspects of the action of PPARs, and it provides new insights into our understanding of PPARs, implying also the latest therapeutic perspectives for the utility of PPAR modulation in different disease settings.
