33211726|a|AIMS: To identify the types of nasogastric/nasoenteric tube (NGT/NET)-related adverse events and to analyze the degree of harm and the factors associated with mechanical device-related complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from October 2017 to April 2019 in seven Brazilian hospitals. Data from 447 adult patients with NGT/NET were collected through electronic forms. Three methods were used to assess the NGT/NET-related adverse events: (1) encouraging spontaneous reports; (2) regular visits to the wards; and (3) review of medical records. The events were classified as mechanical device-related complications and other events. The degree of harm was classified according to the World Health Organization's International Classification for Patient Safety. Data were analyzed using the R program, version 3.5.3. The following tests were applied to identify associations between the explanatory and response variables: Cochran-Armitage Chi-Square test, Fisher's exact test, and Linear-by-linear Chi-Square test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to verify the predictors of mechanical device-related complications. All analyses were performed considering a 5% significance level. RESULTS: 191 NGT/NET-related adverse events were identified in 116 patients; the majority were mechanical device-related complications and resulted in mild harm to the patient. At the moment of the event, patients had a mean of 3.27 comorbidities, were highly dependent on nursing care, with high risk of death and altered level of consciousness. There was no association between the degree of harm and the care complexity, disease severity or level of consciousness. Intensive care was the strongest predictor for mechanical device-related complications and critical patients had a four times greater likelihood of presenting this type of event when compared to patients receiving minimal care. CONCLUSION: Intensive care patients should receive special attention as the complexity of care is an important predictor for mechanical device-related complications in tube fed patients.
