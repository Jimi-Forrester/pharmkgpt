35795205|t|Association of Vitamin D Anabolism-Related Gene Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Uterine Leiomyomas.
35795205|a|Background: Uterine leiomyomas (ULs) is the most common gynecological benign tumor in women. Our previous study showed that the phenomenon of vitamin D deficiency existed in patients with ULs. However, the association of vitamin D anabolism-related gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to ULs was unclear. Methods: Vitamin D anabolism-related gene polymorphisms in 110 patients with ULs and 110 healthy controls were detected by sequencing and the differences of the 92 SNPs were analyzed in the two groups via chi-square test. To verify the association between the significantly different SNPs and the risk of ULs, the SNPs were genotyped in another 340 patients and 340 healthy controls. Additionally, an unconditional logistic regression model was conducted to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of ULs occurrence and the 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for age and BMI. Findings: In sequencing samples, there were differences in DHCR7 rs1044482 C > T (p = 0.008) and NADSYN1 rs2276360 G > C (p = 0.025) between patients with ULs and healthy controls. DHCR7 rs1044482 was related to the susceptibility to ULs in validation samples (heterogeneous: adjusted OR = 1.967, p = 0.002; homogenous: adjusted OR = 2.494, p = 0.002; additive: adjusted OR = 1.485, p < 0.041; and dominant: adjusted OR = 2.084, p < 0.001). Stratified analysis further showed that the DHCR7 rs1044482 polymorphisms were associated with ULs risks in women over 40 and with 18.5-25.0 BMI. In contrast to the wild-type CG haplotype vectors, individuals with TC haplotypes had a higher risk of developing ULs. Interpretation: The vitamin D anabolism-related gene DHCR7 rs1044482 C > T polymorphism was a risk factor of ULs, especially in patients over 40 with 18.5-25.0 BMI, while the relationship between NADSYN1 rs2276360 and ULs risk was not clear.
