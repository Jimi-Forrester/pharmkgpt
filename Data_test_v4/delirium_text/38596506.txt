38596506|t|It is not "just a fracture".
38596506|a|In their recent population-based study of nearly 100 000 patients from Ontario, Canada, who had suffered a fracture, Vincent et al. characterized postfracture survival rates. Their findings showed that overall survival was decreased particularly following fractures of the hip or vertebrae, and was worse in men and the oldest old. They found that relative survival, particularly after hip fracture, is strikingly poor with less than one-third of men and one-half of women surviving for 5 years following hip fracture, survival which was far less than that seen for patients afflicted by both prostate and breast cancers. Importantly, mortality risk increased immediately after fracture occurrence and was highest within 1 month of fracture. Collectively, their data suggest that a short, critical window may exist immediately following fracture in which application of interventions to improve survival is likely to be of greatest value. Future work is urgently needed to identify the best approaches to employ during this critical time period in order to optimize survival in patients who have suffered a fracture.
