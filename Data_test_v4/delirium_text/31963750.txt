31963750|t|Neurofilaments: The C-Reactive Protein of Neurology.
31963750|a|Neurofilaments (NFs) are quickly becoming the biomarkers of choice in the field of neurology, suggesting their use as an unspecific screening marker, much like the use of elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) in other fields. With sensitive techniques being readily available, evidence is growing regarding the diagnostic and prognostic value of NFs in many neurological disorders. Here, we review the latest literature on the structure and function of NFs and report the strengths and pitfalls of NFs as markers of neurodegeneration in the context of neurological diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
