33266366|t|Structure-Based Inhibitor Discovery of Class I Histone Deacetylases (HDACs).
33266366|a|Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are promising targets for epigenetic therapies for a range of diseases such as cancers, inflammations, infections and neurological diseases. Although six HDAC inhibitors are now licensed for clinical treatments, they are all pan-inhibitors with little or no HDAC isoform selectivity, exhibiting undesirable side effects. A major issue with the currently available HDAC inhibitors is that they have limited specificity and target multiple deacetylases. Except for HDAC8, Class I HDACs (1, 2 and 3) are recruited to large multiprotein complexes to function. Therefore, there are rising needs to develop new, hopefully, therapeutically efficacious HDAC inhibitors with isoform or complex selectivity. Here, upon the introduction of the structures of Class I HDACs and their complexes, we provide an up-to-date overview of the structure-based discovery of Class I HDAC inhibitors, including pan-, isoform-selective and complex-specific inhibitors, aiming to provide an insight into the discovery of additional HDAC inhibitors with greater selectivity, specificity and therapeutic utility.
