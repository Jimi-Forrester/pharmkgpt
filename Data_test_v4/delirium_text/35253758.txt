35253758|t|Capgras Syndrome as the Core Manifestation of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.
35253758|a|Capgras syndrome (CS) was usually considered a symptom of a functional disorder in the young, most commonly schizophrenia, or an organic disorder in the elderly. The occurrence of CS among early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is extremely rare. We describe a case in which the unrecognition of CS as part of EOAD resulted in a wrong psychiatric diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. This paper aims to acknowledge CS as an early or core manifestation and highlight EOAD as a differential diagnosis of mental disorders in young people, even without a remarkable family history.
