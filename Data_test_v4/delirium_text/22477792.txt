22477792|t|Dexmedetomidine to control agitation and delirium from toxic ingestions in adolescents.
22477792|a|Dexmedetomidine is an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the provision of short term (less than 24 hours) sedation of adults during mechanical ventilation. Given its beneficial physiologic effects including sedation and anxiolysis, various applications have been reported in the pediatric-aged patient. We report the use of dexmedetomidine to control the agitation and violent behavior which resulted from the ingestion of illicit drugs in 3 adolescents. The utility of dexmedetomidine in these scenarios is discussed and its potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular and respiratory function are reviewed.
