34973075|t|Nocebo effect in multiple system atrophy: systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials.
34973075|a|BACKGROUND: Nocebo effect is prevalent among neurological diseases, resulting in low adherence and treatment outcome. We sought to examine the nocebo effect in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in multiple system atrophy (MSA). METHODS: We searched RCTs in MSA from Medline since September, 2021. RCTs for drug treatment conducted in adult MSA patients with more than 5 cases in each treatment arm were included. We assessed the number of dropout due to placebo intolerance. We also did a symptomatic/disease-modifying subgroup analysis based on two different treatment purposes. The STATA software was used for statistical analysis. Overall heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q and I2. RESULTS: Data were extracted from 11 RCTs fulfilling our search criteria. Of 540 placebo-treated patients, 64.2% reported at least one adverse event (AE) and 7.5% reported dropout because of AEs. The chance of dropping out because of an AE and experiencing at least one AE did not differ between placebo and active drug treatment arms. Besides, the pooled nocebo dropout rate in the symptomatic subgroup was similar to that of the disease-modifying subgroup. CONCLUSION: In MSA RCTs, nocebo dropout rate was not at a low level among neurological disorders. Nocebo effect was an important reason of dropout because of AE in placebo and active drug treatment arms. Different treatment purposes may not influence nocebo effect.
