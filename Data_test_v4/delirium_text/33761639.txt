33761639|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications after abdominal surgery are high, and there is no reliable intervention program to prevent them. Some studies have pointed out that early postoperative activities have advantages in preventing the occurrence of complications, but lack of evidence-based basis. The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the effect of nursing intervention is guiding early postoperative activities on the rapid recovery of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. METHODS: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and Chinese Biomedical Database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library will be searched by computer, and a randomized controlled study is conducted on early participation in exercise programs after abdominal surgery from the establishment of the database to January 2021. The language is limited to English and Chinese. The quality of the included study is independently extracted and the literature quality is evaluated by 2 researchers, and the included literature is analyzed by Meta using RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: This study will evaluate the effect of nursing intervention is guiding early postoperative activities on the rapid rehabilitation of patients undergoing abdominal surgery through the indexes of postoperative quality of life score, the incidence of complications, mortality, length of stay and so on. CONCLUSION: This study will provide reliable evidence-based basis for establishing a reasonable and effective postoperative activity guidance program for patients undergoing abdominal surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Private information from individuals will not be published. This systematic review also does not involve endangering participant rights. Ethical approval will not be required. The results may be published in a peer-reviewed journal or disseminated at relevant conferences. OSF REGISTRATION NUMBER: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/59MD4.
