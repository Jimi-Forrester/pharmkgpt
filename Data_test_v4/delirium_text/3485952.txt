3485952|a|The ability to mimic skilled movements or to pantomime them in response to spoken command was compared with psychometric performance and with regional glucose utilization as estimated by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in 17 right-handed patients with Alzheimer's disease and 6 age-matched normal subjects. Apraxia scores, both on tests to command and to imitation, were significantly lower in the Alzheimer patients. Imitation scores correlated best with performance on tests of visual--spatial ability and with cortical metabolism in the right parietal lobe; command scores related most closely with the results of tests reflecting verbal proficiency and with cortical metabolism in the left inferior hemisphere, especially frontally. Apraxia to command and imitation may thus reflect neuronal dysfunction in distinct cerebral regions in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
