38513821|a|BACKGROUND: This study explores Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) as a potential non-invasive treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing on its impact on cognitive functions and behavioral symptoms. METHODS: In a prospective, one-arm open-label trial, ten patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD were assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire, and Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. Assessments occurred at 30- and 90-days post-treatment. The TPS protocol consisted of 10 sessions over five weeks, using the Neurolith  device to deliver 6000 focused shockwave pulses at 0.25 mJ/mm2 and a frequency of 4 Hz. RESULTS: TPS significantly reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms, with NPI scores decreasing by 23.9 points (95% CI: -39.19 to -8.61, p = 0.0042) after 30 days, and by 18.9 points (95% CI: -33.49 to -2.91, p = 0.022) after 90 days. These changes had large effect sizes (Cohen's dz = 1.43 and dz = 0.94, respectively). A decreasing trend was observed in the ADAS-Cog score (-3.6, 95% CI: -7.18 to 0.00, p = 0.05) after 90 days, indicating a potential reduction in cognitive impairment, though not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The preliminary results indicate that TPS treatment leads to significant improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients, showing promise as a therapeutic approach for AD. Further research is needed to fully establish its effectiveness, especially concerning cognitive functions.
