30487866|a|Background/Objective: Diseases of the cardiovascular system and depression are common, and they often coexist, significantly deteriorating the quality of life. Another factor influencing vital functions is impairment of cognitive functions occurring in patients with heart failure (HF). Deficits of different degrees of severity have been observed within a variety of cognitive domains. Cognitive deficits, which may impair daily functioning, hinder adaptation to the disease and worsen prognosis, are also observed in depression. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the quality of life, the severity of depressive disorders and disorders of certain executive functions, and memory in patients with severe, stable heart failure. Method: The study group consisted of 50 patients with stable, severe heart failure and 50 appropriately selected patients with coronary heart disease, without heart failure. Results: The results of cognitive tests are significantly lower in the HF group than in the control group. In the HF group, a significantly lower quality of life, as well as a higher result in the BDI-II test, was observed. No influence of cognitive disorders on the reduction in the quality of life was demonstrated. The factor that significantly affects the quality of life is the intensification of depression symptoms. Conclusions: The factor that significantly affects the quality of life is the intensification of depression symptoms.
