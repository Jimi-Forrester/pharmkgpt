38451820|t|Protocol to measure apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD specks in human cerebrospinal fluid via imaging flow cytometry.
38451820|a|Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a c-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) specks are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRDs) patients. Here, we present a flow cytometry protocol to quantify ASC specks. We describe steps for fluorescently labeling ASC specks using antibody technology, visualizing with imaging flow cytometry, and gating based on physical characteristics. CSF ASC specks levels positively correlate with phosphorylated tau (Thr181) and negatively correlate with amyloid beta ratio (42/40), thus serving as a neuroinflammatory biomarker for diagnosing AD/ADRDs. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Jiang et al.1.
