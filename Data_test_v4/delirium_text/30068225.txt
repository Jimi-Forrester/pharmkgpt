30068225|t|Mild Cognitive Impairment in Clinical Practice: A Review Article.
30068225|a|The spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly ranges from what can be classified as normal cognitive decline with aging to subjective cognitive impairment to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. This article reviewed the up-to-date evidence of MCI including the diagnostic criteria of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease, vascular cognitive impairment and MCI due to Parkinson disease, management and preventive intervention of MCI. There are various etiologies of MCI, and a large number of studies have been conducted to ascertain the practical modalities of preserving cognition in predementia stages. Lifestyle modification, such as aerobic exercise, is an approved modality to preserve cognitive ability and decrease the rate of progression to dementia, as well as being recommended for frailty prevention.
