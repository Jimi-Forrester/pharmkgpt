24103729|a|Prefibrillar assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major event underlying the development of neuropathology and dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study determined the neuroprotective properties of an orally bioavailable Abeta synaptotoxicity inhibitor, SEN1576. Binding of SEN1576 to monomeric Abeta 1-42 was measured using surface plasmon resonance. Thioflavin-T and MTT assays determined the ability of SEN1576 to block Abeta 1-42-induced aggregation and reduction in cell viability, respectively. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) determined effects on synaptic toxicity induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of cell-derived Abeta oligomers. An operant behavioural schedule measured effects of oral administration following i.c.v. injection of Abeta oligomers in normal rats. SEN1576 bound to monomeric Abeta 1-42, protected neuronal cells exposed to Abeta 1-42, reduced deficits in in vivo LTP and behaviour. SEN1576 exhibits the necessary features of a drug candidate for further development as a disease modifying treatment for the early stages of AD-like dementia.
