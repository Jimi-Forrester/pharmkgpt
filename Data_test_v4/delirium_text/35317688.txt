35317688|t|Food bioactives lowering risks of chronic diseases induced by fine particulate air pollution: a comprehensive review.
35317688|a|Airborne particulate matter (PM) exerts huge negative impacts on human health worldwide, not only targeting the respiratory system but more importantly inducing and aggravating associated chronic diseases like asthma, lung cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer diseases. Food-derived bioactive compounds like vitamins, dietary polyphenols, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and sulforaphane are feasible alternative therapeutic approaches against PM-mediated potential health damages, drawing great attention in recent years. In this review, the association between PM exposure and risks of developing chronic diseases, and the detailed mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of PM will be discussed. Subsequently, principal food-derived bioactive compounds, with emphasize on the preventative or protective effects against PM, along with potential mechanisms will be elucidated. This comprehensive review will discuss and present current research findings to reveal the nutritional intervention as a preventative or therapeutic strategy against ambient air pollution, thereby lowering the risk of developing chronic diseases.
