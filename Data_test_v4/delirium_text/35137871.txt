35137871|t|ELMO, a new helmet interface for CPAP to treat COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure outside the ICU: a feasibility study.
35137871|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using a new helmet interface for CPAP, designated ELMO, to treat COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) outside the ICU. METHODS: This was a proof-of-concept study involving patients with moderate to severe AHRF secondary to COVID-19 admitted to the general ward of a public hospital. The intervention consisted of applying CPAP via the ELMO interface integrated with oxygen and compressed air flow meters (30 L/min each) and a PEEP valve (CPAP levels = 8-10 cmH2O), forming the ELMOcpap system. The patients were monitored for cardiorespiratory parameters, adverse events, and comfort. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study protocol. The ELMOcpap system was well tolerated, with no relevant adverse effects. Its use was feasible outside the ICU for a prolonged amount of time and was shown to be successful in 60% of the patients. A CPAP of 10 cmH2O with a total gas flow of 56-60 L/min improved oxygenation after 30-to 60-min ELMOcpap sessions, allowing a significant decrease in estimated FIO2 (p = 0.014) and an increase in estimated PaO2/FIO2 ratio (p = 0.008) within the first hour without CO2 rebreathing. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ELMOcpap has proven to be feasible and effective in delivering high-flow CPAP to patients with COVID-19-related AHRF outside the ICU. There were no major adverse effects, and ELMO was considered comfortable. ELMOcpap sessions significantly improved oxygenation, reducing FIO2 without CO2 rebreathing. The overall success rate was 60% in this pilot study, and further clinical trials should be carried out in the future.(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04470258 [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/]).
