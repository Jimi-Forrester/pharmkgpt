33571811|t|Chalcone and its analogs: Therapeutic and diagnostic applications in Alzheimer's disease.
33571811|a|Chalcone [(E)-1,3-diphenyl-2-propene-1-one], a small molecule with alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl group is a precursor or component of many natural flavonoids and isoflavonoids. It is one of the privileged structures in medicinal chemistry. It possesses a wide range of biological activities encouraging many medicinal chemists to study this scaffold for its usefulness to oncology, infectious diseases, virology and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Small molecular size, convenient and cost-effective synthesis, and flexibility for modifications to modulate lipophilicity suitable for blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability make chalcones a preferred candidate for their therapeutic and diagnostic potential in AD. This review summarizes and highlights the importance of chalcone and its analogs as single target small therapeutic agents, multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) as well as molecular imaging agents for AD. The information summarized here will guide many medicinal chemist and researchers involved in drug discovery to consider chalcone as a potential scaffold for the development of anti-AD agents including theranostics.
