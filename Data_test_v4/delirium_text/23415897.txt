23415897|a|The formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils is crucial in initiating the cascade of pathological events that culminates in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Abeta fibril formation from hydrodynamically well defined species under controlled aggregation conditions. We present a detailed mechanistic model that furnishes a novel insight into the process of Abeta42 fibril formation and the molecular basis for the different structural transitions in the amyloid pathway. Our data reveal the structure and polymorphism of Abeta fibrils to be critically influenced by the oligomeric state of the starting materials, the ratio of monomeric-to-aggregated forms of Abeta42 (oligomers and protofibrils), and the occurrence of secondary nucleation. We demonstrate that monomeric Abeta42 plays an important role in mediating structural transitions in the amyloid pathway, and for the first time, we provide evidences that Abeta42 fibrillization occurs via a combined mechanism of nucleated polymerization and secondary nucleation. These findings will have significant implications to our understanding of the molecular basis of amyloid formation in vivo, of the heterogeneity of Abeta pathology (e.g., diffuse versus amyloid plaques), and of the structural basis of Abeta toxicity.
