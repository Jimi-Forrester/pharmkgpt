33161719|a|The physiological function of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) in platelets has remained elusive. Upon platelet activation, APP localizes to the platelet surface and is proteolytically processed by proteases to release various metabolites, including amyloid beta (Abeta) and soluble APP. Synthetic Abeta is a substrate of activated coagulation factor XIII (FXIII-A*), a transglutaminase that is active both inside and on the surface of platelets. Here we tested if platelet APP and its fragments are covalently modified by FXIII-A*. Platelet-derived FXIII-A* and fibrin(ogen) bound to APP, and their bound fractions increased 7- and 11-fold upon platelet activation, respectively. The processing of platelet APP was enhanced when FXIII-A* was inhibited. Soluble APPbeta was covalently cross-linked by FXIII-A*. This mechanism regulating APP processing is significant, because controlling the processing of APP, such as by inhibiting specific secretases that cleave APP, is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.
