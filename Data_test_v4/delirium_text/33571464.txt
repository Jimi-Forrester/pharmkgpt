33571464|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of a caregiver training program on the oral hygiene of caregivers and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to identify program components and parameters for accurate assessment of outcomes. DESIGN: Single-blinded prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with AD and caregivers in nursing homes in the Greater Zhengzhou Area, China. METHODS: Initially 168 AD patient/caregiver pairs were recruited and randomly assigned to control, limited training, and comprehensive training groups. The mini-mental state examination, global deterioration scale, and Katz activities of daily living scale were conducted for patients with AD. Information on participants' oral hygiene habits and general oral health was collected. The modified Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (PI) and Gingival Index (GI) were used to assess oral hygiene and gingival health. Intervention included (1) an educational video showing the role of dental plaque and the modified Bass technique; and (2) caregivers practicing toothbrushing on themselves and patients with AD under professional guidance. Changes in oral hygiene and correlations between patient PI/GI and caregiver PI/GI were analyzed. RESULTS: After 6 weeks, complete data for 146 AD patient/caregiver pairs were collected. Before enrollment, most patients with AD had very poor oral hygiene. Compared with controls and limited training, only comprehensive training was able to achieve steady reduction in PI and GI scores in patients with AD, which still fell short of desirable levels (PI: 2.46 +- 0.52, GI: 1.24 +- 0.24, week 6). PI and GI scores in caregivers saw steady improvement only through comprehensive training (PI: 1.41 +- 0.38, GI: 0.88 +- 0.19, week 6). Number of training sessions had the greatest influence on both patient PI and GI scores. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Comprehensive caregiver training on toothbrushing skills is effective in improving the oral hygiene of caregivers and patients with AD in nursing homes. Additional evidence is needed to establish the optimal program structure.
