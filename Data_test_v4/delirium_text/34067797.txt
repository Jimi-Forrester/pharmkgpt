34067797|t|Epidemiology and Prevention of Healthcare-Associated Infections in Geriatric Patients: A Narrative Review.
34067797|a|Demographic studies show that life expectancy is increasing in developed countries; increased longevity has also increased the share of the older population with often concomitant chronic conditions. An ageing population and increased comorbidities lead to more complex pharmacological therapies (polypharmacy). The particular picture provided by chronic conditions and polypharmacy can lead to longer hospital stays and a greater need for healthcare. Elderly patients are identified as being in the high-risk group for the development of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) due to the age-related decline of the immune system, known as immunosenescence. Comorbid conditions can often complicate infections, diminishing our ability to treat them effectively. Respiratory tract infections are the most common healthcare-associated infections, followed by urinary tract infections. HAIs in geriatric patients are responsible for longer hospital stays, extended antibiotic therapy, significant mortality, and higher healthcare costs. This is because the microorganisms involved are multidrug-resistant and, therefore, more difficult to eliminate. Moreover, geriatric patients are frequently transferred from one facility (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and other specialty clinics) to another or from one hospital ward to another; these transitions cause care fragmentation, which can undermine the effectiveness of treatment and allow pathogens to be transferred from one setting to another and from one person to another. Multifactorial efforts such as early recognition of infections, restricted use of invasive devices, and effective infection control measures (surveillance, isolation practices, hand hygiene, etc.) can contribute to significant reduction of HAIs in geriatric patients.
