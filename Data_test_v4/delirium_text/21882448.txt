Genomic research progresses to proteomics and brings us to a deeper understanding of the behavior and function of protein clusters. And now proteomics gives way to neuroproteomics as we begin to unravel the complex mysteries of neurological diseases that less than a generation ago seemed opaque to our inquiries, if not altogether intractable. Edited by Dr. Oscar Alzate, <i>Neuroproteomics</i> is the newest volume in the CRC Press <i>Frontiers of Neuroscience</i> series. With an extensive background in mathematics and physics, Dr. Alzate exemplifies the newest generation of biological systems researchers. He organizes research and data contributed from all across the world to present an overview of neuroproteomics that is practical and progressive. Bolstered by each new discovery, researchers employing multiple methods of inquiry gain a deeper understanding of the key biological problems related to brain function, brain structure, and the complexity of the nervous system. This in turn is leading to new understanding about diseases of neurological deficit such as Parkinson s and Alzheimer s. Approaches discussed in the book include mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, chromatography, surface plasmon resonance, protein arrays, immunoblotting, computational proteomics, and molecular imaging. Writing about their own work, leading researchers detail the principles, approaches, and difficulties of the various techniques, demonstrating the questions that neuroproteomics can answer and those it raises. New challenges await, not the least of which is the identification of potential methods to regulate the structures and functions of key protein interaction networks. Ultimately, those building on the foundation presented here will advance our understanding of the brain and show us ways to abate the suffering caused by neurological and mental diseases.
