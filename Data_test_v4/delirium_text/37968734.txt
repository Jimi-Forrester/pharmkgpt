37968734|a|BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is an important outcome for patients and crucial for demonstrating the value of new treatments. Health utility estimates in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are limited, especially in biomarker-confirmed populations. Besides, little is known about the longitudinal HR-QoL trajectory. This study aims to provide health utility estimates for SCD and MCI and investigate the QoL trajectory along the disease continuum. METHODS: Longitudinal data from 919 SCD and 1336 MCI patients from the MEMENTO cohort were included. SCD was defined as clinical dementia rating (CDR) = 0, and MCI as CDR = 0.5. HR-QoL was measured using the EQ-5D-3L patient-reported instrument. Linear mixed-effect models (LMM) were used to assess the longitudinal change in HR-QoL and identify predictors of these changes. RESULTS: Baseline health utilities were 0.84 +- 0.16 and 0.81 +- 0.18, and visual analogue scale (VAS) were 75.8 +- 14.82 and 70.26 +- 15.77 in SCD and MCI. In amyloid-confirmed cases, health utilities were 0.85 +- 0.14 and 0.86 +- 0.12 in amyloid-negative and amyloid-positive SCD, and 0.83 +- 0.17 and 0.84 +- 0.16 in amyloid-negative and amyloid-positive MCI. LMM revealed an annual decline in health utility of - 0.015 (SE = 0.006) and - 0.09 (SE = 0.04) in moderate and severe dementia (P < 0.05). There was a negative association between clinical stage and VAS where individuals with MCI, mild, moderate, and severe dementia were on average 1.695 (SE = 0.274), 4.401 (SE = 0.676), 4.999 (SE = 0.8), and 15.386 (SE = 3.142) VAS points lower than individuals with SCD (P < 0.001). Older age, female sex, higher body mass index, diabetes, cardiovascular history, depression, and functional impairment were associated with poor HR-QoL. Amyloid positivity was associated with an annual decline of - 0.011 (SE = 0.004, P < 0.05) health utility over time. CONCLUSIONS: Health utility estimates from this study can be used in economic evaluations of interventions targeting SCD and MCI. Health utility declines over time in moderate and severe dementia, and VAS declines with advancing clinical stages. Amyloid-positive patients show a faster decline in health utility indicating the importance of considering biomarker status in HR-QoL assessments. Future research is needed to confirm the longitudinal relationship between amyloid status and HR-QoL and to examine the level at which depression and IADL contribute to HR-QoL decline in AD.
