38465812|a|OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the drug Acatinol Memantine, 20 mg (once daily) in comparison with the drug Acatinol Memantine, 10 mg (twice daily) in patients with moderate to moderate severe vascular dementia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 130 patients aged 50-85 years of both sexes with instrumentally and clinically confirmed vascular dementia. The patients were randomized into 2 groups. Group I consisted of 65 patients receiving Akatinol Memantine, 20 mg once daily, group II - 65 patients receiving Akatinol Memantine, 10 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. Clinical, parametric and statistical research methods were used. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale, the cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), the short mental Status Assessment Scale (MMSE) and the general clinical impression scale for patients condition and illness severity (CGI-C and CGI-S) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) were used. Adverse events were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: At week 24, both groups showed statistically significant positive change in ADAS-cog total score: in group I the total score was 27.2+-8.76 points (absolute difference from baseline 3.5 points; p<0.01), and in group II - 26.1+-7.86 points (absolute difference from baseline 2.5 points; p<0.01) with no statistically significant differences between groups. Evaluation of secondary efficacy criteria (change in ADAS-cog total score at week 12 and MMSE at weeks 4, 12, and 24) also revealed statistically significant benefit in both groups compared to baseline with no significant differences between groups. Statistically significant improvement was noticed on CGI-S and CGI-C scales in both groups. Akatinol Memantine was safe and well tolerated in both groups. CONCLUSION: The study showed no lesser efficacy and safety of Akatinol Memantine, 20 mg (once daily) compared to Akatinol Memantine, 10 mg (twice daily) in patients with moderate and moderately severe vascular dementia.
