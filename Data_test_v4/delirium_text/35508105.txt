35508105|t|PHGDH expression increases with progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology and symptoms.
35508105|a|Chen et al. reveal an increase of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) mRNA and protein levels in two mouse models and four human cohorts in Alzheimer's disease brains compared to age- and sex-matched control brains. The increase of PHGDH expression in human brain correlates with symptomatic development and disease pathology.
