36381697|t|The Association Between Alzheimer's Disease and Epilepsy: A Narrative Review.
36381697|a|Several studies have established the two-way relationship between the sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy. However, a more robust connection exists between epilepsy and early onset familial AD (EOFAD). Still, the mechanisms underlying the same are not yet fully understood. Aging is also known to be associated with both AD and seizures. Seizures of any type can occur at any stage of AD and are six to 10 times more likely in patients with AD than in controls of a similar age group. Seizures can quicken cognitive decline and increase mortality, amplifying the medical and economic burden. It is, therefore, clinically essential to recognize and treat seizures early in these patients. However, diagnosis of seizures in AD is complicated by the difficulty in identifying non-motor focal seizures in patients with cognitive decline, problems with obtaining histories, low sensitivity of standard scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) methods, nonspecific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and radiological findings. This article has reviewed and summarised the existing literature on the association between AD and epilepsy pertaining to epidemiology, pathophysiological links, risk factors, modalities for diagnosis, and treatment strategies.
