37574742|t|Humanization of the mdx Mouse Phenotype for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Modeling: A Metabolic Perspective.
37574742|a|Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe form of muscular dystrophy (MD) that is characterized by early muscle wasting and lethal cardiorespiratory failure. While the mdx mouse is the most common model of DMD, it fails to replicate the severe loss of muscle mass and other complications observed in patients, in part due to the multiple rescue pathways found in mice. This led to several attempts at improving DMD animal models by interfering with these rescue pathways through double transgenic approaches, resulting in more severe phenotypes with mixed relevance to the human pathology. As a growing body of literature depicts DMD as a multi-system metabolic disease, improvements in mdx-based modeling of DMD may be achieved by modulating whole-body metabolism instead of muscle homeostasis. This review provides an overview of the established dual-transgenic approaches that exacerbate the mild mdx phenotype by primarily interfering with muscle homeostasis and highlights how advances in DMD modeling coincide with inducing whole-body metabolic changes. We focus on the DBA2/J strain-based D2.mdx mouse with heightened transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling and the dyslipidemic mdx/apolipoprotein E (mdx/ApoE) knock-out (KO) mouse, and summarize how these novel models emulate the metabolic changes observed in DMD.
