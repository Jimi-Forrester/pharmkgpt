31128566|a|Longstanding psychological stress has been associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In a prospective population study of women (n = 81), we tested if midlife stress (mean age 49 years) was associated with late-life biomarkers of neurodegeneration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (mean age 74 years) in linear regression models. It was found that women who report of stress at baseline (n = 20) had higher levels of CSF visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) (age adjusted beta = 0.113, p = 0.017) and CSF myelin basic protein (beta = 0.060, p = 0.030) compared with women without midlife stress (n = 61). There was also a trend observed for higher CSF neurofilament light (beta = 0.133, p = 0.056). In addition, longer periods of stress (i.e., stress at 2-3 midlife examinations) were associated with higher levels of CSF VILIP-1. The results suggest that longstanding stress might be associated with neurodegenerative processes in the brain, as CSF VILIP-1 is an unspecific marker for neuronal injury and CSF myelin basic protein reflects neuroaxonal demyelination.
