37950148|a|BACKGROUND: The retrospective cohort study was conducted to estimate the opioid-sparing anesthesia and limited side-effects with ultrasound (US)-guided ESPB using programmed intermittent bolus (PIB) or continuous infusion (CI) and standard opioid-based anesthesia in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS). METHODS: Patients underwent VATS were stratified into either control group or one of the two ESPB groups in a 1:2:2 ratio depending on whether PIB was implemented or not. The primary endpoint was intra- and post-operative opioids consumption over the first 48 h following surgery. RESULTS: A total of 180 cases were included in the analysis. Cumulative perioperative opioid administration was found to be significantly different between PIB, CI and control group (both p < 0.001), and between PIB and CI group (p = 0.028). More specifically, the mean was 305.30 +- 51.35 mg, 339.68 +- 56.07 mg and 468.91 +- 79.84 mg in PIB, CI and control group. NRS scores at rest across all postoperative times were comparable in two ESPB groups, while significantly lower than control group, however, scores during exercising at postoperative 3, 6, 12 h were significantly lower in PIB group as compared to CI group. A wider anesthetized dermatomes with PIB was observed at 6, 24 and 48 h as opposed to the CI. The mean of levobupivacaine plasma concentration was significantly lower for PIB at postoperative 0.5, 12, 24 and 48 h after initiation than CI. However, local anesthetic toxicity was not observed in any of the two ESPB groups. CONCLUSIONS: When US-guided ESPB using PIB was performed preoperatively, it contributed to the minimization of intra- and post-operative opioid consumption due to better analgesia with a wider anesthetic dermatome opposed to conventional CI, whereas, it was also associated with lower risk of local anesthetic toxicity because of lower plasma concentration of levobupivacaine.
