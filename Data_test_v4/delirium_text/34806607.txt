34806607|a|BACKGROUND: Glucose dysmetabolism is an important risk factor for dementia. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations of diabetes mellitus, the levels of glycemic measures, and insulin resistance and secretion measures with dementia and its subtypes in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: In this study, 10,214 community-dwelling participants were enrolled. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), the HOMA of percent beta-cell function (HOMA-beta), and the glycated albumin (GA) was evaluated. The associations of each measure with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) were investigated. RESULTS: The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of AD were significantly higher in participants with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes (1.46 [95% CI: 1.08-1.97]). Higher HbA1c levels were significantly associated with AD at diabetes (>=6.5%) and even at prediabetes (5.7 %-6.4 %) levels; multivariable-adjusted ORs for AD in participants at the diabetes level were 1.72 (95% CI: 1.19-2.49), and those in participants at the prediabetes level were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.00-1.68), compared with those in normal participants. Moreover, higher GA levels were associated with AD. No associations were observed between the diabetic status or the levels of glycemic measures and VaD. In addition, no significant relationships were observed between insulin resistance and secretion measurements and AD and VaD. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia are significantly associated with AD, even in individuals at the prediabetes level.
