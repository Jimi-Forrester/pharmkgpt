37743611|a|Objective: To evaluate the latent structure, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, diagnostic accuracy, and criterion validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment's auditory items (MoCA-22), which has previously been evaluated in small samples if at all. Methods: 11,284 participants completed the MoCA over 1-2 visits to an Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Mage = 69.2, Meducation = 15.9, 57.6% women, 92.4% non-Hispanic white). MoCA-22 items were probed with alpha, omega, confirmatory factor analysis, and test-retest correlations. Scores were related to measures of neurocognition, daily functioning, behavioral-psychological symptoms (BPS), and vision performance for convergent-discriminant and criterion validity. Dementia stage was used to calculate area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curves and cutoffs for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Results: A single-factor had good fit (CFI = .961; TLI = .945; RMSEA = .061; SRMR = .031), with good internal consistency (Omega total = .83) and test-retest consistency (ICC = .92 at 2.7 years). The strongest convergent correlations were with general cognition and executive functioning, while discriminant validity was demonstrated with its weakest and negative correlations being with BPS. There was strong classification accuracy in distinguishing MCI from normal cognition (AUC = .79; optimal cutoff point < 18), and mild-to-moderate dementia from MCI (AUC = .85; optimal cutoff point < 13). Furthermore, the MoCA-22 had negligible-to-small differences among those with and without vision limitations. Conclusions: These findings add to the evidence of the MoCA-22's utility and it serves as a useful cognitive screening tool with sound reliability and validity.
