35159242|t|Estrogens-Origin of Centrosome Defects in Human Cancer?
35159242|a|Estrogens are associated with a variety of diseases and play important roles in tumor development and progression. Centrosome defects are hallmarks of human cancers and contribute to ongoing chromosome missegragation and aneuploidy that manifest in genomic instability and tumor progression. Although several mechanisms underlie the etiology of centrosome aberrations in human cancer, upstream regulators are hardly known. Accumulating experimental and clinical evidence points to an important role of estrogens in deregulating centrosome homeostasis and promoting karyotype instability. Here, we will summarize existing literature of how natural and synthetic estrogens might contribute to structural and numerical centrosome defects, genomic instability and human carcinogenesis.
