39449333|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease leading to dementia in the elderly, and the mechanisms of AD have not been fully defined. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), covalently closed RNAs produced by reverse splicing, have critical effects in the pathogenesis of AD. CircRNAs participate in production and clearance of Abeta and tau, regulate neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity and the process of apoptosis and autophagy, indicating that circRNAs may be alternative biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our review summarizes the functions of circRNAs in the progression and development of AD, which provide insights into the prospect of circRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
