30868009|t|Trigeminal Amyloidoma: Case Report and Review of Literature.
30868009|a|Amyloid is an abnormal insoluble protein that can deposit in extracellular space. It can involve nearly any organ system and may manifest as a systemic process or focal lesion (amyloidoma). We present a rare case of localized amyloidosis with trigeminal nerve being the only site of involvement and no evidence of systemic disease. We also review literature relevant to trigeminal amyloidoma and make recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.
