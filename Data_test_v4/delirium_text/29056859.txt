29056859|t|Efficacy and Safety of Transdermal Buprenorphine versus Oral Tramadol/Acetaminophen in Patients with Persistent Postoperative Pain after Spinal Surgery.
29056859|a|PURPOSE: Control of persistent pain following spinal surgery is an unmet clinical need. This study compared the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine transdermal system (BTDS) to oral tramadol/acetaminophen (TA) in Korean patients with persistent, moderate pain following spinal surgery. METHODS: Open-label, interventional, randomized multicenter study. Adults with persistent postoperative pain (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] >= 4 at 14-90 days postsurgery) were enrolled. Patients received once-weekly BTDS (n = 47; 5 mug/h titrated to 20 mug/h) or twice-daily TA (n = 40; tramadol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet titrated to 4 tablets) for 6 weeks. The study compared pain reduction with BTDS versus TA at week 6. Quality of life (QoL), treatment satisfaction, medication compliance, and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. FINDINGS: At week 6, both groups reported significant pain reduction (mean NRS change: BTDS -2.02; TA -2.76, both P < 0.0001) and improved QoL (mean EQ-5D index change: BTDS 0.10; TA 0.19, both P < 0.05). The BTDS group achieved better medication compliance (97.8% versus 91.0%). Incidence of AEs (26.1% versus 20.0%) and adverse drug reactions (20.3% versus 16.9%) were comparable between groups. IMPLICATIONS: For patients with persistent pain following spinal surgery, BTDS is an alternative to TA for reducing pain and supports medication compliance. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01983111.
