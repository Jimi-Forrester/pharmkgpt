39076933|a|With population aging and the subsequent accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors, a growing proportion of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are octogenarian (aged between 80 and 89). The marked heterogeneity of this population is due to several factors like age, comorbidities, frailty, and other geriatric conditions. All these variables have a strong impact on outcomes. In addition, a high prevalence of multivessel disease, complex coronary anatomies, and peripheral arterial disease, increases the risk of invasive procedures in these patients. In advanced age, the type and duration of antithrombotic therapy need to be individualized according to bleeding risk. Although an invasive strategy for non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is recommended for the general population, its need is not so clear in octogenarians. For instance, although frail patients could benefit from revascularization, their higher risk of complications might change the risk/benefit ratio. Age alone should not be the main factor to consider when deciding the type of strategy. The risk of futility needs to be taken into account and identification of risk factors for adverse outcomes, such as renal impairment, could help in the decision-making process. Finally, an initially selected conservative strategy should be open to a change to invasive management depending on the clinical course (recurrent angina, ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure). Further evidence, ideally from prospective randomized clinical trials is urgent, as the population keeps growing.
