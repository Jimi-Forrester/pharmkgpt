38131773|t|Mobile Point-of-Care Device Using Molecularly Imprinted Polymer-Based Chemosensors Targeting Interleukin-1beta Biomarker.
38131773|a|Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have garnered significant attention as a promising material for engineering specific biological receptors with superior chemical complementarity to target molecules. In this study, we present an electrochemical biosensing platform incorporating MIP films for the selective detection of the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) biomarker, particularly suitable for mobile point-of-care testing (POCT) applications. The IL-1beta-imprinted biosensors were composed of poly(eriochrome black T (EBT)), including an interlayer of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) and a 4-aminothiophenol monolayer, which were electrochemically polymerized simultaneously with template proteins (i.e., IL-1beta) on custom flexible screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). The architecture of the MIP films was designed to enhance the sensor sensitivity and signal stability. This approach involved a straightforward sequential-electropolymerization process and extraction for leaving behind cavities (i.e., rebinding sites), resulting in the efficient production of MIP-based biosensors capable of molecular recognition for selective IL-1beta detection. The electrochemical behaviors were comprehensively investigated using cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy responses to assess the imprinting effect on the MIP films formed on the SPCEs. In line with the current trend in in vitro diagnostic medical devices, our simple and effective MIP-based analytical system integrated with mobile POCT devices offers a promising route to the rapid detection of biomarkers, with particular potential for periodontitis screening.
