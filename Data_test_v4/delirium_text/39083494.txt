39083494|a|Older adults have higher rates of emergency department (ED) admissions when compared to their younger counterparts. Mobility is the ability to move around, but also encompasses the environment and the ability to adapt to it. Walking aids can be used to improve mobility and prevent falls. According to international guidelines, they must be available in Geriatric EDs. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a program of training and provision of walking aids (WA), associated or not with telemonitoring, on fear of falling, mobility, quality of life and risk of falls up to 3 and 6 months in older adults cared for in an ED. A randomized controlled trial will be carried out in the ED. Participants will be randomized and allocated into three groups, as follows: A) walking aid group will be trained for the use of a walking aid and receive guidance on safe gait; B) walking aid and telemonitoring group will receive training for the use of a walking aid, guidance on safe gait, and telemonitoring (every two weeks for first three months); C) Control group will receive only guidance on safe gait. Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation encompassing sociodemographic and clinical data, mobility in life spaces, gait speed, muscle strength, functionality, quality of life, fear of falling, history of falls, cognition and mood before the intervention. Gait time and fear of falling will be assessed again after the intervention in ED. Finally, mobility in life spaces, functionality, quality of life, fear of falling, history of falls, cognition, and mood will be assessed 3 and 6 months after discharge from the geriatric ED through a telephone interview. Provision of walking aids in the geriatric ED is currently recommended. This study will be the first randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the impact of training and provision of these devices in the ED. Trial registration number: NCT05950269.
