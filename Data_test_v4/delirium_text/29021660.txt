29021660|t|18F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography-guided diagnosis of prostatic and leptomeningeal tuberculosis.
29021660|a|Genitourinary tuberculosis contributes to 10%-14% of extrapulmonary TB. Prostate tuberculosis is rare and usually found incidentally following transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia. We report a case of an immunocompetent patient with pyrexia of unknown origin, on evaluation with whole-body 18F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography scan found to have suspicious prostatic primary, with hypermetabolic abnormalities involving the brain. Histopathological diagnosis was established as multifocal tuberculosis involving prostate, meninges, and intracranial tuberculomas.
