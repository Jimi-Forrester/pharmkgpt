38612514|t|Specific Binding of Alzheimer's Abeta Peptides to Extracellular Vesicles.
38612514|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, yet the onset and progression of the disease is poorly understood. What is known is that the presence of amyloid, particularly polymerized Abeta42, defines when people are on the AD continuum. Interestingly, as AD progresses, less Abeta42 is detectable in the plasma, a phenomenon thought to result from Abeta becoming more aggregated in the brain and less Abeta42 and Abeta40 being transported from the brain to the plasma via the CSF. We propose that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in this transport. EVs are found in bodily fluids such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid and carry diverse "cargos" of bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metabolites) that dynamically reflect changes in the cells from which they are secreted. While Abeta42 and Abeta40 have been reported to be present in EVs, it is not known whether this interaction is specific for these peptides and thus whether amyloid-carrying EVs play a role in AD and/or serve as brain-specific biomarkers of the AD process. To determine if there is a specific interaction between Abeta and EVs, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and discovered that Abeta42 and Abeta40 bind to EVs in a manner that is sequence specific, saturable, and endothermic. In addition, Abeta incubation with EVs overnight yielded larger amounts of bound Abeta peptide that was fibrillar in structure. These findings point to a specific amyloid-EV interaction, a potential role for EVs in the transport of amyloid from the brain to the blood, and a role for this amyloid pool in the AD process.
