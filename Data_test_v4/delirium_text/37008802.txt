37008802|t|Autoimmunity and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration: From Laboratory Study to Clinical Practice.
37008802|a|Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a group of neurodegenerative diseases with heterogenous clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics that show similar impairment of areas in the frontal and/or temporal lobes. Prime doctors' lack of awareness of this complex disease makes early identification and accurate intervention difficult. Autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies are manifestations of different levels of autoimmune reactions. This review presents research findings examining the relationship between autoimmunity and FTLD in terms of autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies with a focus on identifying potential diagnosis and treatment approaches. The findings indicate that the same or similar pathophysiological mechanisms may exist from clinical, genetic, and pathological perspectives. However, the existing evidence is not sufficient to extract substantial conclusions. On the basis of the current situation, we propose future research patterns using prospective studies on large populations and combined clinical and experimental research. Autoimmune reactions or, more generally, inflammatory reactions should receive increased attention from doctors and scientists of all disciplines.
