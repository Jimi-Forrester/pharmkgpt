38602280|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigated the association between sleep duration and neuropathologic changes 19 to 40 years later in oldest-old (age 90+) participants of The 90+ Study. METHODS: Participants self-reported sleep duration and underwent neuropathologic evaluation. We categorized sleep duration as < 7, 7 to 8 = reference, > 8 hours and dichotomized neuropathologic changes as present/absent. We estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression. RESULTS: In 264 participants, mean age at sleep self-report was 69 years, mean age at autopsy was 98 years, and mean interval between sleep self-report and autopsy was 29 years (range: 19-40). Those reporting > 8 hours of sleep had lower likelihood of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) inclusions (OR = 0.18; CI = 0.04-0.82) and amyloid beta deposits (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.12-0.94). DISCUSSION: Long self-reported sleep is associated with lower odds of neurodegenerative neuropathologic changes 19 to 40 years later in the oldest-old, suggesting a potential role of sleep in accumulation of dementia-related neuropathologies. HIGHLIGHTS: Association of self-reported sleep with non-Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes has not been explored. Whether sleep duration is related to dementia neuropathologic changes decades later is unclear. Long self-reported sleep is associated with lower odds of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change 19 to 40 years later in the oldest-old. Long self-reported sleep is associated with lower odds of limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change 19 to 40 years later in the oldest-old.
