26049981|a|Ferulic acid (FA) is an abundant dietary antioxidant which may offer beneficial effects against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. The impact of FA on health depends on its intake and pharmacokinetic properties. In this article, the literature pertaining to chemistry, natural sources, dietary intake and pharmacokinetic properties of FA is critically reviewed. High levels of FA are found in both free and bound forms in vegetables, fruits, cereals, and coffee. We have estimated that consumption of these foods may result in approximately 150-250mg/day of FA intake. FA can be absorbed along the entire gastrointestinal tract and metabolized mainly by the liver. The absorption and metabolism of FA seem to be dose dependent at least in experimental settings. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are required to characterize the impact of FA on human health.
