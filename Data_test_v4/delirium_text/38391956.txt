38391956|a|Central nervous system diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, pose significant challenges in medicine. These conditions, characterized by progressive neuronal loss, have remained largely incurable, exacting a heavy toll on individuals and society. In recent years, in vivo reprogramming using Yamanaka factors has emerged as a promising approach for central nervous system regeneration. This technique involves introducing transcription factors, such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, into adult cells to induce their conversion into neurons. This review summarizes the current state of in vivo reprogramming research in the central nervous system, focusing on the use of Yamanaka factors. In vivo reprogramming using Yamanaka factors has shown promising results in several animal models of central nervous system diseases. Studies have demonstrated that this approach can promote the generation of new neurons, improve functional outcomes, and reduce scar formation. However, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed before this approach can be translated into clinical practice. These challenges include optimizing the efficiency of reprogramming, understanding the cell of origin for each transcription factor, and developing methods for reprogramming in non-subventricular zone areas. Further research is needed to overcome the remaining challenges, but this approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat central nervous system disorders.
