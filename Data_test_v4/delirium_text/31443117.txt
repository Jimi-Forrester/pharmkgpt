31443117|a|In recent years, the extraction fraction of volatile oil from Acorus gramineus has significant effects on anti-dementia and improving the learning and memory of animals. To date, limited studies have determined whether volatile oil from A. gramineus has the protective effect on neuronal damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of volatile oil from A. gramineus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, by means of behavior test, immunohistochemistry and western blot methods. In this study, mice were injected with Abeta1-42 in the bilateral hippocampus to establish the AD model. On the seventh day after modeling, the mice with cognitive dysfunction were selected by the novel object recognition task. Subsequently, the volatile oil treatment groups underwent intragastric administration for per 10 g body weight 2.5 or 5 muL volatile oil from A. gramineus for 3 weeks. The control group and the AD group were given the same amount of saline. Our results showed that after treatment of volatile oil from A. gramineus, the number of Doublecortin and Nestin positive cells increased significantly, suggesting that the volatile oil from A. gramineus may induce the regeneration of hippocampal neurons in mice, and promote the growth of hippocampal neurons by upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine protein kinase B, and neurotrophin-3 expression. These results might provide more experimental evidences for underlying mechanism about the neuroprotective effects of volatile oil from A. gramineus against AD relevant symptoms.
