34725968|t|Circulating SERPINA3 improves prognostic stratification in patients with a de novo or worsened heart failure.
34725968|a|AIMS: We investigated the prognostic relevance of serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A member 3 (SERPINA3) in patients admitted with a de novo or worsened heart failure (HF). METHODS AND RESULTS: In the first stage, 83 HF-related left ventricular (LV) transcripts were examined in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy (CCMP, n = 44) who died within 5 years and compared with age-matched and haemodynamically matched CCMP survivors (n = 39) and controls with normal LV function (n = 17). Among 14 differentially expressed transcripts, myocardial gene and circulating SERPINA3 levels were up-regulated in non-survivors vs. survivors (2.40 +- 3.66 vs. 0.36 +- 0.22 units, P < 0.01 and 334.7 +- 138.7 vs. 228.2 +- 83.1 mug/mL, P < 0.01, respectively). While no significant transmyocardial gradient was detected, cytokine stimulation of human endothelial cells induced SERPINA3 secretion. In an independent validation cohort with a de novo or worsened HF (n = 387), circulating SERPINA3 levels > 316 mug/mL were associated with increased all-cause mortality {hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.4 [1.5-3.9], P = 0.0002} and its composite with unplanned cardiovascular readmission [HR (95% CI): 2.0 (1.2-3.3), P = 0.004]. Patients with elevated SERPINA3 levels and elevated either N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide or ST2 showed worse freedom from both endpoints. In a multivariate analysis, including established clinical risk factors, SERPINA3 remained independent predictor of all-cause mortality together with age, gender, ST2, glomerular filtration, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. CONCLUSION: In patients with a de novo or worsened HF, increased SERPINA3 levels > 316 mug/mL are associated with increased mortality or unplanned cardiac readmission. Elevated SERPINA3 levels on top of established clinical predictors appear to identify a subgroup of HF patients at higher mortality risk. Prospective studies should further validate its value in prognostic stratification of HF.
