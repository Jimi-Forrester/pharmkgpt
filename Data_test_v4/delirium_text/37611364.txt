37611364|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: More than half of institutionalized older people need a emergency department visit annually, with high resources consumption and higher risk of adverse events, due to high complexity. Direct admission to Acute Geriatric Unit (AGU), after geriatric consultant and nursing home medical team assessment, could be a safety and effective alternative to emergency department (ED) admission. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of AGU patients admitted by Nursing Home Geriatric Team between January, 1st and December, 31st, 2021. Planned admissions and SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were excluded. Medical (sociodemographic, clinical, functional and cognitive) records and outcomes data (inpatient mortality, hospital and ED lenght of stay, transfer to ED and delirium within 48h after admission, hospital discharge location) were collected. RESULTS: Two hundred and six patients directly admitted, 101 through ED (N 307). 62.5% with Barthel index <40, 65% with dementia, 56.4% with Charlson index >=3. Inpatient mortality was 14.6% in direct admission, 20.8% in ED referral group, p=0.14. Hospital lenght of stay was 9.61+-6.01 days in direct admission, 11.22+-5.36 days in ED group, p=0.02. 27.7% of patients with delirium in direct admission and 36.6% in ED group; only one patient was transferred to ED, within 48h after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Direct admission is a safety and effective alternative to ED referral in institutionalized older people after geriatric assessment, due to no increased mortality, shorter length of stay and hospital cost reduction.
