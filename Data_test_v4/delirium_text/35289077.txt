35289077|t|CAR-T cell therapy for lung cancer: Potential and perspective.
35289077|a|Lung cancer is the highest incidence and mortality of all cancers around the world. In the present immunotherapy era, an increasing number of immunotherapeutic agents including monoclonal antibody-targeted drugs have been used in the clinical treatment of malignancy, but it still has many limitations. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells, a novel adoptive immunotherapy strategy, have not only been used successfully against hematological tumors, but have also opened up new avenues for immunotherapy of solid tumors, including lung cancer. However, targeting lung cancer-specific antigens using engineered CAR-T cells is complicated by the lack of proper tumor-specific antigens, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, a low level of CAR-T cell infiltration into tumor tissues, along with off-target effect, etc. Simultaneously, the clinical application of CAR-T cells remains limited because of many challenges such as tumor lysis syndrome, neurotoxicity syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome. In this review, we outline the basic structure and generation characteristic of CAR-T cells and summarize the common tumor-associated antigens in clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy for lung cancer, and point out the current challenges and new strategies, aiming to provide new ideas and approaches for the pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy in lung cancer.
