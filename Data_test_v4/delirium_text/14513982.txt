14513982|a|PURPOSE: This study evaluates the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in clinical scenarios other than sedation during mechanical ventilation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review and presentation of case series of children in the pediatric intensive care unit and the postanesthesia care unit who received dexmedetomidine. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine was administered by continuous infusion to three patients and as a single bolus dose (0.5 microg/kg) to two patients. In the five clinical scenarios, dexmedetomidine provided effective sedation during spontaneous ventilation in two patients, reversed the clinical signs and symptoms of withdrawal from illicit substances in one patient, and was effective in the treatment of postanesthesia emergence delirium and shivering in two additional patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that dexmedetomidine may be an effective agent for sedation in spontaneously breathing patients, in the treatment of drug withdrawal, and in the treatment of two common postanesthesia problems.
