28222511|t|Evaluation of a DNA Abeta42 Vaccine in Aged NZW Rabbits: Antibody Kinetics and Immune Profile after Intradermal Immunization with Full-Length DNA Abeta42 Trimer.
28222511|a|A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid plaques in the brain consisting of aggregated amyloid-beta 42 peptide (Abeta42) derived from cellular amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Based on successful experiments in mouse AD models, active immunization with Abeta42 peptide and passive immunizations with anti-Abeta42 antibodies were started in clinical trials. Active Abeta42 peptide immunization in humans had led to an inflammatory autoimmune response, and the trial was stopped. Passive immunizations had shown some effects in slowing AD pathology. Active DNA Abeta42 immunizations administered with the gene gun into the skin elicits a different immune response and is non-inflammatory. While in rodents, good responses had been found for this type of immunization, positive results in larger mammals are missing. We present here results from sixteen New Zealand White Rabbits, which underwent intradermal DNA Abeta42 immunization via gene gun. The humoral immune response was analyzed from blood throughout the study, and cellular immune responses were determined from spleens at the end of the study. A good anti-Abeta antibody response was found in the rabbit model. The T cell response after re-stimulation in cell culture showed no IFNgamma producing cells when ELISPOT assays were analyzed from PBMC, but low numbers of IFNgamma and IL-17 producing cells were found in ELISPOTS from spleens (both 5 immunizations). Brains from immunized rabbits showed no signs of encephalitis. Based on these results, DNA Abeta42 immunization is highly likely to be safe and effective to test in a possible clinical AD prevention trial in patients.
