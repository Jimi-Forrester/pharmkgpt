32801364|a|Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R, also known as c-FMS) is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and IL-34 are ligands of CSF1R. CSF1R-mediated signaling is crucial for the survival, function, proliferation, and differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, including osteoclasts, monocytes/macrophages, microglia, Langerhans cells in the skin, and Paneth cells in the intestine. CSF1R also plays an important role in oocytes and trophoblastic cells in the female reproductive tract and in the maintenance and maturation of neural progenitor cells. Given that CSF1R is expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells, altered CSF1R signaling is implicated in inflammatory, neoplastic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibiting CSF1R signaling through an inhibitory anti-CSF1R antibody or small molecule inhibitors that target the kinase activity of CSF1R has thus been a promising therapeutic strategy for those diseases. In this review, we cover the recent progress in our understanding of the various roles of CSF1R in osteoclasts and other myeloid cells, highlighting the therapeutic applications of CSF1R inhibitors in disease conditions.
