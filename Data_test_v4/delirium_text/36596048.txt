36596048|t|Analysis of anesthetic effect of dexmedetomidine in femoral shaft fracture surgery.
36596048|a|To investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on hemodynamics and recovery period after femoral shaft fracture surgery. Fifty-two patients, aged 3 to 7 years, who underwent femoral shaft fracture reduction surgery in our hospital in 2019 were randomly divided into the experimental group (n = 26) and the control group (n = 26). Both groups were given routine propofol combined with remifentanil by intravenous anesthesia. The experimental group was continuously pumped with DEX after induction of anesthesia, while the control group was continuously pumped with the same volume of normal saline. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before anesthesia induction (T0), when laryngeal mask was inserted (T1), when skin was cut (T2), when intramedullary needle was inserted (T3), and when laryngeal mask was removed (T4). Extubation time after anesthesia withdrawal was recorded in the 2 groups. According to the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score, the agitation and the incidence of agitation were recorded immediately after extubation (T5), 10 minutes after entering the recovery room (T6) and 30 minutes after entering the recovery room (T7). There was no significant difference in MAP and HR between the 2 groups at T0 and T1 time points (P > .05). The MAP and HR of the experimental group at T2 to T4 were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < .05). The extubation time of the experimental group was longer than that of the control group (P < .05), but the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score and the incidence of agitation in the recovery period of the experimental group were lower than those of the control group (P < .05). In femoral shaft fracture surgery, intravenous anesthesia combined with continuous pumping DEX can effectively stabilize the hemodynamics of patients, and the incidence of postoperative agitation during anesthesia recovery is low.
