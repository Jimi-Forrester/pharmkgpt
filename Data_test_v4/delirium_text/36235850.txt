36235850|t|Higher Total Cholesterol Concentration May Be Associated with Better Cognitive Performance among Elderly Females.
36235850|a|BACKGROUND: The brain contains the highest level of cholesterol in the body, and the total amount of serum cholesterol in the blood has a huge impact on brain aging and cognitive performance. However, the association of total serum cholesterol with cognitive function remains uncertain. This study determines whether there is an association between the total amount of cholesterol in the blood and cognitive performance in elderly females without a history of stroke. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on elderly (over 60 years old) females and males without a history of stroke from 2011 to 2014 in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The primary exposure was total blood cholesterol, and the main outcome was cognitive performance; this association was assessed with logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: 1309 female and 1272 male participants were included. In females, higher total cholesterol was significantly associated with higher cognitive scores, particularly in the digit symbol substitution test (OR 0.51, 95% CI (0.36-0.72)) and the animal fluency test (OR 0.64, 95% CI (0.45-0.91)). This association remained significant in models adjusted for age, race, smoking status, education level, and chronic conditions (OR 0.40, 95% CI (0.25-0.63)). This association was not significant in males, however. CONCLUSIONS: A higher concentration of total cholesterol measured in later life may be a protective factor for cognitive performance among females over 60 years old without a history of stroke. Further, this association was more pronounced among women with higher levels of education than women with lower or no education.
