30649985|a|Background: Improving quality of life (QOL) is important in cancer palliative care (PC) patients. "Spiritual pain" (SP) is common in this population, but it is unknown how it affects QOL. Objective: To study the associations between SP and QOL in cancer patients in PC. Design: Cross-sectional. Settings/Subjects: Cancer patients assessed at a PC clinic in Puente Alto, Chile, were enrolled in a longitudinal study to characterize patients' end of life. Inclusion criteria included age >=18, a primary caregiver, not having delirium, and a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <=80. Measurements: After consenting patients completed baseline surveys that included demographics, single-item questions to assess SP (0-10), financial distress, spirituality-related variables and questionnaires to assess QOL (0-100), and physical (Global distress score-physical) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), baseline data analyses to explore associations between SP and QOL were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Two hundred and eight patients were enrolled: mean age was 64, 50% were female, and 67% had SP. In univariate analysis, SP was significantly associated with lower QOL (coefficient [95% confidence interval]: -1.88 [-2.93 to -0.84], p < 0.001). Lower QOL was also associated with being younger, lower KPS, higher physical distress, having anxiety or depression, and decreased religiosity and religious coping. In the multivariate analysis, QOL remained independently associated with SP (-1.25 [-2.35; to -0.15], p < 0.026), religious coping (11.74 [1.09 to 22.38], p < 0.031), and physical distress (-0.52 [-0.89 to -0.16], p < 0.005). Conclusions: SP is associated with QOL in cancer patients in PC. SP should be regularly assessed to plan for interventions that could impact QOL. More research is needed.
