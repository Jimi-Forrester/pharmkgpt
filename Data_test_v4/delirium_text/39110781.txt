However, efficient delivery of functional proteins across the cell membrane remains challenging. Exosomes are nanosized vesicles naturally secreted by various types of cells and may serve as promising nanocarriers for therapeutic biomolecules. Here, we engineered exosomes equipped with a photoinducible cargo protein release system, termed mMaple3-mediated protein loading into and release from exosome (MAPLEX), in which cargo proteins can be loaded into the exosomes by fusing them with photocleavable protein (mMaple3)-conjugated exosomal membrane markers and subsequently released from the exosomal membrane by inducing photocleavage with blue light illumination. Using this system, we first induced transcriptional regulation by delivering octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY-box transcription factor 2 to fibroblasts in vitro. Second, we induced in vivo gene recombination in Cre reporter mice by delivering Cre recombinase. Last, we achieved targeted epigenome editing in the brains of 5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice, two models of Alzheimer's disease. Administration of MAPLEXs loaded with beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (Bace1)-targeting single guide RNA-incorporated dCas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, coupled with the catalytic domain of DNA methyltransferase 3A, resulted in successful methylation of the targeted CpG sites within the Bace1 promoter. This approach led to a significant reduction in Bace1 expression, improved recognition memory impairment, and reduced amyloid pathology in 5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice. These results suggest that MAPLEX is an efficient intracellular protein delivery system that can deliver diverse therapeutic proteins for multiple diseases.
