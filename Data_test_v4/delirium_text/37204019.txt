Although many studies have evaluated screening questionnaires based psychiatric morbidity, very few studies have used contemporary diagnostic criteria. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with SLE admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A total of 79 patients diagnosed with SLE for at least for 1 year, who were not in delirium were assessed by a qualified psychiatrist for psychiatric morbidity as per the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria. Additionally, these patients were assessed on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) item version, Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) item version, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: 51% (n = 40) of the participants were diagnosed with a psychiatric diagnosis, with depressive disorders being the most common, seen in 36.7% (n = 29) of the participants. Additionally, 10% (n = 8) participants were diagnosed with adjustment disorder and 2.5% (n = 2) were diagnosed with anxiety (not otherwise specified). Only one patient was diagnosed with organic psychosis. On PHQ-9, 39.8% (n = 33) were diagnosed with depression. 44.3% (n = 35) expressed death wishes and/or suicidal ideations. On PHQ-15, 17.7% (n = 14) of the participants scored for severe somatic distress (score >15). On GAD-7, 55.7% (n = 44) screened positive for anxiety symptoms, but only 7.6% (n = ) had a score of 15 or more to indicate severe anxiety. Nearly half (n = 43; 52%) of the participants also had cognitive impairment as assessed on MoCA, with 13.3% (n = 11) of the participants having scores indicating severe dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLE have a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities and should be routinely screened for psychiatric morbidity. They should be appropriately treated, to improve the overall treatment outcomes.
