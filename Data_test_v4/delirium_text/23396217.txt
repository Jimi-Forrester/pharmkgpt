23396217|a|Language disorders can be the first symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). The main variants of PPA are: the non-fluent/agrammatic variant, the semantic variant and the logopenic variant.Several additional variants of PPA, however, have been described and are considered as atypical presentations. We describe the case of a woman presenting a progressive isolated language disturbance, characterized by an early dysprosodia, phonological and semantic paraphasias, agrammatism, impairment in repetition, writing of non-words and sentence comprehension. This clinical picture pointed to an atypical presentation of the non-fluent variety. The frequent symptom overlap between the different variants of PPA, most likely reflecting differences in the topography of the pathological changes, needs to be considered in the definition of diagnostic criteria.
