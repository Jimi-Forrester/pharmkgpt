18954483|a|This study investigated the role of visuospatial tasks in identifying cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), by correlating neuropsychological performance with cerebral perfusion measures. There were 157 participants: 29 neurologically healthy controls (age: 70.3 +/- 6.6, MMSE > or = 27), 86 patients with mild AD (age: 69.18 +/- 8.28, MMSE > or = 21) and 42 patients moderate/severe AD (age: 68.86 +/- 10.69, MMSE 8-20). Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) was used to derive regional perfusion ratios, and correlated using partial least squares (PLS) with neuropsychological test scores from the Benton Line Orientation (BLO) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (RO). Cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that mean scores differed in accordance with disease status: control group (BLO 25.5, RO 33.3); mild AD (BLO 20.1, RO 25.5); moderate/severe AD (BLO 10.7, RO 16). Correlations were observed between BLO/RO and right parietal SPECT regions in the AD groups. Visuospatial performance, often undersampled in cognitive batteries for AD, is clearly impaired even in mild AD and correlates with functional deficits as indexed by cerebral perfusion ratios on SPECT implicating right hemisphere circuits. Furthermore, PLS reveals that usual spatial tasks probe a distributed brain network in both hemispheres including many areas targeted by early AD pathology.
