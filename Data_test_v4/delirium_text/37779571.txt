37779571|a|It is increasingly conceivable that elderly patients will be treated in perioperative settings as the world's population shifts toward an older age distribution. They are more prone to a variety of unfavorable outcomes as a consequence of the physiological changes that accompany aging and the coexistence of multiple medical conditions. Postoperative complications in elderly patients are linked to a large increase in morbidity and mortality and the burden placed on the healthcare system. Our goal is to determine how elderly patients' recovery after anesthesia differs from that of younger patients. In addition, we will discuss the main postoperative complications experienced by elderly patients and the measures that are utilized to limit the risk of these complications developing.
