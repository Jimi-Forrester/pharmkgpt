29849078|t|The Relationship between Cerebral White Matter Integrity and Cognitive Function in Mild Stroke with Basal Ganglia Region Infarcts.
29849078|a|Mild stroke is a known risk factor for dementia. The relationship between cerebral white matter (WM) integrity and cognitive impairment (CI) in mild stroke patients with basal ganglia region infarcts is unknown. Total of 33 stroke patients and 19 age-matched controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging scans and a formal neuropsychological test battery. CI was defined as having a performance score 1.5 SD below the established norm. We compared the differences in Z-scores and Fraction Anisotropy (FA) values among controls, stroke with no CI (NCI) and stroke with CI groups. Multiple linear regressions were performed between FA values in affected regions and neuropsychological tests in stroke patients. The majority of stroke patients were in their 50s (56.90 +- 9.23 years). CI patients exhibited a significantly decreased Z score in visual delayed memory and remarkably decreased FA values in the right external capsule and right fornix (FWE-corrected) compared with NCI patients and controls. In stroke patients, the FA value in the right fornix was positively correlated with delayed visual memory. Mild stroke with basal ganglia region infarcts may be related to widespread abnormality of WM integrity. The lower WM integrity in the right fornix may be a marker of impaired delayed visual memory.
