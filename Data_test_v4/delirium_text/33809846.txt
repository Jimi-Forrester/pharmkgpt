33809846|t|Improved Controlled Release and Brain Penetration of the Small Molecule S14 Using PLGA Nanoparticles.
33809846|a|Phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an important cellular messenger. PDE7's role in neurotransmission, expression profile in the brain and the druggability of other phosphodiesterases have motivated the search for potent inhibitors to treat neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Different heterocyclic compounds have been described over the years; among them, phenyl-2-thioxo-(1H)-quinazolin-4-one, called S14, has shown very promising results in different in vitro and in vivo studies. Recently, polymeric nanoparticles have been used as new formulations to target specific organs and produce controlled release of certain drugs. In this work, we describe poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based polymeric nanoparticles loaded with S14. Their preparation, optimization, characterization and in vivo drug release profile are here presented as an effort to improve pharmacokinetic properties of this interesting PDE7 inhibitor.
