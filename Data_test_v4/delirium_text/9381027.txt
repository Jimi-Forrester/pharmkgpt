9381027|a|Early diagnosis and treatment of AD is critical to maximize benefits for the patient and the caregiver. It is important to intervene early in the illness, before the quality of life of the patient and the caregiver has deteriorated to the point where treatment only prolongs an already difficult situation. If treatment begins early enough in the disease course, loss of functional independence may be delayed, just as nursing home placement was delayed in this study. In this way, quality of life is improved for both the patient and the caregiver.
