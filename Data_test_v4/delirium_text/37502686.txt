37502686|t|Magnetoencephalography-based approaches to epilepsy classification.
37502686|a|Epilepsy is a chronic central nervous system disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Not only does epilepsy severely affect the daily life of the patient, but the risk of premature death in patients with epilepsy is three times higher than that of the normal population. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive, high temporal and spatial resolution electrophysiological data that provides a valid basis for epilepsy diagnosis, and used in clinical practice to locate epileptic foci in patients with epilepsy. It has been shown that MEG helps to identify MRI-negative epilepsy, contributes to clinical decision-making in recurrent seizures after previous epilepsy surgery, that interictal MEG can provide additional localization information than scalp EEG, and complete excision of the stimulation area defined by the MEG has prognostic significance for postoperative seizure control. However, due to the complexity of the MEG signal, it is often difficult to identify subtle but critical changes in MEG through visual inspection, opening up an important area of research for biomedical engineers to investigate and implement intelligent algorithms for epilepsy recognition. At the same time, the use of manual markers requires significant time and labor costs, necessitating the development and use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that use classifiers to automatically identify abnormal activity. In this review, we discuss in detail the results of applying various different feature extraction methods on MEG signals with different classifiers for epilepsy detection, subtype determination, and laterality classification. Finally, we also briefly look at the prospects of using MEG for epilepsy-assisted localization (spike detection, high-frequency oscillation detection) due to the unique advantages of MEG for functional area localization in epilepsy, and discuss the limitation of current research status and suggestions for future research. Overall, it is hoped that our review will facilitate the reader to quickly gain a general understanding of the problem of MEG-based epilepsy classification and provide ideas and directions for subsequent research.
