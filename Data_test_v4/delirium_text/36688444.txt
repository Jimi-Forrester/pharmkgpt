36688444|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of quinoline-O-carbamate derivatives as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
36688444|a|A series of novel quinoline-O-carbamate derivatives was rationally designed for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) strategy. The target compounds were synthesised and evaluated by AChE/BuChE inhibition and anti-inflammatory property. The in vitro activities showed that compound 3f was a reversible dual eeAChE/eqBuChE inhibitor with IC50 values of 1.3 microM and 0.81 microM, respectively. Moreover, compound 3f displayed good anti-inflammatory property by decreasing the production of IL-6, IL-1beta and NO. In addition, compound 3f presented significant neuroprotective effect on Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cell injury. Furthermore, compound 3f presented good stabilities in artificial gastrointestinal fluids, liver microsomes in vitro and plasma. Furthermore, compound 3f could improve AlCl3-induced zebrafish AD model by increasing the level of ACh. Therefore, compound 3f was a promising multifunctional agent for the treatment of AD.
