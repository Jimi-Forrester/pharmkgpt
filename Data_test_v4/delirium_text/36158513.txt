36158513|t|Role of micronutrients in Alzheimer's disease: Review of available evidence.
36158513|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders that have been studied for more than 100 years. Although an increased level of amyloid precursor protein is considered a key contributor to the development of AD, the exact pathogenic mechanism remains known. Multiple factors are related to AD, such as genetic factors, aging, lifestyle, and nutrients. Both epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown that the levels of micronutrients, such as copper, zinc, and iron, are closely related to the development of AD. In this review, we summarize the roles of eight micronutrients, including copper, zinc, iron, selenium, silicon, manganese, arsenic, and vitamin D in AD based on recently published studies.
