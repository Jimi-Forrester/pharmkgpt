36381848|t|A Review of the Usage and Post-surgical Outcomes of Anesthesia for Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) Procedure.
36381848|a|When laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery is employed for myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, the process requires the usage of anesthetics to ensure that there is minimal patient harm and negative consequences once the procedure is complete. Statistical analysis was conducted as part of this review to evaluate the application of and distinctions between the different analgesics used for LASIK surgery by compiling and filtering information from multiple research studies. Topically administered oxybuprocaine and proparacaine were found to be the most commonly used anesthetics for LASIK, according to the data included in the review. It was also determined that there were no significant differences in terms of patient outcomes and drug concentrations when proparacaine was substituted for oxybuprocaine. This is particularly intriguing given their different chemical compositions. Temporary dry eyes were the most commonly reported adverse effect of LASIK when the anesthetic was employed. Perhaps cocaine derivatives produce similar anesthetic and post-surgical effects, but further investigations are needed to verify this hypothesis.
