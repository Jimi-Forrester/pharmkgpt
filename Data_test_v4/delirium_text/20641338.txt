20641338|a|Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition, and emotion (1, 2). Dopamine receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington s disease, and schizophrenia (3). Five subtypes of dopamine receptors, D<sub>1</sub> through D<sub>5</sub>, have been well characterized pharmacologically and biochemically (4). These five subtypes are classified into two subfamilies: D<sub>1</sub>-like (D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub>) and D<sub>2</sub>-like (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub>) dopamine receptors. D<sub>1</sub>-like and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors exert synergistic as well as opposite effects at both the biochemical and overall system level. A great majority of striatal D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors are localized postsynaptically on caudate-putamen neurons and to a lesser extent presynaptically on nigrostiatal axons. Substituted benzamides, such as sulpiride, raclopride, and iodobenzamide, are specific ligands with only moderate affinity for the D<sub>2</sub> receptors, making studies of extrastriatal D<sub>2</sub> receptors difficult (5-7). In binding studies, [<sup>123</sup>I]-labeled epidepride, an analog of isoremoxipride, was found to have high potency and low nonspecific binding, and to be selective for striatal and extrastriatal D<sub>2</sub> receptors (8). Epidepride has marginal binding to D<sub>4</sub> receptors, with little affinity for other known neurotransmitter receptors. (S)-<i>N</i>-((1-Allyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl)-5-(3-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoropropyl)-2,3-dimethoxybenzamide ([<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride), an analog of epidepride, was found to be a selective, high-affinity antagonist of D<sub>2/3</sub> receptors (9), and in positron emission tomography (PET) <i>in vivo</i> studies (10-12), it identified extrastriatal D<sub>2/3</sub> receptors. [<sup>18</sup>F]Fallypride PET has been used to study D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor occupancy and density in neuropsychiatric disorders and aging in humans.
