10692521|t|Glycoxidative modification of AA amyloid deposits in renal tissue.
10692521|a|BACKGROUND: N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML) is a product of the oxidative modification of glycated proteins, which damages proteins with ageing, diabetes, uraemia and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, pyrraline is one of the advanced glycation end products, which is independent of oxidative processes. CML has been identified in beta-amyloid of Alzheimer's disease and beta(2)-microglobulin-associated amyloid. We investigated whether CML and pyrraline are formed in AA and AL amyloid of the kidney. METHOD: Renal specimens from 19 cases of AA amyloidosis and 14 cases of AL amyloidosis were investigated for immunolocalization of CML, pyrraline, collagen type IV and laminin in amyloid deposits. Renal biopsies of 10 age-matched cases with thin basement membrane disease and normal renal function were used as controls. The fractional areas of amyloid, CML, laminin and collagen IV in glomeruli and interstitium (%amyloid, %CML, %laminin and %collagen, respectively) were calculated using the point counting method. The correlation between these parameters was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation test. RESULTS: CML colocalized with AA amyloid, but not AL amyloid, except in two cases of the latter with a long history of nephropathy exceeding 14 years. In contrast, pyrraline was not observed in either type of amyloid. Mean %CML in AA amyloid was significantly higher than %collagen and %laminin in glomeruli and interstitium, indicating that AA amyloid is modified by CML independent of colocalized extracellular matrix. %CML significantly correlated with %amyloid both in glomeruli and interstitium in AA amyloidosis. AL amyloid cases with a long history of nephropathy showed positive staining for CML in glomeruli and interstitium but no staining for collagen IV and laminin in amyloid deposits. CONCLUSION: CML modification may occur in amyloid deposits of AA amyloidosis, independent of extracellular matrix components. Glycoxidative modification may have a functional link to AA amyloid deposition in renal tissues.
