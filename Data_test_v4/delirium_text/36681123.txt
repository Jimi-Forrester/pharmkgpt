36681123|t|Inositol pyrophosphate profiling reveals regulatory roles of IP6K2-dependent enhanced IP7 metabolism in the enteric nervous system.
36681123|a|Inositol pyrophosphates regulate diverse physiological processes; to better understand their functional roles, assessing their tissue-specific distribution is important. Here, we profiled inositol pyrophosphate levels in mammalian organs using an originally designed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) protocol and discovered that the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) contained the highest levels of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7) and its precursor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Although their absolute levels in the GIT are diet dependent, elevated IP7 metabolism still exists under dietary regimens devoid of exogenous IP7. Of the major GIT cells, enteric neurons selectively express the IP7-synthesizing enzyme IP6K2. We found that IP6K2-knockout mice exhibited significantly impaired IP7 metabolism in the various organs including the proximal GIT. In addition, our LC-MS analysis displayed that genetic ablation of IP6K2 significantly impaired IP7 metabolism in the gut and duodenal muscularis externa containing myenteric plexus. Whole transcriptome analysis of duodenal muscularis externa further suggested that IP6K2 inhibition significantly altered expression levels of the gene sets associated with mature neurons, neural progenitor/stem cells, and glial cells, as well as of certain genes modulating neuronal differentiation and functioning, implying critical roles of the IP6K2-IP7 axis in developmental and functional regulation of the enteric nervous system. These results collectively reveal an unexpected role of mammalian IP7-a highly active IP6K2-IP7 pathway is conducive to the enteric nervous system.
