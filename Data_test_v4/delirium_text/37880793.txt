37880793|a|BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common and deadliest cancer worldwide, and approximately 90% of all lung cancer deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes could potentially promote tumor metastasis through the delivery of metastasis-related molecules. However, the function and underlying mechanism of exosomal long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in lung cancer metastasis remain largely unclear. METHODS: Cell exosomes were purified from conditioned media by differential ultracentrifugation and observed using transmission electron microscopy, and the size distributions were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Exosomal lncRNA sequencing (lncRNA-seq) was used to identify long noncoding RNAs. Cell migration and invasion were determined by wound-healing assays, two-chamber transwell invasion assays and cell mobility tracking. Mice orthotopically and subcutaneously xenografted with human cancer cells were used to evaluate tumor metastasis in vivo. Western blot, qRT-PCR, RNA-seq, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the potential mechanism. The level of exosomal lncRNA in plasma was examined by qRT-PCR. MS2-tagged RNA affinity purification (MS2-TRAP) assays were performed to verify lncRNA-bound miRNAs. RESULTS: Exosomes derived from highly metastatic lung cancer cells promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells with low metastatic potential. Using lncRNA-seq, we found that a novel lncRNA, lnc-MLETA1, was upregulated in highly metastatic cells and their secreted exosomes. Overexpression of lnc-MLETA1 augmented cell migration and invasion of lung cancer. Conversely, knockdown of lnc-MLETA1 attenuated the motility and metastasis of lung cancer cells. Interestingly, exosome-transmitted lnc-MLETA1 promoted cell motility and metastasis of lung cancer. Reciprocally, targeting lnc-MLETA1 with an LNA suppressed exosome-induced lung cancer cell motility. Mechanistically, lnc-MLETA1 regulated the expression of EGFR and IGF1R by sponging miR-186-5p and miR-497-5p to facilitate cell motility. The clinical datasets revealed that lnc-MLETA1 is upregulated in tumor tissues and predicts survival in lung cancer patients. Importantly, the levels of exosomal lnc-MLETA1 in plasma were positively correlated with metastasis in lung cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies lnc-MLETA1 as a critical exosomal lncRNA that mediates crosstalk in lung cancer cells to promote cancer metastasis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.
