38689156|a|Inward rectifying potassium channels sensitive to ATP levels (KATP) have been the subject of investigation for several decades. Modulators of KATP channels are well-established treatments for metabolic as well as cardiovascular diseases. Experimental studies have also shown the potential of KATP modulation in neurodegenerative disorders. However, to date, data regarding the effects of KATP antagonists/agonists in experiments related to neurodegeneration remain inconsistent. The main source of confusion in evaluating available data seems to be the choice of experimental models. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of both opening and blocking KATP channels in two forms of SH-SY5Y cells. Our results offer valuable insights into the significance of metabolic differences between differentiated and non-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, particularly in the context of glibenclamide and diazoxide effects under normal conditions and during the initiation of pathological events simulating Parkinson's disease in vitro. We emphasize the analysis of mitochondrial functions and changes in mitochondrial network morphology. The heightened protein expression of KATP channels identified in non-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells seems to be a platform for a more significant impact of KATP modulators in this cell type. The efficiency of rotenone treatment in inducing morphological changes in the mitochondrial network depends on the differentiation status of SH-SY5Y cells.
