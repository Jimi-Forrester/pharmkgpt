38222214|t|Same Pathogen, Different Manifestations: A Case of Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis.
38222214|a|Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most prevalent contagious disease worldwide and a significant cause of morbidity, ranking as the second most deadly disease globally. The transmission of the disease occurs through aerosols via the respiratory route, predominantly affecting pulmonary tissue. However, the pathogen can disseminate and infect any organ within the body. Up to 15% of patients exhibit extrapulmonary involvement. The case involves a 59-year-old male who presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain and subfebrile episodes, without any other significant symptoms or findings on physical examination. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated inflammatory markers and abnormal liver biochemistry parameters. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a neoformative lesion in the liver - a collection with a vascularized, thick, irregular wall. This raised the possibility of a potentially hypervascular hepatic neoformation or an encysted inflammatory lesion. The patient was started on empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward for further investigation. Later, the patient began to exhibit a decline in overall condition, a slowed and less complex speech pattern, loss of balance, and distal tremors in the upper limbs, as well as a symmetric and distal reduction in strength in all four limbs. A cerebral CT scan revealed no significant abnormalities, and a lumbar puncture yielded no immediate notable findings. Simultaneously, a repeated abdominal CT scan showed the previously known hepatic lesion, albeit with features more indicative of a multiloculated collection. An aspirative biopsy of the hepatic abscess was conducted. From the extensive analysis conducted, a positive PCR result for mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in both the pus from the hepatic abscess and the cerebrospinal fluid. This led to the conclusion that the case presented was an instance of extrapulmonary TB involving the liver and the central nervous system. Following the identification of the causative agent, the patient commenced antibacterial therapy comprising rifampicin, ethambutol, and isoniazid with adjunctive dexamethasone. Despite targeted treatment and instituted supportive therapy, the patient exhibited an unfavorable progression and eventually succumbed 57 days after diagnosis. This case highlights an unusual manifestation of a patient with disseminated extrapulmonary TB, emphasizing the importance of early diagnostic suspicion for clinicians. The unfavorable disease progression despite appropriate targeted treatment prompts reflection on whether the delay in diagnosis and provision of anti-TB drugs may have played a major role in the prognosis of the patient.
