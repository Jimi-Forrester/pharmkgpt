31753142|t|Delirium in the critically ill patient.
31753142|a|Delirium is an acute and transient brain dysfunction that is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, affecting both its content (i.e., attention) and level (i.e., arousal). It affects as many as 50% of those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Once believed to be an inconsequential outcome of critical illness, it is now recognized that delirium is harmful in both the short- and long-term. Despite occurring frequently in critically ill patients, delirium often goes unrecognized. Well-validated delirium screening tools, designed for use in the ICU, should be used to reliably detect delirium. The first step in delirium treatment is to identify and address potentially modifiable risk factors. Multiple trials have shown that benzodiazepines are a risk factor for delirium in a dose-dependent manner. Sedation with nonbenzodiazepine-based strategies are an effective means by which to reduce delirium. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as those which seek to reduce sensory impairment, sleep deprivation, and immobility are effective. Pharmacologic treatment with antipsychotics, though commonly used, is not supported by findings from placebo-controlled trials. Recent data support from multiple trials support the use of the "ABCDEF bundle" as a means by which to reduce delirium.
