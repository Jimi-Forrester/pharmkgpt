35388457|t|Pregnancy and neurologic complications of COVID-19: A scoping review.
35388457|a|While neurologic complications are frequently reported among patients with COVID-19 in the general population, they are unknown in pregnant women. This paper summarizes the case reports of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection plus a specified neurologic diagnosis. Until November 2021, 18 case reports were found. Both the central and peripheral nervous systems were equally affected: delirium (n = 1), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (n = 4), cerebrovascular disease (n = 2), acute cerebral demyelinating disease (n = 1), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (n = 1), Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 5), including one patient who also had vestibular neuritis, Bell's palsy (n = 3), and rhabdomyolysis (n = 1). The median maternal age was 32.5 (25-35) years, the median gestational age was 34 (30-36.5) weeks, and 38.9% presented previous medical conditions. Respiratory symptoms were reported in 76.5%, and 76.5% received immunotherapies to treat the COVID-19 or the neurologic complications. Half the women required admission to ICU and, more often, were those with central nervous system involvement (77.8% vs. 22.2%; Chi-square test, p = .018). For 64.7% of women, the most common method of delivery was surgical, although just one case was due to the neurologic complication. There were reports of one spontaneous abortion, two fetal deaths, and no maternal deaths. Only one case presented a poor neurologic outcome. It is possible that our findings are underestimated, considering that there are thousands of reports regarding neurologic complications in the general population with COVID-19.
