33317322|t|The Tumorigenic Effect of Sphingosine Kinase 1 and Its Potential Therapeutic Target.
33317322|a|Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) regulates cell proliferation and survival by converting sphingosine to the signaling mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). SPHK1 is widely overexpressed in most cancers, promoting tumor progression and is associated with clinical prognosis. Numerous studies have explored SPHK1 as a promising target for cancer therapy. However, due to insufficient knowledge of SPHK1 oncogenic mechanisms, its inhibitors' therapeutic potential in preventing and treating cancer still needs further investigation. In this review, we summarized the metabolic balance regulated by the SPHK1/S1P signaling pathway and highlighted the oncogenic mechanisms of SPHK1 via the upregulation of autophagy, proliferation, and survival, migration, angiogenesis and inflammation, and inhibition of apoptosis. Drug candidates targeting SPHK1 were also discussed at the end. This review provides new insights into the oncogenic effect of SPHK1 and sheds light on the future direction for targeting SPHK1 as cancer therapy.
