36605060|t|Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis After Greenlight Laser Prostate Surgery.
36605060|a|Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory disease. Multiple risk factors have been defined for the manifestation of HLH. While infection remains the top risk factor, having multiple surgical procedures has also been suggested as a potential risk factor for HLH. Our patient presented with generalized weakness, weight loss, and fatigue after having a greenlight laser prostatectomy for benign prostate hypertrophy; the patient deteriorated rapidly and was found to fulfill the HLH 2004 and modified criteria. We believe this patient had a rare bone marrow disorder with a rare complicated clinical and laboratory presentation.
