15036403|t|Differences between recognition memory and remote memory for olfactory and visual stimuli in nondemented elderly individuals genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
15036403|a|Recognition and remote memory for olfactory and visual stimuli were assessed in nondemented elderly individuals positive for the apolipoprotein E 4 allele and in 4 negative controls to examine whether the 4 allele differentially affects recognition and/or remote memory depending on the modality of stimulus to be remembered. Compared to controls, 4 positive individuals committed more false positive recognition memory errors for olfactory but not visual stimuli suggesting that 4 positive individuals may show false positive errors for olfactory stimuli before deficits for other stimuli are detectable. There were no significant differences in familiarity ratings (a proposed measure of remote memory) suggesting that brain areas involved in remote memory are not affected in nondemented 4 positive individuals. The results suggest that neuropathological changes in nondemented individuals genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease may differentially affect memory processes.
