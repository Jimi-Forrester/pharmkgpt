32105418|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective cohort study was to determine the incidence and neuroimaging risk factors associated with Babinski sign following acute ischemic stroke, as well as its relationship with the functional outcome of patients. METHODS: A total of 351 patients were enrolled in the study within 7 days of acute ischemic stroke. The Babinski sign along with other upper motor neuron signs were examined upon admission and between days 1 and 3 and days 5 and 7 after admission. Neuroimaging parameters included site and volume of infarction and white matter lesions. All patients were followed up at 3 months. Functional outcome was assessed with the Lawton Activities of Daily Living scale and modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: Babinski sign was observed in 115 of 351 (32.8%) patients in the acute ischemic stroke. These patients had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at admission and higher rates of atrial fibrillation and cardioembolism; higher frequencies of frontal, temporal, and limbic lobes and basal ganglia infarcts; and larger infarct volume. Higher NIHSS score and basal ganglia infarct were significant predictors of the presence of Babinski sign. After adjusting for confounds, the presence of Babinski sign did not predict poor functional outcome. CONCLUSION: The incidence of Babinski sign was 32.8% in the acute ischemic stroke. Severe infarction and basal ganglia infarct were independent predictors of Babinski sign. Although Babinski sign is common in acute ischemic stroke patients, it does not predict poor functional outcome 3 months later.
