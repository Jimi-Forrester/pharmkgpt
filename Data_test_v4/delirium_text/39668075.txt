39668075|t|Neuropathology meets chemical and genetic pathology head-on: a personal perspective.
39668075|a|Medical science has made revolutionary discoveries around the nosology and aetiology of the neurodegenerative diseases. Dementia is the second leading cause of death in Australia. My colleagues and I are now looking at therapeutics which potentially can delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Advances in diagnosis allow detection of preclinical AD. Neuropathologists working closely with chemical and genetic pathologists have a major role to play in pushing diagnostics and therapeutics to the forefront of clinical management of these diseases.
