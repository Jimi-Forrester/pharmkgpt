32961777|a|BACKGROUND: Recent anti-aging interventions have shown contradictory impacts of (poly)phenols regarding the prevention of cognitive decline and maintenance of brain function. These discrepancies have been linked to between-study differences in supplementation protocols. This subgroup analysis and meta-regression aimed to (i) examine differential effects of moderator variables related to participant characteristics and supplementation protocols and (ii) identify practical recommendations to design effective (poly)phenol supplementation protocols for future anti-aging interventions. METHODS: Multiple electronic databases (Web of Science; PubMed) searched for relevant intervention published from inception to July 2019. Using the PICOS criteria, a total of 4303 records were screened. Only high-quality studies (n = 15) were included in the final analyses. Random-effects meta-analysis was used, and we calculated standard differences in means (SDM), effect size (ES), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for two sufficiently comparable items (i.e., psychomotor function and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)). When significant heterogeneity was computed (I2 > 50%), a subgroup and meta-regression analysis were performed to examine the moderation effects of participant characteristics and supplementation protocols. RESULTS: The reviewed studies support the beneficial effect of (poly)phenols-rich supplementation on psychomotor functions (ES = -0.677, p = 0.001) and brain plasticity (ES = 1.168, p = 0.028). Subgroup analysis revealed higher beneficial impacts of (poly)phenols (i) in younger populations compared to older (SDM = -0.89 vs. -0.47 for psychomotor performance, and 2.41 vs. 0.07 for BDNF, respectively), (ii) following an acute compared to chronic supplementation (SDM = -1.02 vs. -0.43 for psychomotor performance), and (iii) using a phenolic compound with medium compared to low bioavailability rates (SDM = -0.76 vs. -0.68 for psychomotor performance and 3.57 vs. 0.07 for DBNF, respectively). Meta-regressions revealed greater improvement in BDNF levels with lower percentages of female participants (Q = 40.15, df = 6, p < 0.001) and a skewed scatter plot toward a greater impact using higher (poly)phenols doses. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that age group, gender, the used phenolic compounds, their human bioavailability rate, and the supplementation dose as the primary moderator variables relating to the beneficial effects of (poly)phenol consumption on cognitive and brain function in humans. Therefore, it seems more advantageous to start anti-aging (poly)phenol interventions in adults earlier in life using medium ( 500 mg) to high doses ( 1000 mg) of phenolic compounds, with at least medium bioavailability rate (>=9%).
