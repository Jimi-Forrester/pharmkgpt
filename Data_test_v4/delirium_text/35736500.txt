35736500|t|FADS Polymorphisms Affect the Clinical and Biochemical Phenotypes of Metabolic Syndrome.
35736500|a|Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) play important roles in human health, from controlling inflammation to lipid and glucose homeostasis. In our previous study, which employed a cluster analysis of a plasma fatty acid (FA) pattern, we identified two clusters of metabolic syndrome (MetS) independent of clinical and biochemical parameters within the whole study group (controls together with metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients). FA desaturase (FADS) genes are the key regulators of LC-PUFA metabolism. The aim of this study was to analyze associations between FADS polymorphisms and clusters of MetS. The study group consisted of 188 controls and 166 patients with MetS. The first cluster contained 71 controls (CON1) and 109 MetS patients (MetS1). The second cluster consisted of 117 controls (CON2) and 57 MetS patients (MetS2). In comparison with MetS2, cluster MetS1 displayed a more adverse risk profile. Cluster CON1 had, in comparison with CON2, higher body weight and increased triacylglycerol levels (p < 0.05). We found that the FADS rs174537 (p < 0.001), rs174570 (p < 0.01), and rs174602 (p < 0.05) polymorphisms along with two inferred haplotypes had statistically significant genotype associations with the splitting of MetS into MetS1 and MetS2. Conversely, we observed no significant differences in the distribution of FADS polymorphisms between MetS and CON subjects, or between CON1 and CON2. These associations between FADS polymorphisms and two clusters of MetS (differing in waist circumference, HOMA-IR, lipolysis, and oxidative stress) implicate the important influence of genetic factors on the phenotypic manifestation of MetS.
