18953108|a|Antibodies towards the N-terminal region of the amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaP) bind to Abeta fibrils, leading to their disaggregation. We developed an immunization procedure using filamentous phages displaying the only four amino acids EFRH encompassing amino acids 3-6 of the 42 residues of AbetaP, found to be the main regulatory site for Abeta formation. Phages displaying EFRH epitope are effective in eliciting humoral response against AbetaP which, in turn, relieves amyloid burden in brains of amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic mice, improving their ability to perform cognitive tasks. In order to overcome the low permeability of the blood brain barrier for targeting 'anti-aggregating' monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to Abeta plaques in the brain, we applied antibody engineering methods to minimize the size of mAbs while maintaining their biological activity. Single-chain antibodies displayed on the surface of filamentous phage showed the ability to enter the central nervous system (CNS). The genetically engineered filamentous bacteriophage proved to be an efficient, nontoxic viral delivery vector to the brain, offering an obvious advantage over other mammalian vectors. The feasibility of these novel strategies for production and targeting of anti-aggregating antibodies against Abeta plaques to disease affected regions in the CNS may have clinical potential for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
