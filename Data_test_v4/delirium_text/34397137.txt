34397137|t|Delirium Reduction by Analgesia Management in Hip Fracture surgery (DRAM-HF): Exploration of perceived facilitators and barriers.
34397137|a|OBJECTIVES: In tandem with the implementation of a multidisciplinary protocol which was successful in reducing delirium after hip fracture surgery (DRAM-HF), we sought to investigate enablers and barriers to same. METHODS: Single-centre, prospective, before-and-after questionnaire targeted at health-care professionals involved in DRAM-HF. We assessed respondent-reported enablers and barriers to the multidisciplinary protocol, using 0-100 agreement scales and free-text responses. RESULTS: A total of 134 preintervention and 124 postintervention responses were collated (out of 200, response rates 67% and 62%, respectively). Preintervention support for DRAM-HF was 100% (n = 130) and postintervention 95.9% (n = 116). Study design was well received with a mean score of 76.7 (SD 19.7) for being easy to understand. Support for additional computer alert systems was also high (mean 73.6, SD 23.9). Free-text responses emphasised the need for integration of ward pharmacists into medication optimisation (n = 31) and upskilling nurse practitioners (n = 23). CONCLUSION: Whilst generally supported, DRAM-HF implementation may be streamlined by optimising electronic delivery, offering targeted education and expanding roles.
