31193797|a|BACKGROUND: Combined tracheostomy and thyroidectomy is usually done in case of removal of a large goiter causing damage to the tracheal wall. Thyroidectomy to get access to the trachea for surgical airway is a rare procedure. Tracheostomy following cervical spinal fracture is challenging as no hyperextension can be provided limiting exposure. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old intoxicated male with a head on bicycle accident suffered a C1 fracture and cervical spinal shock requiring emergent intubation. The C1 fracture was managed with a cervical collar. The patient improved neurologically on the ICU; however, he could not be weaned from mechanical ventilation thus requiring tracheostomy. On initial trauma CT-scan, a large goiter displacing the trachea to the left side was seen. He was kept in line stabilized using towels in the OR. A 5 cm transverse neck incision was made. The large partially retrosternal goiter reaching the aortic arch was stepwise mobilized out of the neck. The isthmus was divided; the enlarged right lobe was brought out of the neck and resected. The trachea was pulled to the midline, crosswise incised, the skin flaps were sutured down and a 7 Shiley cannula was inserted. A PEG tube was placed. The patient had a protracted course but ultimately was transferred alert and oriented to a long-term rehabilitation facility moving all extremities. CONCLUSION: Combined thyroidectomy with tracheostomy in the setting of cervical fracture is technically challenging but was an essential step in the recovery of this patient.
