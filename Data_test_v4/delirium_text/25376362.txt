25376362|t|The Shanghai Aging Study: study design, baseline characteristics, and prevalence of dementia.
25376362|a|BACKGROUND: To establish a prospective cohort to enumerate the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among residents aged >=60 in an urban community of Shanghai, China. METHODS: Participants received clinical evaluations including physical measurements, demographic and lifestyle questionnaires, physical and neurologic examinations, and neuropsychological testing. Urine and blood samples were collected, aliquoted, and stored. DNA was extracted for Apolipoprotein (APOE) genotyping. Diagnoses of dementia and MCI were made using standard criteria via consensus diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 3,141 participants aged >=60, 1,438 (45.8%) were men. The average age of participants was 72.3 years (SD 8.1), and they had an average of 11.6 years (SD 4.4) of education. The most common chronic disease of participants was hypertension (56.4%). The frequencies of APOE-epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4 were 7.9, 82.7 and 9.4%, respectively. We diagnosed 156 (5.0%, 95% CI 4.3-5.8%) participants with dementia. The prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were 3.6% (95% CI 3.0-4.3%) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.5-1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The Shanghai Aging Study is the first prospective community-based cohort study of cognitive impairment in China, with a comparable study design, procedures, and diagnostic criteria for dementia and MCI to most previous cohort studies in developed countries.
