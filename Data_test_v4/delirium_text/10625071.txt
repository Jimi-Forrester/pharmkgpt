10625071|t|Mitogen-activated protein kinase is involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation of amyloid precursor protein cleavage.
10625071|a|Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Several lines of evidence suggest that glutamatergic hypoactivity exists in the Alzheimer's disease brain, where it may contribute to both brain amyloid burden and cognitive dysfunction. Although metabotropic glutamate receptors have been shown to alter cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, little attention has been paid to the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in this process. We now report that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells increases production of the soluble amyloid precursor protein derivative. Moreover, using both pharmacological and gene transfer techniques, we show that this effect is largely due to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, specifically the pathway leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase but not other mitogen-activated protein kinases. These observations further our understanding of the pathways that regulate amyloid precursor protein cleavage, and buttress the notion that regulation of amyloid precursor protein cleavage is critically dependent upon the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
