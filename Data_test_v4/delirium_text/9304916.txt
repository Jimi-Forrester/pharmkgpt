9304916|t|[Study on nurse-patient relationships in patients with fractures and traumatic delirium].
9304916|a|Having obvious psychical defect, the fractured patients were different from other orthopedical patients. The characteristics of disease courses of 63 patients were analyzed in this study. The result indicated that at the time of pre-operation, the end of first post-operation week, and the end of second post-operation week there were significant difference in patients' psychical condition (P < 0.05). At the end of third post-operation week, the physical trauma were cured and their psychical condition turned to be almost normal. It may related to the nurse patient relationship model, active-passive model, and guidance-cooperation model which were used during deliria period, recovering period, and smooth period. Using these models effectively may improve the recovery of the patients physically and psychologically.
