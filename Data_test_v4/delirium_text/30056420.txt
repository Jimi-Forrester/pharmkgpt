30056420|t|Prevalence, Safety, and Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulant Use in People with and without Dementia or Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
30056420|a|BACKGROUND: Differences in management and outcomes of oral anticoagulant (OAC) use may exist for people with and without dementia or cognitive impairment (CI). OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the prevalence and safety and effectiveness outcomes of OAC use in people with and without dementia or CI. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for studies reporting prevalence or safety and effectiveness outcomes of OAC use for people with and without dementia, published between 2000 to September 2017. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: studies met pre-specified inclusion criteria (21 prevalence studies, 6 outcomes studies). People with dementia had 52% lower odds of receiving OAC compared to people without dementia. Mean OAC prevalence was 32% for people with dementia, compared to 48% without dementia. There was no difference in the composite outcome of embolic events, myocardial infarction, and all-cause death between dementia and non-dementia groups (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.72, 95% CI, 0.45-1.14, p = 0.155). Bleeding rate was lower for people without dementia (HR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.37-0.85). Adverse warfarin events were more common for residents of long-term care with dementia (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI, 1.20-1.82). Community-dwelling people with dementia treated with warfarin had poorer anticoagulation control than those without dementia (mean time in therapeutic range (TTR) % +-SD, 38+-26 (dementia), 61+-27 (no dementia), p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: A lower proportion of people with dementia received oral anticoagulation compared with people without dementia. People with dementia had higher bleeding risk and poorer anticoagulation control when treated with warfarin.
