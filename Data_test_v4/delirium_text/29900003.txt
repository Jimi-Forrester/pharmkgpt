29900003|a|BACKGROUND: Although cognitive dysfunction is a leading cause of disability and poor quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), it is infrequently tested in routine clinical evaluation. Development of a cognitive testing paradigm that captured MS-related cognitive dysfunction and could be obtained in a routine clinical setting may increase surveillance and recognition of cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: This was a pilot study to determine if Cognivue could find cognitive performance differences between patients with MS and healthy controls (HC).Methods: A total of 24 patients with MS and 12 HCs between 18 and 50 years old were enrolled. Baseline testing included an Expanded Disability Scale (EDSS), paced auditory serial additions test (PASAT), symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) and Cognivue. Subjects then had repeat testing every 1-2 months for a maximum of three tests. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between MS and HC on SDMT, PASAT, and Cognivue Total score. Most Cognivue subtests showed significant differences between MS and HC. Cognivue scores correlated with both SDMT and PASAT and had high test-retest reliability in HCs. CONCLUSION: Cognivue was able to detect multi-domain cognitive dysfunction in MS. Further studies to determine validity of Cognivue in MS with comparison with neuropsychological testing and sensitivity to clinical change are still needed.
