However, it is still unknown how vascular pathology differentially impacts primary age-related tauopathy (PART) compared to AD. Therefore, our objectives were to compare the brain microangiopathic burden in patients with PART and AD, evaluated by MRI, while assessing its relation with neuropathological findings, patterns of brain atrophy and degree of clinical impairment. METHODS: Clinical information, brain MRI (T1 and T2-FLAIR) and neuropathological data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre ongoing study, with a total sample of 167 patients identified, that were divided according to the presence of neuritic plaques in Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) 0 to 3. Microangiopathic burden and brain atrophy were evaluated by two certified neuroradiologists, using, respectively, the Fazekas score and previously validated visual rating scales to assess brain regional atrophy. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between the Fazekas score and atrophy in the fronto-insular and medial temporal regions on both groups, with PART showing overall stronger positive correlations than in AD, especially in the fronto-insular region. For this specific cohort, no significant correlations were found between the Fazekas score and the degree of clinical impairment. CONCLUSION: Our results show that PART presents different pathological consequences at the brain microvascular level compared with AD and further supports PART as an independent pathological entity from AD.
