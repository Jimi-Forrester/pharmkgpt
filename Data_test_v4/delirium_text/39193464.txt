39193464|a|It is estimated that 45% of individuals with cognitive impairment experience sleep disturbances prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms. Assessing sleeping problems and enhancing sleep quality are critical first steps to reduce the risk of cognitive impairment. Objective: To review existing literature based on predefined eligibility criteria to understand the connection between sleep disturbance and Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A thorough and systematic evaluation of numerous studies was carried out to assess one or more of the following epidemiological factors: (1) sleep disorders, (2) cognitive impairment, and (3) risk estimates for cognitive impairment due to sleep. Results: Studies suggest that individuals who experience memory loss may encounter sleep disturbances before noticing other symptoms. Numerous sleep disorders, such as excessive and inadequate sleep duration, poor sleep quality, circadian rhythm abnormalities, insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnea were found to increase the risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Additionally, lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration have been linked to higher cerebral-beta-amyloid levels. Objective evidence for the development of cognitive impairment is provided by the architecture of sleep stages. Patients experiencing sleep problems may benefit from specific types of sleep medicine as a preventative measure against cognitive decline. Conclusion: Sleep disorders can have adverse effects on cognitive health. The duration and quality of sleep are fundamental factors for maintaining a healthy brain as we age. Proper sleep can aid prevent cognitive impairment, particularly Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
