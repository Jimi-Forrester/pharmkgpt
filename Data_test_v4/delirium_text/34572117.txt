34572117|t|An Autophagy Modulator Peptide Prevents Lung Function Decrease and Corrects Established Inflammation in Murine Models of Airway Allergy.
34572117|a|The involvement of autophagy and its dysfunction in asthma is still poorly documented. By using a murine model of chronic house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation, we tested the expression of several autophagy markers in the lung and spleen of asthma-like animals. Compared to control mice, in HDM-sensitized and challenged mice, the expression of sequestosome-1/p62, a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays an important role in the autophagy machinery, was raised in the splenocytes. In contrast, its expression was decreased in the neutrophils recovered from the bronchoalveolar fluid, indicating that autophagy was independently regulated in these two compartments. In a strategy of drug repositioning, we treated allergen-sensitized mice with the therapeutic peptide P140 known to target chaperone-mediated autophagy. A single intravenous administration of P140 in these mice resulted in a significant reduction in airway resistance and elastance, and a reduction in the number of neutrophils and eosinophils present in the bronchoalveolar fluid. It corrected the autophagic alteration without showing any suppressive effect in the production of IgG1 and IgE. Collectively, these findings show that autophagy processes are altered in allergic airway inflammation. This cellular pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for treating selected patients with asthma.
