37470225|t|Quantitative Assays for Catalytic Photo-Oxygenation of Alzheimer Disease-Related Tau Proteins.
37470225|a|Catalytic photo-oxygenation of tau amyloid is a potential therapeutic approach to tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease (AD). However, tau is a complex target containing great molecular size and heterogeneous isoforms/proteoforms. Although catalytic photo-oxygenation has been confirmed when using catalyst 1 and recombinant tau pretreated with heparin, its effects on tau from human patients have not yet been clarified. In this study, focusing on the histidine residues being oxygenated, we have constructed two assay systems capable of quantitatively evaluating the catalytic activity when used on human patient tau: (1) fluorescence labeling at oxygenated histidine sites and (2) LC-MS/MS analysis of histidine-containing fragments. Using these assays, we identified 2 as a promising catalyst for oxygenation of human tau. In addition, our results suggest that aggregated tau induced by heparin is different from actual AD patient tau in developing effective photo-oxygenation catalysts.
