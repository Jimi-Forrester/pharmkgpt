36294507|t|11beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 as a Potential Treatment Target in Cardiovascular Diseases.
36294507|a|Glucocorticoids (GCs) belong to the group of steroid hormones. Their representative in humans is cortisol. GCs are involved in most physiological processes of the body and play a significant role in important biological processes, including reproduction, growth, immune responses, metabolism, maintenance of water and electrolyte balance, functioning of the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. The availability of cortisol to the glucocorticoid receptor is locally controlled by the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1). Evidence of changes in intracellular GC metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular complications highlights the role of selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibition in the pharmacotherapy of these diseases. This paper discusses the role of 11beta-HSD1 in MetS and its cardiovascular complications and the importance of selective inhibition of 11beta-HSD1.
