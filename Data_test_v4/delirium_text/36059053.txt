36059053|t|Suicide Risk in Survivors of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Nationwide Cohort Study in South Korea.
36059053|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the prevalence and risk factors of suicide among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. This study included all adults admitted to intensive care units with a diagnosis of ARDS from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019, who survived >=365. The primary endpoint in this study was suicide within 1 year of an ARDS diagnosis, which was determined as death by a suicide attempt or self-harm. RESULTS: Analysis included 9,928 patients identified as ARDS survivors. One-year all-cause mortality occurred in 5,021 patients, 186 (1.9%) of which died by suicide. In multivariable Cox regression, older age, continuous renal replacement therapy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation incidence, history of self-harm or attempted suicide and concurrent substance abuse were associated with a higher risk of death by suicide among ARDS survivors. CONCLUSION: During the 1-year follow-up period, 1.9% of ARDS survivors died by suicide in South Korea, and some factors were identified as potential risk factors for death by suicide. Knowledge of the factors associated with suicide might allow for earlier intervention to potentially reduce the death by suicide among ARDS survivors.
