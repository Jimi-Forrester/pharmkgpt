38399591|t|Delirium and Its Associations with Critical Care Utilizations and Outcomes at the Time of Hospital Discharge in Patients with Acute Brain Injury.
38399591|a|Background and Objectives: We analyzed delirium testing, delirium prevalence, critical care associations outcomes at the time of hospital discharge in patients with acute brain injury (ABI) due to acute ischemic stroke (AIS), non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), non-traumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to an intensive care unit. Materials and Methods: We examined the frequency of assessment for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. We assessed delirium testing frequency, associated factors, positive test outcomes, and their correlations with clinical care, including nonpharmacological interventions and pain, agitation, and distress management. Results: Amongst 11,322 patients with ABI, delirium was tested in 8220 (726%). Compared to patients 18-44 years of age, patients 65-79 years (aOR 0.79 [0.69, 0.90]), and those 80 years and older (aOR 0.58 [0.50, 0.68]) were less likely to undergo delirium testing. Compared to English-speaking patients, non-English-speaking patients (aOR 0.73 [0.64, 0.84]) were less likely to undergo delirium testing. Amongst 8220, 2217 (27.2%) tested positive for delirium. For every day in the ICU, the odds of testing positive for delirium increased by 1.11 [0.10, 0.12]. Delirium was highest in those 80 years and older (aOR 3.18 [2.59, 3.90]). Delirium was associated with critical care resource utilization and with significant odds of mortality (aOR 7.26 [6.07, 8.70] at the time of hospital discharge. Conclusions: In conclusion, we find that seven out of ten patients in the neurocritical care unit are tested for delirium, and approximately two out of every five patients test positive for delirium. We demonstrate disparities in delirium testing by age and preferred language, identified high-risk subgroups, and the association between delirium, critical care resource use, complications, discharge GCS, and disposition. Prioritizing equitable testing and diagnosis, especially for elderly and non-English-speaking patients, is crucial for delivering quality care to this vulnerable group.
