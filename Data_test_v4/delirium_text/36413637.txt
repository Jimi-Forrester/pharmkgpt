METHODS: We performed quantitative EEG analysis for 16 LBD and 14 non-LBD patients. After artifact removal, a fast Fourier transform was performed on 90, 60, and thirty 2-second epochs to derive dominant frequency; dominant frequency variability; and dominant frequency prevalence. RESULTS: In LBD patients, there were no significant differences in EEG features derived from 90, 60, and thirty 2-second epochs (all P >0.05). There were no significant differences in EEG features derived from 3 different groups of thirty 2-second epochs (all P >0.05). When analyzing EEG features derived from ninety 2-second epochs, we found that LBD had significantly reduced dominant frequency, reduced dominant frequency variability, and reduced dominant frequency prevalence alpha compared with the non-LBD group (all P <0.05). These same differences were observed between the LBD and non-LBD groups when analyzing thirty 2-second epochs. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in EEG features derived from 1 minute versus 3 minutes of EEG data, and both durations of EEG data equally differentiated LBD from non-LBD.
