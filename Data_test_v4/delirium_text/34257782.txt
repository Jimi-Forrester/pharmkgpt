34257782|t|Adult onset acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: A case report.
34257782|a|Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an immune mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, it predominantly affects children in the age group between of 5-8 years. Is most widely thought to be a post-viral, post-vaccination autoimmune phenomenon. We present a case of 40 years old Pakistani male arrived to ER agitated with decrease level of consciousness and delirium, develop tonic-clonic convulsion and it was relieved by DIAZEPAM. This is the first attack to the patient with no past medical history of similar presentation. MRI showed supra and infratentorial white matter high T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities, involving supratentorial cortical and subcortical parito-occipital region, also to less extent at deep white matter predominantly right tempro-occipital region in asymmetric pattern. Involvement of juxta cortical and U fibers. MRI raised the possibility of adult onset Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, after exclusion of other causes of juxta cortical and U fibers involvement (based on imaging analysis with consideration of clinical presentation and available lab results).
