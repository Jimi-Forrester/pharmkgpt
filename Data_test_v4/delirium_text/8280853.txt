8280853|a|Plasma transferrin binding in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease is significantly reduced compared with age matched controls and it was thought this may help elucidate a pathological time sequence for the onset of dementia in Down syndrome. In Down syndrome, there was a reduction in gallium and aluminium transferrin binding both with age and the onset of dementia. Non-transferrin bound gallium species were identified as non-transportable phosphate or silicate. Thus, the route of entry of metals into the brain must be via a transferrin mediated complex only. A clear sequence of pathological events has been demonstrated in Down syndrome which shows the pathway to development of plaques and dementia and this is believed to have an immunological origin.
