33038618|a|The pulmonary manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are well known. The literature on neurological manifestations and complications in patients with COVID-19 has been increasing but is still sparse. At present, there are only a few reported case reports and clinical studies on neurological manifestations of COVID-19, of which ischemic stroke is one of the most common ones. Coagulopathy and vascular endothelial dysfunction have been proposed as the complications of COVID-19 which can ultimately lead to ischemic stroke. In this case report, we present a case of multifocal ischemic stroke in a patient with COVID-19. This patient had persistent encephalopathy and dysarthria after recovering from hypoxic respiratory failure and subsequently developed ischemic stroke in multiple vascular territories during hospital admission.
