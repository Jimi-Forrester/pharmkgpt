17144902|a|Novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders comprise drug candidates designed specifically to act on multiple CNS targets. We have synthesized a multifunctional non-toxic, brain permeable iron chelator drug, M-30, possessing propargyl monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory neuroprotective and iron-chelating moieties, from our prototype iron chelator VK-28. In the present study M-30 was shown to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities, including pro-survival neurorescue effects, induction of neuronal differentiation and regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels. M-30 was found to decrease apoptosis of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a neurorescue, serum deprivation model, via reduction of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bax, and inhibition of the apoptosis-associated phosphorylated H2A.X protein (Ser 139) and caspase 3 activation. In addition, M-30 induced the outgrowth of neurites, triggered cell cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1) phase and enhanced the expression of growth associated protein-43. Furthermore, M-30 markedly reduced the levels of cellular APP and beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) and the levels of the amyloidogenic Abeta peptide in the medium of SH-SY5Y cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the APP 'Swedish' mutation. Levels of the non-amyloidogenic soluble APPalpha and alpha-CTF in the medium and cell lysate respectively were coordinately increased. These properties, together with its brain selective MAO inhibitory and propargylamine- dependent neuroprotective effects, suggest that M-30 might serve as an ideal drug for neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, in which oxidative stress and iron dysregulation have been implicated.
