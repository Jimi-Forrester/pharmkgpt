39065590|t|The Role of Different Types of Cannabinoids in Periodontal Disease: An Integrative Review.
39065590|a|This integrative review addresses the potential of the Endocannabinoid System (ES) and cannabinoids in the pathogenesis and treatment of periodontal disease (PD). Cannabinoid receptors are expressed in healthy and inflamed periodontal tissues, indicating a potential regulatory role for SEC in oral homeostasis. Healthy periodontal cells express more CB1 receptors, while inflamed sites show increased CB2 receptors. This suggests a dynamic involvement of the SEC in the inflammatory response associated with PD. Cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinoid receptor agonists such as HU-308, anandamide (AEA), and methanamide (Meta-AEA) have demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in studies. CBD has been associated with the control of bone resorption, antibacterial activity, and increased production of gingival fibroblasts, indicating effects in mitigating the progression of PD. HU-308 demonstrated preventive effects against alveolar bone loss, and anti-inflammatory, osteoprotective, and pro-homeostatic properties in animal models of periodontitis. AEA and Meta-AEA have anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The activation of cannabinoid receptors attenuates inflammatory processes, inhibits alveolar bone loss, exerts antibacterial effects, and promotes tissue repair. However, clinical trials are especially needed to validate these results and explore the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in the treatment of PD in humans.
