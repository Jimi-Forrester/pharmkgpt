35274703|t|The Crosstalk Between Adipose-Derived Stem or Stromal Cells (ASC) and Cancer Cells and ASC-Mediated Effects on Cancer Formation and Progression-ASCs: Safety Hazard or Harmless Source of Tropism?
35274703|a|Adipose-derived stem or stromal cells (ASCs) possess promising potential in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their secretory activity, their multilineage differentiation potential, their easy harvest, and their rich yield compared to other stem cell sources. After the first identification of ASCs in humans in 2001, the knowledge of their cell biology and cell characteristics have advanced, and respective therapeutic options were determined. Nowadays, ASC-based therapies are on the verge of translation into clinical practice. However, conflicting evidence emerged in recent years about the safety profile of ASC applications as they may induce tumor progression and invasion. Numerous in-vitro and in-vivo studies demonstrate a potential pro-oncogenic effect of ASCs on various cancer entities. This raises questions about the safety profile of ASCs and their broad handling and administration. However, these findings spark controversy as in clinical studies ASC application did not elevate tumor incidence rates, and other experimental studies reported an inhibitory effect of ASCs on different cancer cell types. This comprehensive review aims at providing up-to-date information about ASCs and cancer cell interactions, and their potential carcinogenesis and tumor tropism. The extracellular signaling activity of ASCs, the interaction of ASCs with the tumor microenvironment, and 3 major organ systems (the breast, the skin, and genitourinary system) will be presented with regard to cancer formation and progression.
