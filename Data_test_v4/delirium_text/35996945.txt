35996945|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF), and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) in terms of global sagittal alignment. METHODS: From January 2007 to December 2019, 141 adult patients who underwent multilevel interbody fusion for lumbar degenerative disorders were enrolled. Regarding the approach, patients were divided into the ALIF (n=23), OLIF (n=60), and TLIF (n=58) groups. Outcomes, including local radiographic parameters and global sagittal alignment, were then compared between the treatment groups. RESULTS: Regarding local radiographic parameters, ALIF and OLIF were superior to TLIF in terms of the change in the anterior disc height (7.6+-4.5 mm vs. 6.9+-3.2 mm vs. 4.7+-2.9 mm, p=0.000), disc angle (-10.0 +-6.3  vs. -9.2 +-5.2  vs. -5.1 +-5.1 , p=0.000), and fused segment lordosis (-14.5 +-11.3  vs. -13.8 +-7.5  vs. -7.4 +-9.1 , p=0.000). However, regarding global sagittal alignment, postoperative lumbar lordosis (-42.5 +-9.6  vs. -44.4 +-11.6  vs. -40.6 +-12.3 , p=0.210), pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch (7.9 +-11.3  vs. 6.7 +-11.6  vs. 11.5 +-13.0 , p=0.089), and the sagittal vertical axis (24.3+-28.5 mm vs. 24.5+-34.0 mm vs. 25.2+-36.6 mm, p=0.990) did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: Although the anterior approaches were superior in terms of local radiographic parameters, TLIF achieved adequate global sagittal alignment, comparable to the anterior approaches.
