23795437|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the perioperative complications of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. METHODS: From June 2009 to December 2011, 63 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture underwent PKP, there were 18 males and 45 females with an average age of 75.3 years ( ranged, 62 to 91). All patients with severe back pain and without neurological symptoms and signs, which were confirmed by X-ray and MRI. Among them,there were 63 cases with severe osteoporosis, 37 cases with hypertension, 10 with coronary artery disease, 29 with anemia, 26 with diabetes, 11 with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and 8 with gastritis and peptic ulcer. The common perioperative complications were retropectively reviewed. RESULTS: Preoperative complications occured in 9 cases (14.3%), including hypostatic pneumonia (1 case), electrolyte disturbances (2 cases), urinary tract infection (2 cases), moderate anemia(2 cases),electrolyte disturbances combined with moderate anemia (1 case), hypostatic pneumonia combined with delirium (1 case). Intraoperative and postoperative. complications occurred in 17 cases (26.9%), there were bone cement correlated complications in 9 cases (14.3%), in which 2 cases of toxic reaction of bone cement and 7 cases of leakage (2 cases had clinical symptoms); there were non-bone cement correlated complications in 3 cases (4.8%), in which 1 case of focal hematoma caused by paracentesis, 1 case of transient nerve injury, 1 case of left intercostal neuralgia;there were transient hyperpathia in 5 cases after operation. All complications result in no severe consequence after treatment. CONCLUSION: Perioperative complications of percutaneous kyphoplasty are not uncommon,however,these complications may not cause serious consequence after active treatment,so prevention and treatment are important for it.
