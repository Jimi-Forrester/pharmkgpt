39862174|t|Utilization of Potentially Inappropriate Sedative-Hypnotic and Atypical Antipsychotic Medications among Elderly Individuals with Insomnia and Alzheimer's Disease.
39862174|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the utilization of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) including oral sedative-hypnotic and atypical antipsychotic (OSHAA), healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and costs among elderly individuals with insomnia and in the subpopulation with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) who also had a diagnosis of insomnia. METHODS: Using claims database containing International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes, the cohort included individuals aged >= 65 with incident insomnia (EI, N=152,969) and AD insomnia subpopulation (ADI, N=4,888). Proportion of patients utilizing atypical antipsychotics or oral sedative-hypnotic medications, namely z-drugs, benzodiazepines, doxepin, Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists (DORAs), and melatonin agonists, were assessed. Inappropriate OSHAA utilization was defined as per the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers criteria. Multivariable models were utilized to compare HCRU and costs between PIM-OSHAA and no PIM-OSHAA groups. RESULTS: Among the EI cohort, z-drugs (13.39%) were the most commonly utilized OSHAA, and in the ADI cohort, it was AAPs (29.97%). PIM-OSHAA was utilized by 20% of the EI and 35% of the ADI cohorts. Patients with PIM-OSHAA use among the EI cohort had a higher annualized adjusted mean HCRU (pharmacy visits: 31.21 vs. 23.68; ambulatory & outpatient visits: 18.55 vs. 16.85) and costs, primarily due to medical costs (mean total cost: $36,676.08 vs. $31,346.54) compared to those without. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial utilization of PIM-OSHAA was observed in EI and ADI cohorts. PIM-OSHAA use was associated with higher HCRU and costs. These findings underscore the importance of appropriate treatment strategies for insomnia in the elderly population especially in those with concurrent AD.
