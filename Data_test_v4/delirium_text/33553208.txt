33553208|t|Cerebral Blood Flow Deviations in Critically Ill Patients: Potential Insult Contributing to Ischemic and Hyperemic Injury.
33553208|a|Background: Ischemic and hyperemic injury have emerged as biologic mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment in critically ill patients. Spontaneous deviations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) beyond ischemic and hyperemic thresholds may represent an insult that contributes to this brain injury, especially if they accumulate over time and coincide with impaired autoregulation. Methods: We used transcranial Doppler to measure the proportion of time that CBF velocity (CBFv) deviated beyond previously reported ischemic and hyperemic thresholds in a cohort of critically ill patients with respiratory failure and/or shock within 48 h of ICU admission. We also assessed whether these CBFv deviations were more common during periods of impaired dynamic autoregulation, and whether they are explained by concurrent variations in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and end-tidal PCO2 (PetCO2). Results: We enrolled 12 consecutive patients (three females) who were monitored for a mean duration of 462.6 +- 39.8 min. Across patients, CBFv deviated by more than 20-30% from its baseline for 17-24% of the analysis time. These CBFv deviations occurred equally during periods of preserved and impaired autoregulation, while concurrent variations in MAP and PetCO2 explained only 13-21% of these CBFv deviations. Conclusion: CBFv deviations beyond ischemic and hyperemic thresholds are common in critically ill patients with respiratory failure or shock. These deviations occur irrespective of the state of dynamic autoregulation and are not explained by changes in MAP and CO2. Future studies should explore mechanisms responsible for these CBFv deviations and establish whether their cumulative burden predicts poor neurocognitive outcomes.
