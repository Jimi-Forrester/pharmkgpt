7746404|a|No association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and apolipoprotein E type epsilon 4 (ApoE epsilon 4) phenotype was found among centenarians in Finland (N = 179). The data are based on ascertainment of all centenarians in Finland in 1991. All examinations were conducted during 1991. The diagnoses of dementia and AD were based on clinical grounds, conforming to DSM-III-R and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The percentage of ApoE epsilon 4 alleles among the centenarians was 8.7% (31 of 358 alleles). This is significantly lower than percentages found in younger Finnish populations. Thirty (16.8%) of the 179 centenarians were epsilon 4 allele carriers. One hundred fifty-one (84.4%) of the centenarians were women. Twenty-eight (18.5%) of the women had at least one epsilon 4 allele, as did two (7.1%) of the men. The prevalence of clinically diagnosed AD was 26.8%; 44% of the subjects were cognitively normal, 23% had signs of cognitive decline or at most mild dementia (with no differential diagnosis), and 6% had a dementia clinically diagnosed as being due to some cause other than AD. For AD cases versus cognitively normal subjects, the odds ratio associated with being a carrier of the epsilon 4 allele was 1.34 (p = 0.64; 95% CI = [0.5, 3.3]). Among women, the odds ratio was 0.99 (p = 1.0; 95% CI = [0.4, 2.6]). There were fewer, but not significantly so, epsilon 4 carriers among subjects with cognitive decline or at most mild dementia (12.2%) than there were among the cognitively normal subjects (16.5%). The AD patients had no evidence of difficulty standing on a flat stationary surface unless the surface suddenly moved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
