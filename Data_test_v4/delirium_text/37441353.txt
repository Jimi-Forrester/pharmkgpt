37441353|a|Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in older adults is undercharacterized. To help inform future immunization policies, this study aimed to describe the disease burden in Canadian adults aged >=50 years hospitalized with RSV. Methods: Using administrative data and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from active surveillance among adults aged >=50 years hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 influenza seasons, RSV was identified using a respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction test to describe the associated disease burden, incidence, and healthcare costs. Results: Of 7797 patients tested, 371 (4.8%) were RSV positive (2.2% RSV-A and 2.6% RSV-B). RSV prevalence varied by season from 4.2% to 6.2%. Respiratory virus coinfection was observed in 11.6% (43/371) of RSV cases, with influenza A being the most common. RSV hospitalization rates varied between seasons and increased with age, from 8-12 per 100 000 population in adults aged 50-59 years to 174-487 per 100 000 in adults aged >=80 years. The median age of RSV cases was 74.9 years, 63.7% were female, and 98.1% of cases had >=1 comorbidity. Among RSV cases, the mean length of hospital stay was 10.6 days, 13.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 6.4% required mechanical ventilation, and 6.1% died. The mean cost per RSV case was $13 602 (Canadian dollars) but varied by age and Canadian province. Conclusions: This study adds to the growing literature on adult RSV burden by showing considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in hospitalized adults aged >=50 years with ARIs such as influenza.
