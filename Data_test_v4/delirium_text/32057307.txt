32057307|a|People who have Down syndrome are at significantly elevated risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's disease that causes dementia (AD-DS). Here we review recent progress in modeling the development of AD-DS in mouse models. These studies provide insight into mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and generate new clinical research questions. In addition, they suggest potential new targets for disease prevention therapies.
