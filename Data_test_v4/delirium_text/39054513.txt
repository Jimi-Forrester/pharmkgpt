39054513|t|Association of triglyceride-glucose index and delirium in patients with sepsis: a retrospective study.
39054513|a|OBJECTIVE: It is well known that glucose and lipid metabolism disorders and insulin resistance are common in sepsis, which affect the occurrence and prognosis of multiple organ dysfunction in septic patients. Previous study reported the predictive value of triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), a clinical indicator for insulin resistance, in postoperative delirium patients. However, it remains unclear whether the TyG index is a novel predictive biomarker for sepsis-associated delirium. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between TyG index and the risk of delirium in patients with sepsis. METHODS: Adult septic patients were identified from the MIMIC-IV database and divided into four groups based on the mean value of TyG. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium. The association between TyG and the risk of developing delirium was evaluated by restricted cubic spline (RCS), multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analysis. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method was used to balance the baseline data. RESULTS: A total of 3,331 septic patients were included in the analysis, and further divided into four groups: Q1 (TyG <= 8.67), Q2 (8.67 < TyG <= 9.08), Q3 (9.08 < TyG <= 9.61), and Q4 (TyG > 9.61). The RCS curves demonstrated a non-linear positive relationship between TyG index and the risk of developing delirium, and an optimal cut-of value 9.09 was recommended. After balancing the baseline information by PSM, patients in the TyG > 9.09 group had a significant higher incidence of delirium compared with those in the TyG <= 9.09 group. In logistic regression analysis, TyG > 9.09 was significantly associated with lower risk of developing delirium in both original cohort (OR 1.54-1.78, all P < 0.001) and the PSM cohort (OR 1.41-1.48, all P < 0.001). No association was found between the TyG index and mortality (all P > 0.05). In subgroup analysis, our findings were consistent (all OR > 1 in all subgroups). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated an independent association between TyG index and increased risk of delirium in septic patients, indicating that TyG index can serve as a biomarker for delirium in sepsis.
