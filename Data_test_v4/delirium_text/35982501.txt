35982501|t|Delayed sternal closure for intractable bleeding after acute type A aortic dissection repair: outcomes and risk factors analyses.
35982501|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative coagulopathy and intractable bleeding are severe complications in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) repair surgery. Mediastinal packing with delayed sternal closure (DSC) is a commonly adapted technique to stabilize the hemorrhagic tendency. This retrospective study aims to investigate the early and late outcomes and risk factors in patients who underwent DSC procedure during ATAAD repair surgery. METHODS: This study investigated 704 consecutive patients who underwent ATAAD repair at this institution between January 2007 and September 2020. These patients were dichotomized into the DSC (n = 109; 15.5%) and primary sternal closure (PSC) groups (n = 595; 84.5%). The clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, 5-years cumulative survival, and freedom from reoperation rates were compared. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for patients who underwent DSC. RESULTS: The DSC group showed a higher rate of hemopericardium and preoperative malperfusion, and was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamping times and a higher rate of intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. The DSC group showed higher blood transfusion volumes and rate of reexploration for bleeding after surgery. However, the in-hospital mortality rates (17.4% vs. 13.3%; P = 0.249), 5-year survival rates (66.9% vs. 68.2%; P = 0.635), and freedom from reoperation rates (89.1% vs. 82.5%; P = 0.344) were comparable between the DSC and PSC groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that hemopericardium, preoperative malperfusion, and intraoperative ECMO support were risk factors for implementing DSC. CONCLUSIONS: DSC is an efficient life-saving technique to stabilize patients with intractable bleeding after undergoing ATAAD repair surgery, which leads to acceptable short- and long-term outcomes. Patients who were at risk for intractable bleeding should have early decision-making for implementing DSC.
