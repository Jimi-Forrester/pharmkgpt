30621569|t|BPA and Nutraceuticals, Simultaneous Effects on Endocrine Functions.
30621569|a|BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is worldwide diffused as a monomer of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics and has recognized activity as Endocrine Disruptor (ED). It is capable to interfere or compete with endogenous hormones in many physiological activities thus having adverse outcomes on health. Diet highly affects health status and in addition to macronutrients, provides a large number of substances with recognized pro-heath activity, and thus called nutraceuticals. OBJECTIVE: This mini-review aims at summarizing the possible opposite and simultaneous effects of BPA and nutraceuticals on endocrine functions. The possibility that diet may represent the first instrument to preserve health status against BPA damages has been discussed. METHODS: The screening of recent literature in the field has been carried out. RESULTS: The therapeutic and anti-oxidant properties of many nutraceuticals may reverse the adverse health effects of BPA. CONCLUSION: In vitro and in vivo studies provided evidence that nutraceuticals can preserve the health. Thus, the use of nutraceuticals can be considered a support for clinical treatment. In conclusion, dietary remediation may represent a successful therapeutic approach to maintain and preserve health against BPA damage.
