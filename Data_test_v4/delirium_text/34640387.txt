34640387|t|Towards a Consensus on Alzheimer's Disease Comorbidity?
34640387|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often comorbid with other pathologies. First, we review shortly the diseases most associated with AD in the clinic. Then we query PubMed citations for the co-occurrence of AD with other diseases, using a list of 400 common pathologies. Significantly, AD is found to be associated with schizophrenia and psychosis, sleep insomnia and apnea, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, fibrillation, osteoporosis, arthritis, glaucoma, metabolic syndrome, pain, herpes, HIV, alcoholism, heart failure, migraine, pneumonia, dyslipidemia, COPD and asthma, hearing loss, and tobacco smoking. Trivially, AD is also found to be associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, which are disregarded. Notably, our predicted results are consistent with the previously published clinical data and correlate nicely with individual publications. Our results emphasize risk factors and promulgate diseases often associated with AD. Interestingly, the comorbid diseases are often degenerative diseases exacerbated by reactive oxygen species, thus underlining the potential role of antioxidants in the treatment of AD and comorbid diseases.
