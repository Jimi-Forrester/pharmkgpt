15102582|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains the most common of the neurodegenerative disorders. In the elderly, it represents the most frequently occurring form of dementia, especially if considered alongside concomitant cerebrovascular disease. Current treatment involves the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which have shown symptomatic benefits in the recognised domains of cognition, function and behaviour. While they may have intrinsic disease-modifying activity, this is yet to be proven, and strategies to alter the fundamental neuropathological changes in AD continue to be sought. Much of the evidence suggests that the accumulation of amyloid-beta may play a pivotal role, therefore the bulk of current research is focused on possible intervention along the amyloid pathways. However, the abnormal phosphorylation of tau is also a reasonable target and as the molecular basis of AD is better delineated, more targeted treatment approaches are being proposed. This paper reports on the current data that is setting the future directions for research into AD.
