35302047|a|Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, especially acute ischemic events and neurodegenerative disorders, constitute a public health problem with no effective treatments to allow a persistent solution. Failed therapies targeting neuronal recovery have revealed the multifactorial and intricate pathophysiology underlying such CNS disorders as ischemic stroke, Alzheimers disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, vascular Parkisonism, vascular dementia, and aging, in which cerebral microvasculature impairment seems to play a key role. In fact, a reduction in vessel density and cerebral blood flow occurs in these scenarios, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and leading to loss of cognitive function. In this review, we provide an overview of healthy brain microvasculature structure and function in health and the effect of the aforementioned cerebral CNS diseases. We discuss the emerging new therapeutic opportunities, and their delivery approaches, aimed at recovering brain vascularization in this context. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The lack of effective treatments, mainly focused on neuron recovery, has prompted the search of other therapies to treat cerebral central nervous system diseases. The disruption and degeneration of cerebral microvasculature has been evidenced in neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and aging, constituting a potential target for restoring vascularization, neuronal functioning, and cognitive capacities by the development of therapeutic pro-angiogenic strategies.
