27095220|t|Glyco-redox, a link between oxidative stress and changes of glycans: Lessons from research on glutathione, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to glycobiology.
27095220|a|Reduction-oxidation (redox) response is one of the most important biological phenomena. The concept introduced by Helmut Sies encouraged many researchers to examine oxidative stress under pathophysiological conditions. Our group has been interested in redox regulation under oxidative stress as well as glycobiology in relation to disease. Current studies by our group and other groups indicate that functional and structural changes of glycans are regulated by redox responses resulting from the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in various diseases including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), even though very few investigators appear to be aware of these facts. Here we propose that the field "glyco-redox" will open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism associated with diseases in relation to glycan changes under oxidative stress. A tight link between structural and functional changes of glycans and redox system under oxidative stress will lead to the recognition and interest of these aspects by many scientists. Helmut's contribution in this field facilitated our future perspectives in glycobiology.
