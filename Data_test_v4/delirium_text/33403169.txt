33403169|t|Electrocardiogram Heart Rate as a Predictor of Severity in Acute Alcohol-Related Pancreatitis With Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome.
33403169|a|Background The severity of acute alcohol-related pancreatitis (AAP) with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) has not been studied. Electrocardiogram (ECG) has not been used as a predictor of severity in patients with AWS and acute pancreatitis. Objectives The study aimed to determine whether the ECG heart rate (HR) could predict the severity of AAP; secondarily, whether AWS influenced the severity of AAP based on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP). Methods Demographics, comorbid illnesses, AWS, biochemistry, ECG, arterial blood gases, and CT findings were noted in patients with AAP. The severity of pancreatitis was scored into mild, moderate, and severe based on CT. BISAP, APACHE II, and ECG heart rate-APACHE (E-APACHE) were compared in patients with and without AWS. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to find the best predictor of severity. Results Among 138 patients (M=128), 94 had AWS. ECG changes (>=1) were seen in 50%. Patients with AWS were younger, had consumed alcohol for a shorter duration, had higher systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), APACHE II, and E-APACHE II scores. APACHE II and E-APACHE II correlated significantly with severity grading, HR, alcohol duration, and AWS. HR was the best predictor of severe pancreatitis; E-APACHE was the best predictor for moderately severe pancreatitis. Conclusions Mostly, AAP appears to be mild; >2/3rds have AWS. ECG findings were seen in 50%. HR has not been previously studied in patients with both AAP and AWS and is an easy and inexpensive test to predict the severity of pancreatitis in this cohort.
