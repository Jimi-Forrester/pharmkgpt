21757905|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Detection and differentiation of neurodegenerative dementias, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with blood-based biomarkers would facilitate diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: By use of a commercially available ELISA kit, we measured alpha-synuclein levels in the serum of 40 DLB patients and controls, and of 80 AD patients. RESULTS: We found significantly reduced alpha-synuclein serum levels in DLB compared to both AD (p = 0.006) and control subjects (p = 0.001), reaching an area under the curve of >0.70. CONCLUSION: Although these results do not justify a definition of serum alpha-synuclein as a potential single biomarker, results may contribute to a multimarker strategy in DLB diagnosis.
