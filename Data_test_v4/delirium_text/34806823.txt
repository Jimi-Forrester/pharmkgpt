34806823|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium is one of the most common and dangerous psychiatric complications after hip surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery and to identify risk factors for such, as part of developing a risk stratification index (RSI) system to predict a patient's risk of postoperative delirium. METHODS: Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) with hip fractures who had received surgical treatment in our hospital between March 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. Clinical data were collected, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relevant risk factors of postoperative delirium. An RSI system was developed based on factors identified in the regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 272 patients included, 52 (19.12%) experienced postoperative delirium. Drinking history (> 3/ week), the perioperative lactic acid level (Lac > 2 mmol/L), postoperative visual analog score (VAS) > 3, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status > II, application of the bispectral index, and preoperative diabetes were independent risk factors of postoperative delirium. When RSI >= 5, the rate of postoperative delirium significantly increased (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The RSI system developed here can safely guide postoperative outcomes of elderly patients with hip fractures, and RSI >= 5 may be able to predict the onset of postoperative delirium.
