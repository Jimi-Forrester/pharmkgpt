19774675|a|Oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation is a problem in neurodegenerative diseases, because the brain is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and low in endogenous antioxidants. One of the most toxic byproducts of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), is implicated in oxidative stress-induced damage in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this study, the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was used to test the protective effects of increasing the detoxification of HNE by overexpressing the HNE-detoxifying enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1). Overexpression of ALDH1 in the SH-SY5Y cells acts to reduce production of protein-HNE adducts and activation of caspase-3. Our data suggest that detoxification of HNE could be therapeutic in preventing some of the toxic disruptions of the brain's redox systems found in many neurodegenerative diseases.
