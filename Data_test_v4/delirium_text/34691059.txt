34691059|a|Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative therapy for patients with hematological malignancies. Acute Graft versus host diseases (GVHD) is a major immune mediated side effect of allo-HCT that can affect the central nervous system (CNS) in addition to post-allo-HCT vascular events, drug toxicity or infections. Here we summarize and discuss recent preclinical data on the CNS as a target of acute GVHD and the known mechanisms contributing to neurotoxicity with a focus on microglia and T cells. We also discuss open questions in the field and place the findings made in mouse models in a clinical context. While in mice the neurological deficits can be assessed in a controlled fashion, in patients the etiology of the CNS damage is difficult to attribute to acute GVHD versus infections, vascular events, and drug-induced toxicity. Ultimately, we discuss novel therapies for GVHD of the CNS. Our understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity after allo-HCT increased over the last decade. This review provides insights into CNS manifestations of GVHD versus other etiologies of CNS damage in mice and patients.
