31667040|a|Introduction Pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders are a significant cause of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, especially in developing areas of the world. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are the most significant causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department of Ghulam Muhammad Meher Medical College and Hospital. One hundred twelve (n=112) women with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders admitted for delivery were included in the study. Results The major pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder was eclampsia (n=48; 43.24%) and preeclampsia (n=28; 25.23%). Among the women who developed one or more complications during or after delivery, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was the most frequent (n=31; 27.6%). Conclusions Pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders are common and adversely impact maternal and fetal outcomes. Efforts should be made at both the community and hospital levels to increase awareness regarding hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and reduce its associated morbidity and mortality.
