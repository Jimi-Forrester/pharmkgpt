39581001|a|Caring for older adults in the Emergency Department demands compassion, expertise, and adaptability to address the intricate medical and emotional needs of this vulnerable population. Key geriatric emergency medicine articles from 2023 highlight the evolving landscape of this field: updates to the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications, medications most implicated in causing delirium, geriatric trauma centers, behavioral problems in persons with dementia, geriatric syndrome detection, and emergency department (ED) process outcomes in geriatric EDs. As healthcare organizations shift to focus on the larger continuum of care that extends beyond the ED visit, we also highlight a novel program from the Veterans Affairs bringing former military medics to the home to improve outcomes after ED discharge. This review highlights practice-changing updates to improve the management of older adults in the ED.
