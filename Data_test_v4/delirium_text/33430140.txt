33430140|t|A Rationale for Hypoxic and Chemical Conditioning in Huntington's Disease.
33430140|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by adverse cellular environments and pathological alterations causing neurodegeneration in distinct brain regions. This development is triggered or facilitated by conditions such as hypoxia, ischemia or inflammation and is associated with disruptions of fundamental cellular functions, including metabolic and ion homeostasis. Targeting intracellular downstream consequences to specifically reverse these pathological changes proved difficult to translate to clinical settings. Here, we discuss the potential of more holistic approaches with the purpose to re-establish a healthy cellular environment and to promote cellular resilience. We review the involvement of important molecular pathways (e.g., the sphingosine, delta-opioid receptor or N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor pathways) in neuroprotective hypoxic conditioning effects and how these pathways can be targeted for chemical conditioning. Despite the present scarcity of knowledge on the efficacy of such approaches in neurodegeneration, the specific characteristics of Huntington's disease may make it particularly amenable for such conditioning techniques. Not only do classical features of neurodegenerative diseases like mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation support this assumption, but also specific Huntington's disease characteristics: a relatively young age of neurodegeneration, molecular overlap of related pathologies with hypoxic adaptations and sensitivity to brain hypoxia. The aim of this review is to discuss several molecular pathways in relation to hypoxic adaptations that have potential as drug targets in neurodegenerative diseases. We will extract the relevance for Huntington's disease from this knowledge base.
