10536812|a|Among 27,692 patients suffering from alcoholism, delirium tremens occurs only in 8.1% of the cases. From 2417 patients with this psychosis repeated delirium tremens was noted in 12.9%. In the studied group (n = 2417) delirium tremens was observed in men (84.2%) 5.3 times more often than in women (15.8%). The mean age of the onset of the delirium was 43.2 years in women and was older than in the group of men (42.0 years). Age distribution of the disease onset in men and women follows a curve of normal distribution. In 125 patients with schizophrenia combined with delirium tremens there was a high rate of repeated alcoholic delirium (22.4%), epileptic seizures (21.6%), diabetes mellitus of type II (10.4%). These facts confirm the role of hereditary predisposition to development of delirium tremens and allow to relate alcoholic delirium to multifactorial diseases.
