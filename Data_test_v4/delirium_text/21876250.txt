21876250|t|No association between hypertension and risk for Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.
21876250|a|This study examined the association between hypertension and AD by using a quantitative meta-analysis of longitudinal studies. EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched for articles published up to February 2011. All studies that examined the association of hypertension or antihypertensive medication use with the onset of AD were included. Pooled relative risks (RR) were calculated using fixed and random effects models. Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. All subjects were without dementia at baseline. Among them, 9 studies compared the incidence of AD between subjects with (7,270) and without (8,022) hypertension. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in incidence of AD (RR: 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-1.14) between subjects with and without hypertension. Seven studies compared the incidence of AD between subjects with (8,703) and without (13,041) antihypertensive medication use. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in incidence of AD (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.79-1.03) between subjects with and without antihypertensive medication use. The quantitative meta-analysis showed that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive medication use was associated with risk for incident AD.
