36204261|a|Introduction Tissue damage, chronic dysfunction, and symptoms that last more than 12 weeks are hallmarks of long-term chronic opportunistic viral infection (COVID-19), and the disease may have a permanent, relapsing/remitting, or gradually improving course. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of severe long COVID-19. Methods In October 2021, primary care clinics enrolled consenting 18- to 89-year-olds to complete an online questionnaire on self-diagnosis, clinician diagnosis, testing, symptom presence, and duration of COVID-19. Long COVID-19 was identified if symptoms were beyond 12 weeks. Patients with long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms were assessed using multivariable regression to identify potential predictors of severe long COVID-19. Results Of the 220 respondents, 108 (49%) patients were self- or clinician-diagnosed with COVID-19 or had a confirmed positive laboratory test result. Patients aged >45 years and with at least 15 COVID-19 symptoms were 5.55 and 6.02 times, respectively, more likely to acquire severe long COVID-19. Most patients with severe and moderate post-acute COVID-19 syndrome had no relevant comorbidities (p=0.0402; odds ratio [OR]=0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.18-0.98). Obesity was a significant predictor (p=0.0307; OR=6.2; 95% CI=1.1-33.2). Conclusion The simultaneous presence of 15 or more COVID-19 symptoms, age >45 years, and obesity were related to a higher probability of severe long COVID-19.
