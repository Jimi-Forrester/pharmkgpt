39774697|a|Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world and a growing cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Yet, at the same time, our understanding of the pathophysiology and genetic underpinnings of this increasingly common yet heterogeneous disease has increased dramatically over the last 2 decades, with the potential to lead to meaningful clinical interventions for patients. We have now seen the first pharmacologic therapy approved for the treatment of MASLD, and multiple other potential treatments are currently under investigation-including gene-targeted RNA therapies that directly extend from advances in MASLD genetics. Here we review recent advances in MASLD genetics, some of the key pathophysiologic insights that human genetics has provided, and the ways in which human genetics may inform our clinical practice in the field of MASLD in the near future.
