35140291|t|Diurnal effects of polypharmacy with high drug burden index on physical activities over 23 h differ with age and sex.
35140291|a|Aging, polypharmacy (concurrent use of >= 5 medications), and functional impairment are global healthcare challenges. However, knowledge of the age/sex-specific effects of polypharmacy is limited, particularly on daily physical activities. Using continuous monitoring, we demonstrated how polypharmacy with high Drug Burden Index (DBI-cumulative anticholinergic/sedative exposure) affected behaviors over 23 h in male/female, young/old mice. For comparison, we also evaluated how different drug regimens (polypharmacy/monotherapy) influenced activities in young mice. We found that after 4 weeks of treatment, high DBI (HDBI) polypharmacy decreased exploration (reduced mean gait speed and climbing) during the habituation period, but increased it during other periods, particularly in old mice during the transition to inactivity. After HDBI polypharmacy, mean gait speed consistently decreased throughout the experiment. Some behavioral declines after HDBI were more marked in females than males, indicating treatment x sex interactions. Metoprolol and simvastatin monotherapies increased activities in young mice, compared to control/polypharmacy. These findings highlight that in mice, some polypharmacy-associated behavioral changes are greater in old age and females. The observed diurnal behavioral changes are analogous to drug-induced delirium and sundowning seen in older adults. Future mechanistic investigations are needed to further inform considerations of age, sex, and polypharmacy to optimize quality use of medicines.
