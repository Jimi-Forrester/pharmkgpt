28357407|t|Role of MicroRNA-103a Targeting ADAM10 in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
28357407|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are deregulated in various vascular ailments including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). MiR-103 is involved in vascular, metabolic, and malignant diseases, but whether it participates in the pathogenesis of AAA remains elusive. ADAM10 plays a vital role in the formation of aneurysm, but whether miRs modulate its activity during AAA formation is totally unknown. In this study, we detected the significantly increased protein expression of ADAM10 in angiotensin II induced murine AAA specimens, while the mRNA expression of ADAM10 was similar between AAA and control, suggesting the posttranscriptional regulation. The ADAM10 specific inhibitor GI254023X dramatically reduced the macrophage infiltration of murine abdominal aorta. Bioinformatic predictions suggest that ADAM10 is the target of miR-103a/107 but the binding site is exclusive. At the cellular level, miR-103a-1 suppressed the protein expression of ADAM10, while antisense miR-103a-1 increased its expression. Particularly, with the progression of murine AAA, the mRNA expression of miR-103a/107 substantially decreased and the protein expression of ADAM10 greatly increased. Together, our data afford the new insight that miR-103a inhibited AAA growth via targeting ADAM10, which might be a promising therapeutic strategy to alleviate AAA.
