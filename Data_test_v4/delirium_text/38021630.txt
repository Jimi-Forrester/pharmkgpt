38021630|a|BACKGROUND: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect brain development and can lead to various psychological imbalances in caregivers of affected children. Siddha formulations have been shown to have a role beyond the physical body and play a significant role in managing Mantha sannior ASD. The objective of this study was to examine the impacts of Amukkara chooranam and Yegamooli thylam in the pediatric population diagnosed with ASD. METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, open clinical trial involving 30 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients received Amukkara chooranam at a dose of 300 mg for ages 3-4 years, 500 mg for ages 5-7 years, and 1 gm for ages 8-12 years, twice a day with honey for 90 days, and Yegamooli thylam was administered using the Thuvalai external manipulation technique once a day for 90 days. Scoring by the Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism (ISAA) was documented at the end of the 0th day, 45th day, and 90th day. RESULTS: The scores were compared at each follow-up, and a statistically significant difference was found at the end of the 90th day of treatment with Amukkara chooranam and Yegamooli thylam (P < 0.05). The statistical analysis included calculating the mean and standard deviation of the clinical assessment, parameters both before and after the treatment were 37.66667 +-13.82485. CONCLUSION: The treatment with Amukkara chooranam and Yegamooli thylam resulted in a clinically significant improvement in clinical assessment parameters in children with ASD.
