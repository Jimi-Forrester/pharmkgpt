34449605|t|Enhancement of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments by Virtual Reality in Older Adults with Cognitive and Motor Deficits: A Randomised Trial.
34449605|a|BACKGROUND: Postural activities involved in balance control integrate the anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) that stabilize balance and posture, facilitating arm movements and walking initiation and allowing an optimal coordination between posture and movement. Several studies reported the significant benefits of virtual reality (VR) exercises in frail older adults to decrease the anxiety of falling and to induce improvements in behavioural and cognitive abilities in rehabilitation processes. The aim of this study was thus to test the efficiency of a VR system on the enhancement of the APA period, compared to the use of a Nintendo Wii system. METHODS: Frail older adults (n = 37) were included in this study who were randomized and divided into a VR exercises group (VR group) or a control group using the Nintendo Wii system (CTRL group). Finally, 22 patients were included in the data treatment. APA were studied through muscular activation timings measured with electromyographic activities. The functional reach test, the gait speed, and the time up and go were also evaluated before and after a 3-week training phase. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: As the main results, the training phase with VR improved the APA and the functional reach test score along the antero-posterior axis. Together, these results highlight the ability of a VR training phase to induce neuromuscular adaptations during the APA period in frail older adults. Then, it underlines the effective transfer from learning carried out during the VR training movements to control balance abilities in a more daily life context.
