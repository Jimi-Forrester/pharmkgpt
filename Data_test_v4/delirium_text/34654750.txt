34654750|a|The low-complexity (LC) domain of the fused in sarcoma (FUS) RNA binding protein self-associates in a manner causing phase separation from an aqueous environment. Incubation of the FUS LC domain under physiologically normal conditions of salt and pH leads to rapid formation of liquid-like droplets that mature into a gel-like state. Both examples of phase separation have enabled reductionist biochemical assays allowing discovery of an N-terminal region of 57 residues that assembles into a labile, cross-beta structure. Here we provide evidence of a nonoverlapping, C-terminal region of the FUS LC domain that also forms specific cross-beta interactions. We propose that biologic function of the FUS LC domain may operate via the mutually exclusive use of these N- and C-terminal cross-beta cores. Neurodegenerative disease-causing mutations in the FUS LC domain are shown to imbalance the two cross-beta cores, offering an unanticipated concept of LC domain function and dysfunction.
