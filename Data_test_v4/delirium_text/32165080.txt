32165080|t|Content of anti-beta-amyloid42 oligomers antibodies in multiple batches from different immunoglobulin preparations.
32165080|a|Immunoglobulin preparations are one of the promising drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations are considered to be critical for the therapeutic effect against Alzheimer's disease. However, the antibodies content in immunoglobulin preparations varies greatly. In order to determine which factor contributes to the difference of the antibodies content, the content of anti-Abeta oligomers antibodies in multiple batches of immunoglobulin preparations from two manufacturers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that no significant difference was found in the antibodies content among different bathes of normal immunoglobulin preparations prepared by the same process from the same manufacturer, whereas significant difference was found in the antibodies content between normal immunoglobulin preparations prepared by ethanol fractionation and those by chromatography process from the same manufacturer. In addition, significant variation existed in the antibodies content between normal immunoglobulin preparations and specific immunoglobulin preparations that are produced by plasma pool of immunized donors. Based on analysis of these results, the preparation process and raw plasma could be the main contributing factors affecting the content of anti-Abeta oligomers antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations. This finding might help to develop AD-specific immunoglobulin preparation containing higher content of anti-Abeta oligomers antibodies.
