38988188|t|Loneliness and Resting-State Functional Brain Connectivity Among Older Adults: A Proportional Correlation.
38988188|a|OBJECTIVE: Loneliness reportedly increases the risk of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). The authors' previous study demonstrated associations between loneliness and structural abnormalities observed in early-stage AD. The present study examined associations between the brain's functional characteristics and loneliness among older adults with concerns about cognitive decline. METHODS: This single-center study included 43 participants (13 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 30 with normal cognition). Participants were assessed with the revised University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale and underwent resting-state functional MRI. Functional images were preprocessed with the CONN toolbox. The selected seeds were within brain regions reportedly associated with loneliness. One-sample general linear model analysis was performed to examine regressions of UCLA Loneliness Scale scores and functional connectivity between the seeds and regions of interest. RESULTS: The revised UCLA Loneliness Scale scores were positively correlated with functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and left lateral parietal lobe and were negatively correlated with functional connectivity between the left amygdala and left frontal operculum and between the left amygdala and right supramarginal gyrus. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and education and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating scale. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was associated with abnormal function of the hippocampus, parts of the parietal lobe and frontal cortex, and the amygdala. These findings may suggest a possible correlation between loneliness and neurological changes associated with dementia.
