30016644|t|Activities, bioavailability, and metabolism of lipids from structural membranes and oils: Promising research on mild cognitive impairment.
30016644|a|Concomitant with increased lifespan, large segments of the population are experiencing cognitive decline, which might progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, there is no cure for AD and, once the neurodegenerative disorders are established, patients use pharmacologic therapy to slow the progression of the symptoms and require appropriate care to manage their condition. The preclinical stage of neural degeneration that progress through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) before the onset of AD is when it might be possible to introduce behavioral changes and pharma-nutritional interventions that modify the risk factors of MCI conversion to AD. Some food components accumulate in brain tissues, where they play essential roles. Among them, polar lipids, omega 3 fatty acids, and carotenoids appear to work additively or synergistically. Therefore, there is an opportunity to formulate nutraceuticals/functional foods to slow the progression of MCI. In this paper, we review the biochemical bases and recent interventions with bioactive lipids-rich formulations. Based on accumulated evidence, we propose that appropriate large-scale trials are warranted.
