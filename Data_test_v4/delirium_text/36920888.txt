36920888|t|Relative importance of potential risk factors for dementia in patients with hypertension.
36920888|a|Patients with hypertension are at higher risk for dementia than the general population. We sought to understand the relative importance of various risk factors in the development of dementia among patients with hypertension. This population-based cohort study used data from the Korean National Insurance Service database. Using the Cox proportional hazard model, R2 values for each potential risk factor were calculated to test the relative importance of risk factors for the development of dementia. Eligible individuals were adults 40 to 79 years of age with hypertension and without a history of stroke and dementia between 2007 and 2009. A total of 650,476 individuals (mean age, 60 +- 11 years) with hypertension were included in the analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.5 years (+-2.8 years), 57,112 cases of dementia were observed. The three strongest predictors of dementia were age, comorbidity burden (assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index), and female sex (R2 values, 0.0504, 0.0023, and 0.0022, respectively). The next strongest risk factors were physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity (R2 values, 0.00070, 0.00024, 0.00021, and 0.00020, respectively). Across all age groups, physical inactivity was an important risk factor for dementia occurrence. In summary, controlling and preventing comorbidities are of utmost importance to prevent dementia in patients with hypertension. More efforts should be taken to encourage physical activity among patients with hypertension across all age groups. Furthermore, smoking cessation, avoiding and limiting alcohol consumption, and maintaining an appropriate body weight are urged to prevent dementia.
