36892961|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an update on the actions of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and presents the most recent findings from trials in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting including relevant meta-analyses. Many specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are produced from bioactive omega-3 PUFAs and may explain many of the beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFAs, although other mechanisms of action of omega-3 PUFAs are being uncovered. RECENT FINDINGS: SPMs resolve inflammation, promote healing and support antiinfection activities of the immune system. Since publication of the ESPEN guidelines, numerous studies further support the use of omega-3 PUFAs. Recent meta-analyses favor the inclusion of omega-3 PUFAs in nutrition support of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis. Recent trials indicate that omega-3 PUFAs may protect against delirium and liver dysfunction in patients in the ICU, although effects on muscle loss are unclear and require further investigation. Critical illness may alter omega-3 PUFA turnover. There has been significant discussion about the potential for omega-3 PUFAs and SPMs in treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. SUMMARY: Evidence for benefits of omega-3 PUFAs in the ICU setting has strengthened through new trials and meta-analyses. Nevertheless, better quality trials are still needed. SPMs may explain many of the benefits of omega-3 PUFAs.
