35602107|a|Background: Sustained stress with the overproduction of corticosteroids has been shown to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to an oxidative stress state. Mitochondria are the main generators of ROS and are directly and detrimentally affected by their overproduction. Neurons depend almost solely on ATP produced by mitochondria in order to satisfy their energy needs and to form synapses, while stress has been proven to alter synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence underpins that Rhodiola rosea, an adaptogenic plant rich in polyphenols, exerts antioxidant, antistress, and neuroprotective effects. Methods: In this study, the effect of Rhodiola rosea extract (RRE) WS 1375 on neuronal ROS regulation, bioenergetics, and neurite outgrowth, as well as its potential modulatory effect on the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway, was evaluated in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and the murine hippocampal HT22 cell lines. Stress was induced using the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Results: RRE increased bioenergetics as well as cell viability and scavenged ROS with a similar efficacy in both cells lines and counteracted the respective corticosteroid-induced dysregulation. The effect of RRE, both under dexamethasone-stress and under normal conditions, resulted in biphasic U-shape and inverted U-shape dose response curves, a characteristic feature of adaptogenic plant extracts. Additionally, RRE treatment promoted neurite outgrowth and induced an increase in BDNF levels. Conclusion: These findings indicate that RRE may constitute a candidate for the prevention of stress-induced pathophysiological processes as well as oxidative stress. Therefore, it could be employed against stress-associated mental disorders potentially leading to the development of a condition-specific supplementation.
