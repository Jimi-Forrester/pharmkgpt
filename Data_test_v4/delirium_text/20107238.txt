20107238|t|The plight of caring for young patients with frontotemporal dementia.
20107238|a|We present the case of a 39-year-old patient with frontotemporal dementia. This case depicts the complexities in the process leading to the diagnosis, treatment, and placement of young patients presenting with severe psychiatric symptoms as the first signs of an underlying neurological disease. Obstacles in the health care system and residential placement process that hinder the optimal and timely care of such difficult cases are discussed. Practical solutions are offered that center upon better awareness and education and the provision of additional resources. These interventions are likely to provide a positive return on investment for the medical system and could be used as strong levers for new health policies relevant to younger patients with neurological illness.
