31936498|t|UV Fluorescence-Based Determination of Urinary Advanced Glycation End Products in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
31936498|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a class of proteins or lipids that are non-enzymatically glycated and oxidized after contact with aldose sugars. The accumulation of AGEs results in carbonyl stress, which is characteristic for diabetes mellitus, uremia, atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. In recent decades, several innovative methods have been developed to measure the concentration of AGEs in blood or urine. In the present study, we evaluated the use of UV fluorescence as an alternative tool to detect urinary AGEs in four groups of well characterized chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients over a wide range of kidney insufficiency and in a group of healthy subjects. Using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm, the fluorescence spectra of urinary AGEs were recorded in the 400-620 nm emission range. When considering the emission peaks at 440 nm and 490 nm, a significantly higher AGE-specific fluorescence intensity was detected in CKD patients compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The urinary creatinine adjusted fluorescence emission spectra in the group of CKD patients with diabetes mellitus were comparable with those of CKD patients without diabetes mellitus. Creatinine-adjusted fluorescence emission spectra were highest in CKD patients with proteinuria, moderate in CKD patients without proteinuria and lowest in healthy controls (p < 0.0001 at both emission wavelengths). In a multiple regression analysis, age, CRP and insulin treatment were predictors of fluorescence intensity at the emission wavelength of 440 nm. Age and insulin treatment were predictors at 490 nm. The presented method is a simple, cheap, alternative method to monitor the AGE-load in the CKD population.
