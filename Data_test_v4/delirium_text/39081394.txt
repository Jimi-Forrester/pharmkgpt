39081394|a|Background: Yokukansan is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that is widely administered to individuals of various age groups as an effective drug for anxiety, with few side-effects. While animal studies have yielded promising results concerning yokukansan's potential in treating anxiety disorders, comprehensive validation has remained incomplete. Moreover, most of the clinical investigations regarding yokukansan have primarily focused on Japanese subjects, and its impact on non-Asian ethnicities remains unverified. Case Presentation: We present the case of a 17-year-old Caucasian female with panic disorder (PD). Following her relocation to Japan, she experienced panic attacks due to environmental changes, which subsequently prompted her to visit to our clinic. Various medical examinations revealed no abnormalities, which ruled out the possibility of any physical illness other than PD. Significantly, the administration of yokukansan resulted in a notable reduction in panic attacks, as well as in anticipatory anxiety, accompanied by discernible enhancements in psychosocial functioning and overall quality of life. Furthermore, it is imperative to underscore the fact that no noteworthy adverse events took place. Conclusion: Panic attacks and profound anxiety in a Caucasian patient with PD were successfully treated with the use of yokukansan. This case study suggests that yokukansan may be effective in treating PD in Caucasians as well as in Asians. However, to substantiate this preliminary observation, further investigations are required.
