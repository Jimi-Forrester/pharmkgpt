31435618|a|Neuronal microtubule (MT) tau protein provides cytoskeleton to neuronal cells and plays a vital role including maintenance of cell shape, intracellular transport, and cell division. Tau hyperphosphorylation mediates MT destabilization resulting in axonopathy and neurotransmitter deficit, and ultimately causing Alzheimer's disease (AD), a dementing disorder affecting vast geriatric populations worldwide, characterized by the existence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in a hyperphosphorylated state. Pre-clinically, streptozotocin stereotaxically mimics the behavioral and biochemical alterations similar to AD associated with tau pathology resulting in MT assembly defects, which proceed neuropathological cascades. Accessible interventions like cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonist clinically provides only symptomatic relief. Involvement of microtubule stabilizers (MTS) prevents tauopathy particularly by targeting MT oriented cytoskeleton and promotes polymerization of tubulin protein. Multiple in vitro and in vivo research studies have shown that MTS can hold substantial potential for the treatment of AD-related tauopathy dementias through restoration of tau function and axonal transport. Moreover, anti-cancer taxane derivatives and epothiolones may have potential to ameliorate MT destabilization and prevent the neuronal structural and functional alterations associated with tauopathies. Therefore, this current review strictly focuses on exploration of various clinical and pre-clinical features available for AD to understand the neuropathological mechanisms as well as introduce pharmacological interventions associated with MT stabilization. MTS from diverse natural sources continue to be of value in the treatment of cancer, suggesting that these agents have potential to be of interest in the treatment of AD-related tauopathy dementia in the future.
