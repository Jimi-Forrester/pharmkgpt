37779573|a|Elderly patients undergoing surgery are at higher risk of life-altering and costly complications. This challenge is increasingly recognized with the growing geriatric surgical population. Advanced age and comorbid conditions, such as disability and frailty that often develop with age, are all independent risk factors of postoperative morbidity and mortality. A common factor in this age group is cognitive impairment, which poses a challenge for the patient and clinician in the perioperative setting. It affects the capacity for informed consent and limits optimization before surgery; furthermore, an existing impairment may progress in severity during the perioperative period, and new onset of signs of delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction may arise during postoperative recovery. In this article, we aim to review the current literature examining the latest definitions, diagnostic criteria, and preventive strategies that may ameliorate postoperative cognitive complications.
