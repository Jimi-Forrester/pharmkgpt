39574948|a|According to the Society of Critical Care Medicine, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) characterizes hypothalamic-adrenal axis insufficiency following acute medical conditions of various causes, i.e., sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, community-acquired pneumonia, and status after major surgical procedures. Due to highly variable etiology, understanding the pathomechanism and management of CIRCI assumes relevance for all centers providing intensive care. During CIRCI, multiple peripheral adaptations develop, and cortisol distribution volume increases due to hypothalamic-adrenal axis dysregulation, alterations in cortisol metabolism, and tissue resistance to corticosteroids. The proper diagnosis and treatment of CIRCI may be challenging in many cases. Although we have been acquainted with CIRCI since 2008, it remains a difficult condition with widely variable approaches among clinicians due to inconsistent high-quality study results determining the effect of corticosteroids on mortality. Corticosteroids are widely used in acutely ill patients, highlighting the necessity for reliable knowledge to support crucial clinicians' decisions in daily medical practice. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical management of patients with CIRCI based on current recommendations and selected studies.
