The latest classification criteria, EULAR/ACR 2019, have not been validated in a Latin American population of Amerindian ancestry. The objective of this study is to compare the sensitivity of the EULAR/ACR 2019 and SLICC 2012 classification criteria in a group of SLE patients with the above ancestry. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done. Data were obtained from the review of medical records of patients who met the inclusion criteria. The overall sensitivity of the criteria was calculated and compared to each other using the McNemar test. RESULTS: 146 medical records of patients from two referral centers were included. There were no differences in the sensitivity of the EULAR/ACR and SLICC 2012 criteria (84.9% versus 85.6% p = 0.79) nor were differences found when the groups based on disease duration were compared: less than 5 years (91.0% versus 92.5% p = 0.70), between 5 and 10 years (82.8% versus 82.8% p = 1), and 10 years or more (76.7% versus 76.7% p = 1). However, SLICC 2012 criteria was found to better classify patients with a less than 5-year disease duration compared to those with 10-year duration or more (92.5% versus 76.4% p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: There are no statistically significant differences between the EULAR/ACR and SLICC 2012 criteria in the population studied. Nor were differences found when evaluating them by age at diagnosis and duration of the disease except when the group with less than 5 years of duration was compared to those with 10 years or more using the SLICC 2012 criteria.
