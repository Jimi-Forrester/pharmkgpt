38495123|a|Electrical brain stimulation (EBS) has gained popularity for laboratory and clinical applications. However, comprehensive characterization of cellular diversity and gene expression changes induced by EBS remains limited, particularly with respect to specific brain regions and stimulation sites. Here, we presented the initial single-nucleus RNA sequencing profiles of rat cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus subjected to intracranial alternating current stimulation (iACS) at 40 Hz. The results demonstrated an increased number of neurons in all three regions in response to iACS. Interestingly, less than 0.1% of host gene expression in neurons was significantly altered by iACS. In addition, we identified Rgs9, a known negative regulator of dopaminergic signaling, as a unique downregulated gene in neurons. Unilateral iACS produced a more focused local effect in attenuating the proportion of Rgs9+ neurons in the ipsilateral compared to bilateral iACS treatment. The results suggested that unilateral iACS at 40 Hz was an efficient approach to increase the number of neurons and downregulate Rgs9 gene expression without affecting other cell types or genes in the brain. Our study presented the direct evidence that EBS could boost cerebral neurogenesis and enhance neuronal sensitization to dopaminergic drugs and agonists, through its downregulatory effect on Rgs9 in neurons.
