34751151|t|Relayed nuclear Overhauser effect weighted (rNOEw) imaging identifies multiple sclerosis.
34751151|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which the immune system attacks the myelin and axons, consequently leading to demyelination and axonal injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of MS, and currently various types of MRI techniques have been used to detect the pathology of MS based on unique mechanisms. In this study, we applied the relayed nuclear Overhauser effect weighted (rNOEw) imaging to study human MS at clinical 3T. Three groups of subjects, including 20 normal control (NC) subjects, 14 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) patients and 21 MS patients, were examined at a clinical 3T MRI scanner. Whole-brain rNOEw images of each subject were obtained by acquiring a control and a labeled image within four minutes. Significantly lower brain rNOEw contrast was detected in MS group compared to NC (P = 0.008) and NMOSD (P = 0.014) groups, while no significant difference was found between NC and NMOSD groups (P = 0.939). The lower rNOEw contrast of MS group compared to NC/NMOSD group was significant in white matter (P = 0.041/0.021), gray matter (P = 0.004/0.020) and brain parenchyma (P = 0.015/0.021). Moreover, MS lesions showed higher number and larger size but lower rNOEw contrast than NMOSD lesions (P = 0.002). Our proposed rNOEw imaging scheme has potential to serve as a new method for assisting MS diagnosis. Importantly, it may be used to identify MS from NMOSD.
