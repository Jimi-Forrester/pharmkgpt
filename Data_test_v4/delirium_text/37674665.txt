37674665|t|Impact of COVID-19 on the End-of-Life Care of Cancer Patients Who Died in a Korean Tertiary Hospital: A Retrospective Study.
37674665|a|Purpose: Social distancing and strict visitor restrictions at hospitals have been national policies since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This has challenged the concept of a good death in comfort with the opportunity to say goodbye. Little is known about how these measures have influenced end-of-life (EOL) care among cancer patients who die in acute care hospitals. This study examined changes in the EOL care of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,456 adult cancer patients who died in 2019 (n=752) and 2020 (n=704) at a tertiary hospital. Data on EOL care-symptom control and comfort care in an imminently dying state, preparation for death, place of death, and aggressive care in the last month-were reviewed. Results: The 1,456 patients had a median age of 67 years, and 62.5% were men. Patients who died in 2020 were more likely to experience agitation or delirium before death (17.2% vs. 10.9%), to use inotropes/vasopressors near death (59.2% vs. 52.3%), and to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation in their last months (16.3% vs. 12.5%) than those who died in 2019. Additionally, the number of deaths in the emergency room doubled in 2020 compared to 2019 (from 7.1% to 14.1%). Conclusion: This study suggests that EOL care for cancer patients who died in a tertiary hospital deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of medical care at the EOL and the preferred place of death should be discussed carefully in advance for high-quality EOL care.
