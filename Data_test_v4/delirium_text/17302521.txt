17302521|t|Targeting the nerve growth factor network in Alzheimer's disease.
17302521|a|In this issue of Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, Papatsoris et al. describe approaches to target the nerve growth factor (NGF) network in the treatment of prostate cancer. During the progression of prostate cancer, the growth-promoting effects of NGF signaling predominate. Conversely, the pro-survival functions of NGF are compromised in Alzheimer's disease. Thus NGF-targeting agents that can selectively modulate the pathway's activity could be beneficial in both of these age-related diseases, although the goal of the modulation will be different in each setting. This editorial provides a brief overview of NGF signaling, selectively summarizes some of the recent data on its dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease and highlights efforts to develop novel pharmacologic agents for its modulation.
