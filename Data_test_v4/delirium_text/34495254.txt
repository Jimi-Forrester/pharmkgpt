34495254|a|OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the gold standard treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This study aimed at reporting outcomes of CTEPH patients undergoing PEA within 10 years, focusing on advances in anesthetic and surgical techniques. METHODS: We evaluated 102 patients who underwent PEA between January 2007 and May 2016 at the Instituto do Coracao do Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade de Sao Paulo. Changes in techniques included longer cardiopulmonary bypass, heating, and cooling times and mean time of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and shortened reperfusion time. Patients were stratified according to temporal changes in anesthetic and surgical techniques: group 1 (January 2007-December 2012), group 2 (January 2013-March 2015), and group 3 (April 2015-May 2016). Clinical outcomes were any occurrence of complications during hospitalization. RESULTS: Groups 1, 2, and 3 included 38, 35, and 29 patients, respectively. Overall, 62.8% were women (mean age, 49.1 years), and 65.7% were in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV. Postoperative complications were less frequent in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2: surgical complications (10.3% vs. 34.2% vs. 31.4%, p=0.035), bleeding (10.3% vs. 31.5% vs. 25.7%, p=0.047), and stroke (0 vs. 13.2% vs. 0, p=0.01). Between 3 and 6 months post-discharge, 85% were in NYHA class I-II. CONCLUSION: Improvements in anesthetic and surgical procedures were associated with better outcomes in CTEPH patients undergoing PEA during the 10-year period.
