34711596|t|Implementation of music in the perioperative standard care of colorectal surgery: study protocol of the IMPROVE Study.
34711596|a|INTRODUCTION: Perioperative music intervention has been proven effective in reducing anxiety, pain, neurohormonal stress response and medication requirement. Unfortunately, there is a gap between new effective interventions and their (interventions) integration in standard care protocols. The aim of this preimplementation and postimplementation study is to investigate the adherence to a music intervention in a tailored, multilevel, systematic implementation strategy and the initial impact of the implementation on postoperative pain in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. METHODS AND DESIGN: A monocentre prospective preimplementation and postimplementation study was set up using The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to conduct a systematic implementation of music intervention in three phases. Primary outcomes are adherence to the music intervention and the initial impact of the music intervention implementation on postoperative pain scores on the first postoperative day. At least 100 patients will be included in the study. Secondary outcomes include adherence to the implementation strategy, penetration of music intervention in the standard care, assessment of the determinants for implementation, impact of the implemented music intervention on pain during the entire admission, anxiety, medication usage, complications, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Ethics Review Board of Erasmus MC University Medical Centre Rotterdam, The Netherlands, has approved this protocol. The study is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NL8071.
