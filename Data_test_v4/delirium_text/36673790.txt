36673790|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a common disease in aging populations. The treatment has mainly focused on memory decline prevention and behavior control. Nonpharmacological treatments, such as cognition training, physical exercise, and music therapy have been effective in slowing memory decline. Chinese calligraphy handwriting (CCH) through breath regulation and fine hand control involves high concentration levels, emotion regulation, and self-awareness. CCH is a mind and body activity that is culturally relevant to older Chinese adults. This study evaluated the beneficial effects of CCH on mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: In 2018, we conducted 8 weeks of CCH training at the Tri-Service General Hospital. The participants were asked to copy a regular script. At the end of the course, they gave oral presentations and showed their work. Self-report questionnaires on emotion, memory, upper limb coordination, attention, and language were collected before and after training. RESULTS: The five questionnaires showed significantly positive feelings after CCH training. The conditions of emotional stability, concentration, hand movement, memory, and speech improved. CONCLUSIONS: CCH training stimulated the brain and improved cognition, psychological symptoms, and hand stability. It is inexpensive and worthwhile for elderly Chinese individuals with mild cognitive impairment to take time daily to practice calligraphy.
