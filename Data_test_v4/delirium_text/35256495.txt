35256495|t|The effect of passive smoking on the laryngospasm rate in children sedated during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
35256495|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the rate of laryngospasm with sedation during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure in children exposed to passive smoking and to examine the frequency of complications due to laryngospasm. METHODS: A single-blind, prospective, observational study with a total of 518 patients evaluated according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status as classification I-II, aged between 1-18 years, and planned to undergo an EGD procedure, were included. Age, gender, weight, ASA assessment, exposure to smoking (the mother, the father, both parents were smokers, or not exposed to smoking), drug doses used in sedation, and anesthesia-related complications, such as cough, decrease in oxygen saturation, and laryngospasm were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 518 patients included in the study, 213 had no smoking exposure history. Oxygen saturation did not decrease below 90% in patients who did not have any smoking exposure. In addition, no laryngospasm was observed in this group. However, 4 (11.4%) of 31 patients whose mother only smoked, 10 (5.1%) of 187 child patients whose father only smoked, and 12 (16.4%) of 61 patients whose mother and father both smoked experienced laryngospasm during the procedure. CONCLUSION: The rate of cough, laryngospasm, and hypoxia development increased during the sedation carried out in the EGD procedure in children who were exposed to passive smoke.Clinicaltrial.gov ID: NCT03920046.
