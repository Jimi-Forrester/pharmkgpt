36233040|t|Cytokine Storm-Definition, Causes, and Implications.
36233040|a|The human innate and adaptive immune systems consist of effector cells producing cytokines (interleukins, interferons, chemokines, and numerous other mediators). Usually, a fragile equilibrium of pro- and anti-inflammation effects is maintained by complex regulatory mechanisms. Disturbances of this homeostasis can lead to intricate chain reactions resulting in a massive release of cytokines. This may result in a drastic self-reinforcement of various feedback mechanisms, which can ultimately lead to systemic damage, multi-organ failure, or death. Not only pathogens can initiate such disturbances, but also congenital diseases or immunomodulatory therapies. Due to the complex and diverse interactions within the innate and adaptive immune systems, the understanding of this important clinical syndrome is incomplete to date and effective therapeutic approaches remain scarce.
