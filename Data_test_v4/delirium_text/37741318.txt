37741318|t|IMD signaling in the gut and the brain modulates Amyloid-beta-induced deficits in Drosophila.
37741318|a|AIMS: Evidence indicates accumulating Abeta peptides in brain activates immune responses in neuronal and peripheral system, which may collaboratively influence pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aim to investigate whether regulating intestinal innate immune signaling ameliorates Abeta-induced impairments in Drosophila melanogaster. MAIN METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to observe expression changes of innate immune responses related genes in brain and in gut under the circumstance of Abeta overexpressing in nerve system. Aversive olfactory conditioning and survival assay were used to investigate effects of modulating Attacin-A (AttA) and Dpitercin-A (DptA). Fluorometric assays of respiratory burst activity was introduced to explore whether reducing oxidative stress enables overexpressing intestinal AttA and DptA to reverse Abeta-induced deficits. KEY FINDINGS: In vivo genetic analysis revealed that accumulating Abeta42 in neurons modulates innate immune signaling of the IMD pathway both in the brain and in the gut. Increased expression levels of the intestinal AttA and DptA improved learning performance and extended the lifespan of Abeta42 flies. The administration of apramycin led to alleviations of Abeta-induced behavioral changes, indicating that gram-negative bacteria are associated with the development of Abeta-induced pathologies. Further analysis showed that the neural expression of Abeta42 increased oxidative stress in the gut, which disrupted intestinal integrity and decreased learning performance. In addition, increased levels of AMPs targeting gram-negative bacteria and antioxidants reduced oxidative stress in the gut and reversed Abeta-induced behavioral damage. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that innate immune responses in the gut play a pivotal role in modulating Abeta-induced pathologies.
