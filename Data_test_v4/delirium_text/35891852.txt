35891852|t|Communicating Hydrocephalus as a Consequence of Chronic Kidney Disease on Maintenance Hemodialysis: An Uncommon Complication of a Common Disease.
35891852|a|While many etiologies of hydrocephalus for different age groups have been studied in detail, chronic kidney disease remains rare. We report a case of a 42-year-old male who was a known case of chronic kidney disease on maintenance hemodialysis since seven years. He was brought to the emergency department with a history of altered sensorium and irrelevant talk since the last 4-5 hours and was found to be a case of communicating hydrocephalus with periventricular ooze, as revealed by a computed tomography (CT) of the brain. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery was performed, and the patient ultimately recovered and was discharged.
