37128516|t|Organophosphate Toxicity Presenting as a Stroke Alert.
37128516|a|Altered mental status is a common emergency department presentation. It has a broad differential and can be particularly challenging when the patient is unable to give a history and collateral information is not immediately available. The authors present a case of altered mental status initially brought in as a stroke alert but later discovered to be intentional organophosphate ingestion. Although organophosphate poisoning is relatively rare in the United States, it should be considered in patients with altered mental status with miosis who are unresponsive to naloxone, especially in the setting of bradycardia or copious secretions.
