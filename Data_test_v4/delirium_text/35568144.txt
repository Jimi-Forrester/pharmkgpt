35568144|t|Structurally related (-)-epicatechin metabolites and gut microbiota derived metabolites exert genomic modifications via VEGF signaling pathways in brain microvascular endothelial cells under lipotoxic conditions: Integrated multi-omic study.
35568144|a|Dysfunction of blood-brain barrier formed by endothelial cells of cerebral blood vessels, plays a key role in development of neurodegenerative disorders. Epicatechin exerts vasculo-protective effects through genomic modifications, however molecular mechanisms of action, particularly on brain endothelial cells, are largely unknow. This study aimed to use a multi-omic approach (transcriptomics of mRNA, miRNAs and lncRNAs, and proteomics), to provide novel in-depth insights into molecular mechanisms of how metabolites affect brain endothelial cells under lipid-stressed (as a model of BBB dysfunction) at physiological concentrations. We showed that metabolites can simultaneously modulate expression of protein-coding, non-coding genes and proteins. Integrative analysis revealed interactions between different types of RNAs and form functional groups of genes involved in regulation of processing like VEGF-related functions, cell signaling, cell adhesion and permeability. Molecular modeling of genomics data predicted that metabolites decrease endothelial cell permeability, increased by lipotoxic stress. Correlation analysis between genomic modifications observed and genomic signature of patients with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's diseases showed opposite gene expression changes. Taken together, this study describes for the first time a multi-omic mechanism of action by which (-)-epicatechin metabolites could preserve brain vascular endothelial cell integrity and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. SIGNIFICANCE: Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), characterized by dysfunction of endothelial cells of cerebral blood vessels, result in an increase in permeability and neuroinflammation which constitute a key factor in the development neurodegenerative disorders. Even though it is suggested that polyphenols can prevent or delay the development of these disorders, their impact on brain endothelial cells and underlying mechanisms of actions are unknow. This study aimed to use a multi-omic approach including analysis of expression of mRNA, microRNA, long non-coding RNAs, and proteins to provide novel global in-depth insights into molecular mechanisms of how (-)-epicatechin metabolites affect brain microvascular endothelial cells under lipid-stressed (as a model of BBB dysfunction) at physiological relevant conditions. The results provide basis of knowledge on the capacity of polyphenols to prevent brain endothelial dysfunction and consequently neurodegenerative disorders.
