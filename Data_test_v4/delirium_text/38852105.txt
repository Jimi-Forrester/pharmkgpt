38852105|t|Does Postanesthesia Forced-Air Warming Affect Emergence Delirium in Pediatric Patients Receiving Daily Anesthesia?
38852105|a|PURPOSE: To determine if postanesthesia forced-air warming as a nonpharmacologic intervention for emergence delirium (ED)/emergence agitation (EA) decreased the incidence and severity of ED in children aged 18 months to 6 years old. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized controlled trial. METHODS: Participants included children aged 18 months to 6 years old receiving general anesthesia within a radiation oncology setting. Status of ED/EA was based on the participants' Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale score (two consecutive scores greater than 10 out of 20) or inconsolable agitation behaviors post computed tomography simulation (day 0). Interrater reliability was conducted among the center's perianesthesia care nurses. Participants who scored positive for ED/EA received a forced-air warming blanket for the remainder of treatment with data collection 1 to 14 days postanesthesia. Non-ED/EA participants were followed for 14 days and provided forced-air warming if ED/EA occurred. Data consisted of daily PAED scores and self- or parent-report on the anxiety scale. If the participants received forced-air warming, nurses' clinical observations and parent satisfaction surveys were collected 3 times during the 14-day study period. FINDINGS: A total of 59 participants completed the study (mean age 3.43 years; 60% male; 63% non-Hispanic White); 16 were identified with ED or EA (mean age 3.56 years; 50% male; 69% non-Hispanic White) with an incidence rate of 28%. For the 16 participants with ED/EA, the primary diagnosis consisted of solid tumors and an American Society of Anesthesia Classification III to IV. Prior to the forced-air warming intervention, all 16 participants exhibited inconsolable ED/EA behaviors, including 8 who had PAED scores greater than 10. ED/EA behaviors expressed included inconsolability, confusion, thrashing, and combativeness. Within the 14-day period, 3 participants received forced-air warming on day 1, while the other 13 received an average of 4.23 days of treatment (range 1 to 11 days; mode 1 day; median 4 days). Comparison of PAED scores pre (mean 4.4) and post (mean 1.8) indicated that the use of forced-air warming was statistically significant (P = .001). ED/EA behaviors and PAED scores after the forced-air warming period decreased in all but one participant. Some agitation behaviors were not captured within the PAED score. CONCLUSIONS: Forced-air warming impacted PAED scores and agitation behaviors for studied participants, offering a safe, nonpharmacological nursing intervention that may be an effective tool for helping to manage this baffling condition.
