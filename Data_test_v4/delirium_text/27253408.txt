27253408|a|Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is primarily known as the most ubiquitously expressed member of the transglutaminase family with Ca(2+)-dependent protein crosslinking activity; however, this enzyme exhibits multiple additional functions through GTPase, cell adhesion, protein disulfide isomerase, kinase, and scaffold activities and is associated with cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. TG2 is found in the extracellular matrix, plasma membrane, cytosol, mitochondria, recycling endosomes, and nucleus, and its subcellular localization is an important determinant of its function. Depending upon the cell type and stimuli, TG2 changes its subcellular localization and biological activities, playing both anti- and pro-apoptotic roles. Increasing evidence indicates that the GTP-bound form of the enzyme (in its closed form) protects cells from apoptosis but that the transamidation activity of TG2 (in its open form) participates in both facilitating and inhibiting apoptosis. A difficulty in the study and understanding of this enigmatic protein is that opposing effects have been reported regarding its roles in the same physiological and/or pathological systems. These include neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects, hepatic cell growth-promoting or hepatic cell death-inducing effects, exacerbating or having no effect on liver fibrosis, and anti- and pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cells. The reasons for these discrepancies have been ascribed to TG2's multifunctional activities, genetic variants, conformational changes induced by the immediate environment, and differences in the genetic background of the mice used in each of the experiments. In this article, we first report that TG2 has opposing roles like the protagonist in the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, followed by a summary of the controversies reported, and finally discuss the possible reasons for these discrepancies.
