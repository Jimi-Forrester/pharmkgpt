33686380|a|The pandemic of severe acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by respiratory symptoms with serious consequences, mainly associated with pneumonia and extreme ARDS. There is a lack of data about specific neurological manifestations of covid-19 infections literature. Epidemiological trials in fewer than 30% of a population reported symptoms of headache and delirium (Helms et al., 2020). Covid-19's neurotropism is still debatable, uncertain and in the present case study patient with Covid-19 is identified. He suffered with extreme respiratory complications during hospitalization and eventually died.
