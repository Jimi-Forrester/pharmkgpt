34179248|t|Common Carotid Arteries Occlusion Surgery in Adult Rats as a Model of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.
34179248|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is an important risk factor of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hypoxia/ischemia in the whole brain induced by CCH causes serious damage to brain structure and function, which can lead to cognitive impairment. Two-vessel occlusion (2-VO), also known as permanent, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, is one of the most widely used animal models (e.g., rat) of CCH to investigate the mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes. In this protocol, we present the surgical procedure for 2-VO in rats.
