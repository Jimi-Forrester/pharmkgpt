33241314|t|Alzheimer Disease Pathogenesis: The Role of Autoimmunity.
33241314|a|BACKGROUND: In addition to deposits of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, growing evidence demonstrates that complex and multifaceted biological processes can arise during Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. The recent failures of clinical trials based on the amyloid hypothesis and the presence of Abeta plaques in cognitively healthy elderly persons without AD point toward a need to explore novel pathobiological mechanisms of AD. CONTENT: In the search for alternative AD mechanisms, numerous genome-wide association studies and mechanistic discoveries suggest a potential immunologic component of the disease. However, new experimental tools are needed to uncover these immunogenic components. The current methods, such as ELISAs or protein microarrays, have limitations of low throughput and/or sensitivity and specificity. In this article, we briefly discuss evidence of potential autoimmune contributions to AD pathobiology, describe the current methods for identifying autoantibodies in patient fluids, and outline our own efforts to develop new techniques for novel autoantibody biomarker discovery. SUMMARY: Uncovering the putative autoimmune components of AD may be crucial in paving the way to new concepts for pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy. IMPACT STATEMENT: In addition to deposits of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, growing evidence demonstrates that complex and multifaceted biological processes can arise during Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. Numerous research directions, including genome-wide association, clinical correlation, and mechanistic studies, have pointed to a potential autoimmunologic contribution to AD pathology. We present research suggesting the association between autoimmunity and AD and demonstrate the need for new laboratory techniques to further characterize potential brain antigen-specific autoantibodies. Uncovering the putative autoimmune components of AD may be crucial in paving the way to new concepts for pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy.
