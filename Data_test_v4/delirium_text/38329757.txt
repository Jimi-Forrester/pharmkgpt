38329757|t|Exercise Intervention and Hospital-Associated Disability: A Nonrandomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
38329757|a|Importance: Inpatient exercise interventions may prevent, at least partly, hospital-associated disability (HAD) in older adults, but whether they also confer clinical benefits in the months following discharge is unclear. Objective: To examine the association of exercise and health education with HAD incidence in hospitalized older adults receiving acute hospital care at discharge and 3 months later. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center open-label, nonrandomized controlled clinical trial included patients aged 75 years or older seen at an acute care for elders unit at a tertiary public hospital in Madrid, Spain, from May 1, 2018, to June 30, 2022. Interventions: Patients were allocated to an intervention or control group. Both groups received usual care, but the intervention group also performed a supervised multicomponent exercise program (daily strength, balance, and walking exercises along with inspiratory muscle training) during hospitalization and received health education on how to exercise at home and telephone counseling during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was HAD incidence (determined by the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living [hereafter, Katz Index]) at discharge and after 3 months compared with baseline (ie, 2 weeks before admission). Secondary outcomes included HAD incidence determined by the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living, ambulatory capacity decline at discharge and follow-up, changes in physical performance at discharge, and incidence of falls, readmissions, and mortality during the follow-up period. Results: The study included 260 patients (134 women [51.5%]; mean [SD] age, 87.4 [4.9] years [range, 75-105 years]; median hospital length of stay, 7 days [IQR, 5-10 days]), of whom 130 received the intervention and 130 were in the control group. Differences in HAD incidence did not reach statistical significance at discharge (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.37-1.05; P = .08) or follow-up (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.36-1.17; P = .15) when using the Katz Index. A lower HAD incidence was observed in the intervention group at discharge (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.81; P = .01) and at follow-up (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.66; P = .001) when using the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living. The intervention was also associated with a lesser decline in ambulatory capacity (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96; P = .03) and improved physical performance at discharge (Cohen d, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12-0.65; P = .004). No significant associations were observed for readmissions, falls, or mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this nonrandomized controlled clinical trial, an exercise and health education intervention was not significantly associated with reduced HAD incidence when measured by the Katz Index. However, the benefits found for several secondary outcomes might support the implementation of in-hospital exercise programs for older patients.
