37670711|a|The most prevalent cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the global AD rate is on a constant rise, medical research is yet to find a cure for this neurological condition. Current available therapeutic drugs for AD treatment only provide symptomatic alleviation. Therefore, it is essential to establish effective AD treatment strategies in addressing clinical needs. The development of disease-modifying treatments for use in the disease's early stages and the advancement of symptomatic drugs principally used in the disease's later stages are priorities in AD research. Given that the etiology of AD is difficult to comprehend, using a multimodal therapy intervention that targets molecular targets of AD-related degenerative processes is a practical strategy to change the course of AD progression. The current review article discussed PPAR-alpha (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha) and PDE5 (Phosphodiesterase type 5) targets with evidence for their preclinical and clinical importance. Furthermore, we support the targets with AD-related processes, functions, and remedial measures. A unique synergistic method for treating AD may involve the beneficial combinatorial targeting of these two receptors. Furthermore, we reviewed different PDE chemical families in this research and identified PDE5 inhibitors as one of the promising AD-related experimental and clinical disease-modifying medications. Lastly, we suggest jointly targeting these two pathways would be more beneficial than monotherapy in AD treatments.
