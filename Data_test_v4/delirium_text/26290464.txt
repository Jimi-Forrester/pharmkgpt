26290464|t|Molecular Insight in the Multifunctional Effects of Oridonin.
26290464|a|Oridonin has attracted considerable attention in the last decade because of its anti-cancer pharmacological properties. This ent-kaurane diterpenoid, isolated from the Chinese herb Rabdosia rubescens and some related species, has demonstrated great potential in the treatment profile of many diseases by exerting anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic, and neurological effects. Unfortunately, the mechanisms via which oridonin exerts these effects remain poorly understood. This review provides an overview of the multifunctional effects of oridonin as well as the reasons for its potential for investigations in the treatment of many diseases other than cancer.
