20015199|t|Temporal relationship of autophagy and apoptosis in neurons challenged by low molecular weight beta-amyloid peptide.
20015199|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Previous studies suggested that various soluble Abeta species are neurotoxic and able to activate apoptosis and autophagy, the type I and type II programmed cell death, respectively. However, the sequential and functional relationships between these two cellular events remain elusive. Here we report that low molecular weight Abeta triggered cleavage of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase to cause neuronal apoptosis in rat cortical neurons. On the other hand, Abeta activated autophagy by inducing autophagic vesicle formation and autophagy related gene 12 (ATG12), and up-regulated the lysoso-mal machinery for the degradation of autophagosomes. Moreover, we demonstrated that activation of autophagy by Abeta preceded that of apoptosis, with death associated protein kinase phosphorylation as the potential molecular link. More importantly, under Abeta toxicity, neurons exhibiting high level of autophagosome formation were absent of apoptotic features, and inhibition of autophagy by 3-methylade-nine advanced neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy can protect neurons from Abeta-induced apoptosis.
