39105797|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, pose significant health challenges and economic burdens worldwide. Recent studies have emphasized the potential therapeutic value of activating silent information regulator-1 (SIRT1) in treating these conditions. Resveratrol, a compound known for its ability to potently activate SIRT1, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects by targeting the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. In this review, we delve into the crucial role of resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 upregulation in improving neurodegenerative diseases. The role of the activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol was reviewed. Moreover, network pharmacology was used to elucidate the possible mechanisms of resveratrol in these diseases. Activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol had positive effects on neuronal function and survival and alleviated the hallmark features of these diseases, such as protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In terms of network pharmacology, the signaling pathways by which resveratrol protects against different neurodegenerative diseases were slightly different. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol and SIRT1 activation remain under investigation, these findings offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.
