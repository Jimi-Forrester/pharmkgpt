12031889|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (A(beta)) is heavily deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and free radical oxidative stress, particularly of neuronal lipids and proteins, is extensive. Recent research suggests that these two observations may be linked by A(beta)-induced oxidative stress in AD brain. This review summarizes current knowledge on phospholipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in AD brain, one potential cause of this oxidative stress, and consequences of A(beta)-induced lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in AD brain.
