24936838|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess psychiatric disorders and their association with burn-related factors in a population of Turkish children with burns. METHODS: Thirty-one children admitted to the Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Burn Unit between January 2013 and August 2013 were first assessed by the plastic surgeon, and then those with psychological symptoms were referred to a child psychiatrist, and the records were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The percentage of burned area to Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) ranged between 2-60% (mean, 17.3%). Nineteen patients (61.3%) had a psychiatric diagnosis, which included acute stress disorder (ASD) (n=15), depression (n=3), posttraumatic stress disorder (n=2, comorbid with depression), and delirium (n=1). The percentage of burned area to TBSA was associated with the presence of psychopathology and ASD. Further, psychopathology was associated with the number of burned major body regions. CONCLUSION: Pediatric burn patients are at risk of developing psychopathology. The children with a greater percentage of burned area to TBSA and more burned body regions have the greatest risk of psychopathology. Surgeons have an important role in patient referral for psychiatric interventions, so that psychiatric disorders can be prevented as early as possible.
