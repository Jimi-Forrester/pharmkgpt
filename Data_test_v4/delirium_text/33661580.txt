33661580|a|Human microbiota communicates with its host by secreting signaling metabolites, enzymes, or structural components. Its homeostasis strongly influences the modulation of human tissue barriers and immune system. Dysbiosis-induced peripheral immunity response can propagate bacterial and pro-inflammatory signals to the whole body, including the brain. This immune-mediated communication may contribute to several neurodegenerative disorders, as Alzheimer's disease. In fact, neurodegeneration is associated with dysbiosis and neuroinflammation. The interplay between the microbial communities and the brain is complex and bidirectional, and a great deal of interest is emerging to define the exact mechanisms. This review focuses on microbiota-immunity-central nervous system (CNS) communication and shows how gut and oral microbiota populations trigger immune cells, propagating inflammation from the periphery to the cerebral parenchyma, thus contributing to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Moreover, an overview of the technological challenges with in vitro modeling of the microbiota-immunity-CNS axis, offering interesting technological hints about the most advanced solutions and current technologies is provided.
