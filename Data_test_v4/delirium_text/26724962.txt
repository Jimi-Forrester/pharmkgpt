26724962|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cognitive impairment in PD have overlapping clinical and pathological features. To examine whether there is a genetic link for these diseases, we performed a case-control study in Chinese population to evaluate the association of AD genome-wide association studies top hits with both PD and cognitive function in PD, investigating 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 genes (BIN1, CLU, ABCA7, CR1, PICALM, MS4A6A, CD33, MS4A4E, and CD2AP). A total of 454 controls and 442 PD patients were genotyped, including 75 mild cognitive impairment and 99 dementia. As a result, no significant association of the AD-susceptibility loci was identified in PD cases, PD-dementia, or PD-mild cognitive impairment. Our findings imply that the 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from AD genome-wide association studies may not play major role in the genetic predisposition with PD and cognitive function in PD in a Chinese population.
