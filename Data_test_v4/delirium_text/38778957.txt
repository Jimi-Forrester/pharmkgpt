38778957|a|Olanzapine is one of the atypical antipsychotic agents which is being increasingly used, and it is synthetic derivative of thienobenzodiazepine with antipsychotic, and antinausea, and antiemetic activities. Olanzapine overdose is mainly associated with the development of anticholinergic toxicity and is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) suppression, tachycardia, and delirium. As little is yet known about the effects of this agent in toxic doses, it is important to report the features of overdose. Herein, we reported a 28-year-old male with a history of mental illness and substance abuse, who was admitted in a comatose state with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Head computed tomography (CT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed significant cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure, indicative of olanzapine-induced neurotoxicity. Management involved immediate cessation of olanzapine, administration of intravenous mannitol for cerebral edema, and supportive care. The patient's condition gradually improved with these interventions. Elevated olanzapine plasma concentration confirmed the diagnosis of overdose. Cranial pressure-lowering treatment has a certain effect on improving the condition of patients.
