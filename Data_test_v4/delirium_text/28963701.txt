28963701|a|An increasing amount of findings suggests that the aggregation of soluble peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils is a relevant upstream process in the complex cascade of events leading to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders. Nevertheless, several aspects of the correlation between the aggregation process and the onset and development of the pathology remain largely elusive. In this context, biophysical and biochemical studies in test tubes have proven extremely powerful in providing quantitative information about the structure and the reactivity of amyloids at the molecular level. In this review we use selected recent examples to illustrate the importance of such biophysical research to complement phenomenological studies based on cellular and molecular biology, and we discuss the implications for pharmaceutical applications associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in both academic and industrial contexts.
