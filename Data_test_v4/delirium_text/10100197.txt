10100197|a|Hydrogen peroxide has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, the effects of hydrogen peroxide upon the functional integrity of beta-adrenoceptors have been investigated in C6 glioma cells. Treatment of cells for 24 h with hydrogen peroxide in serum-free medium produced a concentration-dependent cell toxicity, seen both using cell counting and LDH release into medium as end point. There were no large nor consistent changes in either the density of cell surface beta 1, or beta 2-adrenoceptors, measured using the hydrophilic ligand [3H](-)-CGP 12177, nor in either basal, forskolin and isoprenaline-stimulated cAMP responses, following hydrogen peroxide treatment. It is concluded that the decreased adenylyl cyclase activity and responsiveness to Gs stimulation found in post-mortem brain samples from Alzheimer's disease autopsy cases is unlikely to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide.
