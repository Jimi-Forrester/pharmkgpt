36835223|t|Mechanical Ventilation-Related High Stretch Mainly Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Thus Mediates Inflammation Response in Cultured Human Primary Airway Smooth Muscle Cells.
36835223|a|Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) occurs in mechanically ventilated patients of respiratory disease and is typically characterized by airway inflammation. However, recent studies increasingly indicate that a major cause of VILI may be the excessive mechanical loading such as high stretch (>10% strain) on airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) due to mechanical ventilation (MV). Although ASMCs are the primary mechanosensitive cells in airways and contribute to various airway inflammation diseases, it is still unclear how they respond to high stretch and what mediates such a response. Therefore, we used whole genome-wide mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-Seq), bioinformatics, and functional identification to systematically analyze the mRNA expression profiles and signaling pathway enrichment of cultured human ASMCs exposed to high stretch (13% strain), aiming to screen the susceptible signaling pathway through which cells respond to high stretch. The data revealed that in response to high stretch, 111 mRNAs with count >=100 in ASMCs were significantly differentially expressed (defined as DE-mRNAs). These DE-mRNAs are mainly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related signaling pathways. ER stress inhibitor (TUDCA) abolished high-stretch-enhanced mRNA expression of genes associated with ER stress, downstream inflammation signaling, and major inflammatory cytokines. These results demonstrate in a data-driven approach that in ASMCs, high stretch mainly induced ER stress and activated ER stress-related signaling and downstream inflammation response. Therefore, it suggests that ER stress and related signaling pathways in ASMCs may be potential targets for timely diagnosis and intervention of MV-related pulmonary airway diseases such as VILI.
