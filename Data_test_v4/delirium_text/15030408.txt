15030408|a|Previous work had shown that the ratio of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit mRNA transcripts containing an N-terminal splice cassette to those that do not is markedly lower in regions of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain that are susceptible to pathological damage, compared with spared regions in the same cases or homotropic regions in controls. To elucidate the origins of this difference in proportionate expression, we measured the absolute levels of each of the eight NR1 transcripts by quantitative internally standardized RT-PCR assay. Expression of transcripts with the cassette was strongly attenuated in susceptible regions of Alzheimer's brain, whereas expression of non-cassette transcripts differed little from that in controls. The expression of other NR1 splice variants was not associated with pathology relevant to disease status, although some combinations of splice cassettes were well maintained in AD cases. The population profile of NR1 transcripts in occipital cortex differed from the profiles in other brain regions studied. Western analysis confirmed that the expression of protein isoforms containing the N-terminal peptide was very low in susceptible areas of the Alzheimer's brain. Cells that express NR1 subunits with the N-terminal cassette may be selectively vulnerable to toxicity in AD.
