32069856|t|Targeting Tumors Using Peptides.
32069856|a|To penetrate solid tumors, low molecular weight (Mw < 10 KDa) compounds have an edge over antibodies: their higher penetration because of their small size. Because of the dense stroma and high interstitial fluid pressure of solid tumors, the penetration of higher Mw compounds is unfavored and being small thus becomes an advantage. This review covers a wide range of peptidic ligands-linear, cyclic, macrocyclic and cyclotidic peptides-to target tumors: We describe the main tools to identify peptides experimentally, such as phage display, and the possible chemical modifications to enhance the properties of the identified peptides. We also review in silico identification of peptides and the most salient non-peptidic ligands in clinical stages. We later focus the attention on the current validated ligands available to target different tumor compartments: blood vessels, extracelullar matrix, and tumor associated macrophages. The clinical advances and failures of these ligands and their therapeutic conjugates will be discussed. We aim to present the reader with the state-of-the-art in targeting tumors, by using low Mw molecules, and the tools to identify new ligands.
