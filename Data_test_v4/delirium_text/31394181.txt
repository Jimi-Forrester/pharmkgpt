31394181|a|Epidemiological studies have compellingly documented the ability of the Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil to reduce the incidence of certain malignancies, and cardiovascular diseases, and slow the Alzheimer's disease progression. S-(-)-Oleocanthal (OC) was identified as the most bioactive olive oil phenolic with documented anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-Alzheimer's activities. OC consumption causes irritating sensation at the oropharynx via activation of TRPA1. Accordingly, a taste-masked formulation of OC is needed for its future use as a nutraceutical while maintaining its bioactivity and unique chemistry. Therefore, the goal of this study was to prepare a taste-masked OC solid formulation with improved dissolution and pharmacodynamic profiles, by using (+)-xylitol as an inert carrier. Xylitol was hypothesized to serve as an ideal vehicle for the preparation of OC solid dispersions due to its low melting point and sweetness. The optimized OC-(+)-xylitol solid dispersion was physically and chemically characterized and showed effective taste masking and enhanced dissolution properties. Furthermore, OC-(+)-xylitol solid dispersion maintained potent in vivo anti-breast cancer activity. It effectively suppressed the human triple negative breast cancer development, growth, and recurrence after primary tumor surgical excision in nude mice orthotopic xenograft models. Collectively, these results suggest the OC-(+)-xylitol solid dispersion formulation as a potential nutraceutical for effective control and prevention of human triple negative breast cancer.
