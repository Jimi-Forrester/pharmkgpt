38921287|t|Rethinking Mental Automatism: De Clerambault's Theory in the Age of Novel Psychoactive Drugs: Psychotropic Effects and Synthetic Psychosis.
38921287|a|The widespread use of novel psychoactive substances (NPSs)-defined as new narcotic or psychotropic agents not classified under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971-poses a significant challenge to contemporary mental health paradigms due to their impact on psychiatric disorders. This study revisits and expands upon the theory of mental automatism as proposed by Gaetan Gatian de Clerambault, aiming to elucidate the psychopathological mechanisms underlying substance-induced psychoses (SIP) and their distinction from non-induced psychoses (schizophrenia and related disorders). Through a phenomenological and clinical investigation, we explore the relevance of mental automatism in the development of toxic psychoses, drawing upon the historical and contemporary literature. This research highlights the psychopathological distinctions between induced and non-induced psychoses and the transition mechanisms from acute to chronic psychosis states. De Clerambault's theory, supplemented by Janet, Jackson, and Bonhoeffer's contributions, provides a foundational framework for understanding the genesis of SIP. Our findings suggest that NPS consumption, particularly among adolescents and psychiatric patients, significantly correlates with increased risks of SIP, marked by a transition to chronicity influenced by biological lesions triggered by substance use. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework for SIP, integrating mental automatism, psychopathological distinctions, and transition mechanisms. This framework aims to refine diagnostic criteria and therapeutic approaches, addressing gaps in clinical practice and research. The study underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of SIP, advocating for a paradigm shift in psychiatric assessment and treatment approaches to better address the complexities of substance-induced mental health disorders.
