35713284|a|The aggregation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cell membrane composition, especially monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1), is known to promote the formation of Abeta fibrils, yet little is known about the roles of GM1 in the early steps of Abeta oligomer formation. Here, by using GM1-contained liposomes as a mimic of the neuronal cell membrane, we demonstrate that GM1 is a critical trigger of Abeta oligomerization and aggregation. We find that GM1 not only promotes the formation of Abeta fibrils but also facilitates the maintenance of Abeta42 oligomers on liposome membranes. We structurally characterize the Abeta42 oligomers formed on the membrane and find that GM1 captures Abeta by binding to its arginine-5 residue. To interrogate the mechanism of Abeta42 oligomer toxicity, we design a new liposome-based Ca2+-encapsulation assay and provide new evidence for the Abeta42 ion channel hypothesis. Finally, we determine the toxicity of Abeta42 oligomers formed on membranes. Overall, by uncovering the roles of GM1 in mediating early Abeta oligomer formation and maintenance, our work provides a novel direction for pharmaceutical research for AD.
