39125993|t|The Role of Magnesium in Parkinson's Disease: Status Quo and Implications for Future Research.
39125993|a|Neurodegenerative diseases represent an increasing economic, social, and, above all, medical burden worldwide. The second most prevalent disease in this category is Parkinson's disease, surpassed only by Alzheimer's. It is a treatable but still incurable systemic disease with a pathogenesis that has not yet been elucidated. Several theories are currently being developed to explain the causes and progression of Parkinson's disease. Magnesium is one of the essential macronutrients and is absolutely necessary for life as we know it. The magnesium cation performs several important functions in the cell in the context of energetic metabolism, substrate metabolism, cell signalling, and the regulation of the homeostasis of other ions. Several of these cellular processes have been simultaneously described as being disrupted in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. The relationship between magnesium homeostasis and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has received little scientific attention to date. The aim of this review is to summarise and critically evaluate the current state of knowledge on the possible role of magnesium in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and to outline possible future directions for research in this area.
