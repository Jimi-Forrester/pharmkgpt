33362800|t|The Joint-Brain Axis: Insights From Rheumatoid Arthritis on the Crosstalk Between Chronic Peripheral Inflammation and the Brain.
33362800|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by erosive polyarthritis. Beyond joint pathology, RA is associated with neuropsychiatric comorbidity including depression, anxiety, and an increased risk to develop neurodegenerative diseases in later life. Studies investigating the central nervous system (CNS) in preclinical models of RA have leveraged the understanding of the intimate crosstalk between peripheral and central immune responses. This mini review summarizes the current knowledge of CNS comorbidity in RA patients and known underlying cellular mechanisms. We focus on the differential regulation of CNS myeloid and glial cells in different mouse models of RA reflecting different patterns of peripheral immune activation. Moreover, we address CNS responses to anti-inflammatory treatment in human RA patients and mice. Finally, to illustrate the bidirectional communication between the CNS and chronic peripheral inflammation, we present the current knowledge about the impact of the CNS on arthritis. A comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk between the CNS and chronic peripheral inflammation will help to identify RA patients at risk of developing CNS comorbidity, setting the path for future therapeutic approaches in both RA and neuropsychiatric diseases.
