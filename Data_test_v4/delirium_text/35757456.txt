35757456|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could prompt various neurological complications. Abrupt visual disturbance was reported as a rare severe manifestation of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Autoimmune conditions were assumed to have an undeniable role in creation of such circumstances. This report presents a 69-year-old woman with sudden bilateral blindness three weeks after recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demyelination due to COVID-19-related autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CRAD-C) was considered to be the etiology of her bilateral blindness. Due to her progressive demyelination, immunosuppressive treatments were administered, which resulted in stabilizing post-COVID-19 demyelinating lesions. Accordingly, in the case of COVID-19-related neurological deficits, especially the acute and progressive symptoms, there should be great consideration of autoimmune response to prevent serious complications; hence early diagnosis, treatment, and long-term assessment of patients are necessitated.
