32974072|a|PURPOSE: Unlike therapy-related nausea and vomiting (chemotherapy or radiotherapy induced), nausea and vomiting (N/V) in patients with advanced cancer is often multicausal and thus presents unique challenges. Few professional guidelines address the palliative management of N/V, and those that do are insufficiently detailed to bolster clinical decision-making. Nonetheless, oncology advanced practitioners (APs) are frequently challenged to manage these high-impact symptoms. This requires collaborating with other oncology care providers and cultivating a knowledge base to educate and mentor professional colleagues to optimize N/V unrelated to treatment. METHODS: Literature reviewed included current and classic articles that address the physiologic bases of N/V related to disease and with malignant bowel obstruction, agents used to alleviate nausea or N/V, and nonpharmacologic adjunctive measures. This information was framed within palliative care and symptom management clinical experience. RESULTS: This review article summarizes what is known about the neuropharmacology of N/V in advanced disease. Focused assessment, pharmacologic agents (antiemetics, central neuromodulators, and peripheral prokinetic agents), and nondrug adjunctive measures that may be useful for N/V are included. CONCLUSIONS: Managing N/V in advanced cancer is a quality-of-life imperative that requires persistence and interprofessional collaboration among oncology APs and other clinicians to personalize management. This work can change the perception that N/V related to progressive disease is frequently intractable to one that considers it as a manageable clinical challenge.
