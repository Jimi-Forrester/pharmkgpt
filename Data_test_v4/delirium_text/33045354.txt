33045354|a|Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic. Unlike other SARS viruses, SARS-CoV2 does not solely impact the respiratory system, but additionally leads to inflammation of endothelial cells, microvascular injuries and coagulopathies, thereby affecting multiple organs. Recent reports of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV2 suggest persistent health problems even months after the initial infection. The French maritime pine bark extract Pycnogenol(R) has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, vascular and endothelium-protective effects in over 90 human clinical studies. It is proposed that Pycnogenol(R) may be beneficial in supporting recovery and mitigating symptoms and long-term consequences resulting from a SARS-CoV2 infection in COVID-19 patients.
