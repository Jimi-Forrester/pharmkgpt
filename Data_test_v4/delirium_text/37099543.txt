37099543|a|Nitric Oxide (NO) signaling pathway plays a vital role in various physiological and pathophysiological processes including vasodilation, neurogenesis, inflammation, translation and protein regulation. NO signaling pathway is associated with various diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, vision impairment, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Human Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) bound with calcium regulatory protein (calmodulin (CaM)) to produce NO which initiates cGMP pathway. The current study employs to screen the novel compounds against human eNOS independent of calcium regulatory protein (CaM). The current effort emphasized that the deficiency of CaM leads to dysfunction of cGMP signaling pathway. In this work, a hybrid approach of high-throughput virtual screening and comparative molecular docking studies followed by molecular dynamic simulation analyses were applied. The screening of top ranked two novel compounds against eNOS were reported that showed effective binding affinity, retrieved through the DrugBank and ZINC database libraries. Comparative molecular docking analyses revealed that Val-104, Phe-105, Gln-247, Arg-250, Ala-266, Trp-330, Tyr-331, Pro-334, Ala-335, Val-336, Tyr-357, Met-358, Thr-360, Glu-361, Ile-362, Arg-365, Asn-366, Asp-369, Arg-372, Trp-447 and Tyr-475 are potent residues for interactional studies. High-throughput virtual screening approach coupled with molecular dynamic simulation and drug likeness rules depicted that ZINC59677432 and DB00456 are potent compounds to target eNOS. In conclusion, the proposed compounds are potent against eNOS based on extensive in silico analyses. Overall, the findings of this study may be helpful to design therapeutic targets against eNOS.
