39100729|a|Cryptococcus neoformans is a global invasive mycosis that is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is commonly observed that individuals with compromised immune systems are more prone to developing cryptococcal meningitis. Although ocular involvement is rare, previous studies have indicated that ocular lesions precede symptomatic meningitis in only 27 % of patients with central nervous system involvement. Intraocular infections typically manifest as chorioretinopathy and vitreous inflammation, often leading to severe vision loss. In this case, we present the clinical details of a 57-year-old immunocompetent woman who visited the ophthalmology department of West China Hospital of Sichuan University with a progressive loss of vision in her right eye. After a thorough evaluation, she was diagnosed with fungal endophthalmitis, and subsequently initiated on appropriate induction anti-fungal therapy for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment, which can potentially improve the prognosis for patients.
