39045955|t|The role of the Chitinase 3-Like 1 (CHI3L1) genes in the preeclampsia pathophysiology.
39045955|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Chitinase 3-Like 1 gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of preeclampsia in a selected cohort of pregnant women. METHODS: A total of 75 pregnant women participated in the study, 35 of whom were diagnosed with preeclampsia, while 40 served as healthy controls. The preeclamptic group was subdivided based on severity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to analyze the serum samples for variations in Chitinase 3-Like 1 gene polymorphisms. RESULTS: The rs880633 polymorphism was found to be significantly more frequent in the control group (80%) compared with the overall preeclamptic group (60%) (p<0.05). In the severity-based subgroups, rs880633 appeared in 57.1% of non-severe and 61.9% of severe preeclamptics. Contrarily, the heterozygous form of rs7515776 polymorphism showed a significantly higher prevalence in the preeclamptic cohort (p<0.05), without distinctions in severity subgroups. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that the rs880633 polymorphism may serve a protective role against the development of preeclampsia, whereas the rs7515776 polymorphism may be associated with an elevated risk. Further research is warranted to elucidate the clinical implications of these findings.
