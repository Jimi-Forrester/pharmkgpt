17563722|t|Investigation of the association between interleukin-1beta polymorphism and normal tension glaucoma.
17563722|a|PURPOSE: In normal tension glaucoma (NTG), factors other than elevated intraocular pressure are likely to have a role in the pathogenesis of optic neuropathy. The potential similarities in cellular apoptosis leading to neurodegeneration between Alzheimer's disease and NTG were shown in recent studies. The interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; -511) and IL-1beta (+3953) polymorphisms were found to increase risk with Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the IL-1beta polymorphism is associated with NTG in the Chinese population. METHODS: This is a cohort study in a Chinese population that involved 231 people with NTG and 245 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction, followed by the enzymatic restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Patients and controls were genotyped for the C/T polymorphism at position -511 and +3953 of the IL-1beta gene. Genotypes for NTG and control groups were compared for statistically significant differences. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in genotype frequency or allele frequency distribution of the IL-1beta gene polymorphisms (position -511 and +3953) between NTG patients and the control group (p >0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed no evidence for an association between the IL-1beta (-511) and IL-1beta (+3953) polymorphisms and NTG. The IL-1beta gene polymorphisms (position -511 and +3953) may not play a key role in NTG pathogenesis in Chinese population.
