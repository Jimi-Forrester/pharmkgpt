35281771|t|Objective Diagnosis of Fibromyalgia Using Neuroretinal Evaluation and Artificial Intelligence.
35281771|a|Background/Objective: This study aims to identify objective biomarkers of fibromyalgia (FM) by applying artificial intelligence algorithms to structural data on the neuroretina obtained using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Method: The study cohort comprised 29 FM patients and 32 control subjects. The thicknesses of complete retina, 3 retinal layers [ganglion cell layer (GCL+), GCL++ (between the inner limiting membrane and the inner nuclear layer boundaries) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)] and choroid in 9 areas around the macula were obtained using SS-OCT. Discriminant capacity was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and the Relief algorithm. A diagnostic aid system with an automatic classifier was implemented. Results: No significant difference (p >= .660) was found anywhere in the choroid. In the RNFL, a significant difference was found in the inner inferior region (p = .010). In the GCL+, GCL++ layers and complete retina, a significant difference was found in the 4 regions defining the inner ring: temporal, superior, nasal and inferior. Applying an ensemble RUSBoosted tree classifier to the features with greatest discriminant capacity achieved accuracy = .82 and AUC = .82. Conclusions: This study identifies a potential novel objective and non-invasive biomarker of FM based on retina analysis using SS-OCT.
