34880025|t|Technology-based counselling in dementia (TeCoDem): study protocol of a mixed-methods systematic review with qualitative comparative analysis and meta-analysis.
34880025|a|INTRODUCTION: Information technology can enhance timely and individual support for people with dementia and informal carers. There is some evidence that people with dementia and informal carers would benefit from technology-based counselling. However, it remains unclear which features of those interventions relate to beneficial outcomes and which aspects are necessary for a successful implementation. Therefore, the primary objectives are: (1) to identify conditions of successful implementation of technology-based counselling interventions in dementia and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of those interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a mixed-methods systematic review. The first primary objective requires evidence from various study designs addressing aspects on effective and non-effective implementation of technology-based counselling. This could be telephone-based, web-based or mobile-based interventions for people with dementia and informal carers. For the second primary objective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) dealing with any outcomes will be included. Year of publication and language will not be restricted. We will search CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science up to April 2021. Additionally, we will perform web searching and citation tracking. To achieve the first primary objective, a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be conducted. The QCA enables us to identify necessary or sufficient components for a successful implementation. To reach the second primary objective, a meta-analysis will be performed with respect to potential clinical and statistical heterogeneity of RCTs. The revised Risk of Bias tool 2.0 will be used to check the risk of bias in RCTs. For all other study designs, the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool will be used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this review. We will disseminate our findings through scientific and non-scientific journal articles and conference presentations as well as formats directed to the public and decision-makers in healthcare.
