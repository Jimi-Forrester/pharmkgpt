39091796|t|The Genetic Architecture of the Human Corpus Callosum and its Subregions.
39091796|a|The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest set of white matter fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. In humans, it is essential for coordinating sensorimotor responses, performing associative/executive functions, and representing information in multiple dimensions. Understanding which genetic variants underpin corpus callosum morphometry, and their shared influence on cortical structure and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, can provide molecular insights into the CC's role in mediating cortical development and its contribution to neuropsychiatric disease. To characterize the morphometry of the midsagittal corpus callosum, we developed a publicly available artificial intelligence based tool to extract, parcellate, and calculate its total and regional area and thickness. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD), we extracted measures of midsagittal corpus callosum morphometry and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of European participants (combined N = 46,685). We then examined evidence for generalization to the non-European participants of the UKB and ABCD cohorts (combined N = 7,040). Post-GWAS analyses implicate prenatal intracellular organization and cell growth patterns, and high heritability in regions of open chromatin, suggesting transcriptional activity regulation in early development. Results suggest programmed cell death mediated by the immune system drives the thinning of the posterior body and isthmus. Global and local genetic overlap, along with causal genetic liability, between the corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity and bipolar disorders were identified. These results provide insight into variability of corpus callosum development, its genetic influence on the cerebral cortex, and biological mechanisms related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.
