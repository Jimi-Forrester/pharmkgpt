33664543|a|Most patients with dementia have behavioural and psychological symptoms. The first-line treatments for these symptoms are not drugs, but behavioural and psychological interventions Antipsychotic drugs are widely prescribed for people living with dementia. This is despite a high adverse effect burden and limited evidence of efficacy Most behavioural and psychological symptoms will subside spontaneously within six months. Trials of deprescribing are therefore recommended Behaviours should be seen as symptoms that have an underlying cause. Treatment should target these causes, rather than the resultant behaviours.
