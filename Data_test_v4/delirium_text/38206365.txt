38206365|a|Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE4) is the predominant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 mouse models have provided advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, but unaccounted variables like rodent housing status may hinder translational outcomes. Non-sterile aspects like food and bedding can be major sources of changes in rodent microflora. Alterations in intestinal microbial ecology can cause mucosal barrier impairment and increase pro-inflammatory signals. The present study examined the role of sterile and non-sterile food and housing on redox indicators and the immune status of humanized-APOE4 knock-in mice (hAPOe4). hAPOE4 mice were housed under sterile conditions until 22 months of age, followed by the transfer of a cohort of mice to non-sterile housing for 2 months. At 24 months of age, the redox/immunologic status was evaluated by flow cytometry/ELISA. hAPOE4 females housed under non-sterile conditions exhibited: (1) higher neuronal and microglial oxygen radical production and (2) lower CD68+ microglia (brain) and CD8+ T cells (periphery) compared to sterile-housed mice. In contrast, hAPOE4 males in non-sterile housing exhibited: (1) higher MHCII+ microglia and CD11b+CD4+ T cells (brain) and (2) higher CD11b+CD4+ T cells and levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and inflammatory cytokines in the periphery relative to sterile-housed mice. This study demonstrated that sterile vs. non-sterile housing conditions are associated with the activation of redox and immune responses in the brain and periphery in a sex-dependent manner. Therefore, housing status may contribute to variable outcomes in both the brain and periphery.
