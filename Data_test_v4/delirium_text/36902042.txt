36902042|t|Synaptic Dysfunction and Plasticity in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
36902042|a|Recent evidence has supported the hypothesis that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multi-step disease, as the onset of symptoms occurs after sequential exposure to a defined number of risk factors. Despite the lack of precise identification of these disease determinants, it is known that genetic mutations may contribute to one or more of the steps leading to ALS onset, the remaining being linked to environmental factors and lifestyle. It also appears evident that compensatory plastic changes taking place at all levels of the nervous system during ALS etiopathogenesis may likely counteract the functional effects of neurodegeneration and affect the timing of disease onset and progression. Functional and structural events of synaptic plasticity probably represent the main mechanisms underlying this adaptive capability, causing a significant, although partial and transient, resiliency of the nervous system affected by a neurodegenerative disease. On the other hand, the failure of synaptic functions and plasticity may be part of the pathological process. The aim of this review was to summarize what it is known today about the controversial involvement of synapses in ALS etiopathogenesis, and an analysis of the literature, although not exhaustive, confirmed that synaptic dysfunction is an early pathogenetic process in ALS. Moreover, it appears that adequate modulation of structural and functional synaptic plasticity may likely support function sparing and delay disease progression.
