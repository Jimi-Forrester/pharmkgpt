38338638|t|Effect of Different Edible Trichosanthes Germplasm on Its Seed Oil to Enhance Antioxidant and Anti-Aging Activity in Caenorhabditis elegans.
38338638|a|The seeds of various Trichosanthes L. plants have been frequently used as snacks instead of for traditional medicinal purposes in China. However, there is still a need to identify the species based on seeds from Trichosanthes germplasm for the potential biological activities of their seed oil. In this study, 18 edible Trichosanthes germplasm from three species were identified and distinguished at a species level using a combination of seed morphological and microscopic characteristics and nrDNA-ITS sequences. Seed oil from the edible Trichosanthes germplasm significantly enhanced oxidative stress tolerance, extended lifespan, delayed aging, and improved healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans. The antioxidant activity of the seed oil exhibits a significant positive correlation with its total unsaturated fatty acid content among the 18 edible Trichosanthes germplasm, suggesting a genetic basis for this trait. The biological activities of seed oil varied among species, with T. kirilowii Maxim. and T. rosthornii Harms showing stronger effects than T. laceribractea Hayata.
