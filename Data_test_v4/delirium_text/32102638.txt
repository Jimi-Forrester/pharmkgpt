32102638|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine patient and perioperative characteristics associated with unexpected postoperative clinical deterioration as determined for the need of a postoperative emergency response team (ERT) activation. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent general anaesthesia discharged to regular wards between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015 and required ERT activation within 48 postoperative hours. Controls were matched based on age, sex and procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline patient and perioperative characteristics were abstracted to develop a multiple logistic regression model to assess for potential associations for increased risk for postoperative ERT. RESULTS: Among 105 345 patients, 797 had ERT calls, with a rate of 7.6 (95% CI, 7.1-8.1) calls per 1000 anaesthetics (0.76%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed the following risk factors for postoperative ERT: cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.18-2.18), neurological disease (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11-2.22), preoperative gabapentin (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.17-2.20), longer surgical duration (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11, per 30 min), emergency procedure (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.18), and intraoperative use of colloids (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.17-1.92). Compared with control participants, ERT patients had a longer hospital stay, a higher rate of admissions to critical care (55.5%), increased postoperative complications, and a higher 30-day mortality rate (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.73-6.54). CONCLUSION: We identified several patient and procedural characteristics associated with increased likelihood of postoperative ERT activation. ERT intervention is a marker for increased rates of postoperative complications and death.
