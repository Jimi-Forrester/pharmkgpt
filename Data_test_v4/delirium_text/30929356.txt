30929356|a|Objective: Characteristics of clinical, MRI and electroencephalogram after trimethyltin chloride (TMT) poisoning. Methods: The clinical manifestations, MRI, EEG, treatment and prognosis of 16 patients with TMT poisoning were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Among the 16 cases of TMT poisoning, 6 cases were severe poisoning, 4 cases were moderate poisoning, and 6 cases were mild poisoning. All patients had dizziness, headache, general fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and other general clinical symptoms. Six patients with severe poisoning had psychobehavioral abnormalities, including 4 patients with mania, delirium, ataxia, epileptic seizures. Glasgow was 15 points in mild and moderate poisoning. Of the 6 cases of severe poisoning, 4 cases of Glasgow were 9~11 points, and 2 cases of Glasgow were 13 points. 2 patients with severe poisoning had abnormal MRI in head, and the total abnormal rate was 12.50%. Toxic encephalopathy was considered in 1 case with abnormal signal of corpus callosum pressure, and patchy ischemic foci of left cerebral foot and mild cerebral atrophy in 1 case. The total abnormal rate of EEG was 56.25%. The abnormal rate of electroencephalogram in severe poisoning was 83.33%. There were 2 cases of severe abnormal electroencephalogram, 2 cases of moderate abnormal electroencephalogram and 1 case of slight abnormal electroencephalogram. Twelve patients were recovered and discharged from hospital. 4 cases of severe poisoning are still getting better, and there are still cerebellar ataxia symptoms such as dizziness and unstable walking. Conclusion: In clinical work, attention should be paid to the identification of patients with mild and moderate TMT poisoning, and attention should be paid to the patients with severe TMT poisoning manifested by disturbance of consciousness. The positive rate of MRI test in TMT poisoning is low, and the lesion is nonspecific. Electroencephalogram test has a high positive rate in TMT poisoning, which can well reflect the degree of illness. Attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of neurodegeneration caused by TMT poisoning.
