34114191|a|alpha-Synuclein oligomers and Ca2+ dyshomeostasis have been thoroughly investigated with respect to the pathogenesis of Lewy body disease (LBD). In LBD, alpha-synuclein oligomers exhibit a neuron-specific cytoplasmic distribution. Highly active neurons and neurons with a high Ca2+ burden are prone to damage in LBD. The neuronal vulnerability may be determined by transneuronal axonal transmission of the pathological processes; however, this hypothesis seems inconsistent with pathological findings that neurons anatomically connected to LBD-vulnerable neurons, such as neurons in the ventral tegmentum, are spared in LBD. This review focuses on and discusses the crucial roles played by alpha-synuclein oligomers and Ca2+ dyshomeostasis in early intraneural pathophysiology in LBD-vulnerable neurons. A challenging view is proposed on the synergy between retrograde transport of alpha-synuclein and vesicular Ca release, whereby neuronal vulnerability is propagated backward along repeatedly activated signaling pathway.
