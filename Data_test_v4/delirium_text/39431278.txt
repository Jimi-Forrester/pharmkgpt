39431278|a|The study of the brain-gut axis and its impact on cognitive function and in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is a very timely topic of interest to researchers. This review summarizes information on the basic mechanisms of gut-brain communication. We then discuss the roles of the gut microbiome as a neuroprotective factor in neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota is extremely important in maintaining the body's homeostasis, shaping the human immune system and the proper functioning of the brain. The intestinal microflora affects the processes of neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal regeneration. This review aims to explain changes in the composition of the bacterial population of the intestinal microflora among patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in gut microflora composition are also noted in stress, depression, or autism spectrum development. New observations on psychobiotic supplementation in alleviating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are also presented.
