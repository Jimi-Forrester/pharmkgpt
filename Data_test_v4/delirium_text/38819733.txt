38819733|a|BACKGROUND: Acute, transient, but sometimes persistent, delirium is characterized by a sharp disruption in attention, consciousness, and cognitive function, and can be caused by many medications and disorders. Delirium occurrence and negative consequences, such as falls and functional decline, can be decreased with multifactorial prevention and timely detection. AIMS: To describe current clinical practice in relation to the prevention, assessment, and management of delirium in Irish hospitals; awareness-raising and educational activities; and barriers to good practice. METHODS: On World Delirium Awareness Day (15th March 2023), a global survey was conducted of delirium prevalence and care. A senior clinical staff member on each participating ward reported on delirium prevalence at 8AM and 8PM, and on usual ward practice; this data was entered into an online survey by a data collector (typically a clinician from the site, visiting several wards to record data). This study reports data from Irish hospitals. RESULTS: In total, 132 wards from 15 hospitals across Ireland participated. Almost 60% of wards used 'personal judgment' for delirium assessment. Having at least one delirium training session in the preceding year was associated with greater use of a formal assessment tool (60.3% versus 18.8%; p < 0.001). Wards reported staff training/education as the main priority to improve care, but 72.7% of wards identified insufficient time to train staff as a key barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice related to delirium care requires improvement. Awareness raising and staff training require more focus and time in busy clinical settings.
