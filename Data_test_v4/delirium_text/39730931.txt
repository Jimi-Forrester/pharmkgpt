39730931|t|Updated imaging markers in cerebral amyloid angiopathy: What radiologists need to know.
39730931|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related small vessel disease pathologically characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in cerebrovascular walls, affecting both cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. Amyloid deposition results in fragile vessels, which may lead to lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and cognitive impairment. To evaluate the probability and severity of CAA, the imaging markers depicted on CT and MRI techniques are crucial, as brain pathological examination is highly invasive. Although the Boston criteria have established diagnostic value and have been updated to version 2.0, due to an aging population, the patients with CAA should also be assessed for their risk of future ICH or cognitive impairment. Furthermore, an increased awareness of CAA is essential when introducing anticoagulants for infarct in elderly patients or anti-amyloid antibodies for Alzheimer's disease, as these may worsen CAA-related hemorrhagic lesions. However, the radiological literature on CAA has not been comprehensively updated. Here, we review the imaging markers of CAA and clinical significance. We also discuss the clinical and imaging characteristics of CAA-related inflammation, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, and iatrogenic-CAA.
