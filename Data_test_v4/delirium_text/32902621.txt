32902621|a|BACKGROUND: Following hip fracture surgery, patients from residential care are frequently excluded from inpatient rehabilitation. We aimed to assess the impact of place of residence and other factors such as frailty on rehabilitation outcomes after hip fracture surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Outcome measures included Functional Independence Measure efficiency, discharge destination and recovery of pre-fracture mobility. Univariable and multivariable linear or logistic regression analyses were performed. SETTING: One general rehabilitation and two geriatric evaluation and management wards in a large public tertiary teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 844 patients who underwent inpatient rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery from 2010 to 2018. RESULTS: There were 139 (16%) patients from residential care. Being from residential care was not an independent predictor of poor outcomes. Premorbid frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale) was the strongest independent predictor of poorer Functional Independence Measure efficiency, inability to recover pre-fracture mobility and return to community dwelling. Dementia and delirium were also independently predictive of poor outcomes across all measures. Age > 90 years was independently predictive of inability to recover pre-fracture mobility and return to community dwelling. CONCLUSION: Being from residential care is not independently associated with poor outcomes following inpatient rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery and should not be the basis for excluding these patients from rehabilitation. Major predictors of poorer outcomes include premorbid frailty, dementia, delirium and age > 90 years. If able and motivated, those with potentially reversible functional limitations should be given the opportunity to participate in inpatient rehabilitation as even small gains can have a significant impact on quality of life.
