37892777|t|Association between Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Due to COVID-19 and Long-Term Sleep and Circadian Sleep-Wake Disorders.
37892777|a|Current studies agree on the impact of sleep and circadian rest-activity rhythm alterations in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors. However, research on the duration of this impact is scarce. In this study, we evaluate the impact of ARDS on the sleep and circadian rest-activity rhythm of COVID-19 survivors twelve months after hospital discharge. This is a prospective study including COVID-19 survivors with and without ARDS during hospitalization. Data was collected four and twelve months after hospital discharge. The interventions included one-week wrist actigraphy and a home sleep apnea test (HSAT), and evaluations were conducted according to the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and insomnia severity index (ISI). Fifty-two patients were evaluated (ARDS = 31 and non-ARDS = 21); they had a median age of 49.0 [39.0;57.2] years and 53.8% were male. After twelve months, 91.3% presented poor sleep quality, 58.7% presented insomnia, 50% presented daytime somnolence, and 37% presented comorbid insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (COMISA). No significant improvement was observed in relation to sleep or the circadian rest-activity rhythm between four and twelve months. A tendency of poor sleep quality, insomnia, daytime somnolence, and COMISA was observed. Finally, there was no significant impact on the circadian rest-activity rhythm between four and twelve months or between the groups.
