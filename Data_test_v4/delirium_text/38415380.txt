38415380|a|OBJECTIVES: Following a user-centred redesign and refinement process of an electronic delirium screening tool (eDIS-MED), further accuracy assessment was performed prior to anticipated testing in the clinical setting. METHODS: Content validity of each of the existing questions was evaluated by an expert group in the domains of clarity, relevance and importance. Questions with a Content Validity Index (CVI) <0.80 were reviewed by the development group for potential revision. Items with CVI <0.70 were discarded. Next, face validity of the entirety of the tests was conducted and readability measured. RESULTS: A panel of five clinical experts evaluated the test battery comprising eDIS-MED. The content validity process endorsed 61 items. The overall scale CVI was 0.92. Eighty-eight per cent of the responses with regard to question relevancy, usefulness and appropriateness were positive. The questions were deemed fifth grade level and very easy to read. CONCLUSIONS: A revised electronic screening tool was shown to be accurate according to an expert group. A clinical validation study is planned.
