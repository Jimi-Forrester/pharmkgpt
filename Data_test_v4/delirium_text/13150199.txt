13150199|a|A study was made of the cases of 200 patients with demonstrated cerebral atrophy. In patients under 70 years of age cerebral atrophy was twice as common in men as women. Over 70 years the ratio was reversed. The incidence of cerebral atrophy was relatively high in the age group 35 to 50. Convulsions were present in more than a third of the 200 patients. Neurological abnormalities were present in 51 per cent of the entire series. Significant personality deviations were observed in 31 per cent. Although the electroencephalogram was abnormal in many patients, it appeared to be of little aid in the diagnosis of the cerebral atrophy. The spinal fluid did not seem to be consistently altered in any significant or diagnostic manner. Most of the patients in the 35 to 50 year age group did not have the symptoms characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and in only a few cases did the symptoms resemble those of other recognized disease entities.
