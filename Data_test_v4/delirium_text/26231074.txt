26231074|t|A facile method for expression and purification of (15)N isotope-labeled human Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptides from E. coli for NMR-based structural analysis.
26231074|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide. AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques composed of aggregated/oligomerized beta-amyloid peptides with Abeta42 peptide representing a major isoform in the senile plaques. Given the pathological significance of Abeta42 in the progression of AD, there is considerable interest in understanding the structural ensembles for soluble monomer and oligomeric forms of Abeta42. This report describes an efficient method to express and purify high quality (15)N isotope-labeled Abeta42 for structural studies by NMR. The protocol involves utilization of an auto induction system with (15)N isotope labeled medium, for high-level expression of Abeta42 as a fusion with IFABP. After the over-expression of the (15)N isotope-labeled IFABP-Abeta42 fusion protein in the inclusion bodies, pure (15)N isotope-labeled Abeta42 peptide is obtained following a purification method that is streamlined and improved from the method originally developed for the isolation of unlabeled Abeta42 peptide (Garai et al., 2009). We obtain a final yield of ~ 6 mg/L culture for (15)N isotope-labeled Abeta42 peptide. Mass spectrometry and (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra of monomeric Abeta42 peptide validate the uniform incorporation of the isotopic label. The method described here is equally applicable for the uniform isotope labeling with (15)N and (13)C in Abeta42 peptide as well as its other variants including any Abeta42 peptide mutants.
