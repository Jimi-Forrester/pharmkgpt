36362984|t|The Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Novel Antidiabetic Agents.
36362984|a|The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been increasing worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of atherosclerotic disease. Several antidiabetic agents have been introduced in trying to regulate glucose control levels with different mechanisms of action. These agents, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in particular, have been endorsed by contemporary guidelines in patients with or without T2DM. Their widespread usage during the last three decades has raised awareness in the scientific community concerning their pleiotropic mechanisms of action, including their putative anti-inflammatory effect. In this review, we delve into the anti-inflammatory role and mechanism of the existing antidiabetic agents in the cardiovascular system and their potential use in other chronic sterile inflammatory conditions.
