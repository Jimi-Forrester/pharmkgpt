26775198|t|GC-MS analysis of the designer drug alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone and its metabolites in urine and blood in an acute poisoning case.
26775198|a|alpha-Pyrrolidinovalerophenone (alpha-PVP) is a synthetic cathinone belonging to the group of "second generation" pyrrolidinophenones that becomes more and more popular as a designer psychostimulant. Here we provide toxicological analytical support for a severe poisoning with alpha-PVP. Serum and urine samples that were sent to our laboratory were subjected to a general unknown screening procedure. The procedure includes immunoassay-based screening of drugs of abuse in serum and systematic toxicological analysis of urine and serum after neutral and basic liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Whereas the immunoassay delivered negative results, analyzing the urine sample by GC-MS in full scan mode disclosed the presence of alpha-PVP and its metabolites alpha-(2''-oxo-pyrrolidino)valerophenone (2''-oxo-alpha-PVP) and 1-phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-ol (OH-alpha-PVP). In the acetylated urine sample we found additionally N,N-bis-dealkyl-PVP. In serum, alpha-PVP could be detected after solid phase extraction and a concentration of 29ng/mL was determined. Other forensic relevant substances were not detected. The presented data can explain the psychotic symptoms and behavioural pattern of the subject after abuse of alpha-PVP, leading to a clinical condition similar to excited delirium syndrome.
