18206238|a|After having provided a brief reminder of the principle of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast effect, the physiological bases of brain activity and the concepts of functional integration and effective connectivity, we describe the most recent approaches, which permit to explore brain activity and putative networks of interconnected active areas in order to examine the normal brain physiology and its dysfunctions. We present various methods and studies of brain activity analysis clinically applicable, and we detail the concepts of functional and effective connectivity, which allow to study the cerebral plasticity which occurs at the child's during the maturation (e.g., dyslexia), at the adult during the ageing (e.g., Alzheimer disease), or still in schizophrenia or Parkinson disease. The study of specific circuits in networks has to allow defining in a more realistic way the dynamic of the central nervous system, which underlies various cerebral functions, both in physiological and pathological conditions. This connectivity approach should improve the diagnostic and facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies.
