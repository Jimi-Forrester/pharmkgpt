33009480|a|Associations between cognitive decline and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) have received increasing attention. An association between CMB distribution (deep or lobar) and cognitive decline has been reported, but these findings are controversial. We investigated the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including CMBs, and cognitive function in patients with first-ever lacunar infarction. We retrospectively included consecutive patients admitted with first-ever lacunar infarction identified by MRI from July 1, 2011, to December 31, 2018. We excluded patients diagnosed with dementia, including strategic single-infarct dementia, before or after the onset of stroke. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed within 3 days of admission. We searched the records of 273 patients (age 72.0 +- 11.2 years, 95 females). The median MMSE score was 27 (interquartile range 25.5-29). In a univariate analysis, the MMSE score was associated with age, body mass index (BMI), education, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), periventricular hyperintensity, medial temporal atrophy, lobar CMBs, and mixed CMBs (p < 0.20). The lacunar infarction location was not associated with the MMSE score. In a multivariate analysis of these factors, lobar CMBs (p < 0.001) and mixed CMBs (p = 0.008) were independently associated with the MMSE score. Lobar CMBs were associated with cognitive impairment.
