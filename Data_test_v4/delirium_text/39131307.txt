This is partly because changes in the cortical and biomechanical ("neuromechanical") control of oromotor behavior in healthy aging are poorly understood. To this end, we investigated the natural feeding behavior of young and aged rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to understand the age-related differences in tongue and jaw kinematics. We tracked tongue and jaw movements in 3 D using high-resolution biplanar videoradiography and X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM). Older subjects exhibited a reduced stereotypy in tongue movements during chews and a greater lag in tongue movements relative to jaw movements compared to younger subjects. Overall, our findings reveal age-related changes in tongue and jaw kinematics, which may indicate impaired tongue-jaw coordination. Our results have important implications for the discovery of potential neuromechanical biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD.
