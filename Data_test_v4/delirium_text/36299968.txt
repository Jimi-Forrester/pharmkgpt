36299968|t|Transient Global Amnesia Masquerading as Transient Ischemic Attack.
36299968|a|Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a rare self-limited syndrome characterized primarily by anterograde amnesia. It shares multiple characteristics with a transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke, which carry a more ominous outlook. There is a debate with respect to what is sufficient for ruling out more serious pathologies. Additionally, there is data that challenge the historical view that TGA is a benign condition requiring no long-term management. Here, we present the case of a 70-year-old female who was admitted to a free-standing emergency room with confusion, memory loss, and hypertensive crisis that was diagnosed as TGA. The patient was evaluated by a neurologist and transferred to the hospital. The patient was discharged after more serious pathologies were excluded after an extensive workup. This scenario showcases how physicians have to balance the risk of serious diseases with the need for further testing. Future research should focus on how to accurately identify or rule out serious diseases leading to a reduction in adverse events and patient costs. It is also not clear if TGA is truly benign or has an association with stroke.
