34606224|t|Implementation and Routinization of the ABCDE Bundle: A Mixed Methods Evaluation.
34606224|a|BACKGROUND: The ABCDE (Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring and management, and Early exercise/mobility) bundle has been associated with reductions in delirium incidence and improved patient outcomes but has not been widely adopted. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine how to facilitate ABCDE bundle adoption by examining the impact of different implementation strategies on bundle adherence rates and assessing clinicians' perceptions of the bundle and implementation efforts. METHODS: This study examined the effect of 2 bundle implementation strategies on patient care in 8 adult intensive care units. The basic strategy included electronic health record (EHR) modification, whereas the enhanced strategy included EHR modification plus additional bundle training, clinical champions, and staff engagement. A total of 84 nurses, physicians, and therapists participated in interviews and a survey to assess bundle implementation. RESULTS: Respondents indicated bundle use resulted in "best care" through care standardization and coordination and improved patient outcomes. Intensive care units in both intervention groups had significant improvements in bundle adherence after implementation efforts, but intensive care units in the basic intervention group outperformed other sites after initiating their own implementation strategies. Successful implementation tactics included incorporating the bundle into multidisciplinary rounds and providing ongoing support, training, and routine auditing and feedback. DISCUSSION: The ABCDE bundle can improve quality of care and outcomes, and implementation can be accelerated through EHR tools, trainings, and performance feedback.
