31534071|a|Curcumin, a compound found in Indian yellow curry, is known to possess various biological activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. Cur2004-8 is a synthetic curcumin derivative having symmetrical bis-alkynyl pyridines that shows a strong anti-angiogenic activity. In the present study, we examined the effect of dietary supplementation with Cur2004-8 on response to environmental stresses and aging using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. Dietary intervention with Cur2004-8 significantly increased resistance of C. elegans to oxidative stress. Its anti-oxidative-stress effect was greater than curcumin. However, response of C. elegans to heat stress or ultraviolet irradiation was not significantly affected by Cur2004-8. Next, we examined the effect of Cur2004-8 on aging. Cur2004-8 significantly extended both mean and maximum lifespan, accompanying a shift in time-course distribution of progeny production. Age-related decline in motility was also delayed by supplementation with Cur2004-8. In addition, Cur2004-8 prevented amyloid-beta-induced toxicity in Alzheimer's disease model animals which required a forkhead box (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16. Dietary supplementation with Cur2004-8 also reversed the increase of mortality observed in worms treated with high-glucose-diet. These results suggest that Cur2004-8 has higher anti-oxidant and anti-aging activities than curcumin. It can be used for the development of novel anti-aging product.
