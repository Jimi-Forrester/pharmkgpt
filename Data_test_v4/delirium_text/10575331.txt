10575331|t|Recurring short delirium with postpartum onset in two sisters.
10575331|a|We report on a 30-year-old woman who twice developed a short postpartum psychosis with organic signs, but without obvious organic cause. Extensive investigations only yielded a state of moderate hypercoagulability. Her sister had developed similar signs and symptoms during her second puerperium and died 5 days after her delivery. We discuss the combination of various precipitating factors for postpartum psychosis, the possible impact of the findings on its cause and its classification.
