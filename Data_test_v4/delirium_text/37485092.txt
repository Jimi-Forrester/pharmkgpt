37485092|t|Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Ketamine as a Bronchodilator in Pediatric Patients With Acute Asthma Exacerbation: A Review.
37485092|a|Ketamine has emerged as a potential treatment option for pediatric patients with acute asthma exacerbation who do not respond to standard therapy. This review aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketamine in this population and provide an overview of the current literature. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar, resulting in the identification of four relevant studies. The studies demonstrated that ketamine administration led to improvements in respiratory parameters, including a decrease in clinical asthma scores (CASs) and respiratory rates, and an increase in peak expiratory flow and oxygen saturation. Ketamine infusion also showed promise in obviating the need for intubation in patients with severe wheezing due to bronchiolitis. The most common side effects observed were increased tracheobronchial secretions and hallucinations, which were manageable through discontinuation or additional medication. No significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure were reported, indicating hemodynamic stability. Long-term complications of ketamine use were minimal, with no reports of nightmares or dysphoria. In conclusion, ketamine shows potential as a bronchodilator for pediatric patients with acute asthma exacerbation, although further research is needed to fully evaluate its effectiveness and long-term effects. The use of ketamine should be considered in carefully selected cases and closely monitored for adverse events.
