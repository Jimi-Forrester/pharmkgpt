8717371|t|Heat shock factor-1 mediates the transcriptional activation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein gene in response to stress.
8717371|a|Stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There is a heat shock element located at position -317 bp on the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) gene promoter. Recently we demonstrated [4] that stress, in the form of heat shock, ethanol and sodium arsenite treatment, transcriptionally activates the beta-APP gene. In this report we demonstrate that the nuclear factor that mediates this activation is heat shock factor-1.
