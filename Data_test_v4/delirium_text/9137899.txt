9137899|t|Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in community-dwelling elderly: a comparison of EEG and MRI.
9137899|a|In a study on the course of cognitive impairment in people over 65 years of age, 58 randomly selected community dwelling elderly underwent EEG and MRI studies. The EEG was visually and quantitatively (qEEG) assessed. Nine out of 58 subjects appeared to have Alzheimer dementia (AD) according to CAMDEX criteria. In this group medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI, as an objective criterium for AD, showed a total accuracy of 72%, visually assessed EEG 81% and qEEG 81-84%. There was an incomplete overlap in subjects regarding MRI and EEG abnormalities, implying that both methods may be complementary.
