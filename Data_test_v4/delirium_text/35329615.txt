35329615|a|Over the last few decades, tissue engineering has become an important technology for repairing and rebuilding damaged tissues and organs. The scaffold plays an important role and has become a hot pot in the field of tissue engineering. It has sufficient mechanical and biochemical properties and simulates the structure and function of natural tissue to promote the growth of cells inward. Therefore, graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs), such as graphene and graphene oxide (GO), have attracted wide attention in the field of biomedical tissue engineering because of their unique structure, large specific surface area, good photo-thermal effect, pH response and broad-spectrum antibacterial properties. In this review, the structure and properties of typical GBNs are summarized, the progress made in the development of GBNs in soft tissue engineering (including skin, muscle, nerve and blood vessel) are highlighted, the challenges and prospects of the application of GBNs in soft tissue engineering have prospected.
