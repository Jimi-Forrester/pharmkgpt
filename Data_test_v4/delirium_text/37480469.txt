37480469|a|Transgenic models are useful tools for studying the pathogenesis of and drug development for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD models are constructed usually using overexpression or knock-in of multiple pathogenic gene mutations from familial AD. Each transgenic model has its unique behavioral and pathological features. This review summarizes the research progress of transgenic mouse models, and their progress in the unique mechanism of amyloid-beta oligomers, including the first transgenic mouse model built in China based on a single gene mutation (PSEN1 V97L) found in Chinese familial AD. We further summarized the preclinical findings of drugs using the models, and their future application in exploring the upstream mechanisms and multitarget drug development in AD.
