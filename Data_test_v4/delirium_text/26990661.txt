26990661|t|The clearance of dying cells: table for two.
26990661|a|Phagocytic cells of the immune system must constantly survey for, recognize, and efficiently clear the billions of cellular corpses that arise as a result of development, stress, infection, or normal homeostasis. This process, termed efferocytosis, is critical for the prevention of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, and persistence of dead cells in tissue is characteristic of many human autoimmune diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematosus. The most notable characteristic of the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells is its 'immunologically silent' response. Although the mechanisms by which phagocytes facilitate engulfment of dead cells has been a well-studied area, the pathways that coordinate to process the ingested corpse and direct the subsequent immune response is an area of growing interest. The recently described pathway of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP) has shed some light on this issue. LAP is triggered when an extracellular particle, such as a dead cell, engages an extracellular receptor during phagocytosis, induces the translocation of autophagy machinery, and ultimately LC3 to the cargo-containing phagosome, termed the LAPosome. In this review, we will examine efferocytosis and the impact of LAP on efferocytosis, allowing us to reimagine the impact of the autophagy machinery on innate host defense mechanisms.
