39864278|a|OBJECTIVE: The topic of brain health across the life-course is currently receiving exponential attention. Alongside this, exposure to lifestyle-related risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias accumulates across the life-course. This study aimed to explore young adults' (18-39 years) perceptions and understanding of brain health and dementia risk. STUDY DESIGN: This study employed a phenomenological descriptive qualitative methodology to examine the lived experiences and perceptions of participants. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 39 young adults (18 female, 2 non-binary) from North America (n = 20) and Europe (n = 19), conducted via video conference. RESULTS: Participants' awareness and understanding of brain health and dementia risk factors varied, influenced by factors such as general health, family history of dementia, and personal experiences with brain health issues (e.g., traumatic brain injury). The data revealed rich insights into how participants connected (or did not connect) lifestyle factors to brain health and dementia risk. CONCLUSION: This study is among the first to explore young adults' perceptions of brain health across diverse populations. While participants demonstrated moderate awareness of factors affecting brain health, they often struggled to link these factors directly to dementia risk or protective measures.
