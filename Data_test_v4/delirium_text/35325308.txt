35325308|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive and emotional disorders frequently persist after recovery from the acute symptoms of COVID-19; possible explanations include pneumonia-induced hypoxia, infection of the central nervous system, and microstrokes. The objective of the present study was to characterize the impact of hypoxia on the cognitive and psychological profile following COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and divided into two groups based on disease severity: outpatients with no pulmonary complications vs. inpatients with hypoxemic pneumonia having received oxygen therapy. All the participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleepiness, attentional, memory and executive processes, and social cognition. For the inpatients, we also collected laboratory data (blood gas, blood glucose, fibrin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein). RESULTS: Cognitive disorders was found in patients with COVID-19: at least 18% had an impairment of memory and 11% had attentional dysfunctions. A high level of fatigue (90% of the patients), anxiety (52%), and depression (50%) was also observed. The impairments in attentional (p < 0.001 for omission and commission in CPT 3) and memory (p < 0.003 for Index Cue Efficiency from free and cue selected reminding test) functions were greater in COVID-19 inpatients that in COVID-19 outpatients. In contrast, levels of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were similarly high in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings might help to improve the management of COVID-19 patients as a function of the disease severity in particular for patients with hypoxia.
