35216548|a|BACKGROUND: Blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) is sensitive to hypoxia. A new blunt snout bream strain, "Pujiang No.2", was developed to overcome this shortcoming. As a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (PS-341) has been shown to affect the adaptation of cells to a hypoxic environment. In the present study, bortezomib was used to explore the hypoxia adaptation mechanism of "Pujiang No.2". We examined how acute hypoxia alone (hypoxia-treated, HN: 1.0 mg L- 1), and in combination with bortezomib (hypoxia-bortezomib-treated, HB: Use 1 mg bortezomib for 1 kg fish), impacted the hepatic ultrastructure and transcriptome expression compared to control fish (normoxia-treated, NN). RESULTS: Hypoxia tolerance was significantly decreased in the bortezomib-treated group (LOEcrit, loss of equilibrium, 1.11 mg L- 1 and 1.32 mg L- 1) compared to the control group (LOEcrit, 0.73 mg L- 1 and 0.85 mg L- 1). The HB group had more severe liver injury than the HN group. Specifically, the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the HB group (52.16 U/gprot, 32 U/gprot) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the HN group (32.85 U/gprot, 21. 68 U/gprot). In addition, more severe liver damage such as vacuoles, nuclear atrophy, and nuclear lysis were observed in the HB group. RNA-seq was performed on livers from the HN, HB and NN groups. KEGG pathway analysis disclosed that many DEGs (differently expressed genes) were enriched in the HIF-1, FOXO, MAPK, PI3K-Akt and AMPK signaling pathway and their downstream. CONCLUSION: We explored the adaptation mechanism of "Pujiang No.2" to hypoxia stress by using bortezomib, and combined with transcriptome analysis, accurately captured the genes related to hypoxia tolerance advantage.
