37298188|a|Flavonoids are polyphenolic phytochemical compounds found in many plants, fruits, vegetables, and leaves. They have a multitude of medicinal applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiviral, and anticarcinogenic properties. Furthermore, they also have neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects. Their biological properties depend on the chemical structure of flavonoids, their mechanism of action, and their bioavailability. The beneficial effects of flavonoids have been proven for a variety of diseases. In the last few years, it is demonstrated that the effects of flavonoids are mediated by inhibiting the NF-kappaB (Nuclear Factor-kappaB) pathway. In this review, we have summarized the effects of some flavonoids on the most common diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular, and human neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we collected all recent studies describing the protective and prevention role of flavonoids derived from plants by specifically focusing their action on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
