33918634|t|Elevated Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 as the Independent Risk Factor of Delirium after Cardiac Surgery. A Prospective Cohort Study.
33918634|a|BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of postoperative delirium is largely unknown. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are associated with postoperative delirium in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. The secondary objective is to investigate whether any association between raised inflammatory biomarkers levels and delirium is related to surgical and anesthetic procedures or mediated by pre-existing psychiatric conditions associated with raised pro-inflammatory markers levels. METHODS: The patients were screened for cognitive impairment one day preoperatively with the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination Test and the Clock Drawing Test. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders was established on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria. Blood samples were collected pre- and postoperatively for hsCRP and chemokine levels. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium developed in 34% (61 of 177) of patients. Both pre- and postoperative hsCRP, and preoperative MCP-1 levels were associated with postoperative delirium in univariate comparisons; p = 0.001; p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively. However, according to a multivariable logistic regression analysis, only a raised MCP-1 concentration before surgery was independently associated with postoperative delirium, and related to advancing age, preoperative anxiety disorders and prolonged intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that an elevated preoperative MCP-1 concentration is associated with delirium after cardiac surgery. Monitoring of this inflammatory marker may reveal the cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients who are at risk of neuropsychiatric syndromes development.
