38821418|a|The intricate origins and diverse symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges for both diagnosis and treatment. Exosomes and microvesicles, which carry disease-specific cargo from a variety of central nervous system cell types, have emerged as promising reservoirs of biomarkers for AD. Research on the screening of possible biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease using proteomic profiling of EVs is systematically reviewed in this comprehensive review. We highlight key methodologies employed in EV isolation, characterization, and proteomic analysis, elucidating their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize the evolving landscape of EV-associated biomarkers implicated in AD pathogenesis, including proteins involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal injury. The literature review highlights the necessity for robust validation strategies and standardized protocols to effectively transition EV-based biomarkers into clinical use. In the concluding section, this review delves into potential future avenues and technological advancements pivotal in crafting EV-derived biomarkers applicable to AD diagnostics and prognostics. This review contributes to our comprehension of AD pathology and the advancement of precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases, hinting at a promising era in AD precision medicine.
