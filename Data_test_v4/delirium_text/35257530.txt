35257530|a|BACKGROUND: Vibrio vulnificus infection is a highly fatal disease resulting from the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood and exposure to seawater containing the organism. It has been a nationally notifiable disease since 2000 in Korea. The aims of this study were to assess the trends in the incidence of V. vulnificus infection and its case fatality rate and to determine the epidemiologic characteristics to effectively prevent infection and lower mortality. METHODS: We analyzed the incidence trends of V. vulnificus infection by year, month, and region in 913 cases reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC, currently Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency) by the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System from 2001 to 2016. We analyzed the number of patients with V. vulnificus infection who were under the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) and whose coastal seawater temperature data were provided by the Korea Oceanographic Data Center of the National Institute of Fisheries Science. Epidemiological investigations were followed up and analyzed for 761 patients from 2003 to 2016. A total of 152 patients who were not followed up were excluded from the analysis. The case fatality rate was analyzed for 325 cases reported to the KCDC from 2011 to 2016. RESULTS: The mean incidence of V. vulnificus infection was 0.12 per 100,000 people, and the highest incidence was reported in September (41.1%) during the study period. The incidence rate per 100,000 people was the highest in Jeonnam (8.23). The number of patients who claimed to the NHIS was the highest in September (105 patients). The average seawater temperature was the highest at 24.1 C in August, and the average seawater temperature from August to October, when many cases occurred, was 22.4 C. The male-to-female ratio was 6:1, and 96.4% of the patients were aged >= 40 years. Of the patients, 96.1% had underlying diseases, the most common of which was liver cirrhosis (56.3%). The case fatality rate was 48.9%. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of V. vulnificus infection showed distinct seasonality, with a large number of cases occurring in the months when the seawater temperature was high; there were also distinct geographical characteristics. The incidence of V. vulnificus infection and mortality rates have not decreased for decades, and it is still an important public health problem with a high fatality rate.
