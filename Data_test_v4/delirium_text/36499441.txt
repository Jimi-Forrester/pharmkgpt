36499441|a|Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is a tropical plant grown for sugar production. We recently showed that sugarcane top (ST) ameliorates cognitive decline in a mouse model of accelerated aging via promoting neuronal differentiation and neuronal energy metabolism and extending the length of the astrocytic process in vitro. Since the crude extract consists of multicomponent mixtures, it is crucial to identify bioactive compounds of interest and the affected molecular targets. In the present study, we investigated the bioactivities of major polyphenols of ST, namely 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3CQA), 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5CQA), 3-O-feruloylquinic acid (3FQA), and Isoorientin (ISO), in human fetal neural stem cells (hNSCs)- an in vitro model system for studying neural development. We found that multiple polyphenols of ST contributed synergistically to stimulate neuronal differentiation of hNSCs and induce mitochondrial activity in immature astrocytes. Mono-CQAs (3CQA and 5CQA) regulated the expression of cyclins related to G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas ISO regulated basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors related to cell fate determination. Additionally, mono-CQAs activated p38 and ISO inactivated GSK3beta. In hNSC-derived immature astrocytes, the compounds upregulated mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha, a master regulator of astrocytic mitochondrial biogenesis. Altogether, our findings suggest that synergistic interactions between major polyphenols of ST contribute to its potential for neuronal differentiation and astrocytic maturation.
