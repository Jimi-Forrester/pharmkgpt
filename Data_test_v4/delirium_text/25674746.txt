25674746|a|The presence of reversible lesions that involve the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) has been reported in patients with a broad spectrum of diseases and conditions and is referred to as reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES).To describe the clinicoradiological features and establish a clinical position for this disease, we retrospectively examined the clinicoradiological features of adult RESLES patients, as well as discuss the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of this disease.The clinical and MRI findings of patients who presented with RESLES accompanied by symptoms of neurological disorders were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were classified into 2 subgroups (favorable and poor outcome subgroups), which corresponded to the severity of the disability using the Modified Oxford Handicap Scale. In addition, we compared the clinical and neuroimaging features between the 2 outcome subgroups.Eight patients with RESLES associated with various diseases and conditions were included. The clinical presentation was nonspecific; however, MRI exhibited consistent lesions in the SCC with a hypointensity on apparent diffusion coefficient maps and a hyperintensity via diffusion-weighted imaging, which disappeared after a variable lapse. The number of patients with a severe disturbance of consciousness, extracallosal lesions, or diffuse slow waves in the poor outcome subgroup was significantly increased compared with the favorable outcome subgroup (P < 0.05). Thus, the clinicoradiological spectrum of RESLES could be classified into 2 principal categories according to differential outcomes.RESLES is a rare entity with a broad clinicoradiological spectrum because of the various diseases and conditions. Although the overall symptoms of RESLES patients tend to be alleviated, the prognosis of patients with a severe disturbance of consciousness, extracallosal lesions, or diffuse slow waves is likely unfavorable.
