35062074|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis have various disease-specific causal factors and pathological features. A very common characteristic of NDs is oxidative stress (OS), which takes place due to the elevated generation of reactive oxygen species during the progression of NDs. Furthermore, the pathological condition of NDs including an increased level of protein aggregates can further lead to chronic inflammation because of the microglial activation. Carotenoids (CTs) are naturally occurring pigments that play a significant role in averting brain disorders. More than 750 CTs are present in nature, and they are widely available in plants, microorganisms, and animals. CTs are accountable for the red, yellow, and orange pigments in several animals and plants, and these colors usually indicate various types of CTs. CTs exert various bioactive properties because of its characteristic structure, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Due to the protective properties of CTs, levels of CTs in the human body have been markedly linked with the prevention and treatment of multiple diseases including NDs. In this review, we have summarized the relationship between OS, neuroinflammation, and NDs. In addition, we have also particularly focused on the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties of CTs in the management of NDs.
