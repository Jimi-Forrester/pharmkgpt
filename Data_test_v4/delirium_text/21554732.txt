21554732|a|BACKGROUND: Increased reactive microglia are a histological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, positively correlating with levels of deposited alpha-synuclein protein. This suggests that microglial-mediated inflammatory events may contribute to disease pathophysiology. Mutations in the gene coding for alpha-synuclein lead to a familial form of PD. Based upon our prior findings that alpha-synuclein expression regulates microglial phenotype we hypothesized that expression of mutant forms of the protein may contribute to the reactive microgliosis characteristic of PD brains. METHODS: To quantify the effects of wild type and mutant alpha-synuclein over-expression on microglial phenotype a murine microglial cell line, BV2, was transiently transfected to express human wild type (WT), and mutant alpha-synuclein (A30P and A53T) proteins. Transfected cells were used to assess changes in microglia phenotype via Western blot analysis, ELISA, phagocytosis, and neurotoxicity assays. RESULTS: As expected, over-expression of alpha-synuclein induced a reactive phenotype in the transfected cells. Expression of alpha-synuclein increased protein levels of cycloxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Transfected cells demonstrated increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as increased nitric oxide production. Transfected cells also had impaired phagocytic ability correlating with decreased protein levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1). In spite of the increased cytokine secretion profile, the transfected cells did not exhibit increased neurotoxic ability above control non-transfected BV2 cells in neuron-microglia co-cultures. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that over-expression of alpha-synuclein drives microglial cells into a form of reactive phenotype characterized by elevated levels of arachidonic acid metabolizing enzymes, cytokine secretion, and reactive nitrogen species secretion all superimposed upon impaired phagocytic potential.
