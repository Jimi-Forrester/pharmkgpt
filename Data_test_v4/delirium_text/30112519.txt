30112519|t|Protein Kinase C-epsilon in Membrane Delivery during Phagocytosis.
30112519|a|During phagocytosis, internal membranes are recruited to the site of pathogen binding and fuse with the plasma membrane, providing the membrane needed for pseudopod extension and target uptake. The mechanism by which vesicles destined for the phagosome are generated, targeted, and fuse is unknown. We established that Golgi-associated protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC-epsilon) is necessary for the addition of membrane during FcyR-mediated phagocytosis. PKC-epsilon is tethered to the Golgi through interactions between its' regulatory domain and the Golgi lipids PI4P and diacylglycerol; disruption of these interactions prevents PKC-epsilon concentration at phagosomes and decreases phagocytosis. The accumulated evidence suggests that PKC-epsilon orchestrates vesicle formation at the Golgi by a mechanism requiring lipid binding but not enzymatic activity. This review discusses how PKC-epsilon might mediate vesicle formation at the level of budding and fission. Specifically, we discuss PKC-epsilon binding partners, the formation of lipid subdomains to generate membrane curvature, and PKC-epsilon mediated links to the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton to provide tension for vesicle fission. Assimilating information from several model systems, we propose a model for PKC-epsilon mediated vesicle formation for exocytosis during phagocytosis that may be applicable to other processes that require directed membrane delivery and fusion.
