30031427|t|Care of Geriatric Patients with Advanced Illnesses and End-of-Life Needs in the Emergency Department.
30031427|a|Older patients with advanced illness are presenting more frequently to emergency departments (EDs). These patients have complex needs, which challenge busy EDs tuned to provide emergent, life-sustaining interventions, and rapid dispositions. This article outlines communication skills to assess patient goals so that the ED provider can create a care plan that matches level of medical intervention with patient wishes. Furthermore, this article outlines symptom-based care for the actively dying geriatric patient in the ED, specifically, acute pain, dyspnea, terminal delirium, secretions, dry mouth, fever, and bereavement.
