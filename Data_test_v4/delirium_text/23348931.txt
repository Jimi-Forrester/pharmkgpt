23348931|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This pathology causes a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra. Several reports have claimed a role of defective nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair pathways in PD etiology, in particular, of the Base Excision Repair (BER) system. In addition, recent findings, related to PD progression, indicate that oxidative stress pathways involving c-Abl and GST could also be implicated in this pathology. This review focuses on recently described networks most likely involved in an integrated manner in the course of PD.
