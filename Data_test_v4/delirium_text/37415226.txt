37415226|t|Dynamic predictive scores for cardiac surgery-associated agitated delirium: a single-center retrospective observational study.
37415226|a|BACKGROUND: Prevention, screening, and early treatment are the aims of postoperative delirium management. The scoring system is an objective and effective tool to stratify potential delirium risk for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2019, were enrolled in our retrospective study. The patients were divided into a derivation cohort (n = 45,744) and a validation cohort (n = 11,436). The AD predictive systems were formulated using multivariate logistic regression analysis at three time points: preoperation, ICU admittance, and 24 h after ICU admittance. RESULTS: The prevalence of AD after cardiac surgery in the whole cohort was 3.6% (2,085/57,180). The dynamic scoring system included preoperative LVEF <= 45%, serum creatinine > 100 micromol/L, emergency surgery, coronary artery disease, hemorrhage volume > 600 mL, intraoperative platelet or plasma use, and postoperative LVEF <= 45%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for AD prediction were 0.68 (preoperative), 0.74 (on the day of ICU admission), and 0.75 (postoperative). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that the calibration of the preoperative prediction model was poor (P = 0.01), whereas that of the pre- and intraoperative prediction model (P = 0.49) and the pre, intra- and postoperative prediction model (P = 0.35) was good. CONCLUSIONS: Using perioperative data, we developed a dynamic scoring system for predicting the risk of AD following cardiac surgery. The dynamic scoring system may improve the early recognition of and the interventions for AD.
