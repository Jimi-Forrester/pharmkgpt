34345308|a|The percentage of geriatric patients treated in intensive care units continues to increase, comprising up to 30%. Age per se is not of great relevance for the outcome of intensive care treatment. Functional status and geriatric syndromes are crucial for prognosis. Frailty and delirium are very important and should be screened using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), respectively. Furthermore, age-physiological organ changes as well as multimorbidity and associated polypharmacy play an important role. The latter should be assessed at the time of admission. Another goal of intensive care treatment of geriatric patients is to maintain and improve the nutritional status, which can be assessed with the help of an established tool (e.g. NRS 2002). In the treatment of critically ill geriatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), frailty is also crucial. It is particularly important in the intensive medical treatment of critically ill geriatric patients to clarify the question whether the patient benefits from each intensive care therapy, e.g., whether a desired therapeutic goal can be achieved, whether intensive care is in the (presumed) patient's will and whether the burdens during treatment are justified by the perspective of life. Furthermore, interdepartmental cooperation plays an important role in the intensive medical care of geriatric patients.
