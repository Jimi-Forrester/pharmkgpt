32368041|t|Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System for Glioma and Its Efficacy Improvement Strategies: A Comprehensive Review.
32368041|a|Gliomas are the most common tumor of the central nervous system. However, the presence of the brain barrier blocks the effective delivery of drugs and leads to the treatment failure of various drugs. The development of a nanoparticle drug delivery system (NDDS) can solve this problem. In this review, we summarized the brain barrier (including blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-brain tumor barriers (BBTB), brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB), and nose-to-brain barrier), NDDS of glioma (such as passive targeting systems, active targeting systems, and environmental responsive targeting systems), and NDDS efficacy improvement strategies and deficiencies. The research prospect of drug-targeted delivery systems for glioma is also discussed.
