35154787|a|OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 temporary emergency 'field' hospitals have been established in the UK to support the surge capacity of the National Health Service while protecting the community from onward infection. We described the population of one such hospital and investigated the impact of frailty on clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: NHS Nightingale Hospital North West, April-June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All in-patients with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and duration of admission. METHODS: We analysed factors associated with mortality using logistic regression and admission duration using Cox's regression, and described trends in frailty prevalence over time using linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 104 COVID-19 patients were admitted, 74% with moderate-to-severe frailty (clinical frailty score, CFS > 5). A total of 84 were discharged, 14 transferred to other hospitals, and six died on site. High C-reactive protein (CRP) > 50 mg/dL predicted 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 11.9, 95%CI 3.2-51.5, p < 0.001). Patients with CFS > 5 had a 10-day median admission, versus 7-day for CFS <= 5 and half the likelihood of discharge on a given day (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51, 95%CI 0.29-0.92, p  =  0.024). CRP > 50 mg/dL and hospital-associated COVID-19 also predicted admission duration. As more frail patients had a lower rate of discharge, prevalence of CFS > 5 increased from 64% initially to 90% in the final week (non-zero slope p < 0.001). Conclusions: The NNW population was characterized by high levels of frailty, which increased over the course of the hospital's operation, with subsequent operational implications. Identifying and responding to the needs of this population, and acknowledging the risks of this unusual clinical context, helped the hospital to keep patients safe.
