36537065|t|Association of Depression With Early Occurrence of Postural Instability in Parkinson's Disease.
36537065|a|OBJECTIVE: Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) affects the quality of life of patients. Postural instability and gait disturbance are associated with the severity and prognosis of PD. We investigated the association of depression with axial involvement in early-stage PD patients. METHODS: This study involved 95 PD patients unexposed to antiparkinsonian drugs. After a baseline assessment for depression, the subjects were divided into a depressed PD group and a nondepressed PD group. Analyses were conducted to identify an association of depression at baseline with the following outcome variables: the progression to Hoehn and Yahr scale (H-Y) stage 3, the occurrence of freezing of gait (FOG), levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and wearing-off. The follow-up period was 53.40 +- 16.79 months from baseline. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves for H-Y stage 3 and FOG showed more prominent progression to H-Y stage 3 and occurrences of FOG in the depressed PD group than in the nondepressed PD group (log-rank p = 0.025 and 0.003, respectively). Depression in drug-naive, early-stage PD patients showed a significant association with the progression to H-Y stage 3 (hazard ratio = 2.55; 95% confidence interval = 1.32-4.93; p = 0.005), as analyzed by Cox regression analyses. In contrast, the occurrence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia and wearing-off did not differ between the two groups (log-rank p = 0.903 and 0.351, respectively). CONCLUSION: Depression in drug-naive, early-stage PD patients is associated with an earlier occurrence of postural instability. This suggests shared nondopaminergic pathogenic mechanisms and potentially enables the prediction of early development of postural instability.
