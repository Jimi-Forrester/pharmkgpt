34120434|a|The increasing survival rate after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) has revealed long-term impairments in the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical domains among survivors. However, clinicians often fail to recognize this post-ICU syndrome (PICS) and its debilitating effects on family members (PICS-F). This study describes two cases of PICS to illustrate the different impairments that may occur in ICU survivors. The PICS risk factors for each domain and the interactions among risk factors are also described. In terms of diagnostic evaluation, limited evidence-based or validated tools are available to assist with screening for PICS. Clinicians should be aware to monitor for its symptoms on the basis of cognitive, psychiatric, and physical domains. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is recommended to screen for cognition, as it has a high sensitivity and can evaluate executive function. Mood disorders should also be screened. For mobile patients, a 6-minute walk test should be performed. PICS can be prevented by applying the ABCDEF bundle ABCDEF bundle in ICU described in this paper. Finally, the family members of patients in the ICU should be involved in patient care and a tactful communication approach is required to reduce the risk of PICS-F.
