38327179|t|Long-term survival after surgical treatment for post-infarction mechanical complications: results from the Caution study.
38327179|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanical complications (MCs) are rare but potentially fatal sequelae of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Surgery, though challenging, is considered the treatment of choice. The authors sought to study early and long-term results of patients undergoing surgical treatment for post-AMI MCs. METHODS: Patients undergone surgical treatment for post-infarction MCs between 2001 through 2019 in 27 centers worldwide were retrieved from the database of CAUTION study. In-hospital and long-term mortality were the primary outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine independent factors associated with overall mortality. RESULTS: The study included 720 patients. The median age was 70.0 [62.0-77.0] years, with a male predominance (64.6%). The most common MC encountered was ventricular septal rupture (VSR) (59.4%). Cardiogenic shock was seen on presentation in 56.1% of patients. In-hospital mortality rate was 37.4%; in more than 50% of cases, the cause of death was low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS). Late mortality occurred in 133 patients, with a median follow-up of 4.4 [1.0-8.6] years. Overall survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 54.0%, 48.1% and 41.0%, respectively. Older age (p < 0.001) and postoperative LCOS (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of overall mortality. For hospital survivors, 10-year survival was 65.7% and was significant higher for patients with VSR than those with papillary muscle rupture (long-rank P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary data from a multicenter cohort study show that surgical treatment for post-AMI MCs continues to be associated with high in-hospital mortality rates. However, long-term survival in patients surviving the immediate postoperative period is encouraging.Trial registration number: NCT03848429.
