10656530|t|Structure and function of type I and II macrophage scavenger receptors.
10656530|a|Type I and II macrophage scavenger receptors are implicated in the pathologic deposition of cholesterol during the atherogenesis. There is a charged collagen structure of type I and II receptors identified as a ligand binding domain, which can recognize a wide range of negatively charged macromolecules including oxidized LDL as well as damaged or apoptotic cells and pathogenic micro-organisms. After binding these ligands can be either internalized by endocytosis, phagocytosis, or remain at cell surface and mediate the adhesion. Under physiological condition, scavenger receptors serve to scavenge or clean up cellular debris and other related materials, as well as playing a role in the hosts defence. In pathological condition, they mediate the recruitment, activation and transformation of macrophages and other cells, which may be related to the development of atherosclerosis and to disorders caused by the accumulation of denatured materials, such as Alzheimer's disease.
