36596025|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of modified HuangLian JieDu decoction (MHLJDD) as a supplementary medication for early enteral nutrition in septic patients. METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized controlled preliminary study. Septic patients were randomly divided into control (treated with the base treatment) and intervention (co-treated with MHLJDD and the base treatment) groups. The primary outcomes of this study were 60-day (d) mortality rate, length of mechanical ventilation (MV), and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Of the 86 included patients, 44 and 42 were allocated to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Lengths of MV and ICU stay were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (10.31 +- 3.92 d vs 8.66 +- 2.84 d, P = .028; and 11.88 +- 5.25 d vs 10.41 +- 3.14 d, P = .029; respectively). However, the difference in 60-d mortality rate between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (20.45% vs 38.10%, P = .071). The enteral-nutrition tolerance score of the control group was higher than that of the intervention group (6.81 +- 4.28 vs 4.68 +- 4.04, P = .020). Incidence of hyperglycemia and gastric retention (gastric residual volume > 250 mL) was higher in the control group than in the intervention group (59.52% vs 29.55%, P = .005; and 28.57% vs 11.36%, P = .020, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: MHLJDD can shorten the MV and ICU stay of septic patients.
