31833118|t|The importance of the intensive care unit environment in sleep-A study with healthy participants.
31833118|a|Sleep disruption is common among intensive care unit patients, with potentially detrimental consequences. Environmental factors are thought to play a central role in ICU sleep disruption, and so it is unclear why environmental interventions have shown limited improvements in objectively assessed sleep. In critically ill patients, it is difficult to isolate the influence of environmental factors from the varying contributions of non-environmental factors. We thus investigated the effects of the ICU environment on self-reported and objective sleep quality in 10 healthy nurses and doctors with no history of sleep pathology or current or past ICU employment participated. Their sleep at home, in an unfamiliar environment ('Control'), and in an active ICU ('ICU') was evaluated using polysomnography and the Richard-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Environmental sound, light and temperature exposure were measured continuously. We found that the control and ICU environment were noisier and warmer, but not darker than the home environment. Sleep on the ICU was perceived as qualitatively worse than in the home and control environment, despite relatively modest effects on polysomnography parameters compared with home sleep: mean total sleep times were reduced by 48 min, mean rapid eye movement sleep latency increased by 45 min, and the arousal index increased by 9. Arousability to an awake state by sound was similar. Our results suggest that the ICU environment plays a significant but partial role in objectively assessed ICU sleep impairment in patients, which may explain the limited improvement of objectively assessed sleep after environmental interventions.
