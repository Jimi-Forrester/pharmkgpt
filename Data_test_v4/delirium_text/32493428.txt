32493428|a|BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a developmental disorder caused by mutations of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). Although NS patients have diverse neurological manifestations, the mechanisms underlying the involvement of SHP2 mutations in neurological dysfunction remain elusive. METHODS: Induced pluripotent stem cells generated from dermal fibroblasts of three NS-patients (NS-iPSCs) differentiated to the neural cells by using two different culture systems, 2D- and 3D-cultured systems in vitro. RESULTS: Here we represent that SHP2 mutations cause aberrant neural development. The NS-iPSCs exhibited impaired development of EBs in which BMP and TGF-beta signalings were activated. Defective early neuroectodermal development of NS-iPSCs recovered by inhibition of both signalings and further differentiated into NPCs. Intriguingly, neural cells developed from NS-NPCs exhibited abundancy of the glial cells, neurites of neuronal cells, and low electrophysiological property. Those aberrant phenotypes were also detected in NS-cerebral organoids. SHP2 inhibition in the NS-NPCs and NS-cerebral organoids ameliorated those anomalies such as biased glial differentiation and low neural activity. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that SHP2 mutations contribute to precocious gliogenesis in NS-iPSCs during neural development in vitro.
