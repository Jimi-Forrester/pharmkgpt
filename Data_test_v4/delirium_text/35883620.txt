35883620|a|The habitual and excessive consumption of sugar (i.e., sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, HFCS) is associated with the onset and progression of lifestyle-related diseases (LSRD). Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) have recently been the focus of research on the factors contributing to LSRD. Approaches that inhibit the effects of AGEs may be used to prevent and/or treat LSRD; however, since the structures of AGEs vary depending on the type of reducing sugars or carbonyl compounds to which they respond, difficulties are associated with verifying that AGEs are an etiological factor. Cytotoxic AGEs derived from glyceraldehyde, a triose intermediate in the metabolism of glucose and fructose, have been implicated in LSRD and are called toxic AGEs (TAGE). A dietary imbalance (the habitual and excessive intake of sucrose, HFCS, or dietary AGEs) promotes the generation/accumulation of TAGE in vivo. Elevated circulating levels of TAGE have been detected in non-diabetics and diabetics, indicating a strong relationship between the generation/accumulation of TAGE in vivo and the onset and progression of LSRD. We herein outline current findings on "TAGE as a new target" for human health.
