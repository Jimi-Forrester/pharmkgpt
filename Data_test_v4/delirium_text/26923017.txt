26923017|t|Metabolic Syndrome and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Case-Control Study among Elderly in a Shanghai Suburb.
26923017|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) maybe associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between MetS, with its individual or combined components, and MCI among elderly. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted among the elderly aged 65 years and over in a community located in the southwestern suburb of Shanghai, China. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (C-MMSE) was used to screen subjects with MCI. Associations of MetS with its individual or combined components and MCI were analyzed using conditional regression analyses with or without adjustment for gender, education, current smoking, current drinking, and physical activities. RESULTS: There were 379 subjects with MCI and 379 gender- and age-matched healthy controls in the study. Compared with healthy controls in univariate analyses, subjects with MCI were more likely to have less time spent on physical activity, lower C-MMSE score, heavier weight, larger waistline and hipline, higher diastolic blood pressure, higher body mass index, higher abdominal obesity index, higher serum glycated hemoglobin, higher serum triglycerides, higher serum cholesterol, higher serum uric acid, and higher serum alanine aminotransferase. After multivariable adjustment, MetS was significantly associated with an increased risk of MCI (OR = 2.277; 95% CI: 1.086-4.773). Among MetS components, abdominal obesity (OR = 2.101; 95% CI: 1.224-3.608) and hypertension (OR = 2.075; 95% CI: 1.170-3.678) showed a significant association with MCI, respectively; while these two components were combined, the association was stronger (OR = 2.459; 95% CI: 1.360-4.447). CONCLUSION: MetS and its components, particularly abdominal obesity and hypertension, were found to be significantly associated with the risk of MCI.
