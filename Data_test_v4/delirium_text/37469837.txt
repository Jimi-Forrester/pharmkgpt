37469837|a|Objective: To provide a rigorous comparison between patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) and healthy elderly, as well as to assess the value of electroencephalography (EEG) in terms of early diagnosis, we conducted a neutral image recognition memory task involving individuals with positive biomarkers including beta amyloid deposition, pathologic tau or neurodegeneration. Methods: The task involving study and test blocks was designed to evaluate participants' recognition memory. Electroencephalogram was recorded synchronously to elicit event-related potentials in patients with MCI-AD and healthy control subjects. We further analyzed differences between groups or conditions in terms of behavioral performance, time domain, and time-frequency domain. Results: The MCI-AD cohort showed a slower response time to old/new images and had low accuracy regarding behavioral performance. The amplitude of the late positive complex for the old/new effects was significantly suppressed in the MCI-AD cohort when compared with that in the HC cohort. The amplitude of the late old/new effects was correlated with the Auditory Verbal Learning Test recognition score in all participants. The time-frequency domain analysis revealed that correct recognition of old items elicited a decrease in beta power, mainly limited to the HC cohort. Moreover, the combination of behavioral (processing speed and accuracy) and electrophysiological (average amplitude and relative power of delta band) measures contributes to classifying patients with MCI-AD from healthy elderly people. Conclusion: Changes of old/new effects, accuracy and response time are sensitive to the impairment of recognition memory in patients with MCI-AD and have moderate value in predicting the incipient stage of AD.
