23373574|t|Verbal and nonverbal learning and recall in dementia with lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.
23373574|a|The present study compares groups of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) on components of memory. The Hopkins Verbal-Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) were utilized. The DAT group performed significantly worse than the DLB group on the learning, delayed free recall, and percent retained scores of the HVLT-R, as well as on the delayed free recall and percent retained scores of the BVMT-R. There were no significant differences on BVMT-R learning. Discriminant function analysis yielded a classification rate of 75.9%. This supports previous research indicating that individuals with DLB have impairments in visuospatial abilities that extend into the domain of memory components, specifically learning. Pattern of performance may be useful in discriminating between individuals with DLB and those with DAT.
