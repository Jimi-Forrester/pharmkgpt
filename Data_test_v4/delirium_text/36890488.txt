METHODS: MTT Colorimetric Assay, ELISA, and quantitative PCR were used to investigate the responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to mitogen Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), PBMCs genomic methylation and hydroxymethylation levels, nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA damage, respiratory chain enzyme activities, and circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels were detected in 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: In the Alzheimer's disease group, LPS stimulated PBMCs viability, TNF-alpha secretion, PHA stimulated IL-10 secretion, genomic DNA methylation levels, circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA copies, citrate synthase activity were reduced compared to the control; while the LPS stimulated PBMCs IL-1alpha secretion, PHA stimulated IL-1alpha and IFN-gamma secretion, plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha, mitochondrial DNA damages were increased compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to mitogens, mitochondrial DNA integrity characteristics, and cell-free mitochondrial DNA copies may be used as candidate laboratory biomarkers to help clinical management of Alzheimer's disease.
