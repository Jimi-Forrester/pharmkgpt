38168129|t|Opioid use following cardio-thoracic intensive care: risk factors and outcomes: a cohort study.
38168129|a|Opioid misuse has become a serious public health problem. Patients admitted to cardio-thoracic critical care are usually exposed to opioids, but the incidence and effects of chronic opioid use are not known. The primary objective was to describe opioid use after admission to a cardio-thoracic intensive care unit. Secondary objectives were to identify factors associated with chronic opioid usage and analyze risk of death. This cohort study included all cardio-thoracic ICU care episodes in Sweden between 2010 and 2018. Among the 34,200 patients included in the final study cohort, 4050 developed persistent opioid use after ICU care. Younger age, preadmission opioid use, female sex, presence of comorbidities and earlier year of ICU admission were all found to be associated with persistent opioid use. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality between 6 and 18 months after admission among individuals with persistent opioid use was 2.2 (95% CI 1.8-2.6; P < 0.001). For opioid-naive patients before ICU admission, new onset of chronic opioid usage was significant during the follow-up period of 24 months. Despite the absence of conclusive evidence supporting extended opioid treatment, the average opioid consumption remains notably elevated twelve months subsequent to cardio-thoracic ICU care.
