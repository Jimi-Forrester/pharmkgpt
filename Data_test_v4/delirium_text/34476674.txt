34476674|a|Increasing evidence implicates astrocytes and the associated purinergic modulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive deficits involving the extracellular amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) accumulation. Abeta can affect astrocytic gliotransmitters release, namely ATP, which is rapidly metabolized into adenosine by ecto-5'-nucleotidase, CD73, resulting in adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) activation that bolsters neurodegeneration. AD's brains exhibit an upregulation of A2AR and of connexin 43 (Cx43), which in astrocytes forms hemichannels that can mediate ATP release. However, a coupling between astrocytic A2AR and Cx43 remains to be established. This was now investigated using astrocytic primary cultures exposed to Abeta1-42 peptides. Abeta triggered ATP release through Cx43 hemichannels, a process blocked by A2AR antagonists and mimicked by selective A2AR activation. A2AR directly regulated hemichannels activity and prevented Cx43 upregulation and phosphorylation observed in Abeta1-42-exposed astrocytes. Moreover, a proximity ligand assay revealed a physical association between astrocytic A2AR and Cx43. Finally, the blockade of CD73-mediated extracellular formation of ATP-derived adenosine prevented the Abeta-induced increase of Cx43 hemichannel activity and of ATP release. Overall, the data identify a feed-forward loop involving astrocytic A2AR and Cx43 hemichannels, whereby A2AR increase Cx43 hemichannel activity leading to increased ATP release, which is converted into adenosine by CD73, sustaining the increased astrocytic A2AR activity in AD-like conditions.
