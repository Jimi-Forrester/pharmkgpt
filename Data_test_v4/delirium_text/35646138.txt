35646138|t|Medication Rules in Herbal Medicine for Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Network Pharmacology and Data Mining Study.
35646138|a|Background: Although traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has good efficacy in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), especially memory improvement and safety, its substance basis and intervention mechanism are particularly complex and unknown. Therefore, based on network pharmacology and data mining, this study aims to explore the rules, active ingredients and mechanism of TCM in the treatment of MCI. Methods: By searching the GeneCard, OMIM, DisGeNET and DrugBank databases, we obtained the critical targets associated with MCI. We matched the components and herbs corresponding to the important targets in the TCMSP platform. Using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software, we constructed a target-component-herb network and conducted a network topology analysis to obtain the core components and herbs. Molecular docking was used to preliminarily analyze and predict the binding activities and main binding combinations of the core targets and components. Based on the analysis of the properties, flavor and meridian distribution of herbs, the rules of herbal therapy for MCI were summarized. Results: Twenty-eight critical targets were obtained after the screening. Using the TCMSP platform, 492 components were obtained. After standardization, we obtained 387 herbs. Based on the target-composition-herb network analysis, the core targets were ADRB2, ADRA1B, DPP4, ACHE and ADRA1D. According to the screening, the core ingredients were beta-sitosterol, quercetin, kaempferol, stigmasterol and luteolin. The core herbs were matched to Danshen, Yanhusuo, Gancao, Gouteng and Jiangxiang. It was found that the herbs were mainly warm in nature, pungent in taste and liver and lung in meridian. The molecular docking results showed that most core components exhibited strong binding activity to the target combination regardless of the in or out of network combination. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that herbs have great potential in the treatment of MCI. This study provides a reference and basis for clinical application, experimental research and new drug development of herbal therapy for MCI.
