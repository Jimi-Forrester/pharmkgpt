19326585|t|Emergence delirium: a nursing perspective.
19326585|a|Emergence delirium is a condition that can affect all segments of the postoperative population, but is seen most often in pediatric and older adult patients. Most cases of emergence delirium resolve quickly and without incident; however, severe episodes may lead to increased incidence of injury to both patients and staff members and increased costs. To minimize the incidence of emergence delirium and treat it when it occurs, perioperative nurses must be aware of the risk factors that contribute to this condition, including the patient's age, type of anesthesia, anxiety level, level of postoperative pain, and preexisting medical conditions.
