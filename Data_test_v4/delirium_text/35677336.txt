35677336|t|Opioid-Use, COVID-19 Infection, and Their Neurological Implications.
35677336|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an imminent threat to human health and public safety. ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 proteins on host cells provide the viral entry point to SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the respiratory system, there have been reports of viral neurotropism and central nervous system injury as indicated by plasma biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Even with a small proportion of infections leading to neurological manifestation, the overall number remains high. Common neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include anosmia, ageusia, encephalopathy, and stroke, which are not restricted to only the most severe infection cases. Opioids and opioid antagonists bind to the ACE2 receptor and thereby have been hypothesized to have therapeutic potential in treating COVID-19. However, in the case of other neurotropic viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), opioid use has been established to exacerbate HIV-mediated central nervous system pathogenesis. An analysis of electronic health record data from more than 73 million patients shows that people with Substance Use Disorders are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffer worse consequences then non-users. Our in-vivo and in-vitro unpublished studies show that morphine treatment causes increased expression of ACE2 in murine lung and brain tissue as early as 24 h post treatment. At the same time, we also observed morphine and lipopolysaccharides treatment lead to a synergistic increase in ACE2 expression in the microglial cell line, SIM-A9. This data suggests that opioid treatment may potentially increase neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have previously shown that opioids induce gut microbial dysbiosis. Similarly, gut microbiome alterations have been reported with SARS-CoV-2 infection and may play a role in predicting COVID-19 disease severity. However, there are no studies thus far linking opioid-mediated dysbiosis with the severity of neuron-specific COVID-19 infection.
