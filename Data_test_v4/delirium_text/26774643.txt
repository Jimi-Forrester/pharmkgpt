26774643|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation is the main molecular mechanism underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease, the most widespread form of senile dementia worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that the key factor leading to impaired neuronal function is accumulation of water-soluble Abeta oligomers rather than formation of the senile plaques created by the deposition of large fibrillary aggregates of Abeta. However, several questions remain about the preliminary steps and the progression of Abeta oligomerization. METHODS: We show that the initial stages of the aggregation of fluorescently labeled Abeta can be determined with a high degree of precision and at physiological (i.e., nanomolar) concentrations by using either steady-state fluorimetry or time-correlated single-photon counting. RESULTS: We study the dependence of the oligomerization extent and rate on the Abeta concentration. We determine the chemical binding affinity of fluorescently labeled Abeta for liposomes that have been recently shown to be pharmacologically active in vivo, reducing the Abeta burden within the brain. We also probe their capacity to hinder the Abeta oligomerization process in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a fluorescence assay allowing investigation of the earliest steps of Abeta oligomerization, the peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease. The assay proved to be sensitive even at Abeta concentrations as low as those physiologically observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This work represents an extensive and quantitative study on the initial events of Abeta oligomerization at physiological concentration. It may enhance our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease, thus paving the way to novel therapeutic strategies.
