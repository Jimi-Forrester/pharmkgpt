30374795|t|Cell toxicity mechanism and biomarker.
30374795|a|Cell toxicity may result in organ dysfunction and cause severe health problem. Recent studies revealed many toxicants may induced the over production of Nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species and the subsequent oxidative stress, cause cell toxicity. Mitochondrion dysfunction maybe the subsequent consequence of oxidative stress and has been recognized as another contributing factor in cell toxicity. Besides, oxidative products induced by some toxicants may also produce the compounds that damage cell DNA, leading to toxicity. Especially, the significance of nanoparticle induced cell toxicity was disclosed recently and attract more concern. The mechanism mainly includes inflammation, oxidative stress and DNA damage. On the other side, some biomarkers of cell toxicity including autophagy, cytokines, miRNA has been identified. The understanding of these phenomenon may enable us to clarify the cell toxicity mechanism then contribute to cell toxicity protection, disease treatment and drug side effect prevention.
