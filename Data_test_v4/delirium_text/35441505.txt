35441505|t|Switchable Multiplex Photoelectrochemical Immunoassay of Abeta42 and Abeta40 Based on a pH-Responsive i-Motif Probe and Pyrene-Based MOF Photocathode.
35441505|a|In accurately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and distinguishing AD from other dementia, the concentration ratio of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) to Abeta40 is more reliable than the concentration of Abeta42 alone. For the multiplex PEC assay, generating an independent photocurrent of multiple targets on a single interface is a great challenge. Herein, an i-motif-based switchable sensing approach is proposed to construct a pH-regulated multiplex PEC immunosensor for Abeta42 and Abeta40 by using Bi-TBAPy as an efficient photoactive cathode material. An independent photocurrent signal of Abeta42 and Abeta40 is produced through the regulation of the electron-transfer tunneling distance by a pH-dependent configuration transition of the i-motif DNA. In a 96-well plate, immunological recognition of Abeta42 (or Abeta40) coupled with an enzymatic catalytic reaction produces an acidic (or alkaline) lysis solution, which triggers the formation and unravelment of the i-motif structure. The above configuration transition regulates the distance between Au NPs labeled SH-DNA and Bi-TBAPy, leading to PEC signal switching. Smart integration of the pH-responsive switchable DNA probe with a high-efficiency photocathode enables the precise monitoring of Abeta42 and Abeta40 at a single interface in a wide detection range (10 fg/mL ~ 1 mug/mL and 1 pg/mL ~ 1 mug/mL) with detection limit of 4.5 fg/mL and 0.52 pg/mL, respectively. The proposed i-motif-based switchable sensing strategy paves a new avenue for a multiplex PEC assay on a single interface, showing great prospects in bioanalysis and early disease diagnosis.
