34874055|t|Current approaches and advances in the imaging of stroke.
34874055|a|A stroke occurs when the blood flow to the brain is suddenly interrupted, depriving brain cells of oxygen and glucose and leading to further cell death. Neuroimaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have greatly improved our ability to visualise brain structures and are routinely used to diagnose the affected vascular region of a stroke patient's brain and to inform decisions about clinical care. Currently, these multimodal imaging techniques are the backbone of the clinical management of stroke patients and have immensely improved our ability to visualise brain structures. Here, we review recent developments in the field of neuroimaging and discuss how different imaging techniques are used in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of stroke.
