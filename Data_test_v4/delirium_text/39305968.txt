39305968|a|OBJECTIVE: Auditory-driven gamma synchrony (GS) is linked to the function of a specific cortical circuit based on a parvalbumin+ and pyramidal neuron loop. This loop is impaired in neuropsychiatric conditions (i.e. schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, stroke etc.) and its relevance in clinical practice is increasingly being recognized. Auditory stimulation at a typical gamma frequency of 40Hz can be applied as a 'stress test' for efficient excitation/inhibition (E/I) of the entire cerebral cortex to provoke GS and record it with magnetoencephalography (MEG) or high-density electroencephalography (EEG). However, these two techniques are costly and not widely available. Therefore, we assessed whether a single EEG electrode is sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the auditory-driven GS level of the entire cortical surface while expecting the highest correspondence in the auditory and somatosensory cortices. METHODS: We measured simultaneous EEG-MEG in 29 healthy subjects, utilizing 3 EEG electrodes (C4, F4, O2) and a full MEG setup. Recordings were performed during binaural exposure to auditory gamma stimulation and during silence. We compared GS measurement of each of the three EEG electrodes separately against full MEG mapping. Time-resolved phase locking value (PLVt) was computed between EEG signals and cortex reconstructed MEG signals. RESULTS: During auditory stimulation, but not at rest, EEG captures a significant amount of GS, especially from both auditory cortices and motor-premotor regions. This was especially true for frontal (C4) and central electrodes (F4). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: While hd-EEG and MEG are necessary for accurate spatial mapping of GS at rest and during auditory stimulation, a single EEG channel is sufficient to detect the global level of GS. These results have great translational potential for mapping GS in standard clinical settings.
