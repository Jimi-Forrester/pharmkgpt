19377027|t|Caregiver status: a potential risk factor for extreme self-neglect.
19377027|a|BACKGROUND: Family caregivers are known to be at risk for physical illness and emotional distress caused by the extreme demands of the caregiving task. OBJECTIVE: The authors present the case of a middle-aged, well-educated woman with advanced endometrial cancer, the symptoms of which she had ignored over an extended period of time because of her family obligations. METHOD: The patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy and was evaluated for depression and subsequent delirium. RESULTS: The patient was informed about her poor prognosis and was transferred to a skilled nursing facility. DISCUSSION: The authors conclude that the caretaking responsibility, along with a low-grade depression, contributed to her delayed presentation and treatment.
