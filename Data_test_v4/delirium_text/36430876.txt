36430876|a|A long noncoding RNA, nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) variant 1 (NEAT1v1), confers radioresistance to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by inducing autophagy via gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Radiation induces oxidative stress to damage cellular components and organelles, but it remains unclear how NEAT1v1 protects HCC cells from radiation-induced oxidative stress via autophagy. To address this, we precisely investigated NEAT1v1-induced autophagy in irradiated HCC cell lines. X-ray irradiation significantly increased cellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA content in HCC cells while NEAT1v1 suppressed them. NEAT1v1 concomitantly induced the phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/parkin-mediated mitophagy. Interestingly, parkin expression was constitutively upregulated in NEAT1v1-overexpressing HCC cells, leading to increased mitochondrial parkin levels. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) was also upregulated by NEAT1v1, and GABARAP or SOD2 knockdown in NEAT1v1-overexpressing cells increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA content after irradiation. Moreover, it was suggested that SOD2 was involved in NEAT1v1-induced parkin expression, and that GABARAP promoted parkin degradation via mitophagy. This study highlights the unprecedented roles of NEAT1v1 in connecting radioresistance and mitophagy in HCC.
