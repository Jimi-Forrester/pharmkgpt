36414909|a|Curcumin (CUR) and piperine (PIP) are very well-known phytochemicals that claimed to have many health benefits and have been widely used in foods and traditional medicines. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, poor oral bioavailability and permeability of curcumin are a major challenge for formulation scientists. In this research study, the researcher tried to enhance the bioavailability and permeability of curcumin by a nanotechnological approach. In this research study, we developed a CUR-PIP-loaded SNEDDS in various oils. Optimised formulation NF3 was subjected to evaluate its therapeutic effectiveness on AD animal model in comparison with untreated AD model and treated group (by market formulation donepezil). On the basis of characterisation results, it is confirmed that NF3 formulation is the best formulation. The optimised formulation shows a significant dose-dependent manner therapeutic effect on AD-induced model. Novel formulation CUR-PIP solid-SNEDDS was successfully developed and optimised. It is expected that the developed S-SNEDDS can be a potential, safe and effective carrier for the oral delivery of curcumin to the brain. To date, this article is the only study of CUR-PIP-loaded S-SNEDDS for the treatment of AD.
