38015425|t|Novel APOE Mutation in a Moroccan Subject Suffering from Alzheimer Disease: A Case Study and Exploration of Pathogenic Implication.
38015425|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a major public health concern worldwide. It is a severe neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the elderly and causes significant brain cell death. According to the most complete scientific research, the APOE gene, which encodes the APOE protein, maybe the key to identifying the likely cause of delayed AD. The development of plaques and tangles, as well as increased amyloid (amyloid-beta) levels and deposition, have been linked to APOE4. Pathogenic mutations in this gene can impact how beta-amyloid deposits and how they are cleared from the body. In this study, we report a novel pathogenic mutation, Arg160Leu, in APOE that was identified in a Moroccan patient. The magnetic resonance imaging of this 67-year-old woman revealed hippocampal shrinkage, and the results of her cognition testing revealed that she is suffering from severe AD. The current study may increase awareness of the genetic risk factors for AD caused by APOE4 mutations.
