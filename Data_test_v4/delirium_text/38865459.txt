38865459|a|The accumulation of protein aggregates is a hallmark of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. As a major pillar of the proteostasis network, autophagy mediates the degradation of protein aggregates. The autophagy cargo receptor p62 recognizes ubiquitin on proteins and cooperates with TAX1BP1 to recruit the autophagy machinery. Paradoxically, protein aggregates are not degraded in various diseases despite p62 association. Here, we reconstituted the recognition by the autophagy receptors of physiological and pathological Tau forms. Monomeric Tau recruits p62 and TAX1BP1 via the sequential actions of the chaperone and ubiquitylation machineries. In contrast, Tau fibrils from Alzheimer's disease brains are recognized by p62 but fail to recruit TAX1BP1. This failure is due to the masking of fibrils ubiquitin moieties by p62. Tau fibrils are resistant to deubiquitylation, and, thus, this nonproductive interaction of p62 with the fibrils is irreversible. Our results shed light on the mechanism underlying autophagy evasion by protein aggregates and their consequent accumulation in disease.
