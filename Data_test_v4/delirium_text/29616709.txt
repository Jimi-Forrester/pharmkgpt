29616709|t|Development of Azeliragon, an Oral Small Molecule Antagonist of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts, for the Potential Slowing of Loss of Cognition in Mild Alzheimer's Disease.
29616709|a|Increasing evidence supports the role of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Azeliragon (TTP488) is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of RAGE in Phase 3 development as a potential treatment to slow disease progression in patients mild AD. Preclinical studies in animal models of AD (tgAPPSwedish/London) have shown azeliragon to decrease Abeta plaque deposition; reduce total Abeta brain concentration while increasing plasma Abeta levels; decreases sAPPbeta while increasing sAPPalpha; reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines; and slow cognitive decline and improve cerebral blood flow. In the Phase 2b study, 18-months treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate AD indicated a baseline to endpoint change in ADAS-cog of 3.1 points in favor of drug. A greater magnitude of effect was evident in the sub-group of patients with mild AD (MMSE 21-26) with a baseline to endpoint change of 4 points on the ADAS-cog in favor of azeliragon and a 1 point change in CDR-sb in favor of drug. Azeliragon 5 mg/day delayed time to cognitive deterioration (7-point change in ADAS-cog from baseline, logrank p=0.0149). Based on promising results from the Phase 2b study, a Phase 3 registration program (STEADFAST) is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment from FDA. The ongoing Phase 3 program, if successful may demonstrate azeliragon can slow cognitive decline in mild AD patients.
