31398051|t|Biocompatible Quantum Funnels for Neural Photostimulation.
31398051|a|Neural photostimulation has high potential to understand the working principles of complex neural networks and develop novel therapeutic methods for neurological disorders. A key issue in the light-induced cell stimulation is the efficient conversion of light to bioelectrical stimuli. In photosynthetic systems developed in millions of years by nature, the absorbed energy by the photoabsorbers is transported via nonradiative energy transfer to the reaction centers. Inspired by these systems, neural interfaces based on biocompatible quantum funnels are developed that direct the photogenerated charge carriers toward the bionanojunction for effective photostimulation. Funnels are constructed with indium-based rainbow quantum dots that are assembled in a graded energy profile. Implementation of a quantum funnel enhances the generated photoelectrochemical current 215% per unit absorbance in comparison with ungraded energy profile in a wireless and free-standing mode and facilitates optical neuromodulation of a single cell. This study indicates that the control of charge transport at nanoscale can lead to unconventional and effective neural interfaces.
