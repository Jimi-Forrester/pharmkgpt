31404951|a|Background: The cognitive function of the elderly has become a focus of public health research. Little is known about the changes of cognitive function and the risk factors for cognitive impairment in the Chinese elderly; thus, the purposes of this study are as follows: (1) to describe changes in cognitive function in the Chinese elderly from 2005-2014 and (2) to explore risk factors for cognitive impairment of the Chinese elderly. Design and setting: A total of 2603 participants aged 64 years and above participated in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) and were followed up from 2005 to 2014. Cognitive function and cognitive impairment were assessed using the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cognitive impairment. Results: Results revealed that the cognitive function of the Chinese elderly shows diversified changes: deterioration (55.09%), unchanged (17.21%) and improvement (27.70%). In addition, there are significant demographic differences in gender, age, education, marriage and other aspects when it comes to the changes of cognitive function in Chinese elderly. In the binary logistic regression analysis, female, increased age, lower education level, no spouse, less income, worse PWB (psychological well-being), less fresh fruit and vegetable intake, more activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, lower social engagement were significantly associated with higher odds for cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Various interventions should be implemented to maintain cognitive function in Chinese elderly.
