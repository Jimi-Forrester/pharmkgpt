28592789|t|Are Sutureless Aortic Valves Suitable for Severe High-Risk Patients Suffering from Active Infective Aortic Valve Endocarditis?
28592789|a|BACKGROUND Sutureless aortic valves were introduced to facilitate minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. Since sutureless aortic valves are a feasible procedure, we evaluated if any benefits could be identified in severe high-risk patients with active infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between April 2014 and April 2015, a total of 42 patients received a sutureless Perceval  aortic valve (Sorin Biomedica Cardio Srl, Saluggia, Italy) for different indications. Nine of these patients (median age 71 years, range 47-83 years) suffered from active infective endocarditis, including four patients with prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Five patients underwent prior cardiac surgery, including transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The median EuroSCORE II was 29.5% (range 16.8-87.7%). Post-operatively, data regarding mortality, operative results, and early operative morbidity were collected. RESULTS There were no cases of 30-day mortality. Four patients needed abscess closure with pericardium. Three patients underwent left atrial appendix closure: one left ventricular thrombectomy, one bypass grafting, and one arch replacement. Median aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 35 minutes (range 26-88 minutes) and 52 minutes (range 40-133 minutes), respectively. The median intubation time was 14 hours (range 1-9 hours). In these high-risk patients, no postoperative morbidity was found except for one re-intubation due to extensive delirium and one re-exploration. No pacemaker implantation was needed. Echocardiographic evaluation showed no central or para-valvular regurgitation, and a median discharge mean gradient of 5.5 mm Hg (range 2.5-10.0 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS Sutureless aortic valve replacement in very high-risk patients suffering from active infection endocarditis seems to be an option with limited morbidity and appropriate echocardiographic results, however, further studies are needed.
