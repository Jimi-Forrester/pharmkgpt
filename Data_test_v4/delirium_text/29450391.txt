29450391|a|Citicoline is the generic name of cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline), an endogenous compound that is able to increase the levels of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system by interacting with the synthesis of cellular membranes phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine. Exogenous Citicoline, administered by ingestion or injection, is hydrolyzed and dephosphorylated in order to form cytidine and choline, which resynthesize CDP-choline inside brain cells. It has proven neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer disease, stroke, and Parkinson's disease, as well as in glaucoma and amblyopia. Citicoline acts as a neuroprotector for those patients with progressive glaucomatous disease in spite of well-controlled intraocular pressure. The purpose of this review was to outline the main features of Citicoline and the evidences of its effect in glaucoma.
