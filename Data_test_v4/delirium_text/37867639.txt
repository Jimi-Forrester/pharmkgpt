37867639|t|Piperidine: A Versatile Heterocyclic Ring for Developing Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors.
37867639|a|The monoamine oxidase enzyme (MAO), which is bound on the membrane of mitochondria, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of endogenous and exogenous monoamines, including monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, adrenaline, and dopamine. These enzymes have been proven to play a significant role in neurodegeneration; thus, they have recently been researched as prospective therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative illness treatment and management. MAO inhibitors have already been marketed as neurodegeneration illness treatments despite their substantial side effects. Hence, researchers are concentrating on developing novel molecules with selective and reversible inhibitory properties. Piperine, which is a phytochemical component present in black pepper, has been established as a potent MAO inhibitor. Piperine encompasses a piperidine nucleus with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, anticonvulsant, antimalarial, antiviral, and anticancer properties. The current Review focuses on the structural changes and structure-activity relationships of piperidine derivatives as MAO inhibitors.
