32145713|a|BACKGROUND: This study is to investigate if non-intubated anaesthesia combined with paravertebral nerve block (PVNB) can enhance recovery in children undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial including 60 patients aged 3 to 8 years old who underwent elective VATS was performed. They were randomly assigned to receive non-intubated anaesthesia combined with PVNB or general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation (1:1 ratio). The primary outcome was the length of postoperative in-hospital stay. The secondary outcomes included emergence time, the incidence of emergence delirium, time to first feeding, time to first out-of-bed activity, pain score and in-hospital complications. RESULTS: The non-intubated group had shorter postoperative in-hospital stay than the control group (4 days [IQR, 4-6] vs 5 days [IQR, 5-8], 95% CI 0-2; P = .013). When compared to the control group, the incidence of emergence delirium (odds ratio [OR] 3.39, 95% CI 1.01-11.41; P = .043), emergence time, duration in the PACU, time to first eating food, first out-of-bed activity, pain score and consumption of sufentanil (at 6 and 12 hours after surgery) were decreased in the intervention group. In contrast, the incidence of airway complications was higher in the control than the intervention group (27.6% vs 6.9%, P = .037). There was no statistical significance in the occurrence of PONV, pneumothorax and other complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Non-intubated anaesthesia combined with PVNB enhances recovery in paediatric patients for video-assisted thoracic surgery although further multi-centre study is needed.
