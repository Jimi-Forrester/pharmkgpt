38485483|a|OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study aimed to explore how young adults experienced the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to extensive lockdowns, social isolation and psychosocial distress. Specifically, this research focused on how the pandemic impacted those who did not contract COVID-19 and lived in a low-risk geographical location. The focus was young adults given they have large social circles (high risk for disease transmission) and have an increased propensity to mental health conditions. These insights can inform planning for future pandemics. DESIGN: This paper draws on 30 in-depth semistructured interviews. Data were analysed inductively following the principles of a constructivist grounded theory approach. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 30 young adults living in Prince Edward Island during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Canadian province with a low number of COVID-19 cases at the time of data collection. RESULTS: We developed four themes that describe the experience of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) life course disruption, (2) fear and anxiety about the COVID-19 virus, (3) isolation and loss of hope and (4) strategies for managing adversity. Our findings highlight the areas of young adults' lives that were affected by extensive social changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate that even individuals who had not contracted the virus were considerably impacted. CONCLUSION: We provide a detailed description of the comprehensive impact of COVID-19 on low-risk young adults not previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. By reflecting on the biographical disruption experienced by young adults, we highlight the need and opportunity to direct healthcare resources towards identifying and addressing the secondary impacts of pandemics. Consequently, these findings can guide decisions relating to future pandemic restrictions to better account for the experiences of individuals living through them.
