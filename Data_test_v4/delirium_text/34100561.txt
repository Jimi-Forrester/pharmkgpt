34100561|t|An Evaluation of the Effect of Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Program Implemented in a New Regional Trauma Center of Korea.
34100561|a|BACKGROUND: This study examined the impact of the performance improvement and patient safety (PIPS) program implemented in 2015 on outcomes for trauma patients in a regional trauma center established by a government-led project for a national trauma system in Korea. METHODS: The PIPS program was based on guidelines by the World Health Organization and American College of Surgeons. The corrective strategies were proceeded according to the loop closure principle: data-gathering and monitoring, identification of preventable trauma deaths (PTDs), evaluation of preventable factors, analysis of findings, and corrective action plans. We established guidelines and protocols for trauma care, conducted targeted education and peer review presentations for problematic cases, and enhanced resources for improvement accordingly. A comparative analysis was performed on trauma outcomes over a four-year period (2015-2018) since implementing the PIPS program, including the number of trauma team activation and admissions, time factors related to resuscitation, ventilator duration, and the rate of PTDs. RESULTS: Human resources in the center significantly increased during the period; attending surgeons responsible for trauma resuscitation from 6 to 11 and trauma nurses from 85 to 218. Trauma admissions (from 2,166 to 2,786), trauma team activations (from 373 to 1,688), and severe cases (from 22.6 to 33.8%) significantly increased (all P < 0.001). Time to initial resuscitation and transfusion significantly decreased from 120 to 36 minutes (P < 0.001) and from 39 to 16 minutes (P < 0.001). Time to surgery for hemorrhage control and decompressive craniotomy improved from 99 to 54 minutes (P < 0.001) and 181 to 135 minutes (P = 0.042). Ventilator duration and rate of PTDs significantly decreased from 6 to 4 days (P = 0.001) and 22.2% to 8.4% (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Implementation of the PIPS program resulted in improvements in outcomes at a regional trauma center that has just been opened in Korea. Further establishment of the PIPS program is required for optimal care of trauma patients.
