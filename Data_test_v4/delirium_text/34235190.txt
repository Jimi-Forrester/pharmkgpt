34235190|t|Soluble Platelet Release Factors as Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Disease.
34235190|a|Platelets are the main players in thrombotic diseases, where activated platelets not only mediate thrombus formation but also are involved in multiple interactions with vascular cells, inflammatory components, and the coagulation system. Although in vitro reactivity of platelets provides information on the function of circulating platelets, it is not a full reflection of the in vivo activation state, which may be relevant for thrombotic risk assessment in various disease conditions. Therefore, studying release markers of activated platelets in plasma is of interest. While this type of study has been done for decades, there are several new discoveries that highlight the need for a critical assessment of the available tests and indications for platelet release products. First, new insights have shown that platelets are not only prominent players in arterial vascular disease, but also in venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation. Second, knowledge of the platelet proteome has dramatically expanded over the past years, which contributed to an increasing array of tests for proteins released and shed from platelets upon activation. Identification of changes in the level of plasma biomarkers associated with upcoming thromboembolic events allows timely and individualized adjustment of the treatment strategy to prevent disease aggravation. Therefore, biomarkers of platelet activation may become a valuable instrument for acute event prognosis. In this narrative review based on a systematic search of the literature, we summarize the process of platelet activation and release products, discuss the clinical context in which platelet release products have been measured as well as the potential clinical relevance.
