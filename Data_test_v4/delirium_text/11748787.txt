11748787|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to compare the treatment-emergent central anticholinergic-like adverse events experienced during treatment with olanzapine versus placebo in patients with psychosis and/or agitation due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, changes in cognition were assessed in a subgroup of patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. METHODS: Double-blind data were compared for placebo and three fixed olanzapine dosages (5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, and 15 mg/day) in 206 nursing home-residing patients with AD for five a priori selected central nervous system anticholinergic-like adverse events: confusion, delirium, delusions, hallucinations, abnormal thinking. Mean change from baseline to endpoint on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) was measured for a subgroup of 43 patients who had mild to moderate cognitive impairment at baseline. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in central anticholinergic-like adverse events at any olanzapine dose compared to placebo. Additionally, in the 43-patient subgroup, there were no significant differences in mean change in ADAS-Cog scores between placebo and the three olanzapine dose subgroups. CONCLUSION: Olanzapine did not differ significantly from placebo for any of the five central nervous system anticholinergic events nor on the ADAS-Cog. Olanzapine's initially reported potent in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity is not consistent with this clinical study of central nervous system anticholinergic-like adverse events in patients with AD.
