32718500|t|Diagnostic and Prognostic Laboratory Testing for Alzheimer Disease.
32718500|a|This article focuses on current clinical laboratory testing to diagnose Alzheimer disease and monitor its progression throughout its disease course. Several clinically available tests focus on analysis of amyloid and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid as well as autosomal dominant and risk factor genes. Although the current armament of clinical laboratory testing is limited by invasiveness of cerebrospinal fluid collection, rarity of autosomal dominant genetic mutations, and uncertainties of risk inherent in nonpenetrant genes, the field is poised to advance the clinical repertoire of laboratory diagnostic testing.
