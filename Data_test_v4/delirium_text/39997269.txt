39997269|a|Background/Objectives: This study investigated the prevalence of functional impairments and the effects of long COVID on long-term functional impairments in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a nationwide multicenter cohort study in collaboration with nine hospitals, collecting data using self-administered questionnaires from participants aged 20 years or older who were diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between April 2021 and September 2021, and discharged alive. Questionnaires regarding daily life, sequela, and functional impairments were mailed to patients in August 2022. The effects of long COVID on functional impairments were examined using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The survey was completed by 220 patients, with a mean of 416 days after discharge. Among respondents, 20.5% had physical impairments (n = 45), 35.0% had mental disorders (n = 77), and 42.7% had either (n = 94). Furthermore, 77.7% had long COVID (171/220), and the most common symptom was dyspnea (40.0%). The multivariate analysis showed that fatigue/malaise, upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgia, muscle weakness, decreased concentration, sleep disorder, brain fog, and dizziness were risk factors for functional impairments at one year. Conclusions: Many patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU still suffered from post-intensive care syndrome even after one year, which manifested in combination with direct symptoms of the original disease, such as long COVID.
