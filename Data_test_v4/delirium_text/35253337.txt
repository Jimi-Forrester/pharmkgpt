35253337|t|The Mini-Cog: A simple screening tool for cognitive impairment useful in predicting the risk of delirium after major urological cancer surgery.
35253337|a|AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the mini-cognitive assessment instrument (Mini-Cog) on postoperative delirium after major urological cancer surgery. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, medical records were collected for patients who underwent major urologic cancer surgery at our department between 2020 and 2021, and underwent preoperative cognitive screening based on the Mini-Cog test (n = 331). The probable cognitive impairment is defined as a Mini-Cog score of <3. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify the risk factors for postoperative delirium. RESULTS: Patients with probable cognitive impairment were 60 (18%). Postoperative delirium occurred in 26 patients (8%). Using multivariate analysis, the Mini-Cog score of <3 (odds ratio [OR] = 12.7; P < 0.001), decline of instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 3.0; P = 0.04) and preoperative benzodiazepine use (OR = 8.3; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium. For predicting postoperative delirium, Mini-Cog score with a cutoff value of <3 granting sensitivity of 69.2%, specificity of 86.2%, positive predictive value of 30.0% and negative predictive value of 97.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-Cog test is a simple screening tool with only two components (a delayed, three-word recall task and a clock drawing test): it is useful in identifying potential cases of cognitive decline and patients at risk for postoperative delirium along with other information routinely collected preoperatively. Effective screening using the Mini-Cog test opens the possibility to provide optimal urologic care for older patients Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 319-324.
