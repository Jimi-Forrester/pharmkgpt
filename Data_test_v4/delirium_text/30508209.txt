30508209|a|OBJECTIVES: The need for pelvic floor surgery will increase with an aging population in the future. Aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the evolution of cognitive function in elderly women after urogynaecological surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 51 female patients 70 years and older who underwent urogynaecological surgery participated in this study. Geriatric and urogynaecological assessment were performed before and six weeks after surgery, including the Mini-COG test, the clock-drawing test, a depression scale, an activities of daily living questionnaire, and the German pelvic floor questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean age was 77 years (range 70-91). Overall, 15 women were operated for incontinence, 31 for prolapse, and five for miscellaneous reasons. Only two (3.9%) of the 51 women developed postoperative delirium. Abnormal cognitive findings increased from preoperatively 15.7% to 39.2% six weeks after surgery (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 8.7, p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant pre-post differences in activities of daily living and depression scores. Pelvic floor function indices improved significantly Conclusion: This study shows an overall decline of cognitive function in a vulnerable group of elderly women during the short-term postoperative period. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after surgery has been described for other types of non-cardiac surgery but has been understudied in urogynaecological surgery. These patients need interdisciplinary management to prevent or minimize adverse effects of surgery on cognitive function.
