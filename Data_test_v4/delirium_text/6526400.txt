6526400|t|Accidental poisoning with deadly nightshade berries: a case report.
6526400|a|A case of acute accidental poisoning with deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) berries is reported. The patient was an elderly but healthy man who soon recovered. On the one hand, the clinical picture looked similar to that of delirium tremens; on the other, there were myoclonic jerks and signs of extrapyramidal involvement to suggest the onset of subacute dementia. The electroencephalogram findings confirmed those already reported during experimentally induced intoxication after ingestion of atropine in man.
