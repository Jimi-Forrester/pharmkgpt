35734760|t|The Flexibility of Physio-Cognitive Decline Syndrome: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.
35734760|a|The mutual presence of impairments in physical and cognitive functions in older adults has been reported to predict incident disability, dementia, and mortality. The longitudinal transitions of phenotypes between these functional impairments, either individually or in combination, remain unclear. To investigate the natural course and prevalence of physical and/or cognitive impairments (CIs), we enrolled participants from a community-based population. Data were retrieved from the first (August 2011 and December 2012) and second wave (August 2013 and June 2015) of the I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study (ILAS). All participants were classified into four groups: robust, mobility impairment (MI), CI, and physio-cognitive decline syndrome (PCDS). MI was diagnosed with weakness and/or slowness. CI was diagnosed if a subject met a cutoff below 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) of age-, sex-, and education-matched norms of any neuropsychological assessments. PCDS was combined with MI and CI. Our results showed that 38, 14, 30, and 18% of the participants were on the robust, MI, CI, and PCDS at the first wave, respectively. After 2.5 years, 17% robust, 29% MI, and 37% CI progressed to PCDS. In contrast, 33% of PCDS was reversed to non-PCDS. Predictors of conversion to PCDS included worse memory and language functions, older age, lower muscle mass, and the presence of diabetes. In PCDS, a stronger hand-grip strength, younger age, and better memory functions predicted reversion to non-PCDS status. In summary, we probed the transition of PCDS. The skeletal muscle mass/function and memory function are crucial factors associated with PCDS reversion or progression.
