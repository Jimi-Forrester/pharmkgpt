34702606|a|INTRODUCTION: Discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy has increased in recent years, but whether this trend extends to patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia remains unclear. METHODS: Medicare data from 2011 to 2018 were analyzed to compare the trends in the use and discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy between patients with and without Alzheimer disease and related dementia who had chronic noncancer pain. Outcome measures were annual proportions of (1) patients who received long-term opioid therapy and (2) long-term opioid therapy users who subsequently discontinued opioids for >=30, 60, or 90 days during 12-month follow-up. All analyses were performed in 2021. RESULTS: The use of long-term opioid therapy decreased from 2011 to 2017 in both patients with and without Alzheimer disease and related dementia. In long-term opioid therapy users, discontinuation of opioids for >=30, 60, and 90 days increased by 8% (95% CI=1.04, 1.12, p<0.001), 13% (95% CI=1.06, 1.20, p<0.001), and 18% (95% CI=1.10, 1.28, p<0.001), respectively, between 2011 and 2017 among patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia, whereas the proportion was largely declining or unchanged among patients without the condition. Differences in long-term opioid therapy discontinuation by Alzheimer disease status widened over time (p<0.01 for interaction). CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy was consistently higher in patients with than in patients without Alzheimer disease and related dementia, with the gap between the 2 groups widening over time. The reasons for these differences and the risk-benefit of increased long-term opioid therapy discontinuation among patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementia warrant further investigation.
