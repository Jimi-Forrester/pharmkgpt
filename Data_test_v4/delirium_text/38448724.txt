38448724|a|The pathological and physiological studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been in-depth, and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) has been proven to be highly correlated with AD, and clinical and experimental data show that ApoE4 can cause blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury, and the change of BBB permeability is an important factor affecting the development of AD. Andrographolide (Andro), as the active component of the natural plant Andrographis paniculata, has been proven to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which have potential neuroprotective effects. To verify the protective effect of Andro on BBB in a short term, our research group used atorvastatin (Atorva)-mediated zebrafish brain injury model and the ApoE4-mediated cell co-culture model of BBB injury to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of Andro on BBB injury. Studies have shown that Andro can inhibit the activation of CypA/NF-kappaB/MMP-9 signaling pathway and has achieved the effect of antagonizing the inhibition of ApoE4 on intercellular tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1). At the same time, Andro can inhibit the secretion of cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) in cells, thereby delaying the occurrence and progression of neuroinflammation and playing a protective role in BBB. In conclusion, Andro is a potent natural product which can protect the blood-brain barrier.
