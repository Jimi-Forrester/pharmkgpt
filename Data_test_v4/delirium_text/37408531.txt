37408531|a|Microcephaly is characterized as a small head circumference, and is often accompanied by developmental disorders. Several candidate risk genes for this disease have been described, and mutations in non-coding regions are occasionally found in patients with microcephaly. Various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), SINEUPs, telomerase RNA component (TERC), and promoter-associated lncRNAs (pancRNAs) are now being characterized. These ncRNAs regulate gene expression, enzyme activity, telomere length, and chromatin structure through RNA binding proteins (RBPs)-RNA interaction. Elucidating the potential roles of ncRNA-protein coordination in microcephaly pathogenesis might contribute to its prevention or recovery. Here, we introduce several syndromes whose clinical features include microcephaly. In particular, we focus on syndromes for which ncRNAs or genes that interact with ncRNAs may play roles. We discuss the possibility that the huge ncRNA field will provide possible new therapeutic approaches for microcephaly and also reveal clues about the factors enabling the evolutionary acquisition of the human-specific "large brain."
