31106561|a|Patients recovering from critical illness are often suffering from remarkable limitations in their everyday life. The purpose of this study was to find factors associated with poor physical functioning and mental health after critical illness. The study was conducted among patients who met the inclusion criteria of our post-intensive care unit follow-up clinic. The patients were invited to the follow-up clinic three months after hospital discharge. The participants filled out a RAND-36 questionnaire, underwent a clinical examination and were stratified to those with good or poor recovery according to physical functioning and emotional wellbeing. Altogether 332 out of 351 follow-up clinic attendees had data available for analysis. In physical functioning 40% of patients achieved a poor outcome. In mental health the percentage was 8%. The patients with poor physical functioning had a longer hospital stay and were more likely to have received vasopressors. Eleven out of 16 (69%) multitrauma patients had poor physical functioning. Patients with poor physical functioning had more memories of pain, achieved worse results in a six-minute walk test and were less likely to be able to move independently. The patients with poor mental health had higher delirium incidence and fewer memories of relatives' visits and of nurses. The conclusions of this study were that the memories of pain, multitrauma and longer hospital stay were associated with a poor physical functioning outcome. Delirium and a lack of memories of relatives and nurses were associated with a poor mental health outcome.
