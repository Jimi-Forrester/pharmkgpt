19269546|a|We present the case of a 52-year-old man who developed catatonia after undergoing liver and kidney transplantation. This is the third reported case of catatonia after liver transplant. Because of the unique and effective therapy for a syndrome that may resemble delirium, schizophrenia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, it is important that physicians be alert to the signs of catatonia, particularly in the postoperative setting.
