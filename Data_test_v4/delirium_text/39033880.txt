39033880|a|Periodontitis (PDS) is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by a dysbiosis of oral pathogenic bacterial species, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). These bacteria can penetrate the bloodstream, releasing various endo and exotoxins that fuel the infection, and stimulate toxic inflammation in different compartments, including the brain. However, the specific mechanisms by which PDS/Pg contribute to brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain unclear. This study assessed the effects of Pg's virulence factors - lipopolysaccharide (LPS-Pg) and gingipains (gps) K (Kgp) and Rgp - on SH-SY5Y cells. Our results demonstrated that LPS-Pg activated signaling through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2/4 induced a significant downregulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5). Additionally, LPS-Pg stimulation resulted in a robust increase in Tau phosphorylation (pTau) and p53 levels, while causing a marked reduction in Bcl2 and increased cell death compared to unstimulated cells (Ns). LPS-Pg also elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, leading to oxidative damage. In cells overexpressing GRK5 via Adenovirus, LPS-Pg failed to increase iNOS and pTau levels compared to GFP control cells. High GRK5 levels also prevented the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB). Furthermore, the overexpression of a GRK5 mutant form lacking the nuclear localization signal (DeltaNLS) nearly abolished LPS-Pg induced p53 and iNOS upregulation. Finally, we tested whether Kgp and Rgp mediated similar effects and our data showed that both gps caused a marked downregulation of GRK5 leading to increased p53 and pTau levels. In conclusion, this study provides further insight into the toxic effects elicited by Pg in cells and suggests that preventing GRK5 deficiency may be a valid strategy to mitigate Pg-induced toxic effects (i.e. cell death, oxidative damage, and Tau hyperphosphorylation) in SH-SY5Y cells, which are typical molecular hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders.
