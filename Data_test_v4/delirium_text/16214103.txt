16214103|a|Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been developed as a new strategy for detection and imaging of beta-amyloid protein in immunohistochemical sections from the brains of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The distribution of beta-amyloid deposits in tissue was based on measurement of Eu- and Ni-coupled antibodies. The laser-based methodologies (spot ablation, single line raster, and two-dimensional imaging) were also used to detect and map trace element distributions and thus provide a novel probe for both elemental and protein data. We also report the combination of laser capture microdissection with LA-ICP-MS as an alternative strategy for microanalysis of immunohistochemical sections.
