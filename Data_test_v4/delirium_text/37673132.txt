37673132|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system after Alzheimer's disease. The current understanding of PD focuses mainly on the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra region of the midbrain, which is attributed to factors such as oxidative stress, alpha-synuclein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These factors together contribute to the PD phenotype. Recent studies on PD pathology have introduced a new form of cell death known as ferroptosis. Pathological changes closely linked with ferroptosis have been seen in the brain tissues of PD patients, including alterations in iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Preclinical research has demonstrated the neuroprotective qualities of certain iron chelators, antioxidants, Fer-1, and conditioners in Parkinson's disease. Natural plant products have shown significant potential in balancing ferroptosis-related factors and adjusting their expression levels. Therefore, it is vital to understand the mechanisms by which natural plant products inhibit ferroptosis and relieve PD symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive look at ferroptosis, its role in PD pathology, and the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of natural plant products focused on ferroptosis. The insights from this review can serve as useful references for future research on novel ferroptosis inhibitors and lead compounds for PD treatment.
