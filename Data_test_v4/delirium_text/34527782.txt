34527782|t|Understanding Cachexia in Head and Neck Cancer.
34527782|a|One of the major comorbidities of cancer and cancer therapy is posing a global health problem in cancer cachexia. Cancer cachexia is now considered a multifactorial syndrome that presents with drastic loss of body weight, anorexia, asthenia, and anemia. Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are at a greater risk for development and severity of cachexia syndrome as there is direct involvement of structures associated with nutritional intake. Yet, the scientific evidence, approach, and management of cachexia in HNCs are yet to be largely explored. The article aims to succinctly review the concepts of cancer cachexia with relevance to HNCs and summarizes the current findings from recent research.
