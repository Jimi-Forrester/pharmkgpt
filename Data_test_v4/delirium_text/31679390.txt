31679390|a|PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the factors affecting caregivers' acceptance of the use of wearable devices by patients with dementia by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model with 2 additional constructs: resistance to change (RC) and technology anxiety (TA). METHODS: A structured online questionnaire was developed and distributed to caregivers who have either dealt previously with or were currently taking care of patients with dementia in sub-Saharan Africa. The selection of countries for the study was purely based on the availability of caregivers of patients with dementia and their readiness to take part in the survey. Questionnaire data from 350 respondents were analyzed and the hypothesis tested using partial least squares based on structural equation modeling. RESULT: The results of the extended model show that social influence, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention (BI) all had P < .05, thus were statistically significant in explaining the perceived BI and actual use of health-care wearable devices among patients with dementia as reported by caregivers. However, P value for RC and TA was greater than .05, hence were insignificant.
