34996965|a|Working memory and pattern separation are fundamental cognitive abilities which, when impaired, significantly diminish quality of life. Discovering genetic mechanisms underlying innate and disease-induced variation in these cognitive abilities is a critical step towards treatments for common and devastating neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, the trial-unique nonmatching-to-location assay (TUNL) is a touchscreen operant conditioning procedure allowing simultaneous quantification of working memory and pattern separation in mice and rats. In the present study, we used the TUNL assay to quantify these cognitive abilities in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. These strains are the founders of the BXD recombinant inbred mouse panel which enables discovery of genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation. TUNL testing revealed that pattern separation was significantly influenced by mouse strain, whereas working memory was not. Moreover, horizontal distance and vertical distance between choice-phase stimuli had dissociable effects on TUNL performance. These findings provide novel data on mouse strain differences in pattern separation and support previous findings of equivalent working memory performance in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Although working memory of the BXD founder strains was equivalent in this study, working memory of BXD strains may be divergent because of transgressive segregation. Collectively, data presented here indicate that pattern separation is heritable in the mouse and that the BXD panel can be used to identify mechanisms underlying variation in pattern separation.
