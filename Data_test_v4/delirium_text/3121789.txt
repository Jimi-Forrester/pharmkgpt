3121789|t|Neuritic plaque amyloid in Alzheimer's disease is highly racemized.
3121789|a|Neuritic plaque core amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue was investigated for the extent of amino acid racemization. Long-lived human proteins exhibit racemization of certain amino acids over the course of a human lifetime. Purified core amyloid was found to contain relatively large proportions of D-aspartate and D-serine, suggesting that neuritic plaque amyloid is derived from a long-lived precursor protein. Alternatively, racemization of protein amino acids may be abnormally accelerated in Alzheimer's disease.
