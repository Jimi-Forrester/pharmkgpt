29456842|a|Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Nitric Oxide (NO) have become recognized as important gaseous signaling molecules with enormous pharmacological effects, therapeutic value, and central physiological roles. NO is one of the most important regulators of the pathophysiological condition in central nervous system (CNS). It is critical in the various functioning of the brain; however, beyond certain concentration/level, it is toxic. H2S was regarded as toxic gas with the smell like rotten egg. But, it is now regarded as emerging neuroprotectant and neuromodulator. Recently, the use of donors and inhibitors of these signaling molecules have helped us to identify their accurate and precise biological effects. The most abundant neurotransmitter of CNS (glutamate) is the initiator of the reaction that forms NO, and H2S is highly expressed in brain. These molecules are shedding light on the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. This review is mainly focused on the importance of H2S and NO for normal functioning of CNS.
