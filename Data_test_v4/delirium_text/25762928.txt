25762928|a|We report the case of a 29-year-old female patient who presented with an acute onset of anisocoria, blurred vision, nausea and severe left-sided headache. There was no history of trauma, drug abuse, or instillation of topical mydriatic compounds. The ocular history was negative for similar events. On presentation, her visual acuity was 0.2 in the left and 1.0 in the right eye with a +2.5 dpt sph. correction. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated a shallow anterior chamber as well as the presence of iris nodules in both eyes. These nodules were identified as Lisch nodules as the patient referred to the previous diagnosis as being neurofibromatosis type 1. A third nerve palsy was considered, but a brain MRI showed normal results. Her ocular motility was normal, but the left pupil was mydriatic and poorly reacting to light, with an associated raised intraocular pressure (IOP) of 38 mm Hg. An examination of the fellow eye was normal, with the IOP measuring 18 mm Hg. Gonioscopy of the right eye showed a narrow angle. On further anamnestic investigation, the patient revealed that the pain and the blurred vision begun in the morning while she was helping her mother in the garden. Finally, after showing the patient a picture of Datura flowers, which she recognized immediately, we made the unusual diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma by Datura, a well-known toxic plant with mydriatic properties. The patient was successfully treated with systemic acetazolamide and topical pilocarpine.
