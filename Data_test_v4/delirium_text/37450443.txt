In this study, we look at the impact of evidence-based protocols implemented at Stanford Hospital. METHODS: This study is a single-center, retrospective analysis. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols were implemented for CABG/Valve and open Aortic operations on 11/1/2017 and 6/1/2018, respectively. Propensity-score matched analysis was used to compare 30-day mortality and morbidity of patients from the pre- and post-implementation cohorts. Secondary endpoints included the following: total hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, time until extubation, and time until urinary catheter removal. RESULTS: After the implementation of the ERAS protocols for CABG/Valve operations, the median post-op LOS decreased from 7.0 days to 6.1 days (p<0.001), and median ICU LOS decreased from 69.9 hours to 54.0 (p = 0.098). There was no significant decrease in 30-day mortality (4% to 3.3%, p = 0.47). However, the incidence of post-op ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) decreased from 5.0% to 2.1% (p = 0.003) and post-op urinary tract infections (UTIs) from 8.3% to 3.6% (p<0.001). Patients who underwent open aortic procedures experienced an improvement in 30-day mortality (7% to 3.5%, p = 0.012), decrease in median ICU LOS (91.7 hours to 69.6 hours, p<0.001), and a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation (79.3 hours to 46.3 hours, p = 0.003). There was a decrease in post-op LOS, post-op VAP, and post-op UTI, although statistical significance was not attained. CONCLUSION: At Stanford Hospital, ERAS pathways have led to decreased morbidity and LOS while simultaneously improving mortality amongst our critically ill patient population.
