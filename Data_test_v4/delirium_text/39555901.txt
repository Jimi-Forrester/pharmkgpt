39555901|a|INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular drug use may help prevent dementia; however, current evidence is mixed. Using a case-control design, we investigated the association between duration and combination of multiple cardiovascular drug classes and incident dementia. METHODS: From the Swedish national registers, we included 88,065 incident dementia cases aged >= 70 at diagnosis between 2011 and 2016 and 880,650 age- and sex-matched controls. Cardiovascular drug use was ascertained from the Prescribed Drug Register. RESULTS: Long-term users (>= 5 years) of antihypertensives, diuretics, lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs), and oral anticoagulants (OACs) had statistically significantly fewer dementia diagnoses (odds ratio [OR] 0.75-0.91) than non-users. Antiplatelets use was associated with more dementia diagnoses (OR 1.13-1.25). Use of antihypertensives in combination with diuretics, LLDs, and OACs for >= 5 years was associated with fewer dementia diagnoses (OR 0.66-0.84). DISCUSSION: Preventing dementia via cardiovascular drug pathways may be possible. It is however important to consider the potential long-term negative cognitive effect of antiplatelets. HIGHLIGHTS: Use >= 5 years of common cardiovascular drugs was associated with lower dementia risk. Common cardiovascular drug combination use was associated with lower dementia risk. Anti-platelet use of any duration was associated with higher dementia risk.
