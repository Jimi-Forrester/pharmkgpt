23670398|t|Peripherally applied synthetic peptide isoAsp7-Abeta(1-42) triggers cerebral beta-amyloidosis.
23670398|a|Intracerebral and intraperitoneal inoculation with beta-amyloid-rich brain extracts originating from patients with Alzheimer's disease as well as intracerebral injection of aggregates composed of synthetic Abeta can induce cerebral beta-amyloidosis, and associated cognitive dysfunctions in susceptible animal hosts. We have found that repetitive intravenous administration of 100 mug of synthetic peptide corresponding to isoAsp7-containing Abeta(1-42), an abundant age-dependent Abeta isoform present both in the pathological brain and in synthetic Abeta preparations, robustly accelerates formation of classic dense-core congophilic amyloid plaques in the brain of beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Our findings indicate this peptide as an inductive agent of cerebral beta-amyloidosis in vivo.
