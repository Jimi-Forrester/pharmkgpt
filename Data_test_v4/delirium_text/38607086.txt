38607086|t|Miro GTPases at the Crossroads of Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Mitochondrial Trafficking.
38607086|a|Miro GTPases are key components in the machinery responsible for transporting mitochondria and peroxisomes along microtubules, and also play important roles in regulating calcium homeostasis and organizing contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, Miro GTPases have been shown to interact with proteins that actively regulate cytoskeletal organization and dynamics, suggesting that these GTPases participate in organizing cytoskeletal functions and organelle transport. Derailed mitochondrial transport is associated with neuropathological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This review explores our recent understanding of the diverse roles of Miro GTPases under cytoskeletal control, both under normal conditions and during the course of human diseases such as neuropathological disorders.
