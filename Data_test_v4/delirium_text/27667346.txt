27667346|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine nurses' approaches to care of patients with postoperative delirium in the postanesthesia care unit and intensive care unit. DESIGN: A descriptive survey design was used. METHODS: Eighty-seven nurses who have been working at a Training and Research Hospital in Erzurum, east of Turkey, were enrolled in this study between October 1 and November 20, 2012. FINDINGS: 83.9% of the nurses reported that they had given pharmacologic therapy for pain management in delirium patients, 39.1% massage, 31.0% rhythmic breathing exercise, and 26.4% music therapy. 90.8% of nurses also stated that they reduced noise and lighting at night to ensure normal sleep pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses need to be supported to take part in courses, conferences, and training seminars. A standard data tool or scale needs to be used to assess delirium routinely in all patients admitted.
