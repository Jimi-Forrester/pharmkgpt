6116549|t|[Delirium tremens in relation to acute surgical diseases (clinical and therapeutic findings)].
6116549|a|More than 300 cases of Delirium Tremens have observed at the Department of Emergency Surgery of the Ospedale Delmati di S. Angelo Lodigiano (Milano) in patients affected with surgical trauma or surgically treated for acute disease. The pathogenetic mechanism and the main changes, peculiar of delirium tremens are described. Therapy has been considered on the ground of personal and others' experience. Two main groups can be distinguished: A causal therapy (detoxicant and hepatoprotective, antireactive and desensitizing) and a symptomatic therapy (analecties, sedation on central nervous system, modification of saline and hydroelectrolitic unbalance). The substances administered, the pathogenetic mechanism and the pharmacological properties are discussed. It is suggested that any schematism of the therapeutical approach is unwarranted, either if one considers as preminent a given pathogenetic factor or if a complex therapy is instituted, to comprehend all the pathogenetic possibilities, by undiscriminated use of different type of agents.
