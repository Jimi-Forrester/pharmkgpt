2671448|a|Geriatrics in future will be most concerned with persons aged 80 years or more (very elderly) in Japan. Clinical and pathological features of very elderly patients were reported with comparison to the 65-79 age group. Many very elderly do not show clear-cut clinical signs and symptoms, but have serious underlying diseases. We propose here a concept of "clinical threshold". On evaluating the laboratory data, we must consider the grades of "activity of daily living (ADL)" of the aged patients, because ADL may significantly modify the test results. Furthermore in clinical practice, we should pay attention to both the psychosocial states and physical findings of the patients. "The old age syndrome" proposed by Parker is useful in geriatric medicine. Extensive studies on dementia, especially of Alzheimer's type are required urgently. Molecular biology approaches to this disease have shown great advances in geriatrics. To prevent geriatric disease, well-controlled exercise and diet are important as well as reasonable psychosocial integrity.
