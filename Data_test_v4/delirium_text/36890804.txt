36890804|a|Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease of the lungs known as the third reason for death worldwide. Frequent COPD exacerbations compel health care workers to apply interventions that are not adverse effect free. Accordingly, adding or replacing Curcumin, a natural meal flavoring, may indicate advantages in this era by its antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. Methods: The PRISMA checklist was employed for the systematic review study. On June 3, 2022, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies associated with COPD and Curcumin in the last 10 years. Duplicate or non-English publications and articles with irrelevant titles and abstracts were excluded. Also, preprints, reviews, short communications, editorials, letters to the editor, comments, conference abstracts, and conference papers were not included. Results: Overall, 4288 publications were found eligible, after the screening, 9 articles were finally included. Among them, one, four, and four in vitro, in vivo, and both in vivo and in vitro research exist respectively. According to the investigations, Curcumin can inhibit alveolar epithelial thickness and proliferation, lessen the inflammatory response, remodel the airway, produce ROS, alleviate airway inflammation, hinder emphysema and prevent ischemic complications. Conclusion: Consequently, the findings of the current review demonstrate that Curcumin's modulatory effects on oxidative stress, cell viability, and gene expression could be helpful in COPD management. However, for data confirmation, further randomized clinical trials are required.
