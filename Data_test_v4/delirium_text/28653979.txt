BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulation is one of the major mechanisms for an organism to respond to the environment through changes in gene expression and has been implicated in numerous disease processes. We would like to examine epigenetic modification patterns that may predispose or protect against PD. METHODS: Frozen tissue samples of the human cerebral cortex from 12 PD patients and 12 subjects without PD pathology were obtained. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Differential methylation was defined as a mean methylation level difference (delta beta) of at least 0.20 (Deltabeta >= 0.20). Methylation regions with an absolute delta beta value >= 0.20 were selected for further gene function studies. RESULTS: We identified 2795 differentially methylated CpG sites in the frontal cortex of PD cases with a detection p-value of <= 0.01 and 328 differentially methylated CpG sites with a detection p-value of <= 0.001. A pattern of robust hypermethylation of synphilin-1, alpha-synuclein-interacting protein (SNCAIP) gene was found in the brain of PD cases (p = 4.93 x 10-7 and delta beta = 0.60). CONCLUSION: Our findings support a link between SNCAIP methylation and PD risk. Hypomethylation of SNCAIP may function to protect against PD. The current results may suggest that the methylation status of SNCAIP could be useful as a marker in PD diagnosis and treatment and warrants further investigation.
