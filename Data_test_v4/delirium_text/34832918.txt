34832918|t|The Potential Effect of Insulin on AChE and Its Interactions with Rivastigmine In Vitro.
34832918|a|There is no definite cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its multifactorial origin. Drugs that inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), such as rivastigmine, are promising symptomatic treatments for AD. Emerging evidence suggests that insulin therapy can hinder several aspects of AD pathology. Insulin has been shown to modify the activity of AChE, but it is still unknown how insulin and AChE interact. Combination therapy, which targets several features of the disease based on existing medications, can provide a worthy therapy option for AD management. However, to date, no studies have examined the potential interaction of insulin with AChE and/or rivastigmine in vitro. In the present study, we employed the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as an in vitro assessment to investigate the effect of insulin on both AChE activity and rivastigmine inhibitory action using a common spectrophotometric assay for cholinesterase activity, Ellman's method. Our results showed that insulin, even at high concentrations, has an insignificant effect on both the activity of AChE and rivastigmine's inhibitory action. The variance of our data is near zero, which means that the dispersion is negligible. However, to improve our understanding of the possible interaction of insulin and rivastigmine, or its target AChE, more in silico modelling and in vivo studies are needed.
