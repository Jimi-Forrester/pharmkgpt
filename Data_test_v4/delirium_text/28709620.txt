28709620|t|Synthesis and anti-diabetic activity of new N,N-dimethylphenylenediamine-derivatized nitrilotriacetic acid vanadyl complexes.
28709620|a|Vanadium compounds are promising anti-diabetic agents. However, reducing the metal toxicity while keeping/improving the hypoglycemic effect is still a big challenge towards the success of anti-diabetic vanadium drugs. To improve the therapeutic potency using the anti-oxidative strategy, we synthesized new N,N-dimethylphenylenediamine (DMPD)-derivatized nitrilotriacetic acid vanadyl complexes ([VO(dmada)]). The in vitro biological evaluations revealed that the DMPD-derivatized complexes showed improved antioxidant capacity and lowered cytotoxicity on HK-2 cells than bis(maltolato)oxidovanadium (IV) (BMOV). In type II diabetic mice, [VO(p-dmada)] (0.15mmolkg-1/day) exhibited better hypoglycemic effects than BMOV especially on improving glucose tolerance and alleviating the hyperglycemia-induced liver damage. These insulin enhancement effects were associated with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPARalpha/gamma) in fat, activation of Akt (v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene)/PKB (protein kinase-B) in fat and liver, and inactivation of c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNK) in liver. Moreover, [VO(p-dmada)] showed no tissue toxicity at the therapeutic dose in diabetic mice and the oral acute toxicity (LD50) was determined to be 1640mgkg-1. Overall, the experimental results indicated that [VO(p-dmada)] can be a potent insulin enhancement agent with improved efficacy-over- toxicity index for further drug development. In addition, the results on brain Tau phosphorylation suggested necessary investigation on the effects of vanadyl complexes on the pathology of the Alzheimer's disease in the future.
