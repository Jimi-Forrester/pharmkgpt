7967143|t|[Efficacy and safety of electroshock therapy without convulsions under general anesthesia in senile depression].
7967143|a|We examined the efficacy and safety of electroshock therapy (EST) under general anesthesia in 26 depressed patients (9 males, 17 females, age range 55-79). The scores of the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for depression were significantly decreased after EST and clinical symptoms such as depressive mood. psychomotor retardation, anxiety, agitation, suicidal tendencies, hypochondria and sleeplessness improved in all of the patients. Complications included amnesia (16/26), delirium (3/26) and transient arrhythmia (1/26) after EST, but neither lethal nor lasting complications were observed. In summary, EST was an effective and convenient method of treatment for senile depression.
