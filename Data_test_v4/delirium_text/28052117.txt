28052117|t|TRIM32-Cytoplasmic-Body Formation Is an ATP-Consuming Process Stimulated by HSP70 in Cells.
28052117|a|The spontaneous and energy-releasing reaction of protein aggregation is typically prevented by cellular quality control machinery (QC). TRIM32 is a member of the TRIM (tripartite motif-containing) ubiquitin E3 ligases, and when overexpressed in cultured cells, readily forms spherical inclusions designated as cytoplasmic bodies (CBs) even without proteasome inhibition. Here, we show that HSP70, a central QC component, is a primary binding factor of overexpressed TRIM32. Contrary to expectation, however, we find that this molecular chaperone facilitates and stabilizes CB assembly depending on intrinsic ATPase activity, rather than preventing CB formation. We also show that the HSP70-TRIM32 complex is biochemically distinct from the previously characterized 14-3-3-TRIM32 phospho-complex. Moreover, the two complexes have opposing roles, with HSP70 stimulating CB formation and 14-3-3 retaining TRIM32 in a diffuse form throughout the cytosol. Our results suggest that CB inclusion formation is actively controlled by cellular QC and requires ATP, similar to protein folding and degradation reactions.
