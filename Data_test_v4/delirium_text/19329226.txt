19329226|t|PIB binding in aged primate brain: enrichment of high-affinity sites in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
19329226|a|Aged nonhuman primates accumulate large amounts of human-sequence amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain, yet they do not manifest the full phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the biophysical properties of Abeta that might govern its pathogenic potential in humans and nonhuman primates, we incubated the benzothiazole imaging agent Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) with cortical tissue homogenates from normal aged humans, humans with AD, and from aged squirrel monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees with cerebral Abeta-amyloidosis. Relative to humans with AD, high-affinity PIB binding is markedly reduced in cortical extracts from aged nonhuman primates containing levels of insoluble Abeta similar to those in AD. The high-affinity binding of PIB may be selective for a pathologic, human-specific conformation of multimeric Abeta, and thus could be a useful experimental tool for clarifying the unique predisposition of humans to Alzheimer's disease.
