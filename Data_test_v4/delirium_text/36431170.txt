36431170|t|Mid- and Long-Term Surgical Outcomes Due to Infective Endocarditis in Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
36431170|a|BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is one of the true remaining dreaded situations in cardiovascular medicine. Current international guidelines do not include specific recommendations for treatment options of infective endocarditis (conventional vs. surgical) based on the patient's age, functional status or comorbidities. Elderly patients have less invasive and often delayed surgeries compared to younger patients due to their shorter long-term survival probabilities. In the setting of IE, this might not be the right treatment, as surgery is the only curative option in up to 50% of all endocarditis patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the mid- and long-term surgical outcomes due to infective endocarditis of patients aged >=70 years. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2020, a retrospective study with 137 patients aged 70 years and older and 276 patients aged below 70 years was conducted. Altogether, 413 consecutive patients who received surgery due to infective native or prosthetic valve endocarditis were assigned to either the elderly (E)-Group or the control (C)-Group. Primary endpoints were short- and long-term MACCEs (Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular Events) as a composite of death or major adverse events, and secondary endpoints were intraoperative variables and postoperative course. RESULTS: Preoperative risk factors differed significantly. Elderly patients had more arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency and coronary heart disease. Fewer of them were in a state of emergency. Time from diagnosis to OR, antibiotic pretreatment, length of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass time were significantly longer in the E-Group. Furthermore, 44.5% of patients in the E-Group had prosthesis endocarditis as opposed to 29.7% in the C-group. During postoperative follow-up, new onset of hemodialysis, duration of ventilation, delirium, reintubation and tracheotomy rates were significantly higher in the E-Group. There were significant differences in 7- and 30-day mortality. One- year survival was 62% for the E-Group and 79% for the C-Group. Five-year survival was 47% for the E-Group and 67% for the C-Group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that surgery for infective endocarditis is a high-risk procedure, especially for elderly people. Nevertheless, as it is more or less the only concept to increase long-term survival, it should be offered generously to all patients who are still able to take care of themselves.
