36157597|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major risk for the aging population. The pathological hallmarks of AD-an abnormal deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (pTau)-have been demonstrated in the retinas of AD patients, including in prodromal patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Abeta pathology, especially the accumulation of the amyloidogenic 42-residue long alloform (Abeta42), is considered an early and specific sign of AD, and together with tauopathy, confirms AD diagnosis. To visualize retinal Abeta and pTau, state-of-the-art methods use fluorescence. However, administering contrast agents complicates the imaging procedure. To address this problem from fundamentals, ex-vivo studies were performed to develop a label-free hyperspectral imaging method to detect the spectral signatures of Abeta42 and pS396-Tau, and predicted their abundance in retinal cross-sections. For the first time, we reported the spectral signature of pTau and demonstrated an accurate prediction of Abeta and pTau distribution powered by deep learning. We expect our finding will lay the groundwork for label-free detection of AD.
