18222136|t|A comparison of the phenomenology of pediatric, adult, and geriatric delirium.
18222136|a|BACKGROUND: The phenomenology of delirium in childhood is understudied. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to compare the phenomenology of delirium in children, adults and geriatric patients. POPULATION AND METHODS: Forty-six children [mean age 8.3, S.D. 5.6, range 0-17 years (inclusive)], admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of Maastricht University Hospital, with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) delirium, underwent assessment with the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). The scores are compared with those of 49 adult (mean age 55.4, S.D. 7.9, range 18-65 years) and 70 geriatric patients (mean age 76.2, S.D. 6.1, range 66-91 years) with DSM-IV delirium, occurring in a palliative care unit. Score profiles across groups, as well as differences in individual item scores across groups are analysed with multiple analysis of variance, applying a Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Although the range of symptoms occurring in all three groups was similar, DRS score profiles differed significantly across the three groups (Wilks lambda=0.019, F=804.206, P<.001). On item level, childhood delirium is characterized by a more acute onset, more severe perceptual disturbances, more frequent visual hallucinations, more severe delusions, more severe lability of mood, greater agitation, less severe cognitive deficits, less severe sleep-wake cycle disturbance, and less variability of symptoms over time. Adult and geriatric delirium do not differ in their presentations, except for the presence of more severe cognitive symptoms in geriatric delirium (P=.001). CONCLUSION: Childhood delirium has a different course and symptom profile than adult and geriatric delirium. Adult and geriatric delirium differ only in the severity of cognitive symptoms.
