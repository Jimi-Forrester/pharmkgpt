37814431|t|The Effect of Curcumin on the Gut-Brain Axis: Therapeutic Implications.
37814431|a|The gut-brain axis describes the bidirectional communication between the gut, the enteric nervous system, and the central nervous system. The gut-brain axis has attracted increasing attention owing to its regulatory effect on dysbiosis and a wide range of related diseases. Several types of nutrients, such as curcumin, have been proposed as regulators of the dysbiotic state, and preclinical experiments have suggested that curcumin is not only beneficial but also safe. This review focuses on the interplay between curcumin and the gut microbiota. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive review of the crosstalk between the gut-brain axis and disease, whilst also discussing curcumin-mediated gut-brain axis-dependent and -independent signaling about modulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis. This will help to define the utility of curcumin as a novel therapeutic agent to regulate intestinal microflora dysbiosis.
