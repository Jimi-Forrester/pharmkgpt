37094829|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine mental health emergency presentations across the Barwon South West, Victoria, Australia - an area comprising a range of urban and rural localities. METHODS: This is a retrospective synthesis of mental health emergency presentations across the Barwon South West (1 February 2017-31 December 2019). De-identified data were obtained from individuals who presented to EDs and urgent care centres (UCCs) within the study region, who had a principal diagnosis of a Mental and Behavioural Disorder (codes F00-F99). Data were sourced from the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset and Rural Acute Hospital Database Register (RAHDaR). Age-standardised incident rates for mental health emergency presentations were calculated for the whole sample and for local government areas. Data on usual accommodation, arrival transport mode, referral source, patient disposition and length of ED/UCC stay were also obtained. RESULTS: We identified 11 613 mental health emergency presentations, with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (n = 3139, 27.0%) and mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (n = 3487, 30.0%) being the most frequent types of presentations recorded. The highest age-standardised incidence rates (mental health diagnosis per 1000 population/year) were in Glenelg (13.95), whereas Queenscliffe had the lowest incident rates (3.76). Most presentations (n = 3851, 33.2%) tended to occur for individuals aged between 15 and 29 years. CONCLUSIONS: Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use were the most frequent types of presentations recorded across the sample. RAHDaR represented a small but meaningful contribution to the data.
