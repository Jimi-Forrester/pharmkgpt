37565902|t|Anesthesia management of patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair: A retrospective analysis of single center.
37565902|a|Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a new alternative surgical treatment for aortic pathologies, which is more minimally invasive. The aim of current study was to summarize the single-center experience of general anesthesia for patients undergoing TEVAR. In adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, the strategy of "fast-track" anesthesia with early extubation in theater is associated with a shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and lower health-care-related costs. Fast-track anesthesia has not been assessed in patients under TEVAR. Adult patients who received general anesthesia for TEVAR in our center from January 2020 to December 2020 were included. Baseline characteristics, airway management, anesthetic techniques and major complications were collected. A total of 204 (171 male, mean age 58.1 +- 11.5 years) patients met inclusion criteria for this study. The distribution of pathologies included 29 descending thoracic aneurysms, 87 type B dissections, and 88 intramural hematoma/perforating aortic ulcer. Etomidate was the induction agent in 190 (93.1%) patients, compared with propofol in 16 (7.8%). Cisatracurium was the muscle relaxant in 201 (98.5%), compared with rocuronium in 3 (1.5%). Midazolam (benzodiazepines) was given to 124 (60.8%) patients during anesthesia induction. General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in 85.3% (174) patients, dexmedetomidine in 201 (98.5%) and propofol in 204 (100%). Postoperative length of stay (LOS) in the hospital was 6.0 (5.0-7.8) days. LOS in the ICU was 23.0 (20.0-27.8) hours. Overall neurologic event rate was 2.0% (n = 4) (spinal cord ischemia 1.5% [n = 3]; stroke 0.5% [n = 1]). After matching, patients who received "fast-track" anesthesia had a shorter LOS in ICUs (21.0 [18.0-24.0] vs 24.0 [20.0-44.0] hours; P = .005), and a shorter postoperative LOS in hospital (5.0 [4.0-7.0] vs 6.0 [5.0-8.0] days; P = .001). There were no in-hospital deaths. Fast-track anesthesia is feasible and safe in patients underwent TEVAR. This management strategy is associated with shorter LOS of ICU and total postoperative hospital stays. An early extubation strategy should be implemented for hemodynamically stable patients.
