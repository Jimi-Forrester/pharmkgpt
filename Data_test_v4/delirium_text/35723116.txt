35723116|t|Infections and Changes in Commensal Bacteria and the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.
35723116|a|The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, but environmental factors are purported to influence risk. Interest in PD as a sequel of infection dates back to reports of parkinsonism arising from encephalitis lethargica. The objective of this paper is to review the literature as it relates to infections and changes in microbiome and the genesis of PD. There is evidence to support prior infection with Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C virus, Malassezia, and Strep pneumonia in association with PD. A large number of studies support an association between changes in commensal bacteria, especially gut bacteria, and PD. Extant literature supports a role for some infections and changes in commensal bacteria in the genesis of PD. Studies support an inflammatory mechanism for this association, but additional research is required for translation of these findings to therapeutic options.
