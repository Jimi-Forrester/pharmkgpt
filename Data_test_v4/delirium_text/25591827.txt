25591827|a|It has been proposed that the amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) cause the neuronal degeneration in the Alzheimer's disease brain. An imbalance between peptide production at the neuronal level and their elimination across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) results in peptide accumulation inside the brain. The identification and functional characterization of the transport systems in the BBB with the capacity to transport Abeta is crucial for the understanding of Abeta peptide traffic from the brain to the blood. In this context, it has been suggested that the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), expressed in endothelial cells of the BBB, plays a role in the elimination of Abeta. However, there is little, if any, experimental evidence to support this; therefore, the aim of this investigation was to determine whether P-gp is capable of transporting Abeta peptides. Our results show that ATPase activity measured in plasma membrane vesicles of K562 cells overexpressing P-gp is not increased by the presence of Abeta42, suggesting that Abeta42 is not a P-gp substrate. Similarly, P-gp of pirarubicin was unaffected by Abeta42. Moreover, the overexpression of P-gp does not protect cells against Abeta42 toxicity. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that Abeta42 is not transported by P-gp.
