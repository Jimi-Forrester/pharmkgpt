38069399|a|Spirulina, a filamentous microalga, is used all over the world as a nutraceutical dietary supplement. Recent studies have focused on examining its chelating activity and antioxidant properties, especially as a candidate for protection against neurotoxicity caused by heavy metals. The MTT test and LDH assay were used to examine the viability of the SH-SY5Y cells for 24, 48, and 72 h, to Cd, Hg, and Pb, individually or in combination with Spirulina, and the effects of necrotic cell death. In comparison to the control group, the viability of SH-SY5Y cells decreased after 24 h of exposure, with Cd being more toxic than Hg and Pb being less lethal. The effects of heavy metal toxicity on cell survival were ranked in order after 72 h under identical experimental circumstances as follows: Hg, Pb, and Cd. The viability of the cells was then tested after being exposed to Spirulina at doses of 5 at 50 (%v/v) for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. SH-SY5Y cells that had been treated with mixtures of heavy metals and Spirulina underwent the same assay. Cell viability is considerably increased by using Spirulina treatments at the prescribed periods and doses. Instead, the same procedure, when applied to SH-SY5Y cells, caused the release of LDH, which is consistent with the reduction in cell viability. We demonstrated for the first time, considering all the available data, that Spirulina 5, 25, and 50 (%v/v) enhanced the number of viable SH-SY5Y cells utilized as a model system for brain cells. Overall, the data from the present study provide a first insight into the promising positive role of Spirulina against the potentially toxic effects of metals.
