39829725|t|The Correlation of Hemostatic Parameters with the Development of Early Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy. A Retrospective Observational Study.
39829725|a|Introduction: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is one of the most common complications seen both in early and late stages of sepsis, with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild neurological dysfunction to delirium and coma. The pathophysiology of SAE is still not completely understood, and the diagnosis can be challenging especially in early stages of sepsis and in patients with subtle symptoms. Aim of the study: The objective of this study was to assess the coagulation profile in patients with early SAE and to compare the hemostatic parameters between septic patients with and without SAE in the first 24 hours from sepsis diagnosis. Material and methods: This retrospective observational study included 280 patients with sepsis in the first 24 hours after sepsis diagnosis. A complete blood count was available in all patients; a complex hemostatic assessment including standard coagulation tests, plasmatic levels of coagulation factors, inhibitors, D-dimers, and Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM, Instrumentation Laboratory) was performed in a subgroup of patients. Results: Early SAE was diagnosed in 184 patients (65.7%) and was correlated with a higher platelet count, after adjusting for age and leucocyte count. Compared to patients without neurological dysfunction, patients with early SAE presented a more active coagulation system revealed by faster propagation phase, increased clot firmness and elasticity with a higher platelet contribution to clot strength. The initiation of coagulation and clot lysis were not different between the groups. Conclusion: In the early stages of sepsis, the development of SAE is correlated with increased systemic clotting activity where platelets seem to have an important role. More research is needed to investigate the role of platelets and the coagulation system in relation to the development of early SAE.
