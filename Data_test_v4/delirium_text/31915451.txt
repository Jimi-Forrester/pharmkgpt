31915451|a|BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis is a serious human health problem, and there is a need for specific antifibrosis drugs in the clinic. Tanshinone IIA has recently been reported to have a role in the treatment of liver fibrosis. However, the evidence supporting its antifibrotic effect is not sufficient, and the underlying mechanism is not clear. We thus performed this meta-analysis of animal research to assess the therapeutic effect of tanshinone IIA on liver fibrosis and analyzed the possible associated mechanism to provide a reference for further clinical drug preparation and clinical research. METHODS: We collect related articles from the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Wanfang, VIP, and CNKI. The quality of the included studies was evaluated according to the SYRCLE risk of bias tool for animal studies. Data were analyzed using RavMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 404 articles were retrieved from the databases. After screening, 11 articles were included in the analysis. The included studies' methodological quality was generally low, and an obvious publication bias was found. The results showed that tanshinone IIA significantly improved liver function in experimental animals and reduced the level of liver fibrosis by reducing inflammation and inhibiting immunity, antiapoptotic processes, and HSC activation. CONCLUSION: Tanshinone IIA can effectively improve liver fibrosis and liver function in animal models and is worthy of future higher quality animal studies and clinical drug trials.
