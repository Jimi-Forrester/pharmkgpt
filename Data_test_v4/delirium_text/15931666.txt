15931666|a|This study investigates the role of excitotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease and in multiinfarct dementia by examining, via immunohistochemical methods, the number of cells that are positive for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the degree of colocalization between NMDA receptor and apoptosis markers such as TUNEL or activated caspase-3 in the frontal cortex of individuals with these two conditions, comparing the results with those from subjects who died of normal aging. We showed an increased number of NMDA receptor-positive cells and an increased number of TUNEL-labeled cells in the frontal cortex of subjects with Alzheimer's disease, especially in the deeper layers of the cortex. However, only about 10% of cells showed colocalization of NMDA receptor with the apoptosis markers studied, suggesting that NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity does not play a major role in neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease or in multiinfarct dementia.
