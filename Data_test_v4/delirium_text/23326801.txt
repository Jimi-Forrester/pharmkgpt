23326801|t|Comparison of Ovarian volume and Antral follicle count with Endocrine tests for prediction of responsiveness in ovulation induction protocols.
23326801|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine if the basal antral follicle number and ovarian volume contributes to the prediction of responsiveness in ovulation induction protocol and comparison of it with hormonal tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 52 irregularly-menstruating patients, aged 18-46 years, participated in this prospective study. All the patients underwent a transvaginal sonography to measure the basal ovarian volume and the basal antral follicles count (AFC). Clomiphene citrate challenge test was measured by summation of measurements of FSH on day 2 and 10. All the women received clomiphene citrate from day 2 to 6. Ovarian responsiveness was measured 1 week after termination of clomiphene citrate and was used as gold standard. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that AFC was the only significant factor for ovarian responsiveness prediction. The area under the curve for AFC to discriminate responder ovaries was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.99). The cutoff value for predicting ovarian responsiveness was 15.5. CONCLUSION: AFC can contribute to the prediction of responsiveness in ovulation induction protocol better than ovarian volume and hormonal tests.
