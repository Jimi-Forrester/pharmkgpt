36128057|a|Reduced awareness of neuropsychological disorders (i.e., anosognosia) is a striking symptom of post-COVID-19 condition. Some leukocyte markers in the acute phase may predict the presence of anosognosia in the chronic phase, but they have not yet been identified. This study aimed to determine whether patients with anosognosia for their memory deficits in the chronic phase presented specific leukocyte distribution in the acute phase, and if so, whether these leukocyte levels might be predictive of anosognosia. First, we compared the acute immunological data (i.e., white blood cell differentiation count) of 20 patients who displayed anosognosia 6-9 months after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (230.25 +- 46.65 days) versus 41 patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 who did not develop anosognosia. Second, we performed an ROC analysis to evaluate the predictive value of the leukocyte markers that emerged from this comparison. Blood circulating monocytes (%) in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with long-term post-COVID-19 anosognosia. A monocyte percentage of 7.35% of the total number of leukocytes at admission seemed to predict the presence of chronic anosognosia 6-9 months after infection.
