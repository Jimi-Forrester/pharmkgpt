Six Food and Drug Administration-approved medications (e.g., donepezil and memantine) have demonstrated some efficacy but are primarily used to alleviate symptoms. The etiology of AD is unknown, and the blood-brain barrier restricts drug penetration, which severely restricts the use of various therapeutic agents. With their high targeting, long-lasting effect, and multifunctionality, inorganic nanomaterials provide a novel approach to the treatment of AD. A review of inorganic nanoparticles in the diagnosis and therapy of AD. This paper reviews the research literature on the use of inorganic nanomaterials in the treatment of AD. Gold nanoparticles, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and quantum dots are among the inorganic nanomaterials studied. As knowledge of the origins of AD remains limited, the majority of studies on inorganic nanomaterials have primarily focused on interventions on Abeta proteins. Adjusting and enhancing the properties of these inorganic nanomaterials, such as core-shell structure design and surface modification, confer benefits for the treatment of AD. Inorganic nanoparticles have a wide spectrum of therapeutic potential for AD. Despite their potential benefits, however, the safety and translation of inorganic nanomaterials into clinical applications remain formidable obstacles.
