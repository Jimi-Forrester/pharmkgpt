38390800|t|Association of Cardiac Biomarkers in Combination With Cognitive Impairment After Acute Ischemic Stroke.
38390800|a|BACKGROUND: Poststroke cognitive impairment is a severe and common clinical complication that constitutes a substantial global health burden. We aimed to evaluate the association of 3 cardiac biomarkers in combination with poststroke cognitive impairment and their prognostic significance. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study included 566 patients with ischemic stroke. Cardiac biomarkers, including sST2 (soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 receptor), GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor-15), and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), were measured. Cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of <27 or a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of <25 at 3 months after ischemic stroke. Odds of cognitive impairment 3 months after ischemic stroke increased with the number of elevated cardiac biomarkers (sST2, GDF-15, and NT-proBNP; Ptrend<0.001). The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) of cognitive impairment defined by the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment were 2.45 (1.48-4.07) and 1.86 (1.10-3.14) for the participants with >=2 elevated cardiac biomarkers, respectively, compared with those without any elevated cardiac biomarker. Additionally, higher cardiac biomarker scores were associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment (Ptrend<0.05). Simultaneously adding all 3 cardiac biomarkers to the basic model with traditional risk factors significantly improved the risk prediction of Mini-Mental State Examination-defined cognitive impairment (net reclassification improvement=34.99%, P<0.001; integrated discrimination index=2.67%, P<0.001). Similar findings were observed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. CONCLUSIONS: An increased number of elevated novel cardiac biomarkers were associated with an increased odds of poststroke cognitive impairment, suggesting that a combination of these cardiac biomarkers may improve the risk prediction of cognitive impairment.
