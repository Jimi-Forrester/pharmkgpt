29953467|t|The role of phenolic OH groups of flavonoid compounds with H-bond formation ability to suppress amyloid mature fibrils by destabilizing beta-sheet conformation of monomeric Abeta17-42.
29953467|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of brain disease that arises due to the aggregation and fibrillation of amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). The peptide Abeta17-42 forms U-shape protofilaments of amyloid mature fibrils by cross-beta strands, detected in brain cells of individuals with AD. Targeting the structure of Abeta17-42 and destabilizing its beta-strands by natural compounds could be effective in the treatment of AD patients. Therefore, the interaction features of monomeric U-shape Abeta17-42 with natural flavonoids including myricetin, morin and flavone at different mole ratios were comprehensively studied to recognize the mechanism of Abeta monomer instability using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that all flavonoids have tendency to interact and destabilize Abeta peptide structure with mole ratio-dependent effects. The interaction free energies of myricetin (with 6 OHs) and morin (with 5 OHs) were more negative compared to flavone, although the total binding energies of all flavonoids are favorable and negative. Myricetin, morin and flavone penetrated into the core of the Abeta17-42 and formed self-clusters of Abeta17-42-flavonoid complexes. Analysis of Abeta17-42-flavonoids interactions identified that the hydrophobic interactions related to SASA-dependent energy are weak in all complexes. However, the intermolecular H-bonds are a main binding factor for shifting U-shape rod-like state of Abeta17-42 to globular-like disordered state. Myricetin and morin polyphenols form H-bonds with both peptide's carbonyl and amine groups whereas flavone makes H-bonds only with amine substitution. As a result, polyphenols are more efficient in destabilizing beta-sheet structures of peptide. Accordingly, the natural polyphenolic flavonoids are useful in forming stable Abeta17-42-flavonoid clusters to inhibit Abeta17-42 aggregation and these compounds could be an effective candidate for therapeutically targeting U-shape protofilaments' monomer in amyloid mature fibrils.
