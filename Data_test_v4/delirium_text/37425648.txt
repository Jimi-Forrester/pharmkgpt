37425648|t|Role of Estrogen Receptor alpha in Aging and Chronic Disease.
37425648|a|Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) plays a crucial role in reproductive function in both sexes. It also mediates cellular responses to estrogens in multiple nonreproductive organ systems, many of which regulate systemic metabolic homeostasis and inflammatory processes in mammals. The loss of estrogens and/or ERalpha agonism during aging is associated with the emergence of several comorbid conditions, particularly in females undergoing the menopausal transition. Emerging data also suggests that male mammals likely benefit from ERalpha agonism if done in a way that circumvents feminizing characteristics. This has led us, and others, to speculate that tissue-specific ERalpha agonism may hold therapeutic potential for curtailing aging and chronic disease burden in males and females that are at high-risk of cancer and/or cardiovascular events with traditional estrogen replacement therapies. In this mini-review, we emphasize the role of ERalpha in the brain and liver, summarizing recent evidence that indicates these two organs systems mediate the beneficial effects of estrogens on metabolism and inflammation during aging. We also discuss how 17alpha-estradiol administration elicits health benefits in an ERalpha-dependent manner, which provides proof-of-concept that ERalpha may be a druggable target for attenuating aging and age-related disease burden.
