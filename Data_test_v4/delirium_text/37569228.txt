37569228|a|We investigated the effects of different types of long-term fermented soybeans (traditionally made doenjang; TMD) on glucose and bone metabolism and memory function in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The rats were categorized into six groups: Control, cooked unfermented soybeans (CSB), and four TMDs based on Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and biogenic amine contents analyzed previously: high B. subtilis (HS) and high biogenic amines (HA; HSHA), low B. subtilis (LS) and HA (LSHA), HS and low biogenic amines (LA; HSLA), and LS and LA (LSLA). The rats in the CSB and TMD groups fed orally had a 4% high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Rats in the Control (OVX rats) and Normal-control (Sham-operated rats) groups did not consume CSB or TMD, although macronutrient contents were the same in all groups. Uterine weight and serum 17beta-estradiol concentrations were much lower in the Control than the Normal-control group, but CSB and TMD intake did not alter them regardless of B. subtilis and biogenic amine contents. HOMA-IR, a measure of insulin resistance, decreased with TMD with high B. subtilis (HSLA and HSHA) compared to the Control group. In OGTT and IPGTT, serum glucose concentrations at each time point were higher in the Control than in the Normal-control, and HSLA and HSHA lowered them. Memory function was preserved with HSHA and HSLA administration. Bone mineral density decline measured by DEXA analysis was prevented in the HSHA and HSLA groups. Bone metabolism changes were associated with decreased osteoclastic activity, parathyroid hormone levels, and osteoclastic activity-related parameters. Micro-CT results demonstrated that TMD, especially HSLA and HSHA, preserved bone structure in OVX rats. TMD also modulated the fecal bacterial community, increasing Lactobacillus, Ligalactobacillus, and Bacillus. In conclusion, through gut microbiota modulation, TMD, particularly with high B. subtilis content, acts as a synbiotic to benefit glucose, bone, and memory function in OVX rats. Further research is needed to make specific recommendations for B. subtilis-rich TMD for menopausal women.
