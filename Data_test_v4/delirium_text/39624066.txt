39624066|a|This comprehensive review explores the pivotal roles of glycation and oxidative stress in the aging process of the skin, emphasizing their targeted therapeutic applications in aesthetic and regenerative medicine, as well as anti-aging interventions. Glycation, a biochemical process involving the non-enzymatic attachment of sugars to proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids, culminates in the formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). These AGEs are significant contributors to aging and various chronic ailments, triggering oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, thereby manifesting as wrinkles, diminished skin elasticity, and other age-related dermal alterations. A central focus of this review is the synergistic interplay between Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and Trehalose in combating these aging mechanisms. HA, renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, assumes a pivotal role in modulating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels and safeguarding against oxidative damage. Concurrently, trehalose targets glycation and oxidative stress, exhibiting promising outcomes in augmenting skin health, providing Ultraviolet B (UVB) photoprotection, and manifesting notable anti-photoaging effects. The combined administration of HA and trehalose not only addresses existing skin damage but also confers preventive and reparative benefits, particularly in stabilizing HA and mitigating glycation-induced stress. Their synergistic action significantly enhances skin quality and mitigates inflammation. The implications of these findings are profound for the future of anti-aging therapeutics in aesthetic medicine, suggesting that the integration of HA and trehalose holds promise for revolutionary advancements in preserving skin vitality and health. Moreover this paper underscores the imperative for continued research into the combined efficacy of these compounds, advocating for innovative therapeutic modalities in aesthetic medicine and enhanced strategies for combating aging, glycation, and oxidative stress.
