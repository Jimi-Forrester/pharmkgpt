34299653|t|Multicomponent Crystal of Metformin and Barbital: Design, Crystal Structure Analysis and Characterization.
34299653|a|The formation of most multicomponent crystals relies on the interaction of hydrogen bonds between the components, so rational crystal design based on the expected hydrogen-bonded supramolecular synthons was employed to establish supramolecular compounds with desirable properties. This theory was put into practice for metformin to participate in more therapeutic fields to search for a fast and simple approach for the screening of candidate crystal co-formers. The prediction of intermolecular synthons facilitated the successful synthesis of a new multicomponent crystal of metformin (Met) and barbital (Bar) through an anion exchange reaction and cooling crystallization method. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the hydrogen bond-based ureide/ureide and guanidine/ureide synthons were responsible for the self-assembly of the primary structural motif and extended into infinite supramolecular heterocatemeric structures.
