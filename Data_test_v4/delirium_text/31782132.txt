31782132|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurodegeneration is the term describing the death of neurons both in the central nervous system and periphery. When affecting the central nervous system, it is responsible for diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other less frequent pathologies. There are several common pathophysiological elements that are shared in the neurodegenerative diseases. The common denominators are oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory responses. Unluckily, these conditions are difficult to treat. Because of the burden caused by the progression of these diseases and the simultaneous lack of efficacious treatment, therapeutic approaches that could target the interception of development of the neurodegeneration are being widely investigated. This review aims to highlight the most recent proposed novelties, as most of the previous approaches have failed. Therefore, older approaches may currently be used by healthcare professionals and are not being presented. METHODS: This review was based on an electronic search of existing literature, using PubMed as primary source for important review articles, and important randomized clinical trials, published in the last 5 years. Reference lists from the most recent reviews, as well as additional sources of primary literature and references cited by relevant articles, were used. RESULTS: Eighteen natural pharmaceutical substances and 24 extracted or recombinant products, and artificial agents that can be used against OS, inflammation, and neurodegeneration were identified. After presenting the most common neurodegenerative diseases and mentioning some of the basic mechanisms that lead to neuronal loss, this paper presents up to date information that could encourage the development of better therapeutic strategies. CONCLUSIONS: This review shares the new potential pharmaceutical and not pharmaceutical options that have been recently introduced regarding OS and inflammatory responses in neurodegenerative diseases.
