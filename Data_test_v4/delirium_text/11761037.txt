11761037|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients often exhibit deficits on conceptual implicit memory tests such as category exemplar generation and word association. However, these tests rely on word production abilities, which are known to be disrupted by AD. The current study assessed conceptual implicit memory performance in AD patients and elderly control participants using a conceptual priming task that did not require word production (i.e., semantic decision). Memory performance was also examined using a category exemplar generation test (i.e., a conceptual priming task that required word production) and a recognition memory test. AD patients exhibited deficits on the semantic decision task, the category exemplar generation task, and the recognition memory task. The results indicate that the conceptual memory deficits observed in AD patients cannot be attributed completely to word production difficulties.
