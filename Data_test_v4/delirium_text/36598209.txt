The present study aimed to reveal the potential deteriorations that may occur in the initial period of sensory processing in resting electroencephalography between children with subclinical hypothyroidism and a control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electroencephalographies of 15 children with subclinical hypothyroidism and 15 healthy children aged 10 to 17 years were recorded for 2 minutes for EC and 2 minutes for eyes-open conditions in resting state. Absolute electroencephalography band powers (muV2 ) within the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands were calculated in Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz electrodes, respectively, for eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. RESULTS: The results show that, although there was no noteworthy difference between the powers of the electroencephalography frequency bands of children with subclinical hypothyroidism and healthy children during the eyes-open condition, the alpha powers of the control group were significantly higher in all electrodes during the eyes-closed condition. Furthermore, the powers of all frequency bands were observed to decrease in the eyes-open condition in the control group. However, the same net decrease was not observed in the frequency powers of children with subclinical hypothyroidism. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, children with subclinical hypothyroidism may experience information processing impairments starting in the early stages of sensory processing.
