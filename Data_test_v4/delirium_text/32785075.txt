32785075|t|Alzheimer's Disease Mouse as a Model of Testis Degeneration.
32785075|a|Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide with protective functions in the central nervous system and various peripheral organs. PACAP has the highest expression level in the testes, among the peripheral organs, and has a positive regulative role in spermatogenesis and in sperm motility. In the present study, we explored testicular degenerative alterations in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J) and demonstrated changes in PACAP-regulated signaling pathways. In addition, the effects of increased physical activity of AD (trained AD (TAD)) mice on testis were also followed. Reduced cell number and decreased thickness of basement membrane were detected in AD samples. These changes were compensated by physical activity. Expression of PACAP receptors and canonical signaling elements such as PKA, P-PKA, PP2A significantly decreased in AD mice, and altered Sox transcription factor expression was also detected. Via this signaling mechanism, physical activity compensated the negative effects of AD on the expression of type IV collagen. Our findings suggest that the testes of AD mice can be a good model of testis degeneration. Moreover, it can be an appropriate organ to follow the effects of various interventions such as physical activity on tissue regeneration and signaling alterations.
