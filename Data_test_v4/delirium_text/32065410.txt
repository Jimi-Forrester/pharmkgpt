32065410|t|Delirium point prevalence studies in inpatient settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
32065410|a|AIMS: To examine the delirium point prevalence studies conducted in different inpatient settings and to discuss the implication of the findings for delirium screening, assessment, prevention and management. BACKGROUND: Delirium-a common and distressing condition manifesting as an acute decline of attention and cognition-is frequently overlooked, misdiagnosed or treated inappropriately. This neuropsychiatric syndrome manifests as changes in attention, cognition and awareness, with resultant impact on behaviour, function and emotions. Delirium is recognised as a patient management challenge in the inpatient setting, and there is a need to understand the current point prevalence and assessment practices of delirium. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic review of published delirium prevalence studies in inpatient settings was conducted and the implications of findings for delirium screening, assessment, prevention and management identified. The random-effects meta-analysis was conducted among studies measuring delirium point prevalence. The PRISMA statement was used to report systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review, with sample sizes ranging from 47-1867. Delirium point prevalence ranged from 9%-32%. Hypoactive delirium was the most common subtype, ranging from 23%-78%. Fifteen delirium screening tools or assessment or diagnostic methods were used. Comorbid dementia was present in up to 50% of inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Gaining a consensus on effective delirium instruments, the time windows for assessment and measurement will be crucial in driving benchmarking and quality improvement studies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Consistent identification of high-risk patients and treatment settings with elevated risk, accompanied by the implementation of effective preventive and management strategies, are critical to addressing delirium-a frequent and burdensome condition, that adversely affects patient outcomes.
