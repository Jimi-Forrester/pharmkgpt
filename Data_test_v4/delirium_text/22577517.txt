22577517|t|Drosophila Answers to TDP-43 Proteinopathies.
22577517|a|Initially implicated in the pathogenesis of CFTR and HIV-1 transcription, nuclear factor TDP-43 was subsequently found to be involved in the origin and development of several neurodegenerative diseases. In 2006, in fact, it was reported for the first time the cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive inclusions of ALS and FTLD patients, suggesting the presence of a shared underlying mechanism for these diseases. Today, different animal models of TDP-43 proteinopathies are available in rodents, nematodes, fishes, and flies. Although these models recapitulate several of the pathological features found in patients, the mechanisms underpinning the progressive neuronal loss observed in TDP-43 proteinopathies remain to be characterized. Compared to other models, Drosophila are appealing because they combine the presence of a sophisticated brain with the possibility to investigate quickly and massively phenotypic genetic modifiers as well as possible therapeutic strategies. At present, the development of TDP-43-related Drosophila models has further strengthened the hypothesis that both TDP-43 "loss-of-function" and "gain-of-function" mechanisms can contribute to disease. The aim of this paper is to describe and compare the results obtained in a series of transgenic and knockout flies, along with the information they have generated, towards a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathies.
