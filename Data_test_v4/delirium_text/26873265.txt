26873265|a|Dual inhibition of A2A and MAO-B is an emerging strategy in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, atom-based three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship (HQSAR) models were generated with benzothiazine and deazaxanthine derivatives. Based on activity against A2A and MAO-B, two statistically significant 3D-QSAR models (r2 = 0.96, q2 = 0.76 and r2 = 0.91, q2 = 0.63) and HQSAR models (r2 = 0.93, q2 = 0.68 and r2 = 0.97, q2 = 0.58) were developed. In an activity cliff analysis, structural outliers were identified by calculating the Mahalanobis distance for a pair of compounds with A2A and MAO-B inhibitory activities. The generated 3D-QSAR and HQSAR models, activity cliff analysis, molecular docking and dynamic studies for dual target protein inhibitors provide key structural scaffolds that serve as building blocks in designing drug-like molecules for neurodegenerative diseases.
