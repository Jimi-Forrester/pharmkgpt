33331023|t|Apathy Induced by Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
33331023|a|Apathy, the loss of motivation, is a common problem in Parkinson's disease (PD) and often observed following deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the occurrence of apathy following STN DBS in literature. Relevant articles were searched in PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of Sciences electronic databases. Studies were included if they reported apathy scores pre- and post-DBS or the cross-sectional difference between PD patients receiving STN DBS and patients receiving medication only. Thirty-three articles were included in the meta-analyses from 6,658 screened articles by two authors independently. A total of 1,286 patients were included with a mean age (+-standard deviation [SD]) of 58.4 +- 8.5 years and a disease duration of 11.0 +- 5.8 years. The apathy score measured by means of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS), and the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) was significantly higher after DBS than pre-operatively (g = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.19-0.48, P < 0.001). An equal, significant difference in severity of apathy was found between STN DBS and medication only (g = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.03-0.65; P = 0.004). Statistical heterogeneity was moderately high, but the effects stood strong after multiple analyses and were independent of tapering off dopaminergic medication. The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that apathy is increased after STN DBS compared to the pre-operative state and to medication only (systematic review registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019133932).   2020 Universiteit van Amsterdam.
