17878917|t|The prolyl isomerase PIN1: a pivotal new twist in phosphorylation signalling and disease.
17878917|a|Protein phosphorylation regulates many cellular processes by causing changes in protein conformation. The prolyl isomerase PIN1 has been identified as a regulator of phosphorylation signalling that catalyses the conversion of specific phosphorylated motifs between the two completely distinct conformations in a subset of proteins. PIN1 regulates diverse cellular processes, including growth-signal responses, cell-cycle progression, cellular stress responses, neuronal function and immune responses. In line with the diverse physiological roles of PIN1, it has also been linked to several diseases that include cancer, Alzheimer's disease and asthma, and thus it might represent a novel therapeutic target.
