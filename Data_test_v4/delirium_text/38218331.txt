38218331|t|The role of irisin in kidney diseases.
38218331|a|Irisin is a hormone that is produced mainly by skeletal muscles in response to exercise. It has been found to have a close correlation with obesity and diabetes mellitus for its energy expenditure and metabolic properties. Recent research has revealed that irisin also possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties, which make it associated with major chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), liver diseases, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer s disease. The identification of irisin has not only opened up new possibilities for monitoring metabolic and non-metabolic diseases but also presents a promising therapeutic target due to its multiple biological functions. Studies have shown that circulating irisin levels are lower in CKD patients than in non-CKD patients and decrease with increasing CKD stage. Furthermore, irisin also plays a role in many CKD-related complications like protein energy wasting (PEW), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). In this review, we present the current knowledge on the role of irisin in kidney diseases and their complications.
