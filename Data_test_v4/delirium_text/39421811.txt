39421811|a|Background/objectives: Saudi Arabia is experiencing a rapid increase in chronic diseases and disabilities. However, there is a dearth of research on these topics in the Arab world. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of multiple long-term chronic conditions (MLTCs) and disabilities and their relationship. Methods: The survey was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2023. Convenient sampling was used to select 324 participants aged 50 years and older, using data on disabilities status. The survey collected information on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), MLTCs or multi-morbidity, and activities of daily living (ADL). Disabilities was measured using Arabic versions of basic ADL and the Barthel index. Results: The prevalence of MLTCs among participants was 49.4%. The prevalence of disabilities measured using the ADL and Barthel index was 33.6 and 49.7%, respectively, and these rates increased by 42.5 and 58.1% among participants with MLTCs (n = 160). MLTCs were associated with an increased risk of disabilities using ADL [odds ratio (OR) 1.99, p = 0.037] and the Barthel index (OR 2.27, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Approximately half of the participants with disabilities data had MLTCs, and approximately a third to half had a disabilities. MLTCs were significantly associated with various types of disabilities among community-dwelling Saudi adults. Hence, strategies to reduce chronic diseases may result in a reduction in disabilities, and vice versa.
