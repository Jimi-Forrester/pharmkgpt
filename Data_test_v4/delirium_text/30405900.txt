30405900|t|Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between the APOE Gene and the Onset of Parkinson's Disease Dementia.
30405900|a|PURPOSE: To clarify the relationship between certain genotypes or alleles of the APOE gene and the onset risk of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched to identify all case-control studies and cohort studies published before October 30, 2017, that investigated the association between the APOE gene and the onset of PDD. Manual information retrieval was also performed. All studies that met the quality requirements were included in a meta-analysis performed using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 17 studies, with a total of 820 patients in the PDD group and 1,922 in the non-PDD group. The influence of the APOE gene on PDD onset was analyzed from three aspects: five genotypes vs. epsilon3/3, epsilon2+/epsilon4+ vs. epsilon3/3, and epsilon4+ vs. epsilon4-. The risk factors for PDD may include the genotypes epsilon3/4 (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14-1.89) and epsilon4/4 (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.20-7.14). In patients with PDD, there was no significant difference in the distribution of epsilon2+ vs. epsilon3/3 (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.97-1.87, P=0.07). The risk of PDD was 1.61 times greater in epsilon4+ compared with epsilon3/3 (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.24-2.08, P=0.0003). As the results indicated that epsilon2+ did not play a role as a risk factor or a protective factor, we divided the population into epsilon4+ and epsilon4- for the meta-analysis and found that, among patients with Parkinson's disease, the dementia risk of those with epsilon4+ was 1.72 times greater than that of those with epsilon4- (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.41-2.10, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis in accordance with different geographical regions revealed that epsilon4+ was a risk factor for PDD in people from all regions. CONCLUSIONS: Among the APOE genotypes, epsilon2+ is neither a risk factor nor a protective factor for PDD, while epsilon4+ is a risk factor for PDD. The present results are applicable to Asian, European, and American patients with Parkinson's disease. Regarding the single APOE genotypes, epsilon3/4 and epsilon4/4 may be risk factors for PDD; however, further studies with large sample sizes are needed to verify this.
