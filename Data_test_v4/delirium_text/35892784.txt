35892784|t|Effect of Coffee on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Immortalized Human Oral Keratinocytes.
35892784|a|Periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease that is strongly influenced by dietary habits. Coffee is one of the most common dietary components; however, current research on the relationship between coffee consumption and periodontitis, as well as its underlying mechanisms, is limited. Based on a previous report, caffeine (CA) and chlorogenic acid (CGA) were formulated into artificial coffee (AC) for this experiment. Cell viability, prostaglandin E2 release, Western blotting, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation analyses were performed to explore the effects of AC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immortalized human oral keratinocytes (IHOKs) and elucidate their underlying mechanisms. AC pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory mediator release, ROS production, and nuclear factor kappa B translocation in IHOKs. CA and CGA promoted AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and down-regulated the nuclear factor-kappaB pathways to exert anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, CGA promoted Nrf2 translocation and heme oxygenase-1 expression and showed anti-oxidative effects. Furthermore, AC, CA, and CGA components showed synergistic effects. Thus, we predict that coffee consumption may be beneficial for alleviating periodontitis. Moreover, the main coffee components CA and CGA seem to play a synergistic role in periodontitis.
