38953087|t|From the Intensive Care Unit to Recovery: Managing Post-intensive Care Syndrome in Critically Ill Patients.
38953087|a|Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is the term used to describe the decline in the physical, cognitive, and/or mental condition of individuals who have been discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). This complication could result in a significant reduction in quality of life, with some patients experiencing symptoms of prolonged weakness, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Intensive care advancement over the years has resulted in an increase in ICU survival rates and a proportional increase in PICS, creating a need for more in-depth research into the prevention and management of the disease. Hence, this study aims to examine the present body of literature on PICS, encompassing its underlying physiological processes and elements that contribute to its development, methods for evaluating and diagnosing the condition, current treatment choices as well as potential new approaches, and the constraints in managing PICS and the necessity for further investigation. In this article, studies were compiled from several databases, including, but not limited to, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. These studies were reviewed, and their data were used to highlight important aspects regarding the efficacy of current PICS screening tools, the optimization and limitations of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment methods, and the feasibility and safety of emerging treatments and technologies. The major conclusions of this review were centered around the need for multidisciplinary management of PICS. From pharmacological management using analgesia to non-pharmacological management using early mobilization and exercise therapy, the effective treatment of PICS requires a multifaceted approach. Patient follow-up and its importance were touched upon, including strategies and policies to bolster proper follow-up, thereby increasing favorable outcomes. Lastly, the importance of family involvement and the increased need for research into this topic were highlighted.
