36011655|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to explore the difference between the indexes of neuro-emotion between the cognitively normal elderly (CNE) and cognitively impaired elderly (CIE) while viewing the Ardisia mamillata Hance with red fruit (F) and without red fruit (NF) to determine which kind of the Ardisia mamillata Hance would be more beneficial to the participants' neuro-emotions. METHODS: Nine CNE individuals and nine CIE individuals, ranging in age from 80-90 years old, participated in this study and signed the informed consent form before beginning the experiment. Six mood indicators (engagement, excitement, focus, interest, relaxation, and stress) were measured by an EEG headset during the participants' viewing of the NF, F, and NF + F. RESULTS: For the CNE group, their engagement, excitement, and focus values were the lowest, while their interest value was the highest when they view the NF + F; therefore, we obtain the results that the combination of NF + F was the most beneficial to their EEG emotions. For the CIE group, the combination of NF + F increased their interest score, but decreased their focus score, which indicated that the NF + F was the most beneficial to their neuro-emotions. CONCLUSIONS: This study concluded that the combination of plants with and without fruits was most beneficial to the neural emotions of both groups of elderly people. Especially for the CIE, plants with larger and warmer colors, such as yellow, red, and orange fruits, should be considered for installation indoors or outdoors, as this would be better for their emotional well-being.
