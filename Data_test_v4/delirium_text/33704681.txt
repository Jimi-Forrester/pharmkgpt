33704681|a|INTRODUCTION: Previous evidence demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia consumed substantial healthcare resources in an integrated healthcare system. This study evaluated the impact of initiating once-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP1M) on healthcare resource utilization (HRU) among patients with schizophrenia treated in a US integrated healthcare system. METHODS: This retrospective study used electronic medical records from Atrium Health. Adults with at least two diagnoses of schizophrenia who received an initial PP1M dose between September 2009 and April 2019 (the corresponding date defined the index date) and at least one subsequent dose within 90 days were included. Additionally, patients were required to have received active care (at least one healthcare visit every 6 months) during 12-month pre- and post-index periods and at least one oral antipsychotic prescription during the 12-month pre-index period. Inpatient, emergency room (ER), and outpatient visits were compared over 12-month pre- versus post-index periods within the same cohort using McNemar's and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Findings were reported for all patients and separately in patients with at least one schizophrenia relapse (schizophrenia-related inpatient or ER visit) during the 12-month pre-index period. RESULTS: The study cohort included 210 patients (mean age 34.2 years, 69.5% male, 39.1% had Medicaid). From the 12-month pre- to post-index period, the proportion of patients with visits and mean number of visits reduced for all-cause inpatient (67.6% to 22.4%, 1.2 to 0.4), 30-day readmission (12.4% to 2.4%, 0.2 to 0.1), and ER (68.6% to 45.7%, 2.3 to 1.2) visits, whereas the mean number of outpatient visits increased (8.7 to 11.6) (all P < 0.05). Similar trends were observed for mental health- and schizophrenia-related HRU. The trends in HRU in patients with prior relapse were similar with a higher extent of reduction in inpatient and ER use compared to the overall cohort. CONCLUSION: Initiation of PP1M was associated with reduced acute HRU in patients with schizophrenia, indicating potential clinical and economic benefits, especially in patients with prior relapse.
