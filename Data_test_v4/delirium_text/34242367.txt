34242367|a|Although the global tobacco market of cigarillos is substantial, little is known about their particulate matter (PM) emissions. For exposure risk assessment of cigarillos, the PM fractions PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 of eight cigarillo brands (four with filters) and a reference cigarette were measured. For this purpose, second-hand smoke was generated by an automatic smoke pump in a measuring chamber with a volume of 2.88 m3. The mean particle concentrations of the cigarillos ranged from 2783 mug/m3 to 6686 mug/m3 for PM10, from 2767 mug/m3 to 6585 mug/m3 for PM2.5, and from 2441 to 4680 mug/m3 for PM1. Mean concentrations of the reference cigarette for PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 were 4400 mug/m3, 4335 mug/m3, and 3289 mug/m3, respectively. Filter-tipped cigarillos showed between 5% and 38% lower PM10 and PM2.5 levels, respectively, and between 4% and 30% lower PM1 levels. Our findings show generally high PM emissions for all investigated tobacco products. Therefore, the declaration of PM amounts to government authorities should be mandatory for all tobacco products. Policymakers should ensure that corresponding information will be provided in the future.
