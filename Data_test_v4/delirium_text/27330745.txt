27330745|a|BACKGROUND: Recent genetic association studies have linked the cadherin-based adherens junction protein alpha-T-catenin (alphaT-cat, CTNNA3) with the development of autism. Where alphaT-cat is expressed in the brain, and how its loss could contribute to this disorder, are entirely unknown. METHODS: We used the alphaT-cat knockout mouse to examine the localization of alphaT-cat in the brain, and we used histology and immunofluorescence analysis to examine the neurobiological consequences of its loss. RESULTS: We found that alphaT-cat comprises the ependymal cell junctions of the ventricles of the brain, and its loss led to compensatory upregulation of alphaE-cat expression. Notably, alphaT-cat was not detected within the choroid plexus, which relies on cell junction components common to typical epithelial cells. While alphaT-cat was not detected in neurons of the cerebral cortex, it was abundantly detected within neuronal structures of the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Although alphaT-cat loss led to no overt differences in cerebral or cerebellar structure, RNA-sequencing analysis from wild type versus knockout cerebella identified a number of disease-relevant signaling pathways associated with alphaT-cat loss, such as GABA-A receptor activation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise the possibility that the genetic associations between alphaT-cat and autism may be due to ependymal and cerebellar defects, and highlight the potential importance of a seemingly redundant adherens junction component to a neurological disorder.
