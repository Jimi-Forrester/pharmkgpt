36408360|t|Efficacy of Early Cardiac Rehabilitation After Cardiac Surgery - Verification Using Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination Data.
36408360|a|Background: The current status of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after cardiac surgery and the introduction of early CR (E-CR) in Japan are not fully understood. In this study, the current status of E-CR and its efficacy were investigated by the Academic Committee of the Japanese Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation. Methods and Results: We examined the rate of introduction of E-CR and its effects among 220,122 patients who underwent major cardiac and thoracic vascular surgery, as registered in the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) classification system, between April 2012 and March 2018. In this study, E-CR was defined as CR starting within 1 day after surgery. Patients with and without E-CR were propensity score matched and analyzed for clinical outcomes. Of all patients participating in CR after surgery, E-CR was initiated in 52.1%, 56.9%, 47.4%, and 54.1% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, aortic surgery, and other cardiovascular surgery, respectively. After propensity score matching, outcomes for E-CR were significantly superior to non-E-CR in terms of in-hospital deaths, Barthel Index score at discharge, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization costs. Conclusions: E-CR after cardiac surgery was effective in terms of prognosis, hospital stay, and medical costs. This study is the first report using big data in Japan. The results indicate that further introduction of E-CR needs to be recommended in the future.
