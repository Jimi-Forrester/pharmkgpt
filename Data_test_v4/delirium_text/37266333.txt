37266333|a|Introduction: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the field is still lacking a specific biomarker for its core pathology: alpha synuclein (alpha-syn). Realtime quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) has recently emerged as a strong biomarker candidate to detect misfolded alpha-syn in DLB. However, the variability in the parameters of the technique and the heterogeneity of DLB patients make the reproducibility of the results difficult. Here, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research of alpha-syn RT-QuIC in DLB focused on: (1) the capacity of alpha-syn RT-QuIC to discriminate DLB from controls, Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD; (2) the capacity of alpha-syn RT-QuIC to identify prodromal stages of DLB; and (3) the influence of co-pathologies on alpha-syn RT-QuIC's performance. We also assessed the influence of different factors, such as technical conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, shaking-rest cycles), sample type, and clinical diagnosis versus autopsy confirmation. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines in August 2022, without any limits in publication dates. Search terms were combinations of "RT-QuIC" and "Lewy Bodies," "DLB" or "LBD". Results: Our meta-analysis shows that alpha-syn RT-QuIC reaches very high diagnostic performance in discriminating DLB from both controls (pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.96, respectively) and AD (pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.95 and 0.88) and is promising for prodromal phases of DLB. However, the performance of alpha-syn RT-QuIC to discriminate DLB from PD is currently low due to low specificity (pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.11). Our analysis showed that alpha-syn RT-QuIC's performance is not substantially influenced by sample type or clinical diagnosis versus autopsy confirmation. Co-pathologies did not influence the performance of alpha-syn RT-QuIC, but the number of such studies is currently limited. We observed technical variability across published articles. However, we could not find a clear effect of technical variability on the reported results. Conclusion: There is currently enough evidence to test misfolded alpha-syn by RT-QuIC for clinical use. We anticipate that harmonization of protocols across centres and advances in standardization will facilitate the clinical establishment of misfolded alpha-syn detection by RT-QuIC.
