34605337|a|Background and purpose - Gaining experience in the surgery room during residency is an important part of learning the skills needed to perform arthroplasties. However, in practice, patients are often not fully comfortable with trainee involvement in their own surgery. Therefore, we investigated complications, revision rates, mortality, and operative time of orthopedic surgeons and residents as primary surgeon performing total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) or total hip arthroplasties (THAs).Patients and methods - In this multi-center retrospective cohort study, 3,098 TKAs and 4,027 THAs performed between 2007 and 2013 were analyzed. Complications, revisions, mortality, and operative time were compared for patients operated on by the orthopedic surgeon or a resident as primary surgeon. An additional analysis was performed to determine whether the complication risk was affected by the postgraduate year of the resident.Results - Orthopedic complication rates were similar (TKA: orthopedic surgeon: 10%, resident: 11%; THA: 9% and 8%), revision rates (TKA: 3% and 2%, THA: 3% and 2%), or mortality rates (TKA: 0.1% and 0.3%, THA: 0.2% and 0.3%). For both procedures a higher non-orthopedic complication rate was found in the resident group (TKA: 8% and 10%; p = 0.03, THA: 8% and 10%; p = 0.01) and a slightly longer operative time (TKA: mean difference 9.0 minutes (8%); THA: 11.3 minutes (11%)).Interpretation - Complications, revisions, and mortality were similar in TKAs or THAs performed by the resident as primary surgeon compared with surgeries performed by an orthopedic surgeon. This data can be used in teaching hospitals and may help to reassure patients.
