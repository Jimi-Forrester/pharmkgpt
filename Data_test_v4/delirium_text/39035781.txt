39035781|a|Important health differences exist in the context of international migration and residential mobility. Less is known about health differences regarding the medium-distance level of internal migration. This study examines life expectancy gaps between internal movers and stayers in the Netherlands and their underlying processes by assessing the contribution of different causes of death by age and sex. It uses individually-linked death counts and population exposures extracted from population registers, covering the native Dutch population aged 10+ from 2015 to 2019. The pooled data were disaggregated by causes-of-death group (neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, lifestyle-related mortality, external causes, and other causes), internal migrant status (movers and stayers, based on past 10-year residence in the 40 NUTS-3 [Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, level 3] regions), age, and sex. Comparing movers and stayers, we computed life expectancy at age 10 (e10), age- and cause-specific mortality risks, and applied decomposition methods to assess contributions of causes of death to e10 gaps. In the Netherlands in 2015-2019, e10 was lower for movers between NUTS-3 regions than stayers (males: 2.49 years; females: 3.51 years), due to excess mortality for movers at most ages. Movers only had a lower mortality than stayers at younger working ages (males: ages 20-44; females: ages 20-34). Mortality from neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases were the largest contributors to the e10 gap, especially at ages 75+ and for females. Mortality from lifestyle-related and external causes of death contributed less, with the largest contributions for females aged 75-89 and males aged 45-69. The lower e10 of movers in the Netherlands is likely explained by health selection effects-in particular care-related moves as coping behaviour-rather than by causal effects through risk accumulation. Research focusing on regional or spatial heterogeneity of the mover-stayer health gap would be insightful to further understand these processes.
