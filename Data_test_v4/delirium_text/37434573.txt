AIM: To provide an overview of current knowledge on clinical presentation, risk factors, prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders after COVID-19. METHOD: PRISMA literature search. RESULTS: Anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms are common after COVID-19. Cognitive symptoms are also very common and appear to be persistent, while data on risk factors to develop these symptoms is scarce. Women and patients after ICU admission, delirium or with somatic comorbidities have a higher risk of developing post COVID psychiatric symptoms. Vaccination may have a protective effect. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on effective treatment strategies for COVID-19-related neurocognitive symptoms. CONCLUSION: More research on risk factors, identification and especially effective treatment options for neuropsychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 is needed. In the meantime, guidelines on disorders with a similar clinical presentation could potentially play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms after COVID-19.
