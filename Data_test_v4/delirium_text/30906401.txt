30906401|t|Prospective Memory Loss and Related White Matter Changes in Patients with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.
30906401|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prospective memory (PM) has a known relationship with frontal function, and PM decline has been observed in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Cerebral small vessel disease, as evidenced by white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), is linked to frontal dysfunction. This study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between PM decline and WMHs in patients with aMCI. METHODS: Of 74 enrollees with aMCI, 69 completed this prospective study. We compared total scores and sub-scores of the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) administered at baseline and 3 months later, stratifying patients by degree of WMHs. RESULTS: A significant decline was seen in PRMQ total scores and PM scores at the 3-month mark in patients with moderate (vs. mild) degrees of WMHs (-2.8+-7.2 vs. 0.2+-7.1; p=0.032). In addition, patients with moderate (vs. mild) degrees of deep WMHs (DWMHs) showed greater PM decline, whereas PM loss in patients with mild, moderate, or severe degrees of periventricular WMHs (PVWMHs) did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study indicate that the burden of WMHs is consistently implicated in PM deterioration experienced by patients with aMCI, and signifies greater PM decline, especially in instances of extensive DWMHs. Greater attention to the change of PM is therefore needed in aMCI patients with WMHs.
