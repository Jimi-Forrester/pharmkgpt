While recruiting older SA adults into a brain health study, we encountered unexpected hesitancy toward structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis and stigmatizing attitudes related to internal locus of control (LoC) for future dementia risks. We hypothesized that support for MRI-related research was influenced by these attitudes as well as personal MRI experience, perceived MRI safety, and concerns for personal risk for future dementia/stroke. METHODS: We developed a brief cross-sectional survey to assess older adults' MRI experiences and perceptions, desire to learn of six incidental findings of increasing impact on health, and attitudes related to dementia (including LoC) and research participation. We recruited a convenience sample of 256 respondents (74% reporting as 50+) from the New Jersey/New York City area to complete the survey (offered in English, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish) and modeled the proportional odds (PO) for favorable attitudes toward research activities. RESULTS: Seventy-seven SA and 84 EA respondents were analyzed alongside 95 White, Black, or Hispanic adults. White (PO = 2.54, p = 0.013) and EA (PO = 2.14, p = 0.019) respondents were both more likely than SA respondents to endorse healthy volunteers' participation in research, and the difference between White and SA respondents was mediated by the latter's greater internal LoC for dementia risks. EA respondents had more worries for future dementia/stroke than SA respondents (p = 0.006) but still shared SA respondents' lower wish (measured by proportion of total) to learn of incidental MRI findings. DISCUSSION: SA-and EA compared to SA-older adults had low desire to learn of incidental MRI findings but had different attitudes toward future dementia/stroke risks. A culturally appropriate protocol to disclose incidental MRI findings may improve SA and EA participation in brain health research. Highlights: Older Asian Americans have limited interest in incidental findings on research MRISouth Asians are most likely to attribute dementia to people's own behaviorsSouth Asians' attitudes mediate lower support for healthy volunteers in researchSouth and East Asians differ in dementia worries and research-related attitudes.
