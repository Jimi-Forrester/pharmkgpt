37999238|t|Metabolomics Analysis of Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) Therapy in a Phase I Clinical Trial of Septic Shock: An Exploratory Study.
37999238|a|Sepsis is the result of an uncontrolled host inflammatory response to infection that may lead to septic shock with multiorgan failure and a high mortality rate. There is an urgent need to improve early diagnosis and to find markers identifying those who will develop septic shock and certainly a need to develop targeted treatments to prevent septic shock and its high mortality. Herein, we explore metabolic alterations due to mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) treatment of septic shock. The clinical findings for this study were already reported; MSC therapy was well-tolerated and safe in patients in this phase I clinical trial. In this exploratory metabolomics study, 9 out of 30 patients received an escalating dose of MSC treatment, while 21 patients were without MSC treatment. Serum metabolomics profiling was performed to detect and characterize metabolite changes due to MSC treatment and to help determine the sample size needed for a phase II clinical trial and to define a metabolomic response to MSC treatment. Serum metabolites were measured using 1H-NMR and HILIC-MS at times 0, 24 and 72 h after MSC infusion. The results demonstrated the significant impact of MSC treatment on serum metabolic changes in a dose- and time-dependent manner compared to non-MSC-treated septic shock patients. This study suggests that plasma metabolomics can be used to assess the response to MSC therapy and that treatment-related metabolomics effects can be used to help determine the sample size needed in a phase II trial. As this study was not powered to detect outcome, how the treatment-induced metabolomic changes described in this study of MSC-treated septic shock patients are related to outcomes of septic shock in the short and long term will need to be explored in a larger adequately powered phase II clinical trial.
