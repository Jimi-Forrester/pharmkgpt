17610161|a|INTRODUCTION: Visual perception disorders are frequent in degenerative diseases with posterior cerebral lobe involvement, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main aim of this study is to create a Perception Digital Test (PDT) based on the treatment of digital photographs, and to present normative values in the elderly Spanish population. The second objective is to validate the test in a group of patients with mild AD, stage 4 in the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (AD-4). SUBJECTS: The group were constituted by 86 healthy controls (CTR) and 27 AD patients. METHOD: VPT, which was formed by 15 items with four options of answer, was administered to all subjects. RESULTS: Mean time of administration of PDT in CTR was 85 seconds (standard desviation: 33). Mean result obtained for each groups was significantly different (CTR: 13.5 [1.4]; AD-4: 10.6 (2.9); p = 0.05). Age did not significantly influence PDT performance in any of the groups. However, years of education influenced significantly the CTR group score. CONCLUSION: PDT is an easy, quick and sensitive test to assess visual perception disorders in initial AD.
