37894774|t|The Role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Microbiota-Gut-Brain Cross-Talk with a Focus on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review.
37894774|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to progressive motor function decline. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment, and its increasing prevalence is linked to an aging population, improved diagnostics, heightened awareness, and changing lifestyles. In the gastrointestinal system, the gut microbiota plays a vital role in producing metabolites, neurotransmitters, and immune molecules. Short-chain fatty acids, of interest for their potential health benefits, are influenced by a fiber- and plant-based diet, promoting a diverse and balanced gut microbiome. These fatty acids impact the body by binding to receptors on enteroendocrine cells, influencing hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which regulate appetite and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, these fatty acids impact the blood-brain barrier, neurotransmitter levels, and neurotrophic factors, and directly stimulate vagal afferent nerves, affecting gut-brain communication. The vagus nerve is a crucial link between the gut and the brain, transmitting signals related to appetite, inflammation, and various processes. Dysregulation of this pathway can contribute to conditions like obesity and irritable bowel syndrome. Emerging evidence suggests the complex interplay among these fatty acids, the gut microbiota, and environmental factors influences neurodegenerative processes via interconnected pathways, including immune function, anti-inflammation, gut barrier, and energy metabolism. Embracing a balanced, fiber-rich diet may foster a diverse gut microbiome, potentially impacting neurodegenerative disease risk. Comprehensive understanding requires further research into interventions targeting the gut microbiome and fatty acid production and their potential therapeutic role in neurodegeneration.
