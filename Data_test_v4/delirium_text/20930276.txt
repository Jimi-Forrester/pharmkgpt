20930276|t|PLA2G3, a gene involved in oxidative stress induced death, is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
20930276|a|Oxidative stress, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Studies in neuronal cells subjected to oxidative stress, mimicking such stress in AD brains, are therefore of great interest. PLA2G3 is the most overexpressed gene in a human neuronal model of oxidative stress induced by the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X-XOD) system, which provokes apoptotic cell death. In this work, we describe that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of X-XOD induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample. The capacity to respond to oxidative stress may therefore modulate the risk of AD, and PLA2G3 is a potential target to regulate neuronal damage induced by free radicals.
