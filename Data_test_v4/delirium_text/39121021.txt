39121021|t|Could Mushrooms' Secondary Metabolites Ameliorate Alzheimer Disease? A Computational Flexible Docking Investigation.
39121021|a|Herein, we highlight the significance of molecular modeling approaches prior to in vitro and in vivo studies; particularly, in diseases with no recognized treatments such as neurological abnormalities. Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes irreversible cognitive decline. Toxicity and ADMET studies were conducted using the Qikprop platform in Maestro software and Discovery Studio 2.0, respectively, to select the promising skeletons from more than 45 reviewed compounds isolated from mushrooms in the last decade. Using rigid and flexible molecular docking approaches such as induced fit docking (IFD) in the binding sites of beta-secretase (BACE1) and acetylcholine esterase (ACHE), promising structures were screened through high precision molecular docking compared with standard drugs donepezil and (2E)-2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one (OKK) using Maestro and Cresset Flare platforms. Molecular interactions, binding distances, and RMSD values were measured to reveal key interactions at the binding sites of the two neurodegenerative enzymes. Analysis of IFD results revealed consistent bindings of dictyoquinazol A and gensetin I in the pocket of 4ey7 while inonophenol A, ganomycin, and fornicin fit quite well in 4dju demonstrating binding poses very close to native ligands at ACHE and BACE1. Respective key amino acid contacts manifested the least steric problems according to their Gibbs free binding energies, Glide XP scores, RMSD values, and molecular orientation respect to the key amino acids. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed our findings and prospected these compounds to show significant in vitro results in their future pharmacological studies.
