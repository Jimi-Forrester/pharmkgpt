3486961|t|Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and multiple infarct dementia by tomographic imaging of iodine-123 IMP.
3486961|a|Tomographic imaging of the brain was performed using a rotating slant hole collimator and [123I]N-isopropyl p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) in normal subjects (n = 6) and patients with either Alzheimer's disease (n = 5) or multiple infarct dementia (n = 3). Four blinded observers were asked to make a diagnosis from the images. Normal subjects and patients with multiple infarct dementia were correctly identified. Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed in three of the five patients with this disease. One patient with early Alzheimer's disease was classified as normal by two of the four observers. Another patient with Alzheimer's disease had an asymmetric distribution of IMP and was incorrectly diagnosed as multiple infarct dementia by all four observers. Limited angle tomography of the cerebral distribution of 123I appears to be a useful technique for the evaluation of demented patients.
