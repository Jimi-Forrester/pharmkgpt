37095162|t|Central role for neurally dysregulated IL-17A in dynamic networks of systemic and local inflammation in combat casualties.
37095162|a|Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) and Dynamic Hypergraphs (DyHyp) were used to define protein-level inflammatory networks at the local (wound effluent) and systemic circulation (serum) levels from 140 active-duty, injured service members (59 with TBI and 81 non-TBI). Interleukin (IL)-17A was the only biomarker elevated significantly in both serum and effluent in TBI vs. non-TBI casualties, and the mediator with the most DyNA connections in TBI wounds. DyNA combining serum and effluent data to define cross-compartment correlations suggested that IL-17A bridges local and systemic circulation at late time points. DyHyp suggested that systemic IL-17A upregulation in TBI patients was associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while IL-17A downregulation in non-TBI patients was associated with interferon-gamma. Correlation analysis suggested differential upregulation of pathogenic Th17 cells, non-pathogenic Th17 cells, and memory/effector T cells. This was associated with reduced procalcitonin in both effluent and serum of TBI patients, in support of an antibacterial effect of Th17 cells in TBI patients. Dysregulation of Th17 responses following TBI may drive cross-compartment inflammation following combat injury, counteracting wound infection at the cost of elevated systemic inflammation.
