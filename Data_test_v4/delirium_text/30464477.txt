30464477|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain signifies a major pathological change of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extracorporeal blood Abeta removal system (E-BARS) has been under development as a tool for enhancing the clearance of Abeta from the brain. Previously, we revealed that dialyzers remove blood Abetas effectively, evoking substantial Abeta influx into the blood during hemodialysis sessions as one form of blood Abeta removal by E-BARS, and that postmortem brains of hemodialysis patients exhibited lower Abeta accumulation. Here, we present a case report of a 77-year-old male patient with end-stage renal failure whose Abeta accumulation in the brain declined by initiating and continuing hemodialysis for 6 months. This report suggests that blood Abeta removal by E-BARS could be an effective therapeutic method for AD.
