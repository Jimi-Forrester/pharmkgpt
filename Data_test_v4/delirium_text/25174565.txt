We aimed to evaluate frequency and clinicoradiological profile of AD patients with multiple microbleeds (MBs). METHODS: We reviewed clinical records and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with probable AD diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria from 2009 to 2012. Brain MRI was performed at 1.5-T superconducting system, including T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging. MBs were defined as rounded, hypointense foci less than or equal to 10 mm in size in the brain parenchyma. MBs topography was divided into the lobar (L) and the deep/infratentorial (D/I) region. Multiple MBs were defined as the number greater than or equal to 8 in the L and the D/I territory, respectively. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were assessed using the age-related white matter changes scale. Clinicoradiological findings were examined for 1 year. Prevalence and clinicoradiological profiles were studied in patients with multiple L or D/I MBs. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty patients (238 men and 312 women) participated in the present study. Mean age (standard deviation) was 78.4 (7.7) years, 78.3 (8.1) years in men and 78.6 (7.5) years in women. A total of 132 patients (55 men and 78 women) had at least 1 MB. Prevalence of MB >= 1 was 24%, 23 in men and 25 in women. The ratio of L and D/I MBs were 1.1, .6 in men and 1.8 in women. Multiple MBs were detected in 93 patients (17%), 38 (16%) men and 55 (17%) in women. L distribution was found in 49 patients (9%), 15 men (6%) and 34 women (11%), and D/I distribution in 44 patients (8%), 23 men (10%) and 21 women (7%). Multiple L MBs was associated with faster progression of dementia, cerebral hemorrhage, and increased number of MBs. Multiple D/I MBs were linked to hypertension and WMH scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that the prevalence of multiple MBs was 17% in Japanese AD patients. The clinicoradiological profile suggested severe degree of CAA in patients with multiple L MBs (9%) and hypertension and aged changes in patients with multiple D/I MBs (8%). T2*-weighted imaging is a useful tool for evaluating degree of CAA and hypertensive vascular changes. We should pay more attention to management and care in AD patients with multiple MBs.
