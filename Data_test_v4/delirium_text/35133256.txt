35133256|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore communication and engagement in everyday situations between persons with young-onset dementia (YOD) living in a nursing home (NH) and the caregivers. METHODS: The study draws on ethnographic methods aligned with participatory design. Three residents with YOD living in a NH and eight staff members were recruited. A narrative approach was used for data collection and analysis. FINDINGS: Three narrative vignettes were developed representing everyday situations in which communication and engagement was enacted among residents and caregiver staff: (a) waiting for something to happen, (b) tensions about everyday communication, and (c) negotiating a combined living + working environment. The findings stress a paradoxical tension rooted in the NH as residence and workplace as well as place of calm and place of boredom. The everyday situations are interpreted differently from the perspective of the residents and staff. CONCLUSION: The identified paradox of planned and spontaneous situations influences communication and engagement in everyday life, and the potentiality for active engagement embedded in contexts of units for residents with YOD. The degree to which everyday activities and encounters are redefined and renegotiated is an important part of caregiving practices in NH settings for residents with YOD.
