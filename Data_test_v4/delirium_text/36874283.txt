36874283|t|Coercion in intensive care, an insufficiently explored issue-a scoping review of qualitative narratives of patient's experiences.
36874283|a|Purpose: The use of coercion, in a clinical context as imposing a measure against a patient's opposition or declared will, can occur in various forms in intensive care units (ICU). One prime example of a formal coercive measure in the ICU is the use of restraints, which are applied for patients' own safety. Through a database search, we sought to evaluate patient experiences related to coercive measures. Results: For this scoping review, clinical databases were searched for qualitative studies. A total of nine were identified that fulfilled the inclusion and the CASP criteria. Common themes emerging from the studies on patient experiences included communication issues, delirium, and emotional reactions. Statements from patients revealed feelings of compromised autonomy and dignity that came with a loss of control. Physical restraints were only one concrete manifestation of formal coercion as perceived by patients in the ICU setting. Conclusion: There are few qualitative studies focusing on patient experiences of formal coercive measures in the ICU. In addition to the experience of restricted physical movement, the perception of loss of control, loss of dignity, and loss of autonomy suggests that restraining measures are just one element in a setting that may be perceived as informal coercion.
