36555651|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are next-generation treatment in degenerative diseases. For the application of mesenchymal stem cell therapy to degenerative disease, transplantation conditions (e.g., optimized dose, delivery route and regenerating efficacy) should be considered. Recently, researchers have studied the mode of action of MSC in the treatment of ovarian degenerative disease. However, the evidence for the optimal number of cells for the developing stem cell therapeutics is insufficient. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy in ovarian dysfunction, depends on cell dose. By intraovarian transplantation of low (1 x 105) and high (5 x 105) doses of placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PD-MSCs) into thioacetamide (TAA)-injured rats, we compared the levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress that depend on different cell doses. Apoptosis and oxidative stress were significantly decreased in the transplanted (Tx) group compared to the non-transplanted (NTx) group in ovarian tissues from TAA-injured rats (* p < 0.05). In addition, we confirmed that follicular development was significantly increased in the Tx groups compared to the NTx group (* p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the apoptosis, antioxidant or follicular development of injured ovarian tissues between the low and high doses PD-MSCs group. These findings provide new insights into the understanding and evidence obtained from clinical trials for stem cell therapy in reproductive systems.
