39679133|a|Objective: To investigate the effect of sodium bicarbonate Ringer's solution (BRS) on the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx components in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery, and to evaluate its impact on endothelial glycocalyx preservation and postoperative recovery. Patients and Methods: A total of eight patients scheduled for elective CPB heart surgery were included and randomly divided into two groups: the sodium lactate Ringer's solution (LRS) group and the BRS group. ELISA was used to measure plasma concentrations of syndecan-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta at predefined time points: T0 (before induction of anesthesia), T3 (immediately after weaning from CPB), T5 and T6 (24 and 72 hours postoperatively). Serum creatinine concentrations were measured within 48 hours postoperatively. The incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) was assessed three days after surgery. Postoperative mechanical ventilation time, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital stay were also documented. Results: The BRS group had significantly lower plasma concentrations of syndecan-1 at T3 (7.98 [7.43, 8.92] ng/mL vs 9.54 [8.4, 10.73] ng/mL, P < 0.001) and T5 (4.20 [3.31, 4.96] ng/mL vs 5.40 [3.95, 6.55] ng/mL, P = 0.001) in comparison with the LRS group (P<0.01). Syndecan-1 levels in both groups were similar at T6 (3.18 [2.88, 3.5]ng/mL vs 3.12 [2.77, 3.45] ng/mL, P > 0.05). Additionally, MMP-9, MMP-3, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly lower at T3 and T5 in the BRS group (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) or POD (P > 0.05). Conclusion: BRS has the potential to reduce glycocalyx degradation in patients undergoing heart valve surgery with CPB. However, both groups demonstrated similar post-postoperative clinical outcomes, including the rates of AKI and POD.
