36921590|t|Prevalence and incidence of Carotid-Fetal-Posterior syndrome.
36921590|a|INTRODUCTION: Carotid-Fetal-Posterior (CFP) syndrome is a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory ischemic stroke/TIA caused by symptomatic >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion via fetal posterior communicating artery. We aimed to assess the incidence of CFP syndrome and prevalence of CFP syndrome among symptomatic >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion as these are unknown. METHODS: We reassessed consecutive CTAs from 4042 persons, and included locally admitted patients with >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion. These were assessed for symptoms and signs of possible posterior circulation stroke/TIA (suspicion of CFP syndrome). Among these, those with unilateral PCA territory stroke/TIA, ipsilateral stenosis and fetal/fetal type PCA were considered CFP syndrome. RESULTS: We included 208 locally admitted patients with >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion, 33 (16%) patients had suspicion of CFP syndrome, of which 3 (9%) had CFP syndrome. The prevalence of CFP syndrome was 2.9% of symptomatic >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion; incidence was 4.23 per 1 000 000 person-years. Also, we found a lower prevalence of CFP-syndrome (0.9%, p=0.047) among referred patients with symptomatic >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion than among locally admitted patients with symptomatic >=50% carotid stenosis or occlusion. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: CFP syndrome has a low incidence and low prevalence among symptomatic carotid stenosis cases. Given lower prevalence of CFP syndrome among referred cases than local, CFP-syndrome seems susceptible to underdiagnosis. On the other hand, few cases with suspicion of CFP syndrome had CFP syndrome, why CFP syndrome also seems susceptible to overdiagnosis if detailed assessment is not employed.
