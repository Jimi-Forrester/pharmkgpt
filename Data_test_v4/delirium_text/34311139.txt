34311139|a|BACKGROUND: Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences of TTAGGG at the ends of chromosomes. Many studies have shown that telomere shortening is associated with aging-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, changes in telomere length (TL) in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndrome are unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we assessed TL in blood samples from patients with FTD syndrome. METHODS: Absolute TL was measured in peripheral blood leukocytes from 53 patients with FTD syndromes (25 with behavioral variant FTD, 19 with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia [PPA], six with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, and three with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS] plus) and 28 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls using terminal restriction fragment analysis. RESULTS: TL was significantly longer in the FTD group than in the CU group. All FTD subtypes had significantly longer TL than controls. There were no significant differences in TL among FTD syndromes. No significant correlations were found between TL and demographic factors in the FTD group. CONCLUSIONS: Longer telomeres were associated with FTD syndrome, consistent with a recent report demonstrating that longer telomeres are related to ALS. Therefore, our results may support a shared biology between FTD and ALS. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed.
