38304644|t|Cardiovascular Manifestations of Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome: A Narrative Review.
38304644|a|Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) is a long-term, age-related extracellular matrix condition that causes aberrant fibrillary pseudoexfoliative material (PXM) to accumulate in various body tissues. The anterior portion of the eye is where this disorder most frequently presents. It affects the entire body. Most frequently, it is seen in older people, usually those over 50. Fibrillar deposits are a symptom of the pseudoexfoliation syndrome and are found in the anterior part of the eye. Deposition of fibrillary white flaky material is seen. The lens capsule, cornea, ciliary epithelium, lens epithelium, iris pigment epithelium, zonules, orbital soft tissues, trabecular meshwork, iris blood vessels, and iris stroma have all been reported to show such depositions. The skin, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and other organs have also been reported to contain these deposits. Asymmetrical and bilateral illnesses are both possible. Myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and systemic hypertension have all been linked to it. The pseudoexfoliative condition was first reported with the characteristic findings of white or grey flakes on the anterior lens capsule, the prevalence of glaucoma rising with age, and its presence in about 50% of eyes. A few decades later, the term pseudoexfoliation was given to differentiate it from the true exfoliation syndrome. True exfoliation syndrome is characterized by lamellar delamination of the lens capsule and is caused by exposure to infrared radiation. It is commonly seen in glassblowers. Age is a risk factor for PEX once a person reaches 70. Symptoms of PEX include elevated intraocular pressure, peripapillary transillumination deficiencies, potential glaucomatous optic nerve damage, poor dilatation, Sampaolesi line, and fibrillar white flaky deposits along the pupillary border. Meanwhile, fibrillar white flaky deposits on the anterior lens capsule (Hoarfrost Ring) and pigment dispersion syndrome are not pathognomonic.
