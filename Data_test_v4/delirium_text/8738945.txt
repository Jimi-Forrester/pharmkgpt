8738945|a|Point mutations of the mitochondrial genome are often considered to be the cause of certain neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial myopathies. Recently, there has been a report on Alzheimer's disease (AD) point mutations at position 5460 of the mitochondrial genome located within the ND2 gene. Using allele-specific PCR with a sensitivity of detection of less than 1% mutated mtDNA, we investigated postmortem brain samples from 48 patients with AD and blood samples of 15 patients with clinically diagnosed AD. In addition, we investigated tissue samples of patients with different neuromuscular disorders and patients with Downs syndrome. Independent of the tissue analysed very few of all the tested samples of patients showed a point mutation at nt 5460 with a base substitution from G to A. Two out of 19 brain and 48 blood samples from controls carried this mutation. The G to T transversion was not found in any of the so far tested samples. Our results do not support the previously reported significant high frequency of these mutations in AD.A polymorphism seems more likely.
