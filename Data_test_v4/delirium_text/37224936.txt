37224936|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, particularly in declarative memory, and the presence of beta-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cortical atrophy (especially in the temporal lobe). Unlike the relationship between the temporal cortex and declarative memory, nondeclarative memories (e.g., motor, fear, and other emotion-based memories) involve distinct neural structures. The present review investigates nondeclarative associative learning ability in Alzheimer's disease. We discuss eyeblink conditioning, fear conditioning, and other emotion-based learning and present the functions and brain areas that are involved in each type of learning. Evidence suggests that nondeclarative learning is also affected by Alzheimer's disease, although some forms of learning may be relatively preserved. Details about each nondeclarative associative learning process and the implications of these findings are presented.
