28855816|t|Identification of novel inhibitors against Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9/Cyclin T1 complex as: Anti cancer agent.
28855816|a|Cell cycle consists of different types of phases, transition from G1, S, G2, M. Inhibition of associated CDKs like CDK9/Cyclin T1 complex, which are indirectly involved in the Cell cycle progression in the form of transcription elongation, reduces diverse diseases such as Cardiac Hypertrophy, Alzheimer's, Cancer, AIDS and Inflammation. Glide tool of the Schrodinger software has been used for performing Structure Based Virtual Screening and Docking against Drug Bank and MDPI database. The best hits were identified which go and bind in the active site of the target where ATP binds for the activity. The ADMET, MM-GBSA and DFT analysis is also done for the same. Compound 4-{4-[4-(3-aminopropoxy)phenyl]-1H-pyrazol-5-yl}-6-chlorobenzene-1,3-diol (DB08045) was found to be more potent, novel and selective as an inhibitor. Hopefully compound (DB08045) could be used as an anti-cancer agent for the treatment of life-threatening diseases.
