38405347|t|The Association Between Positive Amyloid-PET and Cognitive Decline Is Not Always Supportive of Alzheimer's Disease: Suggestions from a Case Report.
38405347|a|Amyloid-beta deposition is the pathological hallmark of both cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease dementia, clinical conditions that can share cognitive decline and positive Amyloid-PET scan. A case is reported involving an 82-year-old Italian female who presented initially a memory deficit, later transient focal neurologic episodes, and finally two symptomatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhages. In light of these events, MRI and PET imaging findings, acquired before cerebral hemorrhages, are reconsidered and discussed, highlighting the utility of Amyloid-PET in supporting an in vivo diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
