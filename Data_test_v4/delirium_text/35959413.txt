35959413|t|Challenges in Nursing Care of Children With Substance Withdrawal Syndrome in the PICU.
35959413|a|Introduction: Substance withdrawal is one of the most common advert events in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), as the administration of potent opiates and sedative drugs is frequently performed several times each day. Objectives: The present study explored the challenges in nursing care of children with substance withdrawal syndrome in the PICU. Method: The study has an explorative and descriptive semi-structured qualitative interview design, with a strategic selection of informants. It was conducted at one out of three pediatric intensive care units in Sweden. Results: Three different main themes were identified describing the different challenges regarding withdrawal symptoms: monitor the child's interest, work with structured support, and understand the observation. Conclusions: There is a discrepancy between the medical perspective and the nursing care perspective regarding children in PICU suffering from withdrawal syndrome. The lack of joint guidelines, language, and nursing diagnoses may lead to subjective evaluations and increase suffering for these children.
