37483836|a|Guar Gum has been evaluated for its importance in food and pharmaceutical industry. A blended biopolymeric hydrogel was prepared by solution casting technique using guar gum (GG), chitosan (CS), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), chemically crosslinked with tetra orthosilicate (TEOS) and impregnated with methotrexate (MTX) to assess its drug carrying capacity against colon cancer (HCT-116). The surface morphology, chemical bonding, hydrophilicity and water absorbing capacity were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle measurements and swelling properties in variable conditions. Furthermore, degradation, drug release kinetics, hemocompatibility, and cytotoxicity of MTX-loaded hydrogel was tested. The release of MTX from GG/CS/PVA biopolymeric blend occurred in sustained manner. Results displayed that in 7 h 25 min duration 96% of the drug was released in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. These blends were non-hemolytic, and antiproliferative against HCT-116. Furthermore, the MTT assay has revealed that MTX-loaded hydrogel had prominently decreased the cell viability (with IC50 11.7 microg/ml) as compared to free MTX (with IC50 21.57 microg/ml). Hence, these results suggest that guar gum based hydrogels are potential biomaterials for colon cancer treatment.
