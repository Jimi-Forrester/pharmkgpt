34925716|t|The Serum Level of Midkine in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica.
34925716|a|INTRODUCTION: Midkine (MK), a heparin-binding growth factor, is involved in neurological diseases by mediating the inflammatory responses through enhancing the leukocyte migration. The present study assesses the serum concentration of this growth factor among newly developed Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) patients. METHODS: The present research, as a cross-sectional study, was performed at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan City, Iran. All samples were selected from patients who visited Kashani and Alzahra hospitals for two years (2014 to 2016). The MK level was assessed in 80 new MS cases, 80 NMO patients, and 80 healthy subjects. After collecting blood sera samples, MK serum level was measured using the ELISA. The obtained data were analyzed in SPSS. RESULTS: The Mean+-SD MK level was 1038.58+-44.73 pg/mL in the MS group, which was significantly higher than the Mean+-SD MK level in the NMO (872.62+-55.42 pg/mL) and control groups (605.02+-9.42 pg/mL). CONCLUSION: Overall, these results demonstrated that MK plays a prominent role in inflammatory reactions and neuroautoimmune diseases, especially in MS. So, the MK level may be used for earlier diagnosis and also prevention of disease progression by using a special inhibitor.
