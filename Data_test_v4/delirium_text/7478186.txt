7478186|t|SMI-32 antibody against non-phosphorylated neurofilaments identifies a subpopulation of cultured cortical neurons hypersensitive to kainate toxicity.
7478186|a|SMI-32, an antibody against a non-phosphorylated neurofilament epitope identifies a subpopulation of human cortical neurons preferentially lost in Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease. In murine cortical cultures SMI-32 labeled a small subset of neurons exhibiting enhanced vulnerability to kainate toxicity. Most SMI-32(+) neurons were GABAergic and exhibited kainate-activated Co2+ uptake. Thus expression of Ca2+ permeable AMPA or kainate receptor-gated channels likely underlies the heightened vulnerability of SMI-32(+) cortical neurons to kainate.
