22973426|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive declines in cognitive function and ability to carry out activities of daily living; and the emergence and worsening of behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms. While there is no cure for AD, non-pharmacologic interventions and medications that modulate neurotransmission can slow symptomatic progression. Medical foods may also be useful as adjuncts to pharmacologic agents in AD. Medium chain triglycerides aimed at improving cerebral metabolism significantly improve Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive scores when added to ongoing pharmacotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Combination of interventions, such as non-pharmacologic treatments, pharmacotherapy, and medical foods, with complementary mechanisms of action may provide a rational approach that may result in maximum preservation of cognitive function in patients with AD.
