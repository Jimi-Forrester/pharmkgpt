36541134|t|Advance Care Planning Among Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment.
36541134|a|In this study, we used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to investigate factors associated with older adults' engagement with advance care planning (ACP) across varying levels of cognitive functioning status. Our analysis used a sample of 17,698 participants in the HRS 2014 survey. Survey descriptive procedures (Proc SurveyMeans, Proc SurveyFreq) and logistic regression procedures (Proc SurveyLogistic) were used. Race, ethnicity, level of cognition, education, age, and number of chronic diseases consistently predicted ACP. Participants with lower levels of cognition were less likely to have a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare (DPOAH). African American and Hispanic participants, younger participants, and those with lower cognition and education levels were less likely to engage in ACP. Marital status and loneliness predicted ACP engagement. Some results varied across the cognition cohorts. Our results indicated that sociodemographic status, together with health and cognitive status, has a significant role in predicting ACP. The results can provide valuable insights on ACP for older adults with or at risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and other cognitive impairments, caregivers, families, and healthcare providers.
