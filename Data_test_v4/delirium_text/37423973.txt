37423973|t|24 h Rest/Activity Rhythms in Older Adults with Memory Impairment: Associations with Cognitive Performance and Depressive Symptomatology.
37423973|a|Little is known about links of circadian rhythm alterations with neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition in memory impaired older adults. Associations of actigraphic rest/activity rhythms (RAR) with depressive symptoms and cognition are examined using function-on-scalar regression (FOSR). Forty-four older adults with memory impairment (mean: 76.84 +- 8.15 years; 40.9% female) completed 6.37 +- 0.93 days of actigraphy, the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and consortium to establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease [CERAD] delayed word recall. FOSR models with BDI-II, MMSE, or CERAD as individual predictors adjusted for demographics (Models A1-A3) and all three predictors and demographics (Model B). In Model B, higher BDI-II scores are associated with greater activity from 12:00-11:50 a.m., 2:10-5:50 p.m., 8:40-9:40 p.m., 11:20-12:00 a.m., higher CERAD scores with greater activity from 9:20-10:00 p.m., and higher MMSE scores with greater activity from 5:50-10:50 a.m. and 12:40-5:00 p.m. Greater depressive symptomatology is associated with greater activity in midafternoon, evening, and overnight into midday; better delayed recall with greater late evening activity; and higher global cognitive performance with greater morning and afternoon activity (Model B). Time-of-day specific RAR alterations may affect mood and cognitive performance in this population.
