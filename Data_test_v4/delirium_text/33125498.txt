33125498|t|Laboratory Findings Associated With Severe Illness and Mortality Among Hospitalized Individuals With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Eastern Massachusetts.
33125498|a|Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on health systems across the world, and reliable estimates of risk for adverse hospital outcomes are needed. Objective: To quantify admission laboratory and comorbidity features associated with critical illness and mortality risk across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of all individuals admitted to the hospital who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction across these 6 hospitals through June 5, 2020, using hospital course, prior diagnoses, and laboratory values in emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. The data were extracted on June 11, 2020, and the analysis was conducted from June to July 2020. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe illness defined by admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 2511 hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (of whom 50.9% were male, 53.9% White, and 27.0% Hispanic, with a mean [SD ]age of 62.6 [19.0] years), 215 (8.6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 164 (6.5%) required mechanical ventilation, and 292 (11.6%) died. L1-regression models developed in 3 of these hospitals yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.807 for severe illness and 0.847 for mortality in the 3 held-out hospitals. In total, 212 of 292 deaths (72.6%) occurred in the highest-risk mortality quintile. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort, specific admission laboratory studies in concert with sociodemographic features and prior diagnosis facilitated risk stratification among individuals hospitalized for COVID-19.
