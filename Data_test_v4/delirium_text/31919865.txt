31919865|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium is a common complication after major surgical procedures and affects outcomes and long-term survival. We identified factors associated with postoperative delirium in patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of 378 patients undergoing esophagectomy. We examined the association between postoperative delirium (DSM-V) criteria with respect to baseline variables and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium was diagnosed in 64 (16.93%) patients and associated with increasing age (P < .05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .07), pneumonia (P = .01), transfusion intraoperatively or within 72 hours of surgery (P < .001), and sepsis (P = .001). Unplanned intubation and increased length of stay (median, 14 days) were significant in patients with delirium (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). In a secondary analysis, surgical technique and operative approach were associated with delirium. Modified McKeown (three-hole) esophagectomy was twice more likely to develop delirium compared with Ivor Lewis (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.23). The strongest association was found between delirium and open techniques (thoracotomy and laparotomy) as compared with minimally invasive techniques (thoracoscopy and laparoscopy) (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.22-5.76). Survival was similar between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium is common and associated with complications following esophagectomy. Identification of predisposing factors such as age and pre-existing pulmonary diseases and proper selection of surgical treatment may reduce delirium and improve surgical outcomes.
