34723090|t|Solifenacin-induced acute psychosis: a case report.
34723090|a|Solifenacin is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that has been used to treat overactive bladder since 2004. It has a great affinity for the detrusor M3 receptor, which must be stimulated for bladder muscle contraction, and demonstrates the most selective profile to the bladder of the muscarinic receptor subtypes. It is thought that urinary antimuscarinic agents, due to their passage to the central nervous system and lipophilic properties, may cause central nervous system symptoms in some rare cases. A case report of a 42-year-old male patient who had an acute psychotic attack as a result of solifenacin treatment for overactive bladder is presented in this article.
