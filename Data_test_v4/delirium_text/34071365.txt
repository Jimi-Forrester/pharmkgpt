34071365|t|Prenatal Screening of Trisomy 21: Could Oxidative Stress Markers Play a Role?
34071365|a|Despite significant progress in trisomy 21 (T21) diagnostic tools, amniocentesis is still used for the confirmation of an abnormal fetal karyotype. Invasive tests carry the potential risk of miscarriage; thus, screening biomarkers are commonly used before undergoing invasive procedures. In our study, we investigated the possible application of oxidative stress markers in the prenatal screening of trisomy 21. The DNA/RNA oxidative stress damage products (OSDPs), advanced glycation end (AGE) products, ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), alfa-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), asprosin, and vitamin D concentrations were measured in both maternal plasma and amniotic fluid in trisomy 21 (T21) and euploid pregnancies. The obtained results indicated increased levels of DNA/RNA OSDPs and asprosin with simultaneous decreased levels of vitamin D and A1AT in the study group. The diagnostic utility of the plasma measurement based on the area under the received operative characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) calculation of asprosin (AUC = 0.965), IMA (AUC = 0.880), AGE (AUC = 0.846) and DNA/RNA OSDPs (AUC = 0.506) in T21 screening was demonstrated. The obtained results indicate a potential role for the application of oxidative stress markers in the prenatal screening of T21 with the highest screening utility of plasma asprosin.
