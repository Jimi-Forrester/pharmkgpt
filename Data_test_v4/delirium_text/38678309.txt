38678309|a|Numerous treatment options are being studied for Alzheimer's disease (AD) given the rising prevalence of this condition worldwide. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a promising option for regulating specific neurological abnormalities pertaining to this condition. This case presents a patient with AD and co-occurring major depressive disorder that received 36 sessions of Deep TMS to the frontal and temporal lobes. This patient experienced improved general cognitive functioning and memory, remission from depression, and reduced slow-frequency theta activity in frontal and temporal sites. Following 7 months of weekly maintenance, additional improvements occurred. This report suggests that Deep TMS may be effective in mitigating AD symptoms, and maintenance sessions are advisable.
