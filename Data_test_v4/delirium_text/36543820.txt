36543820|t|Incidence rate and distinctive characteristics of first episode psychosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multicenter observational study.
36543820|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of people around the world. However, its impact on first-episode psychosis (FEP) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence rate (IR) and the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients who developed FEP during the nine-month period following the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain and to compare these data to the corresponding period in the previous year. We included all patients (n = 220) treated for the first time during these two time periods at three FEP programs in Spain. The IR was 0.42/100,000 person-years during the pandemic vs. 0.54/100,000 in the prior year (p = 0.057). Compared to prior year, women accounted for a significantly higher proportion of FEP patients (46.3% vs. 28%; p = 0.005) during the COVID-19 period. This association was significant on the logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, female: 2.12 [confidence interval 1.17-3.82]; p = 0.014). These data reveal a non-significant trend towards a lower incidence of FEP during the pandemic period. Female sex was associated with a greater risk of developing FEP during the pandemic period, perhaps due to differences between males and females in the susceptibility and expression of psychosis. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of stress-related disorders.
