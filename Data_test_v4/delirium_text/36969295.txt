36969295|a|Objective: The objective of this study was to better understand the clinical features of photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) in Chinese children. Methods: Thirty-one children with PSE were screened out of 398 children with epilepsy who were consecutively diagnosed by the video-electroencephalogram (VEEG) monitoring method and by using an intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) test. Their EEGs and clinical features were retrospectively analyzed, and their treatment outcomes were followed up. Results: PSE accounted for 7.79% (31/398) of children with epilepsy during the observation period in our single epilepsy center. The male to female ratio of PSE was 1:3.43, and the average seizure onset age was 7.8 +- 3.28 years. The highest range of frequency sensitivity of the IPS test for the induction of EEG epileptic discharge or electroclinical seizures was within 10-20 Hz. Electroclinical seizures were induced in 41.94% (13/31) of PSE patients by using the IPS test, while EEG discharge without clinical seizures was induced in 58.06% (18/31) of PSE patients. Among all PSE patients, an IPS-positive reaction in the eye-closure state was induced in 83.87% of patients, and this rate was significantly higher than that in the eye-opened state (41.94%) or eye-closed state (35.48%). (Eye-closure IPS stimulation means: make the subjects close their eyes at the beginning of each stimulation, open their eyes at the end of the stimulation, and close their eyes again at the beginning of the next stimulation, and so on. While Eye-closed IPS stimulation means the stimulation is started after 5 s of eye closure, and the subjects are kept closed throughout the whole process.) The common and effective drugs used for single or combined therapy in PSE children were valproic acid and levetiracetam. Conclusion: This study provides some useful information about electroclinical characteristics in a cohort of 31 PSE children. It may be beneficial for pediatric neurologists in terms of paying more attention to PSE and correctly dealing with it.
