32493431|t|Transcriptional profiling of multiple system atrophy cerebellar tissue highlights differences between the parkinsonian and cerebellar sub-types of the disease.
32493431|a|Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare adult-onset neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause, with no effective therapeutic options, and no cure. Limited work to date has attempted to characterize the transcriptional changes associated with the disease, which presents as either predominating parkinsonian (MSA-P) or cerebellar (MSC-C) symptoms. We report here the results of RNA expression profiling of cerebellar white matter (CWM) tissue from two independent cohorts of MSA patients (n = 66) and healthy controls (HC; n = 66). RNA samples from bulk brain tissue and from oligodendrocytes obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) were sequenced. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and were examined before and after stratifying by MSA clinical sub-type.We detected the highest number of DEGs in the MSA-C group (n = 747) while only one gene was noted in MSA-P, highlighting the larger dysregulation of the transcriptome in the MSA-C CWM. Results from both bulk tissue and LCM analysis showed a downregulation of oligodendrocyte genes and an enrichment for myelination processes with a key role noted for the QKI gene. Additionally, we observed a significant upregulation of neuron-specific gene expression in MSA-C and enrichment for synaptic processes. A third cluster of genes was associated with the upregulation of astrocyte and endothelial genes, two cell types with a key role in inflammation processes. Finally, network analysis in MSA-C showed enrichment for beta-amyloid related functional classes, including the known Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes, APP and PSEN1.This is the largest RNA profiling study ever conducted on post-mortem brain tissue from MSA patients. We were able to define specific gene expression signatures for MSA-C highlighting the different stages of the complex neurodegenerative cascade of the disease that included alterations in several cell-specific transcriptional programs. Finally, several results suggest a common transcriptional dysregulation between MSA and AD-related genes despite the clinical and neuropathological distinctions between the two diseases.
