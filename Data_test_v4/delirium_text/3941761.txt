3941761|t|Decreased cerebral blood flow precedes multi-infarct dementia, but follows senile dementia of Alzheimer type.
3941761|a|A 7-year prospective study among 181 neurologically normal elderly volunteers (mean age, 70.6 years) revealed an incidence of 3.3%, or 0.47% new cases per year, for Alzheimer's disease (SDAT) and 5.5%, or 0.78% new cases per year, for multi-infarct dementia (MID). The unusually high incidence of MID is considered to reflect preselection of a large percentage of volunteers (48.6%) with risk factors for (but without symptoms of) atherothrombotic stroke. Of 88 volunteers at risk of stroke, 11.4% developed MID within 7 years. In MID patients, cerebral blood flow (CBF) values began to decline around 2 years before onset of symptoms, while in SDAT patients, CBF levels remained normal until symptoms of dementia appeared; thereafter, CBF declined rapidly.
