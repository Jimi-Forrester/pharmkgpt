39027524|a|Objective: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of early postoperative complications of radical cystectomy, using standardized reporting methodology to assess perioperative characteristics and determine risk factors for major complications. Materials and methods: A retrospective study included 254 consecutive bladder cancer patients undergoing RC between 2012 and 2020 at a urological cancer referral center. Postoperative complications within 30 days were recorded and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). The study examined risk factors, including novel inflammatory-nutrition biomarkers and perioperative serum chloride. Results: Total complications were observed in 135 (53 %). Of these, 47 (18.5 %) were high grade (CDC >= 3). Wound dehiscence was the most common complication, occurring in 14 (5.5 %) patients. Independent risk factors for major complications included an age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) > 4 and thrombocytopenia (odds ratio [OR] 3.67 and OR 8.69). Preoperative platelet counts < 220,000/muL and albumin < 3 mg/dL were independent risk factors for wound dehiscence (OR 3.91 and OR 4.72). Additionally, postoperative hypochloremia was a risk factor for major complications (OR 13.71), while novel serum biomarkers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were not associated with early major complications. Conclusion: Patients who have multiple comorbidities are at a greater risk of developing major complications after undergoing RC. Our result suggests that preoperative platelet counts and serum albumin levels are associated with wound dehiscence.
