37180903|t|Association between vitamin D deficiency and multiple sclerosis- MRI significance: A scoping review.
37180903|a|Background/Objective: Multiple Sclerosis is a common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Several studies suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and multiple sclerosis disease activity, which can be evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Thereby, the main objective of the following scoping review is to summarize the magnetic resonance imaging findings assessing the probable effects of vitamin D on MS disease activity. Methodology: PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was employed to structure this review. Literature was searched for observational and clinical studies tackling the given matter using several search engines including PubMed, CORE, and Embase. Data was extracted in a systematic manner, and the articles meeting the inclusion criteria were quality-assessed by Jadad scale for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies. Results: A total of 35 articles were included. Twenty-one (60%) studies noted a statistically significant association between vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis MRI-detected disease activity. MRI-detected features involved lower contrast-enhancing T1 lesions, lower hyperintense T2 lesions, and a decrease in lesions volume. On the other hand, 40% (14 articles) of the articles did not detect any significant effect of vitamin D on Multiple Sclerosis disease activity. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies involved, meta-analysis was not employed in the given review. Discussion/conclusion: There was an abundance in the number of research studies investigating the relationship between vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis while highlighting the significant role of MRI in assessing the activity of the disease. Numerous studies found that higher serum vitamin D levels are associated with decreased new active cortical and subcortical lesions and lower lesions volume. These findings highlight the importance of imaging modalities in the various aspects of neurological diseases and encourage further research to focus on the preventive effects of vitamin D on MS patients.
