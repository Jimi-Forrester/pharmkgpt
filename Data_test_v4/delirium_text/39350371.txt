39350371|t|Japanese Subgroup Analyses from EMERGE and ENGAGE, Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Aducanumab in Patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease.
39350371|a|BACKGROUND: Global prevalence and incidence of dementia continue to rise at a rapid rate. There is a need for new Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments globally. Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated soluble amyloid beta oligomers and insoluble amyloid beta fibrils. In June 2021, aducanumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of AD under the accelerated approval pathway. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy, safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aducanumab in Japanese subgroups in EMERGE and ENGAGE studies. DESIGN: EMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia). SETTING: These studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants enrolled in Japan included 121 (7.4% of total 1638 in EMERGE) and 100 (6.1% of total 1647 in ENGAGE) patients (aged 50-85 years with confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (6 or 10 mg/kg target dose) or placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to Week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, function, and behavior; biomarker endpoints (amyloid PET and plasma p-tau181); serum PK profiles and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Results from the Japanese subgroup analyses were generally consistent with those of the overall study population across endpoints, while a lower mean body weight (kg) and a smaller proportion of ApoE epsilon4 carriers were observed in the Japanese subgroup population. A treatment effect was observed in favor of aducanumab on the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 78 in EMERGE, but not ENGAGE. The incidence and type of adverse events in the Japanese subgroups were generally comparable to those observed in the overall study population; amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were common treatment-related adverse events that appeared to be related to the aducanumab dose. ARIA incidence was generally lower in the Japanese subgroup compared with the overall population. Consistent with the overall data set, a robust dose-dependent decrease in amyloid beta levels as assessed with amyloid-PET and plasma p-tau181 was observed. Serum PK profiles and immunogenicity of aducanumab in Japanese population were consistent with the non-Japanese population. CONCLUSION: Efficacy, safety, biomarker, and PK profiles of aducanumab were consistent between the Japanese subgroup and the overall population. A positive treatment effect of aducanumab on efficacy endpoints was observed in EMERGE, but not in ENGAGE.
