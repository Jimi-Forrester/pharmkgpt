38780948|t|Suprazygomatic Maxillary Nerve Blocks and Opioid Requirements in Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
38780948|a|Importance: Pain management following pediatric adenotonsillectomies is opioid-inclusive, leading to potential complications. Objective: To investigate the use of suprazygomatic maxillary nerve (SZMN) blocks to reduce pain and opioid use after pediatric intracapsular adenotonsillectomy and to measure recovery duration and incidence of complications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a randomized, blinded, prospective single-center tertiary pediatric hospital that included 60 pediatric patients (2-14 years old) scheduled for intracapsular adenotonsillectomy from November 2021 to March 2023. Patients were excluded for having combined surgical procedures, developmental delay, coagulopathy, chronic pain history, known or predicted difficult airway, or unrepaired congenital heart disease. Participants were randomized to receive bilateral SZMN blocks (block group) or not (control group). Intervention: SZMN block administered bilaterally under general anesthesia for intracapsular adenotonsillectomy. Primary Outcomes and Measures: Opioid consumption, FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) scores, and rates of opioid-free postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay. Secondary outcomes were recovery duration and incidence of adverse effects, ie, nausea, vomiting, block site bleeding, and emergency delirium. Results: The study population included 53 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 6.5 [3.6] years; 29 [55%] females; 24 [45%] males); 26 were randomly assigned to the SZMN block group and 27 to the control group. The mean (SD) opioid morphine equivalent consumption during PACU stay was 0.15 (0.14) mg/kg for the 27 patients in the control group compared with 0.07 (0.11) mg/kg for the 26 patients in the block group (mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.15; Cohen d, 0.64). The block group had a higher incidence of opioid-free PACU stays (n = 7 patients; 58%) compared with the control group (n = 15 patients; 26%) (mean difference, 32%; 95% CI, 5%-53%). Patients in the block group experienced lower FLACC scores (0.7 vs 1.6; mean difference, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.2-1.6; Cohen d, 0.7). The overall occurrence of adverse events was similar in the 2 groups, with no reported nerve block-related complications. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of the randomized clinical trial indicate that SZMN blocks are a useful adjunct tool for managing postoperative pain in pediatric intracapsular adenotonsillectomy. Use of these blocks during adenotonsillectomy provided clinically meaningful reductions of postoperative opioid consumption with a low risk of complications.
