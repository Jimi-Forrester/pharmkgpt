MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty pediatric patients were randomized into the PCB group and the SFIB group. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores were used to assess postoperative pain during the initial 24 h after extubation. Sufentanil consumption, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) demands, and complications were also recorded. RESULTS: The NRS pain scores were significantly lower in the PCB group than in the SFIB group at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after extubation (all P < 0.01). Postoperatively, 13.8% of patients in the PCB cohort received additional administration of sufentanil, in contrast to 63.3% of the SFIB cohort (P < 0.01). In the PCB group, 0 (0-0) mcg/kg sufentanil was administered, while in the SFIB group 0.1 (0-0.2) mcg/kg (P < 0.01). In addition, the PCB group had fewer PCA demands than the SFIB group within the initial 24 h (P < 0.01). It took less operating time to achieve SFIB as compared to PCB (P < 0.01). No adverse events related to two techniques were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: PCB provided a better perioperative pain management in pediatric patients with the DDH surgeries compared to SFIB. It also reduced the need for supplementary systemic analgesia.
