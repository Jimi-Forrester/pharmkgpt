30276162|t|Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Addiction Related Hippocampal Damages.
30276162|a|The brain is an important organ that controls all sensory and motor actions, memory, and emotions. Each anatomical and physiological modulation in various brain centers, results in psychological, behavioral, and sensory-motor changes. Alcohol and addictive drugs such as opioids and amphetamines have been shown to exert a great impact on brain, specifically on the hippocampus. Emerging evidence has indicated that altered hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with the pathophysiology of neuropsychological disorders including addiction. The addictive drugs impair neurogenesis and undermine the function of neural stem/progenitor cells in hippocampus. This feature was claimed to be one of the underlying mechanisms of behavioral changes in patients with addiction. As the impairment of stem cells' function has been proven to be the underlying cause of pathologic neuroadaptations in the brain, the administration of stem cell populations has shown promising results for re-modulating of neuronal status in the brain and especially in the hippocampus. Among the different types of stem cells, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells are the most proper candidates for stem cell therapies. In this review article, the recent studies on the effects of addictive drugs on brain neurogenesis, and also the promising potential effects of stem cells in curing addiction related hippocampal damages are discussed.
