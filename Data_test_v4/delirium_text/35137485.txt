35137485|a|OBJECTIVE: Paravertebral muscle asymmetry may be involved in the pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), and the Tent5a protein was recently identified as a novel active noncanonical poly(A) polymerase. We, therefore, explored the function of the AIS susceptibility gene Tent5a in myoblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA-seq of AIS paravertebral muscle was performed, and the molecular differences in paravertebral muscle were investigated. Twenty-four AIS susceptibility genes were screened, and differential expression of Tent5a in paravertebral muscles was confirmed with qPCR and Western blot. After the knockdown of Tent5a, the functional effects of Tent5a on C2C12 cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, wound-healing assay, and TUNEL assay, respectively. Myogenic differentiation markers were tested with immunofluorescence and qPCR in vitro, and muscle fiber formation was compared in vivo. RESULTS: The AIS susceptibility gene Tent5a was differentially expressed in AIS paravertebral muscles. Tent5a knockdown inhibited the proliferation and migration of C2C12 cells and inhibited the maturation of type I muscle fibers in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the expression of myogenin was decreased along with the suppression of Tent5a. CONCLUSIONS: Tent5a plays an important role in the proliferation and migration of myoblasts, and it regulates muscle fiber maturation by maintaining the stability of myogenin. Tent5a may be involved in the pathogenesis of AIS by regulating the formation of muscle fiber type I.
