33676717|a|Exosomes (30-200 nm) play important roles in intercellular communication. Because their contents differ between healthy individuals and subjects diagnosed with various diseases, exosomes have been regarded as potential sources of biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. However, the accuracy of diagnosis by exosomal biomarkers is highly dependent on the extraction efficiency, yield, and the quality of exosomes. Hence, inexpensive, convenient, and fast exosome separation methods are required. In the present study, the CaTiO3/Al3+/Pr3+/Sm3+ nanocomposite was synthesized and applied in highly selective and efficient separation of exosomes. Notably, the developed material exhibited higher specificity and efficiency than commercially available TiO2. Moreover, CaTiO3/Al3+/Pr3+/Sm3+ could be reused at least three times without any significant decrease in efficiency. The synthesized material was also used for the extraction of exosomes from the serums of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls. The exosomes were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) separation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry analysis. It was found that five proteins in the exosomes were evidently upregulated, while one protein was downregulated. Among the detected proteins, serum amyloid P-component (SAP) has been reported to be closely related to pathogenesis of AD. The obtained results indicated that the developed method involving separation and analysis of serum exosomes could be used for disease diagnosis or postoperative clinical monitoring.
