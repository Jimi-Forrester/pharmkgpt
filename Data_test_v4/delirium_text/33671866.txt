33671866|a|Oxidative stress, which refers to unbalanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cells, has been linked to acute and chronic diseases. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway plays a vital role in regulating cytoprotective genes and enzymes in response to oxidative stress. Therefore, pharmacological regulation of Nrf2/ARE pathway is an effective method to treat several diseases that are mainly characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. Natural products that counteract oxidative stress by modulating Nrf2 have contributed significantly to disease treatment. In this review, we focus on bioactive compounds derived from food that are Nrf2/ARE pathway regulators and describe the molecular mechanisms for regulating Nrf2 to exert favorable effects in experimental models of diseases.
