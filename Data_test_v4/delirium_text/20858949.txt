20858949|t|Cholinergic central system, Alzheimer's disease, and anesthetics liaison: a vicious circle?
20858949|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide and loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons, resulting in progressive loss of memory and irreversible impairment of higher cognitive functions. Several studies have accounted for the close relationship between AD and the central cholinergic system, suggesting that a dysfunction of acetylcholine containing neurons in the brain contributes significantly to the cognitive deficit of individuals with AD. The aim of the present review is to survey current literature on this topic in order to provide a clear understanding of the role of the cholinergic system in the development and neurodegenerative process of AD. The implications for anesthesia are also discussed. This knowledge could be valuable to improve anesthesia performance and patient safety.
