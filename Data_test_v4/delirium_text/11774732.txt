11774732|a|An 82-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 50 and had been treated with antihypertensive agents. Proteinuria was detected at age 60 and her renal function subsequently deteriorated. Hemodialysis was started on February 14, 2000. She fell out of the bed and hit her neck in the early morning on February 15. Neck X-ray tomography revealed Anderson type III dens fracture. Since she had several complicating conditions including angina pectoris and arrhythmia, she was treated by external fixation using a halo-vest. The neck pain improved gradually. During her clinical course, she experienced delirium due to immobilization. However, bone union was complete 5 months later. Physicians should be aware of the possibility that even minor injury can cause dens fracture in elderly patients. Conservative management of type III dense fracture should be considered for elderly patients with a compromised condition.
