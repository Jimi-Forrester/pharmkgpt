37329189|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a multifactorial and heterogeneous syndrome that is defined as acutely altered consciousness. This retrospective multicenter study evaluated the impact of postoperative delirium after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in elderly patients. METHODS: Patients aged >=75 years, who underwent curative liver resection for HCC at nine university hospitals from April 2010 to December 2017, were evaluated to compare short- and long-term outcomes between patients with and without delirium. Risk factors for delirium were determined using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: The rate of postoperative delirium was 14.2% (n = 80) in the study cohort of 562 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed smoking history, hypertension, sleeping pill consumption, and open liver resection as risk factors for postoperative delirium. The rate of other causes of death was significantly higher in the delirium group than in the no-delirium group although the rate of death at 1 year due to HCC or liver failure was similar between the two groups (p = .015). The 1-year mortality rates due to vascular diseases were 71.4% and 15.4% in the delirium and no-delirium groups, respectively (p = .022). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates after liver resection were 86.6%, 64.1%, and 36.5% in the delirium group and 91.3%, 71.2%, and 56.9% in the no-delirium group, respectively (p = .046). CONCLUSION: The multivariate analysis revealed the possible benefits of laparoscopic liver resection in reducing the rate of postoperative delirium after liver resection for HCC in elderly patients.
