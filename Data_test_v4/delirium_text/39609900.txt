39609900|t|The effectiveness of theta burst stimulation for motor recovery after stroke: a systematic review.
39609900|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Motor dysfunction is a common sequela, which seriously affects the lives of patients. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a new transcranial magnetic therapy for improving motor dysfunction after stroke. However, there remains a lack of studies on the mechanism, theoretical model, and effectiveness of TBS in improving motor dysfunction following stroke. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a comprehensive overview and assessment of the current impact of TBS on motor rehabilitation following stroke and analyzes potential factors contributing to treatment effect disparities. The aim is to offer recommendations for further refining the TBS treatment approach in subsequent clinical studies while also furnishing evidence for devising tailored rehabilitation plans for stroke patients. METHODS: This study was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically from the establishment of the database to February 2024. Relevant studies using TBS to treat patients with motor dysfunction after stroke will be included. Data on study characteristics, interventions, outcome measures, and primary outcomes were extracted. The Modified Downs and Black Checklist was used to assess the potential bias of the included studies, and a narrative synthesis of the key findings was finally conducted. RESULTS: The specific mechanism of TBS in improving motor dysfunction after stroke has not been fully elucidated, but it is generally believed that TBS can improve the functional prognosis of patients by regulating motor cortical excitability, inducing neural network reorganization, and regulating cerebral circulation metabolism. Currently, most relevant clinical studies are based on the interhemispheric inhibition model (IHI), the vicariation model, and the bimodal balance-recovery model. Many studies have verified the effectiveness of TBS in improving the motor function of stroke patients, but the therapeutic effect of some studies is controversial. CONCLUSION: Our results show that TBS has a good effect on improving motor function in stroke patients, but more large-scale, high-quality, multicenter studies are still necessary in the future to further clarify the mechanism of TBS and explore the optimal TBS treatment.
