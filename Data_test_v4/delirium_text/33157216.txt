33157216|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a global public health emergency since December 2019, and so far, more than 980,000 people (until September 24, 2020) around the world have died. SARS-CoV-2 mimics the influenza virus regarding methods and modes of transmission, clinical features, related immune responses, and seasonal coincidence. Accordingly, co-infection by these viruses is imaginable because some studies have reported several cases with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection. Given the importance of the mentioned co-infection and the coming influenza season, it is essential to recognize the similarities and differences between the symptoms, immunopathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. Therefore, we reviewed the virology, clinical features, and immunopathogenesis of both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated outcomes in cases with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection.
