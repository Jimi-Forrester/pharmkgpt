32493079|t|Factors Influencing Functional Exercise Capacity After Lung Resection for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
32493079|a|Purpose: We investigated, in patients who underwent lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the magnitude of early limitation in functional exercise capacity and the associations with pre- and postoperative factors. Methods: Consecutive patients with preoperative clinical stage I to IIIA NSCLC who underwent lung resection were prospectively enrolled. We measured functional exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance [6MWD]) and skeletal muscle strength (handgrip [HF] and quadriceps force [QF]) within 2 days prior to surgery and on day 7 postoperatively. Results: Two hundred eighteen participants were recruited (median age 69 years) of whom 49 developed postoperative complications (POCs). 6MWD was markedly decreased (514 m vs 469 m, P < .001); HF and QF were slightly decreased following surgery. Multiple linear regression showed that preoperative vital capacity (P < .01), QF (P < .05), the duration of chest tube drainage (P < .001), and presence of POCs (P < .05) were significant predictors. However, intraoperative factors were not significantly associated with the decline in 6MWD. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with preoperative impairments in pulmonary function and muscle strength, and those who require prolonged chest tube drainage or develop POCs are likely to have impaired exercise capacity. Therefore, individual assessment and follow-up of patients with such factors is indicated.
