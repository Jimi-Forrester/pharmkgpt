39200352|a|Peripheral insulin resistance (IR) is a well-documented, independent risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and cellular senescence. Recently, the brain has also been identified as an insulin-responsive region, where insulin acts as regulator of the brain metabolism. Despite the clear link between IR and the brain, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. Therapeutic intervention in patients showing symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases has produced little or no results. It has been demonstrated that insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly cognitive decline. Peripheral and brain IR may represent a modifiable state that could be used to prevent major brain disorders. In this review, we will analyse the scientific literature supporting IR as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and suggest some therapeutic strategies to provide a new proposal for the prevention of brain IR and its consequences.
