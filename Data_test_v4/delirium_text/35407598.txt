35407598|t|Incidence and Risk Factors of Worsened Activities of Daily Living Status Three Months after Intensive Care Unit Discharge among Critically Ill Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.
35407598|a|Background: We aimed to determine risk factors associated with worsened activity of daily living (ADL) status three months after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill adult patients that were emergently admitted to an ICU. We assessed ADL status by Barthel index score prior to ICU admission and three months after ICU discharge. The primary outcome was worsened ADL status, defined as a >=10 decrease in Barthel index score. Results: We enrolled 102 patients (median age was 72 years old, 55% were male, and 87% received mechanical ventilation during ICU stay), and 42 patients (41%) had worsened ADL status three months after discharge from ICU. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (>70 years old; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.68; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.33-10.19), high burden of chronic illness (aOR 4.11; 95%CI 1.43-11.81), and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (>=4 days; aOR 2.83; 95%CI 1.04-7.69) were independent risk factors for worsened ADL status at three months. Conclusions: Almost half of the critically ill adult patients in this cohort had worsened ADL status after ICU discharge. Older age, high burden of chronic illness, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation were risk factors for worsened ADL status.
