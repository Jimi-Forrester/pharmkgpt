39214327|t|Irisin in ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease and depression: a Narrative Review.
39214327|a|Irisin is a glycosylated protein formed from the hydrolysis of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin is widely involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that Irisin can inhibit inflammation, restrain oxidative stress and have neuroprotective effects, which suggests that Irisin may have a good therapeutic effect on central nervous system diseases. Therefore, this review summarizes the role of Irisin in central nervous system diseases, including its signal pathways and possible mechanisms, etc. Irisin may be a potential candidate drug for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.
