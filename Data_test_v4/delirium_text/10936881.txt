10936881|a|Interest in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipoproteins has been stimulated by the association of certain alleles of the human apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and because apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one of the major apolipoproteins in CSF. CSF lipoproteins (d < 1.210 g/ml fraction) are distinct from their plasma counterparts, and in AD patients CSF may contain novel particles. The protein concentration of CSF lipoproteins is reduced in AD patients. Moreover, the molecular distribution of apoE- and apoAII-containing apolipoproteins in CSF is dictated by APOE. The lipid composition suggests that CSF lipoproteins from AD patients may have undergone increased free radical-mediated damage; experimental data support the possibility that this may occur both before and after lipoprotein assembly. Finally, human CSF lipoproteins oxidized ex vivo are neurotoxic to neuronal cells in culture and disrupt microtubule structure, an activity not observed with oxidized bovine CSF lipoproteins. CSF lipoproteins may represent a means whereby apoE influences the outcome of free radical-mediated damage to brain.
