35884735|t|Identification and Validation of Novel Potential Pathogenesis and Biomarkers to Predict the Neurological Outcome after Cardiac Arrest.
35884735|a|Predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest remains a major issue. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers capable of predicting neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest. Expression profiles of GSE29540 and GSE92696 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low brain performance category (CPC) scoring subgroups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key gene modules and crossover genes in these datasets. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of crossover genes was constructed from the STRING database. Based on the PPI network, the most important hub genes were identified by the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape software. Eight hub genes (RPL27, EEF1B2, PFDN5, RBX1, PSMD14, HINT1, SNRPD2, and RPL26) were finally screened and validated, which were downregulated in the group with poor neurological prognosis. In addition, GSEA identified critical pathways associated with these genes. Finally, a Pearson correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expression of hub genes EEF1B2, PSMD14, RPFDN5, RBX1, and SNRPD2 were significantly and positively correlated with NDS scores in rats. Our work could provide comprehensive insights into understanding pathogenesis and potential new biomarkers for predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest.
