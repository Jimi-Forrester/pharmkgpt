33550630|t|beta-sheet breakers with consecutive phenylalanines: Insights into mechanism of dissolution of beta-amyloid fibrils.
33550630|a|beta-sheet breakers (BSB) constitute a class of peptide inhibitors of amyloidogenesis, a process which is a hallmark of many diseases called amyloidoses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular details of their action are still not fully understood. Here we describe the results of the computational investigation of the three BSBs, iabeta6 (LPFFFD), iabeta5 (LPFFD), and iabeta6_Gly (LPFGFD), in complex with the fibril model of Abeta42 and propose the kinetically probable mechanism of their action. The mechanism involves the binding of BSB to the central hydrophobic core (CHC) region (LVFFA) of Abeta fibril and the pi-stacking of its Phe rings both internally and with the Abeta fibril. In the process, the Abeta fibril undergoes distortion accumulating on the side of chain A (located on the odd tip of the fibril). In a single replica of extended molecular dynamics run of one of the iabeta6 poses, the distortion concludes in a dissociation of chain A from the fibril model of Abeta42. Altogether, we postulate that including consecutive Phe residues into BSBs docked around Phe 20 in the CHC region of Abeta42 improve their potency for dissolution of fibrils.
