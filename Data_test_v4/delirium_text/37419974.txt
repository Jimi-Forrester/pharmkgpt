37419974|a|The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system is the primary inhibitory neurotransmission system in the mammalian brain. Its dysregulation has been shown in multiple brain conditions, but in Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies have provided contradictory results. Here, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to investigate whether the GABAergic system is altered in AD patients compared to healthy controls (HC), following the PRISMA 2020 Statement. We searched PubMed and Web of Science from database inception to March 18th, 2023 for studies reporting GABA, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67, GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC receptors, GABA transporters (GAT) 1-3 and vesicular GAT in the brain, and GABA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 index, and the risk of bias was assessed with an adapted questionnaire from the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. The search identified 3631 articles, and 48 met the final inclusion criteria (518 HC, mean age 72.2, and 603 AD patients, mean age 75.6). Random-effects meta-analysis [standardized mean difference (SMD)] revealed that AD patients presented lower GABA levels in the brain (SMD = -0.48 [95% CI = -0.7, -0.27], adjusted p value (adj. p) < 0.001) and in the CSF (-0.41 [-0.72, -0.09], adj. p = 0.042), but not in the blood (-0.63 [-1.35, 0.1], adj. p = 0.176). In addition, GAD65/67 (-0.67 [-1.15, -0.2], adj. p = 0.006), GABAA receptor (-0.51 [-0.7, -0.33], adj. p < 0.001), and GABA transporters (-0.51 [-0.92, -0.09], adj. p = 0.016) were lower in the AD brain. Here, we showed a global reduction of GABAergic system components in the brain and lower GABA levels in the CSF of AD patients. Our findings suggest the GABAergic system is vulnerable to AD pathology and should be considered a potential target for developing pharmacological strategies and novel AD biomarkers.
