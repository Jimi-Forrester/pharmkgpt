37100399|a|Heavy metals such as lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) exist as particulate matter (PM) in the air and can cause biological damage to cells, animals, and humans. However, the mechanism underlying the toxic effects of heavy metals on nerve cells has not yet been completely identified. Glioma is the most common and fatal tumor in the central nervous system; the U87 human glioblastoma cell line is commonly used when researching brain cancer, including aggressive malignant gliomas. Therefore, in this study, cell viability, cytotoxicity, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were analyzed to confirm the effect of Cd and Pb exposure on U87 cells. On confirming the absence of significant effects on cell viability at low concentrations of heavy metals, Cd and Pb exposure had no effect on lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) activity at the concentrations (1 mug/L, 30 mug/L, and 1 mg/L) used in this study, and there was a remarkable effect of Cd and Pb exposure on the inflammatory response of these cells. Our findings provide a basis for future research elucidating the effects of heavy metal exposure on cellular pathology. Systematic studies with higher heavy metal concentrations and precision are warranted to deepen our understanding of the relationship between heavy metal exposure and neuronal responses.
