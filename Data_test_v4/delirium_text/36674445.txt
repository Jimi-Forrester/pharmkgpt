36674445|t|The KDET Motif in the Intracellular Domain of the Cell Adhesion Molecule L1 Interacts with Several Nuclear, Cytoplasmic, and Mitochondrial Proteins Essential for Neuronal Functions.
36674445|a|Abnormal functions of the cell adhesion molecule L1 are linked to several neural diseases. Proteolytic L1 fragments were reported to interact with nuclear and mitochondrial proteins to regulate events in the developing and the adult nervous system. Recently, we identified a 55 kDa L1 fragment (L1-55) that interacts with methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) via the KDET motif. We now show that L1-55 also interacts with histone H1.4 (HistH1e) via this motif. Moreover, we show that this motif binds to NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2), splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ), the non-POU domain containing octamer-binding protein (NonO), paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1), WD-repeat protein 5 (WDR5), heat shock cognate protein 71 kDa (Hsc70), and synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1). Furthermore, applications of HistH1e, NDUFV2, SFPQ, NonO, PSPC1, WDR5, Hsc70, or SYT1 siRNAs or a cell-penetrating KDET-carrying peptide decrease L1-dependent neurite outgrowth and the survival of cultured neurons. These findings indicate that L1's KDET motif binds to an unexpectedly large number of molecules that are essential for nervous system-related functions, such as neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival. In summary, L1 interacts with cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins to regulate development and, in adults, the formation, maintenance, and flexibility of neural functions.
