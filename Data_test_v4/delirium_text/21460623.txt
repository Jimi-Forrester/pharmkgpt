21460623|a|Recent work from our laboratory demonstrates that the accumulation of sphingolipids (SLs) decreases the capacity of cells to clear potentially amyloidogenic fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) during autophagy. APP is a type I membrane protein and could undergo sequential proteolytic processing by beta- and gamma-secretase resulting in the generation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Genetic, molecular and biochemical evidence indicates that the accumulation of toxic Abeta aggregates plays a critical role in the degeneration of neurons during the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Thus, SL storage could promote the accumulation of Ab in endosomal and lysosomal compartments and thereby induce characteristic cytopathological changes of AD.
