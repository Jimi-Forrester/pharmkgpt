38372938|t|Inhibition of Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 1 in Chronic Plaque Psoriasis: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.
38372938|a|INTRODUCTION: Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), a key mediator of inflammation through necroptosis and proinflammatory cytokine production, may play a role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis. An experimental medicine study of RIPK1 inhibition with GSK2982772 immediate-release formulation at doses up to 60 mg three times daily in mild to moderate plaque psoriasis indicated that efficacy may be improved with higher trough concentrations of GSK2982772. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose study (NCT04316585) assessed the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 960 mg GSK2982772 (once-daily modified-release formulation) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Twenty-nine patients were randomized 2:1 to GSK2982772 (N = 19) or placebo (N = 10) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: GSK2982772 was well tolerated with trough concentrations greater than tenfold higher than the previous phase 1 study with immediate release. Despite near complete RIPK1 target engagement in blood and modest reduction in circulating inflammatory cytokines, the proportion of patients achieving 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area Severity Index score at week 12 was similar between GSK2982772 and placebo (posterior median 1.8% vs 4.9%, respectively), with an estimated median treatment difference of - 2.3%. This analysis incorporated historical placebo data through the use of an informative prior distribution on the placebo arm. Week 4 changes in skin biopsy gene expression suggested sufficient local drug exposure to elicit a pharmacodynamic response. CONCLUSION: Administration of the RIPK1 inhibitor GSK2982772 to patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis did not translate into meaningful clinical improvements.
