37239295|t|Kullback-Leibler Divergence of Sleep-Wake Patterns Related with Depressive Severity in Patients with Epilepsy.
37239295|a|(1) Objective: Whether abnormal sleep-wake rhythms were associated with depressive symptoms in patents with epilepsy had remained unclear. Our study aimed to establish relative entropy for the assessment of sleep-wake patterns and to explore the relationship between this index and the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with epilepsy. (2) Methods: We recorded long-term scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD-17) questionnaire scores from 64 patients with epilepsy. Patients with HAMD-17 scores of 0-7 points were defined as the non-depressive group, while patients with scores of 8 or higher were defined as the depression group. Sleep stages were firstly classified based on EEG data. We then quantified sleep-wake rhythm variations in brain activity using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of daytime wakefulness and nighttime sleep. The KLD at different frequency bands in each brain region was analyzed between the depression and non-depression groups. (3) Results: Of the 64 patients with epilepsy included in our study, 32 had depressive symptoms. It was found that patients with depression had significantly decreased KLD for high-frequency oscillations in most brain areas, especially the frontal lobe. A detailed analysis was conducted in the right frontal region (F4) because of the significant difference in the high-frequency band. We found that the KLDs at the gamma bands were significantly decreased in the depression groups compared to the non-depression group (KLDD = 0.35 +- 0.05, KLDND = 0.57 +- 0.05, p = 0.009). A negative correlation was displayed between the KLD of gamma band oscillation and HAMD-17 score (r = -0.29, p = 0.02). (4) Conclusions: Sleep-wake rhythms can be assessed using the KLD index calculated from long-term scalp EEGs. Moreover, the KLD of high-frequency bands had a negative correlation with HAMD-17 scores in patients with epilepsy, which indicates a close relationship between abnormal sleep-wake patterns and depressive symptoms in patients with epilepsy.
