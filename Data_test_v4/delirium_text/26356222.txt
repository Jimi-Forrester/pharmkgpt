26356222|t|The Significance of the Prognostic Nutritional Index in Patients with Completely Resected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
26356222|a|OBJECTIVES: Immunological parameters and nutritional status influence the outcome of patients with malignant tumors. A prognostic nutritional index, calculated using serum albumin levels and peripheral lymphocyte count, has been used to assess prognosis for various cancers. This study aimed to investigate whether this prognostic nutritional index affects overall survival and the incidence of postoperative complications in patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 409 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent complete resection between 2005 and 2007 at the Aichi Cancer Center. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rates of patients with high (>=50) and low (<50) prognostic nutritional indices were 84.4% and 70.7%, respectively (p = 0.0011). Univariate analysis showed that gender, histology, pathological stage, smoking history, serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and prognostic nutritional index were significant prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis identified pathological stage and the prognostic nutritional index as independent prognostic factors. The frequency of postoperative complications tended to be higher in patients with a low prognostic nutritional index. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic nutritional index is an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer.
