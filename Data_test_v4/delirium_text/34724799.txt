34724799|t|Tert-butylhydroquinone attenuates osteoarthritis by protecting chondrocytes and inhibiting macrophage polarization.
34724799|a|AIMS: Tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) has been identified as an inhibitor of oxidative stress-induced injury and apoptosis in human neural stem cells. However, the role of tBHQ in osteoarthritis (OA) is unclear. This study was carried out to investigate the role of tBHQ in OA. METHODS: OA animal model was induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Different concentrations of tBHQ (25 and 50 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected in ten-week-old female mice. Chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage of mice and treated with 5 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 10 ng/ml interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) for 24 hours, and then treated with different concentrations of tBHQ (10, 20, and 40 muM) for 12 hours. The expression levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in blood were measured. The expression levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) leptin in plasma were measured using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway proteins, and macrophage repolarization-related markers, were detected by western blot. RESULTS: Tert-butylhydroquinone significantly attenuated cartilage destruction in DMM-induced mice in vivo. It demonstrated clear evidence of inhibiting IL-1beta-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, inflammation, and differentiation defect in vitro. Meanwhile, tBHQ inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways, and also inhibited LPS-induced reactive oxygen species production and macrophages repolarization in vitro. CONCLUSION: Taken together, tBHQ might be a potential therapeutic strategy for protecting against OA development. Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2021;10(11):704-713.
