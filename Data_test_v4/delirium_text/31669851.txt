31669851|a|Multi-target-directed ligands seem to be an interesting approach to the treatment of complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to find novel multifunctional compounds in a non-imidazole histamine H3 receptor ligand library. Docking-based virtual screening was applied for selection of twenty-six hits which were subsequently evaluated in Ellman's assay for the inhibitory potency toward acetyl- (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The virtual screening with high success ratio enabled to choose multi-target-directed ligands. Based on docking results, all selected ligands were able to bind both catalytic and peripheral sites of AChE and BuChE. The most promising derivatives combined the flavone moiety via a six carbon atom linker with a heterocyclic moiety, such as azepane, piperidine or 3-methylpiperidine. They showed the highest inhibitory activities toward cholinesterases as well as well-balanced potencies against H3R and both enzymes. Two derivatives were chosen - 5 (IC50 = 0.46 muM (AChE); 0.44 muM (BuChE); Ki = 159.8 nM (H3R)) and 17 (IC50 = 0.50 muM (AChE); 0.76 muM (BuChE); Ki = 228.2 nM (H3R)), and their inhibition mechanism was evaluated in kinetic studies. Both compounds displayed non-competitive mode of AChE and BuChE inhibition. Compounds 5 and 17 might serve as good lead structures for further optimization and development of novel multi-target anti-Alzheimer's agents.
