34673147|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. AD drug development has been limited due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents efficient uptake of therapeutics into the brain. To solve this problem, we used trans-activator of transcription (TAT)-transducing domain and added the human serum albumin (HSA) carrier to increase the half-life of the drug within the body. In addition, we included the protein of interest for lowering Abeta deposition and/or neurofibrillary tangles. We made HSA fusion protein (designated AL04) which contains Cystatin C (CysC) as core mechanism of action moiety in the construct containing tandem repeat TAT (dTAT). After purification of 80KDa AL04, we investigate the therapeutic potential of AL04 in vitro and AD mouse model Tg2576. We evaluated the permeability of AL04 through the BBB using a cell-basedhuman BBB model and show that dTAT plays a role in facilitating the delivery of 80 kDa protein. We found out that AL04 attenuates Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. In Tg2576 mice brain, Abeta plaques were dramatically reduced in AL04 treated mice. These data suggest that BBB-crossing albumin fusion protein AL04 with CysC active moiety can be a disease modifying treatment for AD.
