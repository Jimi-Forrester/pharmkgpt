This study aimed to identify factors that delay or facilitate dementia diagnoses in racial or ethnic minoritized PLWD and elicit care partner perspectives on timing and effects of diagnosis. METHODS: Maryland-based participants cared for a PLWD age 60 or older, self-identified as Black/African/African-American, Asian, or Hispanic/Latino, and spoke English. Nineteen care partner in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis methods. RESULTS: Biological, sociocultural, and environmental factors delayed dementia diagnosis. Memory loss was the most common early symptom, but the onset was often subtle or perceived as normal aging. Stigma and secrecy surrounding dementia influenced recognition and discussion of dementia among families and communities. Diagnoses were family-initiated and started in primary care. Care partners were divided in their perceptions of diagnosis timeliness and whether earlier diagnosis would have changed outcomes. Family reactions to dementia diagnoses varied; most participants expressed a strong sentiment of service and duty to care for older family members. Participants overwhelmingly felt the benefits of obtaining a dementia diagnosis outweighed harms. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous factors affect dementia diagnosis in racial and ethnic minoritized PLWD. Normalization of brain health discussions and systematic, proactive discussion and detection of dementia in primary care may address multilevel barriers and facilitators to diagnosis. Systems-level and community-led public health interventions may also help address disparities in brain health education and dementia diagnosis.
