35163044|a|Biological sex influences disease development and progression. The steroid hormone 17beta-oestradiol (E2), along with its receptors, is expected to play a major role in the manifestation of sex differences. E2 exerts pleiotropic effects in a system-specific manner. Mitochondria are one of the central targets of E2, and their biogenesis and respiration are known to be modulated by E2. More recently, it has become apparent that E2 also regulates mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics, thereby affecting cellular metabolism. The aim of this article is to discuss the regulatory pathways by which E2 orchestrates the activity of several components of mitochondrial dynamics in the cardiovascular and nervous systems in health and disease. We conclude that E2 regulates mitochondrial dynamics to maintain the mitochondrial network promoting mitochondrial fusion and attenuating mitochondrial fission in both the cardiovascular and nervous systems.
