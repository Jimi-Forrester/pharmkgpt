33401346|a|BACKGROUND: Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), in which continuous epileptiform discharges occur without seizure-like movement, is rare and unfamiliar to anesthesiologists, both of which make this condition overlooked in patients with decreased levels of consciousness following general anesthesia. CASE: We report on an elderly female patient who developed NCSE in the immediate postoperative period after the spine surgery. Initially, delayed emergence from anesthesia was suspected, but the electroencephalogram confirmed NCSE, and anticonvulsant therapy was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed emergence is commonly attributed to cerebrovascular events or residual anesthetic effects, but NCSE must be included in the differential diagnosis, especially in elderly patients. Anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated as soon as possible for a better prognosis.
