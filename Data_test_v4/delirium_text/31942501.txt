31942501|a|With the development of geriatric medicine, more and more reported research has found that as humans grow old, their blood vessels also age. Blood vessels are vital components of various organs. Vascular aging is an important physiological and pathological basis for the aging of organs and systems of the human body and is the common pathogenesis of various chronic diseases in the elderly. Early detection of vascular aging and the use of correct methods to delay and treat vascular aging are of great significance to prevent and control chronic diseases in the elderly and to deal with the increasingly serious problems of population aging. For this purpose, this consensus is formulated for use by geriatric doctors and related personnel.
