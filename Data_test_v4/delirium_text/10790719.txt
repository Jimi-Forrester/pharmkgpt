10790719|t|A preliminary understanding of mania: roles for melatonin, vasotocin and rapid-eye-movement sleep.
10790719|a|Speculation about mania links melatonin, vasotocin and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Normal REM sleep can have the loss of reality testing and this feature intruding into the wake period could be the cause of the distorted reality present in manic delusions. REM sleep has a role in memory formation. Abnormal levels and/or rhythms of melatonin are thought to be involved in mania. Decreased melatonin production with malfunction of REM sleep is proposed to be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, because the loss of the antioxidant function of melatonin allows brain injury to occur.
