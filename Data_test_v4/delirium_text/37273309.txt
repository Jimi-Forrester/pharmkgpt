37273309|t|Local Anesthesia Approach for Percutaneous Screw Fixation of an Impacted Subcapital Femoral Neck Fracture: A Technique for High-Risk Patients.
37273309|a|Elderly, frail patients and those who have substantial medical co-morbidities who sustain hip fractures present a challenging problem for treatment as they are at very high risk for complications from surgical intervention. The functional outcomes, pain levels, and mortality rates all worsen when non-surgical treatment is used. The safety of administering general or spinal anesthesia may be a concern in certain cases. Other modalities, such as epidural or caudal anesthesia, may be an option; however, the use of local anesthesia may be advantageous for patients with non-displaced and impacted femoral neck fractures undergoing surgical intervention. We present a case report describing the successful treatment of an elderly male who had relative contraindications to spinal anesthesia and high risk for general anesthesia and was successfully treated with percutaneous screw fixation of a femoral neck fracture using local anesthesia with a light, monitored anesthetic.
