25096620|t|Divergent cognitive status with the same Braak stage of neurofibrillary pathology: does the pattern of amyloid-beta deposits make the difference?
25096620|a|The neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the co-occurrence of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes composed of abnormal tau. Over the last decades, the concept emerged that neurofibrillary changes progress in a hierarchical manner from mesial temporal structures through the associative neocortex to primary sensory and motor fields, paralleling cognitive deterioration closer than Abeta. The observation that two patients (one cognitively normal, one with dementia) exhibited neurofibrillary changes closely overlapping as regards their entity and topographic distribution but differed for characteristics of Abeta deposition suggests that the latter may directly contribute in determining cognitive impairment in AD.
