33223658|t|Neurology and COVID-19: Acting now. Preparing for Future.
33223658|a|COVID-19 has a wide-ranging and multimodal neurological impact. First, several neurological symptoms and complications are commonly observed in patients with COVID-19. Second, medications and vaccinations used to counter the disease can have secondary neurological effects. Third, patients with pre-existing neurological disorders bear an increased health-risk due to COVID-19. And finally, the pandemic has disrupted the delivery of neurological and vaccination services, and associated educational and research programs. In this article we review the various channels through which the pandemic is known or projected to effect individual patients or the practice of neurology. We also provide recommendations to manage its immediate effects and prepare for the longer-term fall-out.
