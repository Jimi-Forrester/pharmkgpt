34489922|t|Development and Validation of a Nomogram for the Prediction of Hospital Mortality of Patients With Encephalopathy Caused by Microbial Infection: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
34489922|a|BACKGROUND: Hospital mortality is high for patients with encephalopathy caused by microbial infection. Microbial infections often induce sepsis. The damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is defined as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). However, the relationship between pathogenic microorganisms and the prognosis of SAE patients is still unclear, especially gut microbiota, and there is no clinical tool to predict hospital mortality for SAE patients. The study aimed to explore the relationship between pathogenic microorganisms and the hospital mortality of SAE patients and develop a nomogram for the prediction of hospital mortality in SAE patients. METHODS: The study is a retrospective cohort study. The lasso regression model was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection. Model of hospital mortality of SAE patients was developed by multivariable Cox regression analysis. Calibration and discrimination were used to assess the performance of the nomogram. Decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the clinical utility of the model. RESULTS: Unfortunately, the results of our study did not find intestinal infection and microorganisms of the gastrointestinal (such as: Escherichia coli) that are related to the prognosis of SAE. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression indicated that factors including respiratory failure, lactate, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, SpO2, temperature, and renal replacement therapy were significantly correlated with hospital mortality. The AUC of 0.812 under the nomogram was more than that of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (0.745), indicating excellent discrimination. DCA demonstrated that using the nomogram or including the prognostic signature score status was better than without the nomogram or using the SAPS II at predicting hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of SAE patients has nothing to do with intestinal and microbial infections. We developed a nomogram that predicts hospital mortality in patients with SAE according to clinical data. The nomogram exhibited excellent discrimination and calibration capacity, favoring its clinical utility.
