35382903|t|CD-19 CART therapy and orthostatic hypotension: a single center retrospective cohort study.
35382903|a|BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy is a form of cellular immunotherapy used to treat hematologic malignancies. Major adverse cardiovascular events have been seen in CART patients who have high grade CRS, higher baseline creatinine, and troponin elevation. However, the incidence and factors associated with orthostatic hypotension after CART therapy have not previously been reported in the literature. METHODS: We looked at patients who underwent CD-19 directed CART therapy at UPMC Shadyside hospital from April 1st 2018 to December 1st 2020. Patients were classified as having orthostatic hypotension if they had recorded orthostatic vital signs that were positive or provider notes indicated that vitals had been taken and were positive in the time period from discharge to 3 months post-CART. Data was analyzed with univariate and multivariate analysis using logistic regression. RESULTS: 79% of patients had orthostatic hypotension after discharge from their CART hospitalization and 64% of those patients were symptomatic. Older age, lower BMI, lower ambulatory diastolic blood pressure and grade 2 CRS were associated with orthostatic hypotension in the univariate analysis. Older age and lower ambulatory systolic blood pressure were associated with orthostatic hypotension in the multivariate analysis. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was associated with a history of hypertension in both the univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with symptoms also had a higher pre-CART ejection fraction but this association was not seen in the regression model. CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of orthostatic hypotension after CART therapy even after discharge. Therefore, orthostatic vitals signs and associated symptoms should be assessed in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Older patients and patients with lower BMIs, lower ambulatory blood pressures, grade 2 CRS, or a history of hypertension may need closer monitoring.
