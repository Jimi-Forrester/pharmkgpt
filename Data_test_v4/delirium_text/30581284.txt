30581284|t|Can psychopathology and neuroscience coexist in psychiatric classifications?
30581284|a|A crisis of confidence was triggered by the disappointment that diagnostic validity, an important goal, was not achieved with the publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project, which provides a framework for neuroscientific research, was initially conceptualized as an alternative to DSM. However, RDoC and DSM are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. From a historical perspective, this article argues that the debate opposing psychology and brain in psychiatric classification is not new and has an air of deja vu. We go back to the first classifications based on a scientific taxonomy in the late 18th century with Boissier de Sauvages, which were supposed to describe diseases as they really existed in nature. Emil Kraepelin successfully associated psychopathology and brain research, prefiguring the interaction between DSM and RDoC. DSM symptoms remain valuable because they are the only data that are immediately and directly observable. Computational science is a promising instrument to interconnect psychopathological and neuroscientific data in the future.
