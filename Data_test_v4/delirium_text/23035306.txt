23035306|a|[<sup>125</sup>I](<i>E</i>)-<i>N</i>-1-(3'-iodoallyl)-<i>N</i>'-4-(3'',4''-dimethoxyphenethyl)-piperazine, abbreviated as [<sup>125</sup>I]<b><i>E</i>-1</b>, is a hybrid structure of two known ligands: TPCNE (1(<i>trans</i>-iodopropen-2-yl)-4-[(4-cyanophenoxy)methyl]piperidine) and SA4503 (1-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine). [<sup>125</sup>I]<b><i>E</i>-1</b> was synthesized for use with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of sigma-1 (s1) receptors (1). s1 receptor is a protein that is widely distributed in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs. There are at least two subtypes of s receptors, s1 receptor and s2 receptor. Although the functions of s2 receptor are poorly understood, s1 receptor is believed to act as a modulator of the signal transduction in neurotransmitter systems (2, 3). s1 receptor primarily resides at the interface between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux by acting as a molecular chaperone for type 3 inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors. s1 receptor can also translocate to the plasma membrane, where it regulates the voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, K<sup>+</sup> channels, and other membrane-bound proteins (2, 4). Increasing evidence suggests that s1 receptor is involved in a range of CNS diseases such as affective disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, substance abuse, Parkinson s disease, and Alzheimer s disease (4, 5). Studies on postmortem human brains have shown that the density of s1 receptor decreased in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer s disease (6). Discovery of specific ligands for s1 receptors has further prompted development of efficient imaging probes for neuropsychiatric diseases by targeting s1 receptor (3, 5). TPCNE and SA4503 are among the radiotracers investigated for s receptor imaging. TPCNE has an affinity of <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.67 nM (log <i>P</i> = 3.36) for s1 receptors, and SA4503 has an affinity of <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = ~5 nM (log <i>P</i> = 2.52) for s1 receptors (7-9). Both exhibit good specific binding to s1 receptors in rat brains and in human brains. Lever et al. synthesized four hybrid structure-related <i>N</i>-1-allyl-<i>N</i>'-4-phenethylpiperazines (<b><i>E</i>-1</b>, <b><i>Z</i>-1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>) from TPCNE and SA4503 on the basis of the hypothesis that hybrid structures might be suitable scaffolds for developing radioiodinated ligands that have high s1 receptor affinities and appropriate lipophilicities for <i>in vivo</i> studies (1). Lever et al. selected <b><i>E</i>-1</b> and <b><i>Z</i>-1</b> to probe the effect of geometric isomerism upon s receptor binding and to discriminate the contribution of the iodine atom through comparison with the allyl analog <b>2</b> (1). Compound <b>3</b>, which is a monomethyl analog and is likely to be a metabolite of <b><i>E</i>-1</b>, was used in the studies to determine the radiometabolites of [<sup>125</sup>I]<b><i>E</i>-1</b>. The results obtained by Lever et al. showed that [<sup>125</sup>I]<b><i>E</i>-1</b> was a selective s1 receptor antagonist that exhibited properties amenable to <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, with possible extension to SPECT using iodine-123 (1).
