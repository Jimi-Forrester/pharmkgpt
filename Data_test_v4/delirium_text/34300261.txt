34300261|t|Influence of Anxiety/Depression, Age, Gender and ASA on 1-Year Follow-Up Outcomes Following Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty in 5447 Patients.
34300261|a|INTRODUCTION: There are many factors influencing the outcome after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). In particular, patient-related factors such as age, gender, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists), or preoperative anxiety/depression have become increasingly important. The aim of this study was to examine the association of these parameters with 1-year postoperative outcomes after total knee and total hip arthroplasty (TKA, THA). METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 5447 TJA patients was evaluated by pre- and postoperative analysis of EQ-5D, EQ-VAS and WOMAC Score. Furthermore, major focus was put on the association between age, gender, ASA, preoperative anxiety/depression and outcome parameters. RESULTS: 53.3% (2903/5447) of all patients were identified with anxiety/depression at time of surgery. In the analysis, patients without anxiety/depression showed statistically significantly (p < 0.05) better EQ-5D, EQ-VAS and WOMAC scores. In addition, patients with ASA 2 or 3 and age over 70 years showed statistically significantly (p < 0.01) worse EQ-5D and WOMAC scores. Gender did not influence the postoperative EQ-5D and WOMAC results, but men had significantly better EQ-VAS scores than women in this study. CONCLUSION: Preoperative anxiety/depression symptoms show worse clinical outcomes 1 year postoperatively after TJA. Other outcome-influencing factors are higher age and ASA 2 or 3. In the future, such patients should be identified, and as far as applicable, a treatment of anxiety/depression or comorbidities should be implemented preoperatively of the surgical procedure to improve clinical outcomes.
