34576297|t|Kynurenine Pathway of Tryptophan Metabolism in Migraine and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.
34576297|a|Migraine, the leading cause of disability in the population aged below 50, is associated with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGIDs) such as functional nausea, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Conversely, changes in intestinal GI transit may cause diarrhea or constipation and are a component of the autonomic symptoms associated with pre- and post-dorsal phases of migraine attack. These mutual relationships provoke a question on a common trigger in migraine and FGIDs. The kynurenine (l-kyn) pathway (KP) is the major route for l-tryptophan (l-Trp) metabolism and transforms l-Trp into several neuroactive compounds. Changes in KP were reported in both migraine and FGIDs. Migraine was largely untreatable, but several drugs approved lately by the FDA, including monoclonal antibodies for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor, create a hope for a breakthrough in migraine treatment. Derivatives of l-kyn were efficient in pain relief with a mechanism including CGRP inhibition. KP products are important ligands to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), whose activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of GI and migraine. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may play a role in migraine and IBS pathogeneses, and KP metabolites detected downstream of TLR activation may be an IBS marker. The TLR4 signaling was observed in initiating and maintaining migraine-like behavior through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) in the mouse. The aim of this review is to justify the view that KP modulation may provide common triggers for migraine and FGIDs with the involvement of TLR, AhR, and MyD88 activation.
