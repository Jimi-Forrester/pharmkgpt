31926631|a|Under physiological conditions, vitamin C is the main antioxidant found in the central nervous system and is found in two states: reduced as ascorbic acid (AA) and oxidized as dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). However, under pathophysiological conditions, AA is oxidized to DHA. The oxidation of AA and subsequent production of DHA in neurons are associated with a decrease in GSH concentrations, alterations in glucose metabolism and neuronal death. To date, the endogenous molecules that act as intrinsic regulators of neuronal necroptosis under conditions of oxidative stress are unknown. Here, we show that treatment with AA regulates the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic genes. Vitamin C also regulates the expression of RIPK1/MLKL, whereas the oxidation of AA in neurons induces morphological alterations consistent with necroptosis and MLKL activation. The activation of necroptosis by AA oxidation in neurons results in bubble formation, loss of membrane integrity, and ultimately, cellular explosion. These data suggest that necroptosis is a target for cell death induced by vitamin C.
