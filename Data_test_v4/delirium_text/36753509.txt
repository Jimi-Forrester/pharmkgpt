36753509|a|BACKGROUND: The predictive value of biomarkers such as neuron specific enolase (NSE), S100B, neurofilament (NFL), interleukin-6 (IL-6), coagulation factor R, and D-Dimer (DD) after acute Stanford A type aortic dissection (AAAD) with neurological complications has recently gained much attention from the research community. However, results from these studies are conflicting. This meta-analysis is conducted to assess the relationship between the biomarkers and the risk of neurological complications after AAAD. METHODS: Two reviewers performed a systematic literature search across eight databases (CNKI, Wan Fang, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE). The studies regarding biomarkers in AAAD patients published up to February 2022 were included. These studies were subjected to rigorous scrutiny and data extraction to determine the weighted mean difference (WMD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI), which were analyzed using the RevMan 5.4 and Stata software 14.0. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies including 360 cases with neurological complications and 766 controls were incorporated into our meta-analysis. WMD analysis showed that there was a higher NSE levels in AAAD patients with postoperative neurological complications compared with controls (WMD = 0.640, 95% CI: 0.205 ~ 1.075, P = 0.004 < 0.005), and the level of S100B was related to the 6 h and 24 h postoperative neurological complications (6 h: WMD = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.27 ~ 1.02, P = 0.0007 < 0.001; 24 h: WMD = 0.281, 95% CI: 0.211 ~ 0.351, P < 0.001). Moreover, S100B levels at 6 hours after operation were significantly higher than that at 24 hours (WMD = 0.260, 95% CI: 0.166 ~ 0.354, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: NSE and S100B are both candidate biomarkers to predict postoperative neurological complications in patients with AAAD. Other markers are also valuable when used in conjunction with clinical judgement. The findings accentuate the necessity of further research to establish standardized values for these biomarkers in predicting neurological complications.
