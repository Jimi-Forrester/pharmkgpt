26227998|t|Battling Alzheimer's Disease: Targeting SUMOylation-Mediated Pathways.
26227998|a|SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) conjugation is a critically important control process in all eukaryotic cells, because it acts as a biochemical switch and regulates the function of hundreds of proteins in many different pathways. Although the diverse functional consequences and molecular targets of SUMOylation remain largely unknown, SUMOylation is becoming increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apart from the central SUMO-modified disease-associated proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein, amyloid beta, and tau, SUMOylation also regulates several other processes underlying AD. These are involved in inflammation, mitochondrial dynamics, synaptic transmission and plasticity, as well as in protective responses to cell stress. Herein, we review current reports on the involvement of SUMOylation in AD, and present an overview of potential SUMO targets and pathways underlying AD pathogenesis.
