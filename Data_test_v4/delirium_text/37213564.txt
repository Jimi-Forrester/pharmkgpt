37213564|t|Brain Circuitry of Consciousness: A Review of Current Models and a Novel Synergistic Model With Clinical Application.
37213564|a|How consciousness arises in the brain has important implications for clinical decision-making. We summarize recent findings in consciousness studies to provide a toolkit for clinicians to assess deficits in consciousness and predict outcomes after brain injury. Commonly encountered disorders of consciousness are highlighted, followed by the clinical scales currently used to diagnose them. We review recent evidence describing the roles of the thalamocortical system and brainstem arousal nuclei in supporting awareness and arousal and discuss the utility of various neuroimaging studies in evaluating disorders of consciousness. We explore recent theoretical progress in mechanistic models of consciousness, focusing on 2 major models, the global neuronal workspace and integrated information theory, and review areas of controversy. Finally, we consider the potential implications of recent research for the day-to-day decision-making of clinical neurosurgeons and propose a simple "three-strikes" model to infer the integrity of the thalamocortical system, which can guide prognosticating return to consciousness.
