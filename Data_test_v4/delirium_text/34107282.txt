Among them, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has emerged as a major factor in the etiology of the disease. Our group is devoted to the study of the relationship among HSV-1, oxidative stress (OS) and neurodegeneration. We have found that HSV-1 induces the main neuropathological hallmarks of AD, including the accumulation of intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta), hyperphosphorylated tau protein and autophagic vesicles, that OS exacerbates these effects, and that matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14) participates in the alterations induced by OS. In this work, we focused on the role of MMP-14 in the degenerative markers raised by HSV-1 infection. Interestingly, we found that MMP-14 blockage is a potent inhibitor of HSV-1 infection efficiency, that also reduces the degeneration markers, accumulation of Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau, induced by the virus. Our results point to MMP-14 as a potent antiviral target to control HSV-1 infection and its associated neurodegenerative effects.
