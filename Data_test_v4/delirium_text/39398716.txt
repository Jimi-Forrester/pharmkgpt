39398716|t|Challenging Diagnosis: Babesiosis With a Coincidental Intraabdominal Mass.
39398716|a|Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by an intraerythrocytic parasite known as Babesia spp. Its clinical presentation is often nonspecific and can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening, depending on the host's immune status. This myriad of manifestations potentially overlaps with other familiar conditions such as hematologic malignancy. Fortunately, despite the variability of presentations, babesiosis can be effectively diagnosed by using simple and cost-effective methods like peripheral blood smears. Recognizing diverse presentations of babesiosis is crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely management. In this case, we highlight the importance of avoiding diagnostic anchoring and including babesiosis in the differential diagnosis, particularly in endemic areas and in the setting of uncommon complications such as splenic infarction.
