8281016|a|Several point mutations within exons 16 and 17 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have been reported that are associated with Alzheimer's disease in a small number of familial cases. To determine the size of the APP gene and the organization of the exons within human genomic DNA, we have characterized 11 Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC) recombinants containing human APP gene sequences. The smallest YAC insert was 125 kb, and the largest was 1.4 Mb. The YACs were screened by polymerase chain reaction amplification of APP exons to determine which of the 18 exons coding for APP770 were present. Four of the YACs (D110G1, D110G6, D110E9, and B142F9) contain all 18 exons and at least part of the promoter. Construction of an overlapping map of the gene with all of the YACs demonstrated that 3 of the 11 YACs were chimeric. The orientation and position of the coding sequence on the map was determined by probing digests of the YAC DNA with exon PCR products and the vector arms. The coding region of the APP gene spans approximately 400 kb of genomic DNA.
