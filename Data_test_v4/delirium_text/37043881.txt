37043881|a|This study longitudinally examined participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who underwent a conversion in amyloid-beta (Abeta) status in comparison to a group of ADNI participants who did not show a change in amyloid status over the same follow-up period. Participants included 136 ADNI dementia-free participants with 2 florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Of these participants, 68 showed amyloid conversion as measured on florbetapir PET, and the other 68 did not. Amyloid converters and non-converters were chosen to have representative demographic data (age, education, sex, diagnostic status, and race). The amyloid converter group showed increased prevalence of APOE epsilon4 (p < 0.001), greater annualized percent volume loss in selected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) regions (p < 0.05), lower cerebrospinal fluid Abeta1-42 (p < 0.001), and greater amyloid retention (as measured by standard uptake value ratios) on florbetapir PET scans (p < 0.001) in comparison to the non-converter group. These results provide compelling evidence that important neuropathological changes are occurring alongside amyloid conversion.
