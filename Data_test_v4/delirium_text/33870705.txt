33870705|t|Impact of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy Versus Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion on Cognitive Function and Quality of Life in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.
33870705|a|Background We compared the cognitive status and quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) or remaining on oral anticoagulation (OAC) after atrial fibrillation ablation. Methods and Results Cognition was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) survey at baseline and follow-up. Consecutive patients receiving LAAO or OAC after atrial fibrillation ablation were screened, and patients with a score of <=17 were excluded from the study. Quality of life was measured at baseline and 1 year using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life survey. A total of 50 patients (CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age>=75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex category] score: 3.30+-1.43) in the LAAO group and 48 (CHA2DS2-VASc score 2.73+-1.25) in the OAC group were included in this prospective study. Mean baseline MoCA score was 26.18 and 26.08 in the LAAO and OAC groups, respectively (P=0.846). At 1 year, scores were 26.94 and 23.38 in the respective groups. MoCA score decreased by an estimated -2.74 (95% CI, -3.61 to -1.87; P<0.0001) points in the OAC group, whereas the change in the LAAO group was nonsignificant (0.79; (95% CI, -0.06 to 1.64; P=0.07). After adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, remaining on OAC was an independent predictor of MoCA change at 1 year (regression coefficient, -3.38; 95% CI, -4.75 to -2.02; P<0.0001). Change in Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life score did not differ significantly in achieving a clinically important difference between groups. Conclusions In this series, a significant difference in the postprocedure MoCA score was observed in postablation patients with atrial fibrillation receiving LAAO versus remaining on OAC with a substantial decline in the score in the OAC group. However, quality of life improved similarly across groups. Registration https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01816308.
