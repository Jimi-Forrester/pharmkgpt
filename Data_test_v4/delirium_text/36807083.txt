36807083|t|Role of long noncoding RNAs; BDNF-AS and 17A and their relation to GABAergic dysfunction in Egyptian epileptic patients.
36807083|a|Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Lately, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly appreciated as regulators of epilepsy-related processes, however, their functional role in its pathogenesis is still to be explored. This study investigated the expression levels of lncRNAs; BDNF-AS and 17A in the sera of Egyptian patients with idiopathic generalized and symptomatic focal epilepsy and correlated their levels with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP reaction element -binding protein (p-CREB), gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, to underline their related molecular mechanism. A total of 70 epileptic patients were divided into two clinical types, besides 30 healthy controls of matched age and sex. The expression levels of both lncRNAs were markedly upregulated in epileptic groups versus the healthy control group with predominance in the symptomatic focal one. Epileptic patients showed significantly lower levels of BDNF, p-CREB, GABA along with significant increase of glutamate levels and glutamate/ GABA ratio, especially in symptomatic focal versus idiopathic generalized epileptic ones. The obtained data raised the possibility that these lncRNAs might be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy via inhibition of GABA/p-CREB/BDNF pathway. The study shed light on the putative role of these lncRNAs in better diagnosis of epilepsy, particularly symptomatic focal epilepsy.
