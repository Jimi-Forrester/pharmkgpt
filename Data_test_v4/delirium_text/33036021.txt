33036021|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. We examined whether this relationship hold true in older adults, who have a higher prevalence of both CKD and dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a cross-sectional secondary analysis of an established observational cohort. We analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), an NIH funded, multicenter longitudinal observational study, which includes participants with normal and impaired cognition and assesses cognition with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. We included a non-probability sample of all ADNI participants with serum creatinine measurements at baseline (N = 1181). Using multivariable linear regression analysis, we related the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation eGFR with validated composite scores for memory (ADNI-mem) and executive function (ADNI-EF). RESULTS: For the 1181 ADNI participants, the mean age was 73.7 +- 7.1 years. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 76.4 +- 19.7; 6% had eGFR<45, 22% had eGFR of 45 to <60, 51% had eGFR of 60-90 and 21% had eGFR>90 ml/min/1.73 m2. The mean ADNI-Mem score was 0.241 +- 0.874 and mean ADNI-EF score was 0.160 +- 1.026. In separate multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race education and BMI, there was no association between each 10 ml/ min/1.73 m2 higher eGFR and ADNI-Mem (beta -0.02, 95% CI -0.04, 0.02, p = 0.56) or ADNI-EF (beta 0.01, 95% CI -0.03, 0.05, p = 0.69) scores. CONCLUSION: We did not observe an association between eGFR and cognition in the older ADNI participants.
