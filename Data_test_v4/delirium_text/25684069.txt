25684069|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rivastigmine patch is approved for the treatment of all stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Application site reactions may be a concern to clinicians and we used two large clinical trial databases to investigate the incidence of skin reactions in patients receiving rivastigmine patch. METHODS: Data from a 24-week, randomised, double-blind (DB) evaluation of 13.3 vs. 4.6 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch in severe AD (ACTION) and a 72- to 96-week study comprising an initial open-label (IOL) phase followed by a 48-week randomised, DB phase (13.3 vs. 9.5 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch) in declining patients with mild-to-moderate AD (OPTIMA) were analyzed. The incidence, frequency, severity, management and predictors of application site reactions were assessed. RESULTS: Application site reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity and reported by similar proportions in each treatment group ( ACTION: 13.3 mg/24 h, 24.5% and 4.6 mg/24 h, 24.2%; OPTIMA: IOL 9.5 mg/24 h, 22.9%; DB 13.3 mg/24 h, 11.4% and 9.5 mg/24 h, 12.0%); none were rated serious. In both studies, <9% of patients required treatment for application site reactions. Application site reactions led to discontinuation of 1.7% and 2.5% of the 13.3 mg/24 h and 4.6 mg/24 h groups, respectively, in ACTION, 8.7% in OPTIMA IOL and 1.8% and 3.5% of the 13.3 mg/24 h and 9.5 mg/24 h groups, respectively, in OPTIMA DB. CONCLUSIONS: Application site reactions were experienced by <25% of patients in both studies, with no notable effect of dose. No reactions qualified as serious and skin reactions were uncommon as a reason for study discontinuation.
