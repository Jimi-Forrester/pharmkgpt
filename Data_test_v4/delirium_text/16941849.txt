16941849|a|OBJECTIVES: Determine alcohol use, referrals to treatment, receiving treatment, and medical problems related to alcohol among fathers who have children with FAS or incomplete FAS. METHODS: Fathers who had American Indian children with FAS (Study 1) or incomplete FAS (Study 2) were compared with fathers whose children did not have FAS. RESULTS: About half of case and control fathers had alcohol use and alcohol-related medical problems documented in their medical records. Case fathers were more likely to receive alcohol treatment and have injuries related to alcohol abuse. CONCLUSION: Significantly more fathers of children with FAS were referred for alcohol treatment, received alcohol treatment, experienced injuries, and had delirium tremens than control fathers. Fathers of children with incomplete FAS were significantly more likely to drink alcohol, to have received alcohol treatment, and to have alcohol-related medical problems and injuries than control fathers.
