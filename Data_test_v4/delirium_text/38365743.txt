38365743|t|Association between dietary vitamin B1 intake and cognitive function among older adults: a cross-sectional study.
38365743|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the relationship between vitamin B1 intake and cognitive function in older adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. A total of 2422 participants were included in the analysis, with dietary vitamin B1 intake being determined by averaging two 24-h dietary recalls. Cognitive function was assessed using three cognitive function tests: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) for processing speed, the Animal Fluency Test (AFT) for executive function, a Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) subtest for memory. Test-specific and global cognition z score was created. Multivariate linear regression models were used to explore the association between vitamin B1 and cognitive function. RESULTS: 2422 participants, aged 60 years and older, were included from NHANES across two survey cycles (2011-2014). Higher vitamin B1 intake was associated with higher DSST, AFT scores (P < 0.001) as well as the global cognition z score (P = 0.008). In the fully adjusted model, as compared to the lowest quartile (Q1), the highest quartile (Q4) of vitamin B1 intake was related to higher DSST score (beta = 2.23, 95% CI 0.79 ~ 3.67) and global cognition z sore (beta = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 ~ 0.16). The association between dietary vitamin B1 intake and cognitive function scores in US adults is linear. There was no detected significant statistical interaction between these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Increased dietary intake of vitamin B1 was associated with better cognitive function in individuals aged over 60.
