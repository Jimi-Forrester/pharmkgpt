10718203|t|Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of metrifonate in patients with probable Alzheimer disease. The Metrifonate Study Group.
10718203|a|A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a once-daily oral administration of metrifonate in patients with probable mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Metrifonate was given as a loading dose of 125-225 mg based on weight (2.5 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 50-90 mg based on weight (1.0 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Twenty-nine patients received metrifonate, and 10 patients received placebo. Metrifonate produced a mean erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase inhibition at the end of treatment of 86.3%. The proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event was comparable between the metrifonate (76%) and placebo (80%) groups. Selected adverse events in disfavor of metrifonate (defined as those for which the incidence in the metrifonate and placebo groups differed by at least 10%) were diarrhea, nausea, leg cramps, and accidental injury. Adverse events were predominantly mild in intensity and transient. No severe adverse events were experienced by any patient. The most notable hemodynamic change observed during metrifonate treatment was a clinically insignificant mean decrease in the heart rate (by electrocardiogram) of approximately 9 beats/min, compared with an approximate 3-beats/min decrease for the placebo group. No muscle weakness was observed in this study. No clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities, such as liver toxicity, or changes in exercise tolerance or pulmonary function tests were found with metrifonate treatment. This metrifonate dose provided a high level of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which was associated in these patients with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Indeed, the magnitude of the peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibition is the highest tolerable inhibition level yet observed.
