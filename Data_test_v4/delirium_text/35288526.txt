35288526|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome can experience prolonged periods of ventilation, high incidence of delirium, and require high amounts of sedation. Tracheostomy has been associated with earlier ventilator liberation, decreased sedation needs, and lower rates of delirium but optimal timing of tracheostomy remains unknown. Is tracheostomy associated with lower sedation requirements and lower incidence of delirium in patients with COVID-19 that are intubated? METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the first 32 patients at a large urban tertiary referral center that underwent tracheostomy for prolonged respiratory failure. We obtained Richmond Agitation Sedation-Scale scores and Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit data along with amount(s) and type(s) of sedating medications given, in the 7 days before and after tracheostomy. Proportion of days delirious and sedating medications were compared in the 7 days before and after tracheostomy. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the amount of opioids and benzodiazepines in the 7-day period following tracheostomy. Opioid dosing decreased by 157.5 morphine equivalents (SD=339, P =0.01) and benzodiazepine dosing decreased by 18 mg lorazepam equivalents (SD=34, P =0.01). There was no significant difference in antipsychotic or other sedative-hyponotic drug doses. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of days of coma or delirium (mean decrease in proportion=0.16, SD=0.32, P =0.008) following tracheostomy. CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy was associated with a significant decrease amount of sedating medications and with a decrease in proportion of days delirious following tracheostomy.
