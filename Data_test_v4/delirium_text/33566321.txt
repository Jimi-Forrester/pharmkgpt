33566321|t|Residue Interaction Network Analysis Predicts a Val24-Ile31 Interaction May be Involved in Preventing Amyloid-Beta (1-42) Primary Nucleation.
33566321|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients could benefit from a more effective treatment than the current FDA-approved options. Because amyloid-beta (Abeta) is thought to play a central role in AD pathogenesis, many experimental drugs attempt to reduce Abeta-induced pathology. Preventing amyloid accumulation may be a more effective strategy than clearing Abeta plaques after they form. If preventing Abeta accumulation can treat or prevent AD, then understanding Abeta primary nucleation may aid rational drug design. This study examines Abeta residue interaction networks and reports network and structural observations that may provide insight into primary nucleation. While many studies identify structural features of Abeta that promote aggregation, this study reports features that may resist primary nucleation by examining Abeta42 studies in more and less polar solvents. In Abeta42 in a less polar solvent (PDB ID: 1IYT), Val24 and Ile31 have higher betweenness and residue centrality values. This may be due to a predicted interaction between Val24 and Ile31. Residues in the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC) of Abeta40 and Abeta42 had significantly higher betweenness values compared to the average betweenness of the structures, highlighting the CHC's reported role in oligomerization. The predicted interaction between Val24 and Ile31 may reduce the likelihood of primary nucleation of Abeta.
