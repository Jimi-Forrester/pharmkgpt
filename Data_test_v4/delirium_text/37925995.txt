37925995|t|Associations between recall of proper names in story recall and CSF amyloid and tau in adults without cognitive impairment.
37925995|a|Neuropsychological measures sensitive to decline in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease are needed. We previously demonstrated that higher amyloid-beta (Abeta) assessed by positron emission tomography in adults without cognitive impairment was associated with recall of fewer proper names in Logical Memory story recall. The current study investigated the association between proper names and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Abeta42/40, phosphorylated tau181 [pTau181], neurofilament light) in 223 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention. We assessed associations between biomarkers and delayed Logical Memory total score and proper names using binary logistic regressions. Sensitivity analyses used multinomial logistic regression and stratified biomarker groups. Lower Logical Memory total score and proper names scores from the most recent visit were associated with biomarker positivity. Relatedly, there was a 27% decreased risk of being classified Abeta42/40+/pTau181+ for each additional proper name recalled. A linear mixed effects model found that longitudinal change in proper names recall was predicted by biomarker status. These results demonstrate a novel relationship between proper names and Alzheimer's disease-cerebrospinal fluid pathology.
