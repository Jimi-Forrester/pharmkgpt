Recently, a new index called the Mediterranean-dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet intervention for the neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet has been developed. In the current study, we aimed to assess the relationship between the MIND diet and the risk of breast cancer (BC) among Tehranian adult women. METHOD: In this hospital-based, case-control study, 134 Tehranian women >= 30 years old with recently (< 6 months) diagnosed BC, confirmed histologically and 272 women of the same age as control were included. Dietary intakes were assessed in a personal interview using a valid and reliable semi-quantitative 168-item food frequency questionnaire. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of breast cancer across tertiles of the MIND diet were determined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In the crude model, participants in the highest tertiles had lower odds of BC [(OR = 0.57; 95% CI,0.34-0.95), P for trend = 0.020)] than those with the lowest scores on the MIND diet. After controlling for potential confounding variables, individuals in the highest tertile of the MIND diet had a 45% lower risk of BC [(OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.96), P for trend = 0.021)] compared with those in the lowest tertile. Also, in women with an abortion history, higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a lower risk of BC [(OR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.52, P for trend = 0.002)]. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with decreased BC risk, which was strongly observed among women with a history of abortion.
