32346662|a|Environmental, genetic and epigenetic risk factors have been closely related to the development of type-2 diabetes (T2D). It has been reported that the expression in H19 and MALAT1 are related to metabolic diseases. To analyze the relationship between the expression of H19 and MALAT1 lncRNAs with diabetic patients. A study was conducted in subjects with T2D and nondiabetic controls, residents of Mexico City. Anthropometric measurements were made, and serum concentrations of glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted from serum and serum exosomes. The H19 and MALAT1 expression levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. A significant reduction in the expression of MALAT1 from serum or serum exosomes were found in patients with T2D, metabolic syndrome and low levels of HDL-c. Significant increase in H19 levels was found in diabetic subjects with poor glycemic control. Additionally, the principal component analyzes showed that serum MALAT1 expression was associated with total cholesterol and HDL-c levels, and the exosomes H19 expression was associated with waist circumference. The results obtained suggest that MALAT1 expression levels could be an epigenetic biomarker of diabetes risk or of its comorbidities.
