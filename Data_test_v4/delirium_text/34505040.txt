34505040|t|Prevalence and Prognosis Impact of Frailty Among Older Adults in Cardiac Intensive Care Units.
34505040|a|BACKGROUND: Whether frailty, defined as a biological syndrome that reflects a state of decreased physiological reserve and vulnerability to stressors, may impact the outcomes of elderly patients admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) remains unclear. We aimed to determine the prevalence of frailty and its impact on mortality in patients aged >= 80 years admitted to a CICU. METHODS: This prospective single-centre observational study was conducted among patients aged >= 80 years admitted to a CICU in a tertiary centre. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS), which provides a score ranging from 0 (not frail) to 17 (very frail). The population was divided into 3 classes: EFS-score of 0-3, EFS-score of 4-6, and EFS-score > 7. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients were included, and median follow-up duration was 365 days. The mean age was 84.8 years, and 50 patients (25.1%) died during the follow-up period. In all, 45 (22.6%), 60 (30.2%), and 94 patients (47.2%) had an EFS-score of 0-3, 4-6, and >= 7, respectively. The all-cause mortality rate was 4.4%, 27.1%, and 37.2% in the 0-3, 4-6, and >= 7 EFS-score groups, respectively (P < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, frailty status remained associated with all-cause mortality: hazard ratio was 2.60 (95% confidence interval 0.54-12.45) within the 4-6 EFS-score group, and 5.46 (95% confidence interval 1.23-24.08) within the >= 7 EFS-score group. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is highly prevalent in older adults admitted to the population hospitalized in a CICU and represents a strong prognostic factor for 1-year all-cause mortality.
