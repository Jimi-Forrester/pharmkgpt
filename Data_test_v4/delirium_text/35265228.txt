35265228|t|Metabolic phenotyping of tear fluid as a prognostic tool for personalised medicine exemplified by T2DM patients.
35265228|a|Background/aims: Concerning healthcare approaches, a paradigm change from reactive medicine to predictive approaches, targeted prevention, and personalisation of medical services is highly desirable. This raises demand for biomarker signatures that support the prediction and diagnosis of diseases, as well as monitoring strategies regarding therapeutic efficacy and supporting individualised treatments. New methodological developments should preferably rely on non-invasively sampled biofluids like sweat and tears in order to provide optimal compliance, reduce costs, and ensure availability of the biomaterial. Here, we have thus investigated the metabolic composition of human tears in comparison to finger sweat in order to find biofluid-specific marker molecules derived from distinct secretory glands. The comprehensive investigation of numerous biofluids may lead to the identification of novel biomarker signatures. Moreover, tear fluid analysis may not only provide insight into eye pathologies but may also be relevant for the prediction and monitoring of disease progression and/ or treatment of systemic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Sweat and tear fluid were sampled from 20 healthy volunteers using filter paper and commercially available Schirmer strips, respectively. Finger sweat analysis has already been successfully established in our laboratory. In this study, we set up and evaluated methods for tear fluid extraction and analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry hyphenated with liquid chromatography, using optimised gradients each for metabolites and eicosanoids. Sweat and tears were systematically compared using statistical analysis. As second approach, we performed a clinical pilot study with 8 diabetic patients and compared them to 19 healthy subjects. Results: Tear fluid was found to be a rich source for metabolic phenotyping. Remarkably, several molecules previously identified by us in sweat were found significantly enriched in tear fluid, including creatine or taurine. Furthermore, other metabolites such as kahweol and various eicosanoids were exclusively detectable in tears, demonstrating the orthogonal power for biofluid analysis in order to gain information on individual health states. The clinical pilot study revealed that many endogenous metabolites that have previously been linked to type 2 diabetes such as carnitine, tyrosine, uric acid, and valine were indeed found significantly up-regulated in tears of diabetic patients. Nicotinic acid and taurine were elevated in the diabetic cohort as well and may represent new biomarkers for diabetes specifically identified in tear fluid. Additionally, systemic medications, like metformin, bisoprolol, and gabapentin, were readily detectable in tears of patients. Conclusions: The high number of identified marker molecules found in tear fluid apparently supports disease development prediction, developing preventive approaches as well as tailoring individual patients' treatments and monitoring treatment efficacy. Tear fluid analysis may also support pharmacokinetic studies and patient compliance control.
