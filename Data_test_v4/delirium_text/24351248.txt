24351248|t|La lunga attesa: towards a molecular approach to neuroimaging and therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease.
24351248|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the gradual onset of dementia. The pathological hallmarks of the disease are Abeta amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), synaptic loss and reactive gliosis. Current diagnosis of AD is made by clinical, neuropsychologic, and neuroimaging assessments. Routine structural neuroimaging evaluation with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is based on non-specific features such as atrophy, a late feature in the progression of the disease, hence the crucial importance of developing new approaches for early and specific recognition at the prodromal stages of AD. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), possibly in conjuction with other related Abeta biomarkers in plasma and CSF, could prove to be valuable in the differential diagnosis of AD, as well as in assessing prognosis. With the advent of new therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the Abeta amyloid burden in the brain, there is increasing interest in the development of MRI contrast agents and PET and SPECT radioligands that will permit the assessment of Abeta amyloid burden in vivo. - ma dov'e / la lenta processione di stagioni / che fu un'alba infinita e senza strade, / dov'e la lunga attesa e qual e il nome / del vuoto che ci invade. - Eugenio Montale.
