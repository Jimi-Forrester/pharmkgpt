35716167|t|Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of Coronaviruses with Particular Emphasis on SARS-CoV-2 Virus.
35716167|a|The rapidly spreading Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global health crisis and has left a deep mark on society, culture, and the global economy. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, SARS-CoV-2 still poses a threat on a global scale. The current epidemiological situation caused an urgent need to understand the basic mechanisms of the virus transmission and COVID-19 severe course. This review summarizes current knowledge on clinical courses, diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. Moreover, we have included the latest research results on the genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and genetic determinants of susceptibility and severity to infection.
