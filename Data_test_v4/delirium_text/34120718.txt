34120718|a|The choroid plexus (CP) is an epithelial tissue primarily responsible for the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Choroid plexuses are found in each of the four brain ventricles: two laterals, third and fourth. They ensure continuous production of CSF to provide nutrients, remove waste products and provide a mechanical buffer to protect the brain. Tight junctions in the CP epithelium form a barrier between the blood plasma and the CSF, which allow channels and transporters in the CP to establish a highly regulated concentration gradient of ions between the two fluids, thereby controlling the composition of CSF. CP plays an important part in healthy brain homeostasis, as its failure to maintain adequate CSF perfusion is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. And yet, the physiology of CP and the mechanism of its age-related functional decline is one of the most understudied areas of neurobiology. Here, we describe a protocol to isolate and identify individual choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) from murine brain for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and ion channel identification. Using the recording from the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1 and TRPM3 that are abundant in CP, we demonstrate a technique to study the regulators of ion channels in the choroid plexus.
