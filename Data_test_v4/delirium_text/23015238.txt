23015238|a|Stigma against chronic disease or mental illness is a well-known phenomenon and results in devastating consequences for individuals who suffer from these diseases and their families. However, few studies have evaluated the stigma and its various processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present review is to discuss the concepts that underlie stigma and its different forms, and then to explain its causes and consequences. Indeed, if the stigma primarily affects individuals with a diagnosis of AD, recent studies have shown that the caregivers of the patients as well as their relatives are also exposed to stigma by association. Moreover, past and current studies on other chronic diseases highlight the importance of using methods issued from experimental social psychology to assess the explicit representations but also the implicit stigma associated with the disease. Finally, several researches and possible interventions are proposed to reduce the stigma associated with AD and related concepts such as MCI.
