2341561|a|Dementing diseases cause a deterioration in the capacity for independent living skills (ILS). The present study investigated the level of insight in ILS impairment in 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 12 multi-infarct dementia (MID) patients, and 12 normal elderly controls, using two different measurement techniques: informant report and patient self-report. Pairwise comparisons at the .05 level revealed a significantly greater loss of insight for ILS impairment in AD patients as compared to both controls and MID patients. Additional analyses revealed that loss of insight, operationally defined as the discrepancy between informant report and patient self-report, was not significantly related to age, education, mental status, or level of depression, but was significantly related to degree of caregiver burden. These results indicate that intervention strategies are needed that take into consideration the level of patient insight for ILS impairment, as well as the caregiver's perception of the patient's capabilities and the degree of burden experienced by the caregiver.
