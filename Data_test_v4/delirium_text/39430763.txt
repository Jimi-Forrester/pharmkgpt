39430763|a|Background: Opioid anesthesia can modulate the impaired immune response and opioid-sparing anesthesia may preserve immune functions. This study was performed to assess the effects of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) and opioid-based anesthesia (OA) on perioperative macrophages differentiation, cytokine changes, and perioperative complications in locally advanced GC (LAGC) patients. Methods: We used quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) questionnaire scores and visual analog scale (VAS) scores to compare postoperative quality of recovery and pain level. In addition, the adverse reactions of patients in the two groups were compared. The perioperative serum level of inflammatory cytokines and the ratio of macrophage subtypes were detected. Results: The OFA group had significantly longer extubation time and PACU stay, whereas the OA group had significantly higher rate of hypotension, higher doses of norepinephrine, higher PONV and dizziness rate, and delayed flatus passage time. The QoR-15 score on postoperative 24 h was significantly higher in OFA group than in OA group. At the end of or after the surgery, the OFA group had higher levels of interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, CD68+CD163- macrophage rate, but lower levels of IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and CD68+CD163+ macrophage rate, indicating OFA attenuated perioperative immunosuppression by diminishing M2 and promoting M1 macrophage polarization. And the reversal tendency is more obvious in LAGC patients with neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor. Conclusions: The OFA may attenuate perioperative immunosuppression by diminishing M2 and promoting M1 macrophage polarization in LAGC patients with neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor.
