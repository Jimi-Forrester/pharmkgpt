METHODS: : This study included patients with musculoskeletal disease (aged >=75 years) who were admitted to the rehabilitation ward. Data on age, ADL, and time for physical activity (metabolic equivalents [METs]) were collected. Patients were divided into groups with or without heart failure, and the differences were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: : This study included 84 musculoskeletal patients, including 25 with heart failure. The heart-failure group had similar levels of ADL independence compared to the without-heart-failure group (p=0.28) but had shorter duration of continuous and sustained physical activities and less total time (p<0.01) of light-intensity physical activity or higher. CONCLUSION: : Older adults with subacute musculoskeletal disease with heart failure do not necessarily require a large amount of physical activity to maintain ADL at the time of discharge. But very low physical activity may increase the risk for developing hospitalization-associated disability. Physical activity in older adults with subacute musculoskeletal disease with heart failure should be monitored separately from ADL.
