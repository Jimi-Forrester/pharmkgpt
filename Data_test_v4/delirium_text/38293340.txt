38293340|t|Unleashing the potential of tungsten disulfide: Current trends in biosensing and nanomedicine applications.
38293340|a|The discovery of graphene ignites a great deal of interest in the research and advancement of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. Within it, semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are highly regarded due to their exceptional electrical and optoelectronic properties. Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a TMDC with intriguing properties, such as biocompatibility, tunable bandgap, and outstanding photoelectric characteristics. These features make it a potential candidate for chemical sensing, biosensing, and tumor therapy. Despite the numerous reviews on the synthesis and application of TMDCs in the biomedical field, no comprehensive study still summarizes and unifies the research trends of WS2 from synthesis to biomedical applications. Therefore, this review aims to present a complete and thorough analysis of the current research trends in WS2 across several biomedical domains, including biosensing and nanomedicine, covering antibacterial applications, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and anticancer treatments. Finally, this review also discusses the potential opportunities and obstacles associated with WS2 to deliver a new outlook for advancing its progress in biomedical research.
