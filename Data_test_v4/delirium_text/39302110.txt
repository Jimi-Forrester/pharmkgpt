39302110|a|The production of neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) is central to the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and involves sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. APP and the secretases are transmembrane proteins and their co-localisation in the same membrane-bound sub-compartment is necessary for APP cleavage. The intracellular trafficking of APP and the beta-secretase, BACE1, is critical in regulating APP processing and Abeta production and has been studied in several cellular systems. Here, we summarise the intracellular distribution and transport of APP and its secretases, and the intracellular location for APP cleavage in non-polarised cells and neuronal models. In addition, we review recent advances on the potential impact of familial AD mutations on APP trafficking and processing. This is critical information in understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD progression and in supporting the development of novel strategies for clinical treatment.
