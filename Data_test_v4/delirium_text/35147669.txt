35147669|t|Anti-HK antibody reveals critical roles of a 20-residue HK region for Abeta-induced plasma contact system activation.
35147669|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. Vascular abnormalities and neuroinflammation play roles in AD pathogenesis. Plasma contact activation, which leads to fibrin clot formation and bradykinin release, is elevated in many AD patients, likely due to the ability of AD's pathogenic peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta) to induce its activation. Since overactivation of this system may be deleterious to AD patients, the development of inhibitors could be beneficial. Here, we show that 3E8, an antibody against a 20-amino acid region in domain 6 of high molecular weight kininogen (HK), inhibits Abeta-induced intrinsic coagulation. Mechanistically, 3E8 inhibits contact system activation by blocking the binding of prekallikrein (PK) and factor XI (FXI) to HK, thereby preventing their activation and the continued activation of factor XII (FXII). The 3E8 antibody can also disassemble HK/PK and HK/FXI complexes in normal human plasma in the absence of a contact system activator due to its strong binding affinity for HK, indicating its prophylactic ability. Furthermore, the binding of Abeta to both FXII and HK is critical for Abeta-mediated contact system activation. These results suggest that a 20-amino acid region in domain 6 of HK plays a critical role in Abeta-induced contact system activation, and this region may provide an effective strategy to inhibit or prevent contact system activation in related disorders.
