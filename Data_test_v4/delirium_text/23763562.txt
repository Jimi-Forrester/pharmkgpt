23763562|a|Emergence delirium and agitation (EAD) associated with sevoflurane general anesthesia are very commonly observed in young children. Such events pose a risk for injury as well as decreased parental satisfaction, especially in the ambulatory and office-based setting. This article reviews the different approaches described in the literature to reduce EAD. A novel approach using a Bispectral Index System (BIS)-guided anesthesia with propofol washout technique is proposed as a viable and effective approach to prevent EAD.
