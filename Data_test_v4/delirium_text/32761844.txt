32761844|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is correlated with refractory Takayasu arteritis (TA), and resistance exercise have been shown to inhibit TNF-alpha. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to explore the effect of resistance exercise in the clinical management of TA. METHODS: This clinical trial enrolled a total of 342 acute TA patients, who were subsequently randomized to undergo either resistance exercise or relaxation control twice per week for 12 weeks. The disease activity was defined using the primary outcome of Birmingham Vascular Activity Score (BVAS). Secondary outcomes included levels of plasma TNF-alpha and C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). RESULTS: BVAS scores along with other laboratory parameters obtained from the patients in the resistance exercise group showed a gradual decline throughout the course of the trial. By contrast, outcomes appeared largely unaltered in the relaxation control group patients. Analyses also revealed that plasma TNF-alpha displayed strong linear correlations with ESR, BVAS scores, and plasma CRP levels. CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise could substantially improve treatment outcomes as well as laboratory parameters in patients with acute TA, probably through decreasing TNF-alpha.
