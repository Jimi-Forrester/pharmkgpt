34922479|a|INTRODUCTION: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are common. An increase in mortality associated with osteoporotic VCFs has been well documented. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of time to surgery on 1-year survival in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study with prospective mortality follow-up, consecutive patients aged >= 60 years who had operative treatment of a low-energy fracture of a thoracolumbar vertebra and had undergone surgical stabilization between January 2015 and December 2018 were identified from our institutional database. By chart review, additional information on hospitalization time, comorbidities (expressed as ASA - American Society of Anesthesiologists Scale), complications and revision surgery was obtained. Time-to-surgery was defined as the time between admission and surgery. Mortality data was assessed by contacting the patients by phone, mail or the national social insurance database. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty patients (mean age 78 years, SD 7 years, range, 60 to 93; 172 female) were available for final analysis. Mean follow-up was 40 months (range, 12 to 68 months). Fifty-nine patients (22.7%) had died at final follow-up and 27/260 patients (10.4%) had died within 1 year after the surgery. Time-to-surgery was not different for patients who died within 1 year after the surgery and those who survived (p = .501). In-hospital complications were seen in 40/260 (15.4%) patients. Time-to-surgery showed a strong correlation with hospitalization time (Pearson's r = .614, p < .001), but only a very weak correlation with the time spent in hospital after the surgery (Pearson's r = .146, p = .018). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to patients with proximal femur factures, time-to-surgery had no significant effect on one-year mortality in geriatric patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Treatment decisions for these fractures in the elderly should be individualized.
