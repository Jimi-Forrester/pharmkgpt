15119738|a|The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene (on chromosome 21), Presenilin 1 (PS1) gene (on chromosome 14) and Presenilin 2 (PS2) gene (on chromosome 1) are responsible for autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Missense mutations in these genes cause abnormal APP processing with subsequent overproduction of amyloidogenic and toxic A beta (42 peptide. A mutational analysis of APP, PS1, and PS2 genes can be used for both symptomatic and presymptomatic genetic testing and counselling in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). To contribute to our knowledge on genetic background of Alzheimer's disease in Poland, we screened APP mutations in a sample of familial EOAD cases from Poznan region. We did not find pathogenic mutations within exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene. Our study confirmed that APP gene mutations account only for a very small portion of FAD.
