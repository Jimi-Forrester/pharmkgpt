23440255|a|During the past few years, it has become evident that metabolic control is a major determinant of postoperative outcomes, not only for diabetic patients but for all patients undergoing surgery.In cardiac and vascular surgery, myocardial ischemia is a common challenge and the management of hyperglycemia should be part of the strategy aimed at optimizing cardiac protection during these types of surgery, since performed in high risk patients. Little informations are available on the relation between glucose substrate and the type of anesthesia and few studies have been performed on glucose metabolism in the perioperative risk assessment as well as on intraoperative and post surgical management of hyperglycemia in patients submitted to cardiac and vascular surgery. Evidence exists that even slight increased in glycemia are detrimental for patients (diabetic and non) elective for cardiac and vascular surgery, though the precise details of the timing of insulin therapy, the desired target serum glucose level, and the duration of therapy are so far to be completely elucidated. Anesthestiologists can therefore affect outcome by simply preserving a normal blood glucose concentration initiating in the operating room. The challenge to optimize glucose control should begin during preoperative evaluation.
