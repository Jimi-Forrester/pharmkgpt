8871950|a|In an attempt to determine the risks for and kinds of dementia most prevalent among the African American population, the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh developed a community satellite program specifically targeting the African American and historically medically underserved communities in Allegheny County, PA. The primary mission of the Alzheimer Outreach Center (AOC) was to increase the awareness of Ad among the targeted population. The number on nonwhite patients participating in the studies at ADRC increased from 2 to 16% in the first year of the program. In May 195, the AOC became a permanent ADRC program.
