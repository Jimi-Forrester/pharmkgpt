8695034|t|Delirium in hospitalized elderly patients: off track.
8695034|a|Delirium in the hospitalized elderly patient is highly prevalent and has severe consequences. Critically ill elderly individuals are at particular risk for delirium because of impaired physical and mental defense mechanisms. More research in terms of etiology, detection, treatment, and especially prevention, needs to be done. Although nursing care and nursing research have contributed much to our current knowledge of this complex condition, more will be contributed toward its understanding and management during the next decade. It is imperative that nurses attempt to keep abreast of this progress to provide the quality and cost-effective care that can keep older patients "on track."
