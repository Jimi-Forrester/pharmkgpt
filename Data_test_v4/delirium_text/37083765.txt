37083765|t|Dexmedetomidine improves lung compliance in patients undergoing lateral decubitus position of shoulder arthroscopy: A randomized controlled trial.
37083765|a|BACKGROUND: The improvement of oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics in patients under general anesthesia can be achieved by dexmedetomidine (DEX) infusion. However, its role in patients undergoing lateral supine shoulder arthroscopy has not been thoroughly studied. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of DEX on lung compliance in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic surgery in a lateral decubitus position. METHODS: The patients who underwent lateral recumbent shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia were randomly divided into the DEX group (group D) and the control group (group N). At the start of the trial, group D was given 0.5 mug/kg/hours continuous pumping until 30 minutes before the end of anesthesia; Group N was injected with normal saline at the same volume. The patients were recorded at each time point after intubation: supine position for 5 minutes (T0), lateral position for 5 minutes (T1), lateral position for 1 hour (T2), lateral position for 2 hours (T3), airway peak pressure, platform pressure, dynamic lung compliance, and static lung compliance, etc. RESULTS: At the end of the drug infusion, the DEX group showed significant improved pulmonary mechanics and higher lung compliance than the control group. Compared with group N, group D's heart rate and mean arterial pressure were lower at all time points; there was no statistical difference in Tidal volume and Pressure end-tidal carbon dioxide data at each time point in Group D. CONCLUSION: DEX can improve lung compliance and reduce airway pressure and platform pressure of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the lateral position under general anesthesia.
