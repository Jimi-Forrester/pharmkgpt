38163471|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly intertwined with sleep disturbances throughout its whole natural history. Sleep consists of a major compound of the functionality of the glymphatic system, as the synchronized slow-wave activity during NREM facilitates cerebrospinal and interstitial long-distance mixing. OBJECTIVE: The present study undertakes a scoping review of research on the involvement of the glymphatic system in AD-related sleep disturbances. DESIGN: we searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and HEAL-link databases, without limitations on date and language, along with reference lists of relevant reviews and all included studies. We included in vivo, in vitro and post-mortem studies examining glymphatic implications of sleep disturbances in human populations with AD spectrum pathology. A thematic synthesis of evidence based on the extracted content was applied and presented in a narrative way. RESULTS: In total, 70 original research articles were included and were grouped as following: a) Protein aggregation and toxicity, after sleep deprivation, along with its effects on sleep architecture, b) Glymphatic Sequalae in SDB, yielding potential glymphatic markers c) Circadian Dysregulation, d) Possible Interventions. CONCLUSIONS: this review sought to provide insight into the role of sleep disturbances in AD pathogenesis, in the context of the glymphatic disruption.
