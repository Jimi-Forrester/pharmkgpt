31313266|a|BACKGROUND: QTc prolongation is a common and serious side effect of antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium. Nevertheless, the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia is rarely reported, so that the clinical relevance of a QTc prolongation triggered in this way remains unclear. METHOD: The focus of this review is on the antipsychotic pharmacotherapy of delirium. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In individual cases, before the prescription of an antipsychotic due to a delirium, a risk-benefit assessment must be made for the patient. For this purpose, patient and substance-specific risk factors for QTc prolongation must be checked and, if possible, reduced. A specific recommendation for an antipsychotic with assured low QTc interference can not be given because all antipsychotics for delirium treatment are potentially QTc-prolonging. Antipsychotic delirium treatment should be monitored, especially in patients with a high risk profile, for QTc prolongation by regular ECG controls.
