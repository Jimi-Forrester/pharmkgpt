37108327|t|Secreted Amyloid Precursor Protein Alpha (sAPPalpha) Regulates the Cellular Proteome and Secretome of Mouse Primary Astrocytes.
37108327|a|Secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha), processed from a parent mammalian brain protein, amyloid precursor protein, can modulate learning and memory. Recently it has been shown to modulate the transcriptome and proteome of human neurons, including proteins with neurological functions. Here, we analysed whether the acute administration of sAPPalpha facilitated changes in the proteome and secretome of mouse primary astrocytes in culture. Astrocytes contribute to the neuronal processes of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Cortical mouse astrocytes in culture were exposed to 1 nM sAPPalpha, and changes in both the whole-cell proteome (2 h) and the secretome (6 h) were identified with Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Spectra-Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS). Differentially regulated proteins were identified in both the cellular proteome and secretome that are involved with neurologically related functions of the normal physiology of the brain and central nervous system. Groups of proteins have a relationship to APP and have roles in the modulation of cell morphology, vesicle dynamics and the myelin sheath. Some are related to pathways containing proteins whose genes have been previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The secretome is also enriched in proteins related to Insulin Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) signaling and the extracellular matrix (ECM). There is the promise that a more specific investigation of these proteins will help to understand the mechanisms of how sAPPalpha signaling affects memory formation.
