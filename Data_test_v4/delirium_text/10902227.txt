10902227|a|BACKGROUND: In this paper, we investigate the reasons for treatment refusal at Linkou and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals, and offer ways to improve the doctor-patient relationship. METHODS: Cases were collected during a 2-year period according to the criterion of notification of "refused treatment" on consultation sheets, with a total of 1631 consultation sheets. All cases were discussed once a week in detail by psychiatrists and the consulting medical staff, and were followed up from 1 to 4 weeks. All cases were treated by the processes of informed consent and crisis intervention. The final results for the reasons of treatment refusal and psychiatric diagnoses were made by psychiatrists and the consulting medical staff. RESULTS: The number of cases compatible with the criterion was 15 (10 men and 5 women). The reasons for treatment refusal included poor communication, inadequate information, lack of competency, denial and shock reaction, reappearance of the suffered experience, and autonomy of patients. The distribution of psychiatric diagnoses included 8 with major depressive disorders, 2 with delirium, 1 with schizophrenic disorder, 1 with adjustment disorder, 1 with acute stress disorder (post-traffic accident), 1 with alcohol dependence, and 1 was deferred. After adequate processes of informed consent and crisis intervention, 12 persons accepted medical treatment. CONCLUSION: We should give patients adequate informed consent and crisis intervention to establish a good doctor-patient relationship and to respect the patients' autonomy for their choice of treatment.
