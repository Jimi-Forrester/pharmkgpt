36839317|t|Alcohol Intake and Arterial Hypertension: Retelling of a Multifaceted Story.
36839317|a|Alcoholic beverages are common components of diets worldwide and understanding their effects on humans' health is crucial. Because hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality, the relationship of alcohol consumption with blood pressure (BP) has been the subject of extensive investigation. For the purpose of this review, we searched the terms "alcohol", "ethanol", and "arterial hypertension" on Pubmed MeSH and selected the most relevant studies. Short-term studies showed a biphasic BP response after ingestion of high doses of alcohol, and sustained alcohol consumption above 30 g/day, significantly, and dose-dependently, increased the risk for hypertension. These untoward effects of alcoholic beverages on BP can be mediated by a multiplicity of neurohormonal mechanisms. In addition to the effects on BP, excess alcohol intake might contribute to cardiac and renal hypertensive organ damage, although some studies suggest possible benefits of moderate alcohol consumption on additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and lipoprotein(a). Some intervention studies and cumulative analyses support the evidence of a benefit of the reduction/withdrawal of alcohol consumption on BP and cardiovascular outcomes. This is why guidelines of scientific societies recommend avoidance or limitation of alcohol intake below one unit/day for women and two units/day for men. This narrative article overviews all these topics, providing an update of the current knowledge on the relationship between alcohol and BP.
