38974087|t|Frailty is a predictor for worse outcomes in patients hospitalized with Clostridioides difficile infection.
38974087|a|Background: Frailty has major health implications for affected patients and is widely used in the perioperative risk assessment. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a validated score that utilizes administrative billing data to identify patients at higher risk because of frailty. We investigated the utility of the HFRS in patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) to determine whether they were at risk for worse outcomes and higher healthcare resource utilization. Methods: Using the 2017 National Inpatient Sample, we identified all adults with a primary diagnosis of CDI. We classified patients into 2 groups: those who had an HFRS <5 (NonFrailCDI) and those with a score >=5 (FrailCDI). We assessed differences in hospital outcomes and healthcare resource utilization based on frailty status. Results: We identified 93,810 hospitalizations, of which 54,300 (57.88%) were FrailCDI. FrailCDI patients were at higher risk for fulminant CDI (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-2.3), requiring colectomy (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.5-11.2), and inpatient mortality (OR 4.5, 95%CI 2.8-7.1). Furthermore, FrailCDI patients had higher odds of requiring Intensive Care Unit admission (OR 13.7, 95%CI 6.3-29.9) or transfer to another facility on discharge (OR 2.2, 95%CI 2.0-2.4), and had longer hospital stays and higher total charges when compared with NonFrailCDI. Conclusions: Frailty as defined by the HFRS is an independent factor for worse outcomes and higher healthcare utilization in adults admitted for CDI. Risk stratifying patients by frailty may improve outcomes.
