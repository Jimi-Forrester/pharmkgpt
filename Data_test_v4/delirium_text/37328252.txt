37328252|a|The determination of clinically significant amounts of tau protein in bodily fluids is a major problem in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. As a result, the present work aims to develop a simple, label-free, fast, highly sensitive, and selective 2D carbon backbone graphene oxide (GO) patterned surface plasmon resonance (SPR) mediated affinity biosensor for Tau-441 monitoring. Initially, non-plasmonic nanosized GO was made using a modified Hummers' method, whereas green synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were subjected to a layer-by-layer (LbL) design employing anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes. Several spectroscopical evaluations were carried out to ensure the synthesis of GO, AuNPs, and LbL assembly. Following that, the Anti-Tau rabbit antibody was immobilized on the designed LbL assembly using carbodiimide chemistry, and various studies such as sensitivity, selectivity, stability, repeatability, spiked sample analysis, etc., were conducted using the constructed affinity GO@LbL-AuNPs-Anti-Tau SPR biosensor. As an output, it shows a broad concentration range and a very low detection limit of 150 ng/mL to 5 fg/mL and 13.25 fg/mL, respectively. The remarkable sensitivity of this SPR biosensor represents the merits of a combination of plasmonic AuNPs and a non-plasmonic GO. It also exhibits great selectivity for Tau-441 in the presence of interfering molecules, which may be because of the immobilization of the Anti-Tau rabbit on the surface of the LbL assembly. Furthermore, it ensured high stability and repeatability, while spiked sample analysis and AD-induced animal samples analysis confirmed the practicability of GO@LbL-AuNPs-Anti-Tau SPR biosensor for Tau-441 detection. In conclusion, fabricated sensitive, selective, stable, label-free, quick, simple, and minimally invasive GO@LbL-AuNPs-Anti-Tau SPR biosensor will provide an alternative for AD diagnosis in the future.
