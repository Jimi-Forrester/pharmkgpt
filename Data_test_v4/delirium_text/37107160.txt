37107160|t|Salvia miltiorrhiza Alleviates Memory Deficit Induced by Ischemic Brain Injury in a Transient MCAO Mouse Model by Inhibiting Ferroptosis.
37107160|a|Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) has been used in oriental medicine for its neuroprotective effects against cardiovascular diseases and ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanism underlying the effects of SM on stroke using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model. Our results showed that SM administration significantly attenuated acute brain injury, including brain infarction and neurological deficits, 3 days after tMCAO. This was confirmed by our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, which revealed a reduction in brain infarction with SM administration, as well as our magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study, which demonstrated the restoration of brain metabolites, including taurine, total creatine, and glutamate. The neuroprotective effects of SM were associated with the reduction in gliosis and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), along with the upregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 in post-ischemic brains. SM also reduced the levels of 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are markers of lipid peroxidation, induced by oxidative stress upregulation in the penumbra of the tMCAO mouse brain. SM administration attenuated ischemic neuronal injury by inhibiting ferroptosis. Additionally, post-ischemic brain synaptic loss and neuronal loss were alleviated by SM administration, as demonstrated by Western blot and Nissl staining. Moreover, daily administration of SM for 28 days after tMCAO significantly reduced neurological deficits and improved survival rates in tMCAO mice. SM administration also resulted in improvement in post-stroke cognitive impairment, as measured by the novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests in tMCAO mice. Our findings suggest that SM provides neuroprotection against ischemic stroke and has potential as a therapeutic agent.
