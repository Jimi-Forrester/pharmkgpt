10461174|a|Postmenopausal women on estrogen replacement appear to have their relative risk of developing Alzheimer's disease diminished by about one half. Because brain amyloid accumulation plays a key role in initiating Alzheimer's pathology, it is attractive to postulate that estrogen might modulate Alzheimer's risk by inhibiting amyloid accumulation. Data and cell biological models supporting such a scenario are reviewed here.
