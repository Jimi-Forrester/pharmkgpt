38222070|a|Background and aims: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a common autoimmune disorder involving the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs with an elusive pathophysiology. SSc is believed to be a genetically prone T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. miRNAs and lncRNAs were thought to be involved in the etiology of several immunological diseases including SSc. This work aimed to assess the expression of miRNA-133, lncRNA-H19, PKM2, and TGF-beta levels in SSc in comparison to controls and their relationship to the clinical course and severity of disease. Patients and methods: Fifty patients with SSc and 40 healthy age and sex-matched controls were included in this study. miRNA-133 and H19 expression levels were detected using quantitative RT-PCR while serum levels of PKM2 and TGF-beta were measured using ELISA techniques. Patients' clinical data and treatments received were extracted and correlated with proteins investigated. Results: Our results showed that miRNA-133 was significantly downregulated in SSc patients in comparison to controls (Mean + SD of SSc = 0.61 +- 0.22, Mean +- SD of HC = 0.97 +- 0.007, p = 0.003). However, there was significant upregulation of the serum expressions of all other tested biomarkers in SSc patients in comparison to controls; H19 (Mean + SD of SSc = 10.37 +- 3.13, Mean +- SD of HC = 1.01 +- 0.01, p = 0.0001), PKM2 (Mean + SD of SSc = 28.0 +- 4.84, Mean +- SD of HC = 16.19 +- 1.32, p = 0.005) and TGF-beta (Mean + SD of SSc = 150.8 +- 6.36, Mean +- SD of HC = 23.83 +- 0.93, p = 0.0001). We also detected several correlations between serum levels of the investigated proteins in patients with SSc. Conclusion: Along with TGF-beta, our results show that miRNA-133, H19, and PKM2 seem to be potential contributors to SSc pathogenesis and could be promising biomarkers in the diagnosis of SSc patients. The lncRNA-H19 correlations with TGF- beta, miRNA-133, and PKM2 suggest a possible influential effect of this RNA molecule on the pathogenesis of SSc.
