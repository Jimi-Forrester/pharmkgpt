32711044|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is one of the most common types of dementia followed by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies showed that approximately 30 %-35 % of patients with AD at post-mortem exhibited vascular pathologies, which suggested that mixed dementia may be the most common type of dementia. Permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) is a well-characterized method for investigating cognitive functions and the histopathological consequences of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) in rats. In the present study, we investigated the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on cognitive impairment after CCH, as well as the effects of CCH-induced neurovascular damage on cognitive function. Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a sham group, a 2VO group, and a 2VO + EE group. The 2VO procedure was performed at 12 weeks, while EE was performed for 8 weeks before and 6 weeks after 2VO. The effect of EE on cognitive functions in 2VO rats was investigated using the radial-arm maze and Morris Water Maze tests. Neurovascular integrity was assessed based on immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), morphological changes in microvessels, and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the motor cortex and hippocampus. EE ameliorated microvessel fragmentation by sustaining the tight junction through increases of ZO-1 expression after CCH, resulting in preserving the neurovascular unit. In summary, EE mitigated cognitive impairment by restoring neurovascular integrity. These findings suggest that EE can be a valuable and meaningful environmental intervention for patients with cognitive impairment.
