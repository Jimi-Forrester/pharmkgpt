2464841|t|Cloning of the cDNA from normal brain and brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease in the expression vector lambda GT 11.
2464841|a|1. RNA was purified from postmortem human brains, and the poly A+ RNA was isolated by oligo dT cellulose. 2. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase, RNAse H and DNA polymerase. 3. cDNA was cloned in the lambda GT 11 expression vector, and libraries containing between 1 and 2 millions clones were obtained. 92 to 98% of the plaques contained a recombinant phage. 4. Such libraries will allow the molecular characterization of cDNA and corresponding proteins which play a key role in brain functions and in particular which could be involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's dementia.
