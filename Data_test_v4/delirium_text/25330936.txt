25330936|t|Crosstalk Between Macroautophagy and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy: Implications for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases.
25330936|a|Macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are two important subtypes of autophagy that play a critical role in cellular quality control under physiological and pathological conditions. Despite the marked differences between these two autophagic pathways, macroautophagy and CMA are intimately connected with each other during the autophagy-lysosomal degradation process, in particular, in the setting of neurological illness. Macroautophagy serves as a backup mechanism to removal of malfunctioning proteins (i.e., aberrant alpha-synuclein) from the cytoplasm when CMA is compromised, and vice versa. The molecular mechanisms underlying the conversation between macroautophagy and CMA are being clarified. Herein, we survey current overviews concentrating on the complex interactions between macroautophagy and CMA, and present therapeutic potentials through utilization and manipulation of macroautophagy-CMA crosstalk in the treatment of neurological diseases.
