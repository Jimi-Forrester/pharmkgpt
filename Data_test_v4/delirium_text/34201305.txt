34201305|t|Use of Extracorporeal Life Support for Heart Transplantation: Key Factors to Improve Outcome.
34201305|a|Although patients receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS) as a bridge to transplantation have demonstrated worse outcomes than those without ECLS, we investigated the key factors in the improvement of their posttransplant outcome. From December 2003 to December 2018, 257 adult patients who underwent heart transplantation (HTx) at our institution were included. We identified 100 patients (38.9%) who underwent HTx during ECLS (ECLS group). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after HTx. The median duration of ECLS was 10.0 days. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.9% (9.2% in peripheral ECLS, 2.9% in central ECLS, and 1.9% in non-ECLS). The use of ECLS was not an independent predictor of 30-day and 1-year mortality (p = 0.248 and p = 0.882, respectively). Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were found to be higher ejection fraction (p < 0.001), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (p < 0.001), and total bilirubin level (p = 0.005). In a subgroup analysis, cannulation type was not a predictor of 30-day mortality (p = 0.275). Early ECLS application to prevent organ failure and sophisticated management of acute heart failure may be important steps in achieving favorable survival after HTx.
