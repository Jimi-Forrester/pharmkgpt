20154503|t|[The role of psychosomatic medicine doctors in palliative care medicine--two case reports].
20154503|a|Palliative care medicine deals with the issue of death by listening to the story of patient's lives. There are several problems such as stress overload or burnout due to the difficulty in responding to all demands from patients and the shortness of time. These problems sometimes make doctors specializing in palliative care have less interest in patients, negative feelings or an indifferent attitude to them. In this report, two cases in which a psychosomatic medical doctor intervened were analyzed. The satisfaction of patients and the stress overload of doctors engaged in palliative care were examined retrospectively by investigation of patients' charts. Both factors were improved by such interventions, thus underscoring the possible contributions by these doctors in cancer medicine. Psychosomatic medicine is based on a biopsychosocial model and related to both physical and psychosocial factors. There are many similar viewpoints between psychosomatic medicine and palliative care medicine. Psychosomatic medical doctors have an advantage in that they can contribute to palliative care without stress overload or burnout because of their special training in communication skills to deal with patients from the standpoints of both mind and body. However, these doctors have not received psychiatric training so as to be able to diagnose precisely and treat psychiatric problems such as adjustment disorders, depression and delirium. Therefore, their further training in psychiatry for several months or years is an issue to be addressed in future.
