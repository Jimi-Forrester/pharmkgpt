38286227|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulated evidence has highlighted the association between atrial fibrillation and the risk of developing dementia. METHODS: This current cohort study utilized data from the UK Biobank to explore the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and all-cause dementia (ACD), encompassing its main subtypes (Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD)). Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the association of AF and dementia with its primary subtypes after adjusting for different sets of covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidential intervals (CIs) were estimated to quantify the associated risks. Competing risk model was applied in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: After exclusion, 373, 415 participants entered the primary analysis. Among these, 27, 934 (7.48 %) were with a history AF at baseline, while 345, 481 (92.52 %) were without. During a mean follow-up of 13.45 years, ACD was diagnosed in 1215 individuals with AF and 3988 individuals without AF. Participants with AF had higher risks of ACD (1.79 [1.67-1.91]), AD (1.48 [1.32-1.65]), and VD (2.46 [2.17-2.80]) in the fully adjusted Cox regression models. Results of subgroup and sensitivity analyses predominantly aligned with the positive associations in primary analysis. LIMITATIONS: The applicability of our findings to diverse ethnicities might require careful consideration and the behind biological mechanisms need to be further revealed. CONCLUSIONS: It indicated that people with atrial fibrillation had an increased future risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia. Atrial fibrillation screening and prevention strategies should take into account to prevent and delay the onset of dementia.
