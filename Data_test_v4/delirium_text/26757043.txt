26757043|a|BACKGROUND: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To measure efficacy and safety of medical cannabis oil (MCO) containing THC as an add-on to pharmacotherapy, in relieving behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). METHODS: Eleven AD patients were recruited to an open label, 4 weeks, prospective trial. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the trial. Significant reduction in CGI severity score (6.5 to 5.7; p <  0.01) and NPI score were recorded (44.4 to 12.8; p <  0.01). NPI domains of significant decrease were: Delusions, agitation/aggression, irritability, apathy, sleep and caregiver distress. CONCLUSION: Adding MCO to AD patients' pharmacotherapy is safe and a promising treatment option.
