34683087|t|Systematic Search for Novel Circulating Biomarkers Associated with Extracellular Vesicles in Alzheimer's Disease: Combining Literature Screening and Database Mining Approaches.
34683087|a|miRNAs play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases. Many miRNA-target gene interactions (MTI) have been experimentally confirmed and associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). miRNAs may also be contained within extracellular vesicles (EVs), mediators of cellular communication and a potential source of circulating biomarkers in body fluids. Therefore, EV-associated miRNAs (EV-miRNAs) in peripheral blood could support earlier and less invasive AD diagnostics. We aimed to prioritize EV-related miRNA with AD-related genes and to identify the most promising candidates for novel AD biomarkers. A list of unique EV-miRNAs from the literature was combined with a known set of AD risk genes and enriched for MTI. Additionally, miRNAs associated with the AD phenotype were combined with all known target genes in MTI enrichment. Expression in different sample types was analyzed to identify AD-associated miRNAs with the greatest potential as AD circulating biomarkers. Four common MTI were observed between EV-miRNAs and AD-associated miRNAs: hsa-miR-375-APH1B, hsa-miR-107-CDC42SE2, hsa-miR-375-CELF2, and hsa-miR-107-IL6. An additional 61 out of 169 unique miRNAs (36.1%) and seven out of 84 unique MTI (8.3%), observed in the body fluids of AD patients, were proposed as very strong AD-circulating biomarker candidates. Our analysis summarized several potential novel AD biomarkers, but further studies are needed to evaluate their potential in clinical practice.
