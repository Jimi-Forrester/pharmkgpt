31752112|a|The studies of solubility of the paprika extract with a high concentration of carotenoids in carbon dioxide under the pressure of 20-50 MPa and at temperatures of 313.15-333.15 K were carried out using the static method. The highest solubility of paprika extract was achieved at the temperature of 333.15 K and under the pressure of 50 MPa. The obtained experimental data were correlated with five density-based models, applied for prediction of solubility in the supercritical carbon dioxide (the Chrastil, del Valle and Aguilera, Adachi and Lu, Sparks et al. and Bian et al. models). The accuracy of particular models with reference to measurement results was specified with the average absolute relative deviation (AARD) and coefficient of determination (R2). Results showed that solubility calculated based on the selected models was compliant with experimental data.
