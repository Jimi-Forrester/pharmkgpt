37915939|t|Inferior vena cava ultrasound and other techniques for assessment of intravascular and extravascular volume: an update.
37915939|a|Goals of volume management are to accurately assess intravascular and extravascular volume and predict response to volume administration, vasopressor support or volume removal. Data are reviewed that support the following: (i) Dynamic parameters reliably guide volume administration and may improve clinical outcomes compared with static parameters, but some are invasive or only validated with mechanical ventilation without spontaneous breathing. (ii) Ultrasound visualization of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter variations with respiration reliably assesses intravascular volume and predicts volume responsiveness. (iii) Although physiology of IVC respiratory variations differs with mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing, the IVC collapsibility index (CI) and distensibility index are interconvertible. (iv) Prediction of volume responsiveness by IVC CI is comparable for mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing patients. (v) Respiratory variations of subclavian/proximal axillary and internal jugular veins by ultrasound are alternative sites, with comparable reliability. (vi) Data support clinical applicability of IVC CI to predict hypotension with anesthesia, guide ultrafiltration goals, predict dry weight, predict intra-dialytic hypotension and assess acute decompensated heart failure. (vii) IVC ultrasound may complement ultrasound of heart and lungs, and abdominal organs for venous congestion, for assessing and managing volume overload and deresuscitation, renal failure and shock. (viii) IVC ultrasound has limitations including inadequate visualization. Ultrasound data should always be interpreted in clinical context. Additional studies are required to further assess and validate the role of bedside ultrasonography in clinical care.
