35628408|a|Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has continued to be the subject of study since its discovery nearly 40 years ago. Significant advances in research and intake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have slowed the progression and appearance of the disease symptoms and the incidence of concomitant diseases, which are the leading cause of death in HIV+ persons. However, the prolongation of ART is closely related to chronic degenerative diseases and pathologies caused by oxidative stress (OS) and alterations in lipid metabolism (increased cholesterol levels), both of which are conditions of ART. Therefore, recent research focuses on using natural therapies to diminish the effects of ART and HIV infection: regulating lipid metabolism and reducing OS status. The present review summarizes current information on OS and cholesterol metabolism in HIV+ persons and how the consumption of certain phytochemicals can modulate these. For this purpose, MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were consulted to identify publications investigating HIV disease and natural therapies and their associated effects.
