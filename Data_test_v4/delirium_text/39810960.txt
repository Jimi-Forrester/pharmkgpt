39810960|a|Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as depression, anxiety, and apathy are present in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and are risk factors for cognitive decline. However, the relationship between NPS and specific cognitive domains is less clear. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether there is a correlation between NPS and specific cognitive domains. Methods: A cross-sectional study which included 174 participants with MCI, aged 55 years or older. Differences in sociodemographic profile, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological tests between MCI participants with and without NPS were measured. Results: Participants with NPS had lower education and worse performance in attention tests and executive functions. Psychotic symptoms were correlated with deficits in visuospatial functions; irritability and agitation with inattention and deficit of inhibitory control; and depression with inattention. Conclusion: Correlations were found between some NPS with specific cognitive domains, especially psychotic symptoms, but also agitation, irritability, apathy, and depression.
