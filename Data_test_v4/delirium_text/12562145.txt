12562145|a|Although quetiapine was introduced as an atypical antipsychotic drug with clinical efficacy in schizophrenia patients, it has been used in a variety of disease states over the last 5 years. The most common conditions have included mood and anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, aggression, hostility, posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, delirium, and comorbid substance abuse. Considering its efficacy in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric conditions and its excellent tolerability profile, quetiapine could emerge as a broad-spectrum psychotropic medication that may be helpful in psychiatry across various diagnostic categories. Traditionally, studies on the predictive validity of psychiatric disorders help with nosologic issues and controversies. Assessing quetiapine's tolerability and its overall treatment response might help tease out the predictive validity of various psychiatric syndromes (based currently on an atheoretical descriptive approach) and may shape psychiatric nosology in the future. Quetiapine's low affinity and fast dissociation from postsynaptic dopamine-2 receptors give the least risk of producing acute extrapyramidal side effects, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These factors suggest that the clinical utility of quetiapine in psychiatric conditions other than schizophrenia has not been fully exploited thus far.
