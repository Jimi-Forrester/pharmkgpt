28634540|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the efficacies of rehabilitation with the hybrid assistive limb and conventional rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 37 consecutive patients who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty for knee osteoarthritis were enrolled. Seven patients withdrew from the study after randomization, and 30 patients (hybrid assistive limb group: n = 16; conventional group: n = 14) completed the randomized controlled trial. Patients in the hybrid assistive limb group underwent ten 20-min rehabilitation sessions with the hybrid assistive limb as well as 20-min conventional sessions over the course of 2 weeks, whereas patients in the conventional group received ten 40-min conventional sessions during the same period. The primary outcome measure was walking speed, whereas the secondary outcome measures included quadriceps strength and knee pain assessed using a numerical rating scale. The outcome measures were evaluated prior to surgery and on postoperative weeks 1, 2, and 3. RESULTS: In the early postoperative period, rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty with the hybrid assistive limb resulted in a significantly greater improvement in walking speed (weeks 1 and 2: p = 0.045), quadriceps strength (weeks 1 and 2; weeks 1 and 3: p < 0.0001), and numerical rating scale scores (week 1: p = 0.03) than conventional rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation with the hybrid assistive limb after total knee arthroplasty led to greater improvements in walking speed, quadriceps strength, and pain scores than conventional rehabilitation.
