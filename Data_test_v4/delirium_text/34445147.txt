34445147|t|Somatostatin and Astroglial Involvement in the Human Limbic System in Alzheimer's Disease.
34445147|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Progressive accumulation of insoluble isoforms of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and tau protein are the major neuropathologic hallmarks, and the loss of cholinergic pathways underlies cognitive deficits in patients. Recently, glial involvement has gained interest regarding its effect on preservation and impairment of brain integrity. The limbic system, including temporal lobe regions and the olfactory bulb, is particularly affected in the early stages. In the early 1980s, the reduced expression of the somatostatin neuropeptide was described in AD. However, over the last three decades, research on somatostatin in Alzheimer's disease has been scarce in humans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to stereologically quantify the expression of somatostatin in the human hippocampus and olfactory bulb and analyze its spatial distribution with respect to that of Abeta and au neuropathologic proteins and astroglia. The results indicate that somatostatin-expressing cells are reduced by 50% in the hippocampus but are preserved in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the coexpression of somatostatin with the Abeta peptide is very common but not with the tau protein. Finally, the coexpression of somatostatin with astrocytes is rare, although their spatial distribution is very similar. Altogether, we can conclude that somatostatin expression is highly reduced in the human hippocampus, but not the olfactory bulb, and may play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
