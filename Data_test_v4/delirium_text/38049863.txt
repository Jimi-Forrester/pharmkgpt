38049863|t|Polyamines: their significance for maintaining health and contributing to diseases.
38049863|a|Polyamines are essential for the growth and proliferation of mammalian cells and are intimately involved in biological mechanisms such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, protein synthesis, and post-translational modification. These mechanisms regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, programmed cell death, and the formation of tumors. Several studies have confirmed the positive effect of polyamines on the maintenance of health, while others have demonstrated that their activity may promote the occurrence and progression of diseases. This review examines a variety of topics, such as polyamine source and metabolism, including metabolism, transport, and the potential impact of polyamines on health and disease. In addition, a brief summary of the effects of oncogenes and signaling pathways on tumor polyamine metabolism is provided. Video Abstract.
