37898850|a|OBJECTIVE: Much research has been conducted to identify natural antioxidant and antimutagenic compounds capable of preventing, reverting or treating conditions caused by oxidative stress and genotoxicity. In this study we evaluated the effects of 10% gum arabic (GA) and eugenol (EUG) on hepatic oxidative stress and genotoxicity induced by dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in rats. METHODS: The prevention arm of the study included 4 control groups and 4 experimental groups. Once a week for 20 weeks, the controls received saline s.c. while the experimental groups received DMH at 20 mg/kg s.c. During the same period and for an additional 9 weeks, the animals received either water, 10% GA , EUG or 10% GA + EUG  by gavage. The treatment arm of the study included 4 control groups and 4 experimental groups. Once a week for 20 weeks, the controls received saline s.c. while the experimental groups received DMH at 20 mg/kg s.c. During the subsequent 9 weeks, the animals received either water, 10% GA, EUG or 10% GA + EUG  by gavage. Finally, the livers were harvested for histopathological study with HE, measurement of genotoxicity and oxidative stress. RESULT: Genotoxicity and oxidative stress were found to be significantly lower in Group XII (animals treated concomitantly with GA and EUG). This is the first study to observe the synergistic action of GA and EUG administered concomitantly in this scenario. CONCLUSION: Indicating a synergistic antigenotoxic and antioxidant effect on liver cells in rats with DMH-induced colorectal carcinogenesis.
