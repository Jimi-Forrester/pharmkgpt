29702977|t|Association between ERalpha gene Pvu II polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility: A meta-analysis.
29702977|a|BACKGROUND: Estrogen has played an important role in the development of breast cancer. ER-alpha PvuII gene polymorphism is in close association with the occurrence risk of breast cancer, but no consensus has been achieved currently. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Wanfang database, and VIP database were retrieved to collect the case-control studies on association between ERalpha gene Pvu II polymorphism and breast cancer risk published before September 1, 2017. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the literatures, Stata 14.0 software was applied for meta-analysis, and the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. The subgroup analysis was performed to assess the confounding factors, followed by assessment of publication bias and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were enrolled in the analysis based on inclusion criteria, which included 15,360 patients and 26,423 controls. The results demonstrated that ERalpha gene Pvu II polymorphism was in significant association with the decrease of breast cancer risk in 3 genetic models (C vs T, OR = 0.962, 95% CI = 0.933-0.992, P = .012; CC vs TT, OR = 0.911, 95% CI = 0.856-0.969, P = .003; CC vs TT/CT, OR = 0.923, 95% CI = 0.874-0.975, P = .004). Subgroup analysis was conducted on the basis of ethnicity and source of controls, whose results illustrated that ERalpha gene Pvu II polymorphism was in significant association with the decrease of breast cancer risk in Asians rather than in Caucasians (CC vs TT, OR = 0.862, 95% CI = 0.750-0.922, P = .038; CC vs TT/CT, OR = 0.851, 95% CI = 0.755-0.959, P = .008). In population-based subgroup rather than in hospital-based subgroup, ERalpha gene Pvu II polymorphism was in significant association with the decrease of breast cancer risk in the allele model, homozygous model, dominant model, and recessive model (C vs T, OR = 0.943, 95% CI = 0.911-0.977, P = .001; CC vs TT, OR = 0.878, 95% CI = 0.817-0.944, P = .000; CC/CT vs TT, OR = 0.936, 95% CI = 0.881-0.994, P = .031; CC vs TT/CT, OR = 0.902, 95% CI = 0.847-0.960, P = .001). CONCLUSION: ERalpha gene Pvu II polymorphism exerts an important function in the progression of breast cancer.
