38068881|t|Mechanisms of Cadmium Neurotoxicity.
38068881|a|Cadmium is a heavy metal that increasingly contaminates food and drink products. Once ingested, cadmium exerts toxic effects that pose a significant threat to human health. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to prolonged, low-dose cadmium exposure. This review article provides an overview of cadmium's primary mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Cadmium gains entry into the nervous system via zinc and calcium transporters, altering the homeostasis for these metal ions. Once within the nervous system, cadmium disrupts mitochondrial respiration by decreasing ATP synthesis and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species. Cadmium also impairs normal neurotransmission by increasing neurotransmitter release asynchronicity and disrupting neurotransmitter signaling proteins. Cadmium furthermore impairs the blood-brain barrier and alters the regulation of glycogen metabolism. Together, these mechanisms represent multiple sites of biochemical perturbation that result in cumulative nervous system damage which can increase the risk for neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the way by which cadmium exerts its effects is critical for developing effective treatment and prevention strategies against cadmium-induced neurotoxic insult.
