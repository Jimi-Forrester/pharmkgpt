37550455|t|Multivariate genome-wide analysis of aging-related traits identifies novel loci and new drug targets for healthy aging.
37550455|a|The concept of aging is complex, including many related phenotypes such as healthspan, lifespan, extreme longevity, frailty and epigenetic aging, suggesting shared biological underpinnings; however, aging-related endpoints have been primarily assessed individually. Using data from these traits and multivariate genome-wide association study methods, we modeled their underlying genetic factor ('mvAge'). mvAge (effective n = ~1.9 million participants of European ancestry) identified 52 independent variants in 38 genomic loci. Twenty variants were novel (not reported in input genome-wide association studies). Transcriptomic imputation identified age-relevant genes, including VEGFA and PHB1. Drug-target Mendelian randomization with metformin target genes showed a beneficial impact on mvAge (P value = 8.41 x 10-5). Similarly, genetically proxied thiazolidinediones (P value = 3.50 x 10-10), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition (P value = 1.62 x 10-6), angiopoietin-like protein 4, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also had beneficial Mendelian randomization estimates. Extending the drug-target Mendelian randomization framework to 3,947 protein-coding genes prioritized 122 targets. Together, these findings will inform future studies aimed at improving healthy aging.
