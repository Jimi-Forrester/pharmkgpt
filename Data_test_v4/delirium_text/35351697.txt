35351697|t|Effects of pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block on postoperative recovery in elderly patients with hip fracture: study protocol for a randomised, parallel controlled, double-blind trial.
35351697|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture is a common and serious emergency in the elderly, and it is associated with severe pain, significant morbidity and mortality. The use of peripheral nerve block can relieve pain effectively and reduce opioid requirements, which may accelerate patient's recovery. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block has been found to provide an effective blockade to the hip joint with a potential motor-sparing effect, so we hypothesised that the PENG block may be an effective tool to enhance the recovery in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-centred, randomised, parallel controlled, double-blind trial. A total of 92 elderly patients scheduled for hip fracture surgery will be divided into two groups at random to receive either ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block or ultrasound-guided PENG block. The primary outcome will be to compare the Quality of Recovery-15 scores at 24 hours postoperatively between the two groups. The secondary outcomes will include measuring and comparing the strength of the quadriceps, the visual analogue scale at rest and on movement, the total morphine consumption, the rescue analgesic, the first time of postoperative out-of-bed mobilisation and complications. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine on 15 December 2020 (reference K2020-110). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed international journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2100042341.
