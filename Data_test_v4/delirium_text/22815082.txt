22815082|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study investigated the factor structure of an instrument to measure attitudes and beliefs of how physical therapist (PT) practitioners perceive working with people with a dementia disorder. METHODS: A survey was mailed to every skilled nursing facility in Indiana (n = 495) for completion by a PT or physical therapist assistant. The survey was developed and included whether the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) impacts the attitudes of physical therapy practitioners. RESULTS: Of the 12 attitudinal questions, 11 were significant (P < .001) concerning how the severity of a diagnosis of AD (early, middle, and late) impacts attitudes of people in physical therapy practice. Principal component analysis identified 3 factors with Eigen values of 3.3 or higher accounting for 43% of the cumulative variance. These factors include professional competence, resources, and conscientiousness. CONCLUSION: This brief instrument could serve as an assessment tool to determine whether PT practitioners exhibit therapeutic nihilism when working with people with a dementia disorder.
