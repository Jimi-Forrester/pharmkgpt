38154792|a|The protein tau misfolds into disease-specific fibrillar structures in more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. To understand and prevent disease-specific mechanisms of filament formation, in vitro models for aggregation that robustly yield these different end point structures will be necessary. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reconstruct fibril polymorphs taken on by residues 297-391 of tau under conditions previously shown to give rise to the core structure found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While we were able to reconstitute the AD tau core fold, the proportion of these paired helical filaments (PHFs) was highly variable, and a majority of filaments were composed of PHFs with an additional identical C-shaped protofilament attached near the PHF interface, termed triple helical filaments (THFs). Since the impact of filament layer quaternary structure on the biological properties of tau and other amyloid filaments is not known, the applications for samples of this morphology are presently uncertain. We further demonstrate the variation in the proportion of PHFs and PHF-like fibrils compared to other morphologies as a function of shaking time and AD polymorph-favoring cofactor concentration. This variation in polymorph abundance, even under identical experimental conditions, highlights the variation that can arise both within a lab and in different laboratory settings when reconstituting specific fibril polymorphs in vitro.
