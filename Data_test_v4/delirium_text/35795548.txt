35795548|a|The inter-organelle interactions, including the cytomembrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, lysosome, dictyosome, and nucleus, play the important roles in maintaining the normal function and homeostasis of cells. Organelle dysfunction can lead to a range of diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cancer), and provide a new perspective for drug discovery. With the development of imaging techniques and functional fluorescent probes, a variety of algorithms and strategies have been developed for the ever-improving estimation of subcellular structures, organelle interaction, and organelle-related drug discovery with accounting for the dynamic structures of organelles, such as the nanoscopy technology and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accordingly, this work summarizes a series of state-of-the-art examples of the recent progress in this rapidly changing field and uncovering the drug screening based on the structures and interactions of organelles. Finally, we propose the future outlook for exciting applications of organelle-related drug discovery, with the cooperation of nanoscopy and MD simulations.
