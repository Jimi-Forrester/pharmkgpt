38597568|t|Clinical and Laboratory Data Up on Hospital Admission are Predictors of New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Hospitalized Due to COVID-19 Pneumonia.
38597568|a|BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) occurs in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. It is still unknown whether clinical and laboratory data assessed upon hospital admission have predictive value for NOAF. OBJECTIVES: To analyze, upon hospital admission, variables with predictive potential for the occurrence of NOAF in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Observational, retrospective, case-control study. Electronic medical reports of consecutive patients, 60 years of age or older, hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia between March 1st and July 15th, 2020, were reviewed. Non-paired Student or chi-squared tests compared variables. A Cox proportional hazard model was employed to identify independent predictors of NOAF. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among 667 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, 201 (30.1%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. NOAF was documented in 29 patients (14.4%), composing group 1. Group 2 was composed of 162 patients without NOAF. Ten patients were excluded due to the AF rhythm upon hospital admission. In groups 1 and 2, there were differences in overall in-hospital survival rate (24.1 % vs. 67.9%; p<0.001), length of stay in ICU (11.1 +- 10.5 days vs. 4.9 +- 7.5 days; p=0.004) and need for mechanical ventilation rate (82.9% vs. 32.7%; p<0.001). In the Cox model, age > 71 y/o (HR=6.8; p<0.001), total leukocyte count <= 7,720 cels.muL-1 (HR=6.6; p<0.001), serum [Na+] <= 137 mEq.L-1 (HR=5.0; p=0.001), SAPS3 score > 55 (HR=5.6; p=0.002), and disorientation (HR=2.5; p=0.04) on admission were independent predictors of NOAF. CONCLUSION: NOAF is a common arrhythmia in elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical and laboratory parameters evaluated on admission have a predictive value for the occurrence of NOAF during hospitalization.
