32281225|a|INTRODUCTION: Cell-based therapy is considered as promising strategy to cure stroke. However, employing appropriate type of stem cell to fulfill many therapeutic needs of cerebral ischemia is still challenging. In this regard, the current study was designed to elucidate therapeutic potential of epidermal neural crest stem cells (EPI-NCSCs) compared to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in rat model of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Ischemic stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 minutes. Immediately after reperfusion, EPI-NCSCs or BM-MSCs were transplanted via intra-arterial or intravenous route. A test for neurological function was performed before ischemia and 1, 3, and 7 days after MCAO. Also, infarct volume ratio and relative expression of 15 selected target genes were evaluated 7 days after transplantation. RESULTS: EPI-NCSCs transplantation (both intra-arterial and intravenous) and BM-MSCs transplantation (only intra-arterial) tended to result in a better functional outcome, compared to the MCAO group; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The infarct volume ratio significantly decreased in NCSC-intra-arterial, NCSC-intravenous and MSC-intra-arterial groups compared to the control. EPI-NCSCs interventions led to higher expression levels of Bdnf, nestin, Sox10, doublecortin, beta-III tubulin, Gfap, and interleukin-6, whereas neurotrophin-3 and interleukin-10 were decreased. On the other hand, BM-MSCs therapy resulted in upregulation of Gdnf, beta-III tubulin, and Gfap and down-regulation of neurotrophin-3, interleukin-1, and interleukin-10. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the therapeutic effects of EPI-NCSCs transplantation, probably through simultaneous induction of neuronal and glial formation, as well as Bdnf over-expression in a rat model of ischemic stroke.
