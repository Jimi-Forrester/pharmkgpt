15551008|a|As life expectancy and modern surgical and intensive care techniques develop, the number of old patients in surgery is rising. Associated are problems with the indication for surgical intervention and rising incidence of "typical" peri- and postoperative complications such as postoperative delirium. Geriatric assessment serves to identify patients at risk of developing complications, to describe the postoperative course of functional and cognitive abilities, and to adjust therapeutic strategies to the individual needs of these patients. The most important instruments of geriatric assessment are described. Postoperative delirium, the most prevalent complication in surgical geriatric patients, is discussed in detail with regard to risk factors, prevalence, diagnosis, and therapeutic options.
