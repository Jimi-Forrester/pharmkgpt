35269533|t|Long-Term Dynamic Changes of NMDA Receptors Following an Excitotoxic Challenge.
35269533|a|Excitotoxicity is a form of neuronal death characterized by the sustained activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) triggered by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. NADPH-diaphorase neurons (also known as nNOS (+) neurons) are a subpopulation of aspiny interneurons, largely spared following excitotoxic challenges. Unlike nNOS (-) cells, nNOS (+) neurons fail to generate reactive oxygen species in response to NMDAR activation, a critical divergent step in the excitotoxic cascade. However, additional mechanisms underlying the reduced vulnerability of nNOS (+) neurons to NMDAR-driven neuronal death have not been explored. Using functional, genetic, and molecular analysis in striatal cultures, we indicate that nNOS (+) neurons possess distinct NMDAR properties. These specific features are primarily driven by the peculiar redox milieu of this subpopulation. In addition, we found that nNOS (+) neurons exposed to a pharmacological maneuver set to mimic chronic excitotoxicity alter their responses to NMDAR-mediated challenges. These findings suggest the presence of mechanisms providing long-term dynamic regulation of NMDARs that can have critical implications in neurotoxic settings.
