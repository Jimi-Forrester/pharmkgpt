38533300|a|Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with a steadily progressive course due to the death of central and peripheral motor neurons responsible for voluntary movements. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a treatment method unique in its universality and efficacy, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: In this review, we discuss the effect and application of LLLT in the treatment of ALS. A literature search for English and Russian publications for the keywords "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Low-Level Laser Therapy" was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Russian Science Citation Index (RSCI) databases. Results: The article provided a brief literature review, substantiated the potential use of low-level laser therapy for ALS. The particular techniques of LLLT were developed. Conclusion: Based on the results of several studies and many years of successful experience with low-level laser therapy in Russia we conclude that a LLLT technique, including intravenous laser blood illumination (ILBI), noninvasive laser blood illumination (NLBI), and local exposure, is a promising treatment method for ALS.
