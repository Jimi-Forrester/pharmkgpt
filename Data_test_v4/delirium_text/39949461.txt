39949461|t|Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) in Chronic Respiratory Diseases: A Comprehensive Review.
39949461|a|The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a complex and often underdiagnosed disorder characterized by impaired water homeostasis, leading to hyponatremia and associated complications. This comprehensive review explores the intersection of SIADH with chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial lung disease. The review looks at current evidence on pathophysiology, diagnostic challenges, and treatment approaches, highlighting the need for specialized management strategies to improve patient outcomes. Through an analysis of clinical and observational studies, this review highlights the significant impact of SIADH on morbidity and mortality among patients with respiratory diseases. It illustrates the necessity for further research to refine diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.
