36510338|a|Objective: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA), is the most common joint disease worldwide. The pathogenesis of KOA is complex and electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective therapy for KOA, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of EA on the rat model of KOA induced by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) and its relationship with NLRP3 inflammasome by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Methods: KOA was induced by intra-articular injection of MIA (3 mg/50 muL) into the right knee joint of rats. Forty-five male rats weighing 250-300 g were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group, KOA group, and KOA + electroacupuncture group (KOA+EA). EA treatment lasted for 2 weeks (6 times a week). Paw withdrawal threshold tests were used to assess mechanical allodynia once a week. Safranin O/Fast Green and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were used to assess the damage to cartilage, synovium, and subpatellar fat pad (IFP). Immunohistochemistry was used to observe NLRP3 inflammasome-associated protein-positive cells in the same field of view and western blot was used to detect the expression of the associated protein in cartilage tissue. Results: The KOA group showed mechanical hyperalgesia, joint inflammation, and significant cartilage tissue destruction. Safranin O/Fast Green and H&E staining revealed that EA alleviated the joint pathological changes caused by KOA and had a protective effect on cartilage, synovium, and IFP destruction. Mechanical allodynia pain and joint swelling were reduced in KOA rats after EA treatment. Immunohistochemistry and western blot showed significant inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated protein. Conclusion: The results indicate that EA can inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome and reduce pyroptosis, which results in the protection of cartilage tissue and the treatment of KOA. It provides reliable evidence for the development of EA in the treatment of KOA and the clinical application of acupuncture.
