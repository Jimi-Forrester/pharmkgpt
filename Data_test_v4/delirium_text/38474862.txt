38474862|t|Quercetin in the Prevention of Induced Periodontal Disease in Animal Models: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38474862|a|BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition initiated by oral bacteria and is associated with several systemic diseases. Quercetin is an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial poly-phenol present in various foods. The aim of this meta-analysis was the evaluation of the effects of quercetin administration in animal models of experimental periodontitis. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in electronic databases using the following search terms: "periodontitis" or "periodontal disease" or "gingivitis" and "quercetin" or "cyanidanol" or "sophoretin" or "pentahydroxyflavone". In vivo preclinical animal models of experimental periodontal disease with a measurement of alveolar bone loss were included in the analysis. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the SYRCLE tool. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 335 results. Five studies were included, four of them qualified for a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that quercetin administration decreased alveolar bone loss (tau2 = 0.31, 1.88 mm 95%CI: 1.09, 2.67) in experimental periodontal disease animal models. However, the risk of bias assessment indicated that four SYRCLE domains had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin diminishes periodontal bone loss and prevents disease progression in animal models of experimental periodontal disease. Quercetin might facilitate periodontal tissue hemostasis by reducing senescent cells, decreasing oxidative stress via SIRT1-induced autophagy, limiting inflammation, and fostering an oral bacterial microenvironment of symbiotic microbiota associated with oral health. Future research will show whether and how the promising preclinical results can be translated into the clinical treatment of periodontal disease.
