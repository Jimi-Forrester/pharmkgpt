36511275|a|The SARS-CoV-2 Virus (COVID-19) is responsible for over 239 million cases and 4.8 million deaths globally (Data source WHO COVID-19 Dashboard accessed on October 14, 2021). It continues to surge and ravage countries, leaving healthcare systems in constant struggle and uncertainty. A variety of vaccines were developed to combat the spread of the COVID-19 Virus. Reports of possible allergic reactions with COVID-19 vaccines are a significant cause of public concern, especially among those with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis). Here we review articles relevant to COVID-19 vaccines and their excipients (especially PEG (Polyethylene glycol) and hypersensitivity reactions associated with COVID-19 vaccines (including clinical features, pathophysiology, special populations receiving COVID-19 vaccinations, potential diagnostic tests, and preventive measures that can be taken to minimize the risks of hypersensitivity reactions with COVID-19 vaccines).
