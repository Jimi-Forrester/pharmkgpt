38002010|t|Nanoparticle Formulations of Antioxidants for the Management of Oxidative Stress in Stroke: A Review.
38002010|a|Stroke is currently one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of effective stroke treatment. Therefore, novel treatment strategies are needed to decrease stroke-induced morbidity and promote the patient's quality of life. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as one of the major causes of brain injury after ischemic stroke. Antioxidant therapy seems to be an effective treatment in the management of oxidative stress relevant to inflammatory disorders like stroke. However, the in vivo efficacy of traditional anti-oxidative substances is greatly limited due to their non-specific distribution and poor localization in the disease region. In recent years, antioxidant nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated a clinical breakthrough for stroke treatment. Some NPs have intrinsic antioxidant properties and act as antioxidants to scavenge ROS. Moreover, NPs provide protection to the antioxidant agents/enzymes while effectively delivering them into unreachable areas like the brain. Because of their nanoscale dimensions, NPs are able to efficiently pass through the BBB, and easily reach the damaged site. Here, we discuss the challenges, recent advances, and perspectives of antioxidant NPs in stroke treatment.
