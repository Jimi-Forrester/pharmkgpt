38169680|t|Assessing causal associations between neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors with biological aging: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.
38169680|a|Background: Aging is a significant risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors. Previous studies indicate that the frailty index, facial aging, telomere length (TL), and epigenetic aging clock acceleration are commonly used biological aging proxy indicators. This study aims to comprehensively explore potential relationships between biological aging and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors by integrating various biological aging proxy indicators, employing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Methods: Two-sample bidirectional MR analyses were conducted using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Summary statistics for various neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, along with biological aging proxy indicators, were obtained from extensive meta-analyses of GWAS. Genetic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the exposures were used as instrumental variables, assessing causal relationships between three neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), two benign neurological tumors (vestibular schwannoma and meningioma), one malignant neurological tumor (glioma), and four biological aging indicators (frailty index, facial aging, TL, and epigenetic aging clock acceleration). Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results: Our analysis revealed that genetically predicted longer TL reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease but increases the risk of vestibular schwannoma and glioma (All Glioma, GBM, non-GBM). In addition, there is a suggestive causal relationship between some diseases (PD and GBM) and DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration. Causal relationships between biological aging proxy indicators and other neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors were not observed. Conclusion: Building upon prior investigations into the causal relationships between telomeres and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, our study validates these findings using larger GWAS data and demonstrates, for the first time, that Parkinson's disease and GBM may promote epigenetic age acceleration. Our research provides new insights and evidence into the causal relationships between biological aging and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors.
