20585413|t|An Image Based System Biology Approach for Alzheimer's Disease Pathway Analysis.
20585413|a|We report multifactorial analysis of candidate mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease utilizing high content analysis, gene expression microarray, and linear regression model to integrate neuronal imaging data with hippocampal gene expression data. Our analysis led to the identification of several genes that may contribute to different image traits or phenotypes in the amyloid-beta (Abeta) injured neurons. Gene network and biological pathways analysis for those genes were further analyzed and led to several novel pathways that may contribute to amyloid plaque triggered neurite loss.
