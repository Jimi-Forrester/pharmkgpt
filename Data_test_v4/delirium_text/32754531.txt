32754531|t|The 3 Ds of geriatric psychiatry: A case report.
32754531|a|The three Ds of geriatric psychiatry-delirium, dementia, and depression are common and challenging diagnoses among elderly. Delirium is often difficult to diagnose and is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older adults. Dementia also affects a significant number of older adults and is associated with delirium, depression, frailty, and failure to thrive. It is well known that depression too increases with increasing age. These three syndromes can exist simultaneously in the same patient, and often confer increased risk for each other, especially in the geriatric population. Early identification, classification, and differential diagnosis are important at the primary care level for the timely management of these common problems of old age. We present a case of concurrent findings and complexity in the medical literature.
