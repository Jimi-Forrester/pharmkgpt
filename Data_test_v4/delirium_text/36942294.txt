36942294|t|Drug-disease interaction: Clinical consequences of inflammation on drugs action and disposition.
36942294|a|Inflammation is a culprit in many conditions affecting millions of people worldwide. A plethora of studies has revealed that inflammation and inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines are associated with altered expression and activity of various proteins such as those involved in drug metabolism, specifically cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). Emphasis of most available reports is on the inflammation-induced downregulation of CYPs, subsequently an increase in their substrate concentrations, and the link between the condition and the inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, reports also suggest that inflammation influences expression and/or activity of other proteins such as those involved in the drug-receptor interaction. These multifaced involvements render the clinical consequence of the inflammation unexpected. Such changes are shown in many inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, acute respiratory illnesses as well as natural processes such as aging, among others. For example, some commonly used cardiovascular drugs lose their efficacy when patients get afflicted with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Interestingly, this is despite increased concentration subsequent to reduced clearance. The observation is attributed to a simultaneous reduction in the expression of target receptor proteins such as the calcium and potassium channel and beta-adrenergic receptor as well as the metabolic enzymes. This narrative review summarizes the current understanding and clinical implications of the inflammatory effects on both CYPs and drug-receptor target proteins.
