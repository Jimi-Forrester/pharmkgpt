39435635|a|ABSTRACT: Recent advances in research on extracellular vesicles have significantly enhanced their potential as therapeutic agents for neurological diseases. Owing to their therapeutic properties and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, extracellular vesicles are recognized as promising drug delivery vehicles for various neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, glioma, and psychosis.However, the clinical application of natural extracellular vesicles is hindered by their limited targeting ability and short clearance from the body. To address these limitations, multiple engineering strategies have been developed to enhance the targeting capabilities of extracellular vesicles, thereby enabling the delivery of therapeutic contents to specific tissues or cells. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the latest advancements in natural and targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles, exploring their applications in treating traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioma, and psychosis. Additionally, we summarized recent clinical trials involving extracellular vesicles and discussed the challenges and future prospects of using targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles for drug delivery in treating neurological diseases. This review offers new insights for developing highly targeted therapies in this field.
