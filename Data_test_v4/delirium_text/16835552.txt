16835552|t|Dysphagia in the elderly--a management challenge for nurses.
16835552|a|Dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) is relatively common in the general population, but the prevalence increases with age and poses particular problems in the older patient, potentially compromising nutritional status, complicating the administration of solid medications, increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia and undermining the quality of life. The repercussions of dysphagia are not only physical but also emotional, affecting patient morale and leading to feelings of social isolation. There are various causes, including carcinoma, stroke and advanced Alzheimer's disease. The diverse range of causes may manifest in a number of different ways, but should always act as a warning sign, which requires further investigation. Management is multidisciplinary, depending on the underlying cause, extent of dysphagia and likely prognosis. This article examines the incidence, causes and management of dysphagia, based on a review of recent literature. The focus is on the nurse's role in the management of this challenging disorder with particular emphasis on the care of the elderly patient.
