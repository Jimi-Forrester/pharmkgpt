39069651|t|Emergence delirium: an overview with an emphasis on the use of electroencephalography in its management.
39069651|a|Emergence delirium remains a clinically significant issue, which often leads to distress among pediatric patients, parents, and staff in the short term; and may also result in postoperative maladaptive behaviors persisting for weeks to months. Although several diagnostic tools are available, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale is most often utilized. Many risk factors contributing to the likelihood of a pediatric patient developing emergence delirium have been identified; however, its accurate prediction remains challenging. Recently, intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring has been used to improve the prediction of emergence delirium. Similarly, it may also prevent emergence delirium if the anesthesiologist ensures that the at-risk patient rouses only after the onset of appropriate electroencephalogram patterns, thus indicating a change to natural sleep. Prediction of at-risk patients is crucial; preventing emergence delirium may begin early during patient preparation by using non-pharmacological methods (i.e., the ADVANCE program). Intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring can predict emergence delirium. This review also discusses a range of pharmacological treatment options which may assist the anesthesiologist in preventing emergence delirium among at-risk patients.
