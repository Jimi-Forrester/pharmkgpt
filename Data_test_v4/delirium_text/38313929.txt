38313929|t|Alzheimer's Disease: The Past, Present, and Future of a Globally Progressive Disease.
38313929|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant 21st-century public health challenge. This article delves into AD's neurodegenerative complexities, highlighting cognitive decline, memory impairment, and societal burdens. Mechanistically, protein misfolding, amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathway abnormalities, and genetic/environmental factors are discussed. The pivotal amyloid hypothesis is dissected, focusing on Abeta aggregation's role in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The review showcases promising therapeutic strategies, including anti-amyloid antibodies and beta/gamma-secretase inhibitors targeting Abeta production. Notably, the FDA-approved Lecanemab signifies a breakthrough, slowing disease progression. Anti-Tau therapies' emergence is highlighted, addressing late-stage intervention. Tau aggregation blockers and anti-Tau antibodies offer potential against intracellular tau pathology. The review underscores collaborative efforts to uncover AD's secrets and pave the way for memory preservation.
