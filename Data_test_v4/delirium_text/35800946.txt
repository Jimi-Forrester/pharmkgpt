35800946|t|Brain Structural and Functional Changes in Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease.
35800946|a|Cognitive neuropsychology seeks a potential alignment between structural and functional brain features to explain physiological or pathological processes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several structural and functional brain changes occurring during the disease, including cognitive impairment, are found at the end of the patient's life, but we need to know more about what happens before its onset. In order to do that, we need earlier biomarkers at preclinical stages, defined by those biomarkers, to prevent the cognitive impairment. In this minireview, we have tried to describe the structural and functional changes found at different stages during AD, focusing on those features taking place before clinical diagnosis.
