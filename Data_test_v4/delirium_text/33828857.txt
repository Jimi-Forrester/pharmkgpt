33828857|t|The management of displaced femoral neck fractures: a narrative review.
33828857|a|This article serves to review the existing clinical guidelines, and highlight the most recent medical and surgical recommendations, for the management of displaced femoral neck fractures (FNFs). It stresses the need for multi-disciplinary intervention to potentially improve mortality rates, limit adverse events and prevent further economic liability.Globally, the incidence of FNFs continues to rise as the general population ages and becomes more active. The annual number of FNFs is expected to exceed six million by 2050. The increased burden of FNFs exacerbates the demand on all services associated with treating these injuries.The management of FNFs may serve as an indicator of the quality of care of the geriatric population. However, despite escalating health costs, a significant 30-day and one-year mortality rate, increased rate of peri-operative adverse events and sub-optimal functional clinical outcomes, continued controversy exists over optimal patient care.Much debate exists over the type of surgery, implant selection and peri-operative clinical care and rehabilitation. FNF care models, systematized clinical pathways, formal geriatrics consultation and specialized wards within an established interdisciplinary care framework may improve outcomes, mitigate adverse events and limit unnecessary costs.
