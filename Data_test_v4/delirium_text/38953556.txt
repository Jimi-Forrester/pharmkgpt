38953556|a|Both osteoporosis and tendinopathy are widely prevalent disorders, encountered in diverse medical contexts. Whilst each condition has distinct pathophysiological characteristics, they share several risk factors and underlying causes. Notably, oxidative stress emerges as a crucial intersecting factor, playing a pivotal role in the onset and progression of both diseases. This imbalance arises from a dysregulation in generating and neutralising reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to an abnormal oxidative environment. Elevated levels of ROS can induce multiple cellular disruptions, such as cytotoxicity, apoptosis activation and reduced cell function, contributing to tissue deterioration and weakening the structural integrity of bones and tendons. Antioxidants are substances that can prevent or slow down the oxidation process, including Vitamin C, melatonin, resveratrol, anthocyanins and so on, demonstrating potential in treating these overlapping disorders. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the complex role of oxidative stress within the interlinked pathways of these comorbid conditions. By integrating contemporary research and empirical findings, our objective is to outline new conceptual models and innovative treatment strategies for effectively managing these prevalent diseases. This review underscores the importance of further in-depth research to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and traditional Chinese medicine in treatment plans, as well as to explore targeted interventions focused on oxidative stress as promising areas for future medical advancements.
