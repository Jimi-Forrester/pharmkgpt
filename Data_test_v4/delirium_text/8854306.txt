8854306|t|Apo-E genotype and verbal deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
8854306|a|Apo-E genotype was not significantly related to cognitive performance in 157 Alzheimer's disease patients. However, patients homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele appeared most impaired on global cognition but least impaired on language measures. Further study with larger samples may reveal that Apo-E genotype accounts for some of the variability in cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease.
