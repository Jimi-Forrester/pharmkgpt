30778295|a|With the aging population rapidly increasing worldwide, preventive measures and treatments for age-related cognitive decline and dementia are of utmost importance. We have previously demonstrated that the consumption of iso-alpha-acids (IAA), which are hop-derived bitter compounds in beer, prevents the formation of disease pathology in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of IAA consumption on age-related cognitive decline is unknown. In the present study, we examined the effect of long-term and short-term dietary consumption of IAA, on age-related memory impairments and inflammation in the hippocampus of aged mice. When compared with young mice, aged mice showed impairment in spatial working memory during the Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, impairment in object recognition memory during the novel object recognition test (NORT), a pro-inflammatory hippocampal microglial phenotype with increased CD86 expression and inflammatory cytokine production, increased levels of glutamate and amyloid beta1-42, and decreased levels of dopamine (DA). In aged mice fed IAA for 3 months, the age-related alterations in memory, microglial inflammation, and glutamate, amyloid beta1-42, and DA levels were all significantly attenuated. Additionally, the oral administration of IAA for 7 days in aged mice with memory impairment, also improved spatial and object recognition memory. These results suggest that IAA consumption prevents inflammation in the hippocampus and ameliorates age-related cognitive decline.
