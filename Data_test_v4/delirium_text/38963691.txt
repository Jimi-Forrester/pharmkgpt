38963691|t|Efficacy of COMPAs, an App Designed to Support Communication Between Persons Living With Dementia in Long-Term Care Settings and Their Caregivers: Mixed Methods Implementation Study.
38963691|a|BACKGROUND: Persons living with dementia experience autonomy loss and require caregiver support on a daily basis. Dementia involves a gradual decline in communication skills, leading to fewer interactions and isolation for both people living with dementia and their caregivers, negatively impacting the quality of life for both members of the dyad. The resulting stress and burden on caregivers make them particularly susceptible to burnout. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the efficacy of Communication Proches Aidants (COMPAs), an app designed following the principles of person-centered and emotional communication, which is intended to improve well-being in persons living with dementia and caregivers and reduce caregiver burden. METHODS: In this implementation study, volunteer caregivers in 2 long-term care facilities (n=17) were trained in using COMPAs and strategies to improve communication with persons living with dementia. Qualitative and quantitative analyses, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires were completed before and after 8 weeks of intervention with COMPAs. RESULTS: Semistructured interviews revealed that all caregivers perceived a positive impact following COMPAs interventions, namely, improved quality of communication and quality of life among persons living with dementia and caregivers. Improved quality of life was also supported by a statistically significant reduction in the General Health Questionnaire-12 scores (caregivers who improved: 9/17, 53%; z=2.537; P=.01). COMPAs interventions were also associated with a statistically significant increased feeling of personal accomplishment (caregivers improved: 11/17, 65%; t15=2.430; P=.03; d=0.61 [medium effect size]). CONCLUSIONS: COMPAs intervention improved well-being in persons living with dementia and their caregivers by developing person-centered communication within the dyad, increasing empathy, and reducing burden in caregivers although most caregivers were unfamiliar with technology. The results hold promise for COMPAs interventions in long-term care settings. Larger group-controlled studies with different populations, in different contexts, and at different stages of dementia will provide a clearer picture of the benefits of COMPAs interventions.
