33073383|a|Changes in hippocampal subfield volumes (HSV) along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have been scarcely investigated to date in elderly subjects classified based on the presence of beta-amyloid aggregation and signs of neurodegeneration. We classified patients (either sex) with mild dementia compatible with AD (n = 35) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 39), and cognitively unimpaired subjects (either sex; n = 26) using [11 C]PIB-PET to assess beta-amyloid aggregation (A+) and [18 F]FDG-PET to account for neurodegeneration ((N)+). Magnetic resonance imaging-based automated methods were used for HSV and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measurements. Significant HSV reductions were found in A+(N)+ subjects in the presubiculum/subiculum complex and molecular layer, related to worse memory performance. In both the A+(N)+ and A+(N)- categories, subicular volumes were inversely correlated with the degree of Abeta deposition. The A-(N)+ subgroup showed reduced HSV relative to the A-(N)- subgroup also in the subiculum/presubiculum. Combining all (N)- subjects, HSV were lower in subjects presenting significant cognitive decline irrespective of A+/A- classification (controlling for WMH load); these between-group differences were detected again in the presubiculum, but also involved the CA4 and granular layer. These findings demonstrate that differential HSV reductions are detectable both in (N)+ and (N)- categories along the AD continuum, and are directly related to the severity of cognitive deficits. HSV reductions are larger both in A+(N)+ and A+(N)- subjects in direct proportion to the degree of Abeta deposition. The meaningful HSV reductions detected in the A-(N)+ subgroup highlights the strength of biomarker-based classifications outside of the classical AD continuum.
