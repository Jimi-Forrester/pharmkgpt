37120663|a|Despite the reported sex-related variations in the immune response to vaccination, whether the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination differ by sex is still under debate, especially considering old vulnerable individuals, such as long-term care facilities (LTCFs) residents. This study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 infections, adverse events, and humoral response after vaccination in a sample of LTCF residents. A total of 3259 LTCF residents (71% females; mean age: 83.4 +- 9.2 years) were enrolled in the Italian-based multicenter GeroCovid Vax study. We recorded the adverse effects occurring during the 7 days after vaccine doses and COVID-19 cases over 12 months post-vaccination. In a subsample of 524 residents (69% females), pre- and post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S immunoglobulin G (Anti-S-IgG) were measured through chemiluminescent assays at different time points. Only 12.1% of vaccinated residents got COVID-19 during the follow-up, without any sex differences. Female residents were more likely to have local adverse effects after the first dose (13.3% vs. 10.2%, p = 0.018). No other sex differences in systemic adverse effects and for the following doses were recorded, as well as in anti-S-IgG titer over time. Among the factors modifying the 12-month anti-S-IgG titers, mobility limitations and depressive disorder were more likely to be associated with higher and lower levels in the antibody response, respectively; a significantly lower antibody titer was observed in males with cardiovascular diseases and in females with diabetes or cognitive disorders. The study suggests that, among LTCF residents, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was effective regardless of sex, yet sex-specific comorbidities influenced the antibody response. Local adverse reactions were more common in females.
