37769542|t|Sedation and analgesia strategies for non-invasive mechanical ventilation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
37769542|a|BACKGROUND: The use of sedative and analgesic drugs during non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness of sedative and analgesic medications used during NIV for patients with ARF to no sedation or analgesia. In addition, to investigate the characteristics of dexmedetomidine in comparison to other medications. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched. Mean differences (MDs) or pooled risk ratios (RRs) were computed using random-effects models. We applied the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool 2.0 to assess the methodological quality of eligible studies and the GRADE approach to evaluate the evidence certainty. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were selected. Whether in Group A (using sedative and analgesic drugs vs. nonuse) or Group B (using dexmedetomidine vs. other drugs), the rates of tracheal intubation and delirium, the length of NIV, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU LOS) all decreased in both experimental groups (P < 0.05). And there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality and the incidence of hypotension between the two groups (P > 0.05), while both Group A and Group B's experimental groups had greater incidences of bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Administering sedative and analgesic medications during NIV can reduce the risk of tracheal intubation and delirium. Additionally, dexmedetomidine outperformed other sedative medications in terms of these clinical outcomes, making it the better option when closely monitoring patients' vital signs.
