33016911|t|The Impact of Amyloid-beta or Tau on Cognitive Change in the Presence of Severe Cerebrovascular Disease.
33016911|a|BACKGROUND: As Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) commonly coexist, the interaction between two has been of the considerable interest. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether the association of Abeta and tau with cognitive decline differs by the presence of significant CSVD. METHODS: We included 60 subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) from Samsung Medical Center and 82 Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment (ADCI) from ADNI, who underwent Abeta (florbetaben or florbetapir) and tau (flortaucipir, FTP) PET imaging. They were retrospectively assessed for 5.0+-3.9 and 5.6+-1.9 years with Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB)/Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mixed effects models were used to investigate the interaction between Abeta/tau and group on CDR-SB/MMSE changes. RESULTS: The frequency of Abeta positivity (45% versus 54.9%, p = 0.556) and mean global FTP SUVR (1.17+-0.21 versus 1.16+-0.17, p = 0.702) were not different between the two groups. We found a significant interaction effect of Abeta positivity and SVCI group on CDR-SB increase/MMSE decrease (p = 0.013/p < 0.001), and a significant interaction effect of global FTP uptake and SVCI group on CDR-SB increase/MMSE decrease (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030). Finally, the interaction effects of regional tau and group were prominent in the Braak III/IV (p = 0.001) and V/VI (p = 0.003) not in Braak I/II region (p = 0.398). CONCLUSION: The association between Abeta/tau and cognitive decline is stronger in SVCI than in ADCI. Therefore, our findings suggested that Abeta positivity or tau burden (particularly in the Braak III/IV or V/VI regions) and CSVD might synergistically affect cognitive decline.
