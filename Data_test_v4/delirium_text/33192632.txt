33192632|t|P50, N100, and P200 Auditory Sensory Gating Deficits in Schizophrenia Patients.
33192632|a|BACKGROUND: Sensory gating describes neurological processes of filtering out redundant or unnecessary stimuli during information processing, and sensory gating deficits may contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia. Among the three components of auditory event-related potentials reflecting sensory gating, P50 implies pre-attentional filtering of sensory information and N100/P200 reflects attention triggering and allocation processes. Although diminished P50 gating has been extensively documented in patients with schizophrenia, previous studies on N100 were inconclusive, and P200 has been rarely examined. This study aimed to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia have P50, N100, and P200 gating deficits compared with control subjects. METHODS: Control subjects and clinically stable schizophrenia patients were recruited. The mid-latency auditory evoked responses, comprising P50, N100, and P200, were measured using the auditory-paired click paradigm without manipulation of attention. Sensory gating parameters included S1 amplitude, S2 amplitude, amplitude difference (S1-S2), and gating ratio (S2/S1). We also evaluated schizophrenia patients with PANSS to be correlated with sensory gating indices. RESULTS: One hundred four patients and 102 control subjects were examined. Compared to the control group, schizophrenia patients had significant sensory gating deficits in P50, N100, and P200, reflected by larger gating ratios and smaller amplitude differences. Further analysis revealed that the S2 amplitude of P50 was larger, while the S1 amplitude of N100/P200 was smaller, in schizophrenia patients than in the controls. We found no correlations between sensory gating indices and schizophrenia positive or negative symptom clusters. However, we found a negative correlation between the P200 S2 amplitude and Bell's emotional discomfort factor/Wallwork's depressed factor. CONCLUSION: Till date, this study has the largest sample size to analyze P50, N100, and P200 collectively by adopting the passive auditory paired-click paradigm without distractors. With covariates controlled for possible confounds, such as age, education, smoking amount and retained pairs, we found that schizophrenia patients had significant sensory gating deficits in P50-N100-P200. The schizophrenia patients had demonstrated a unique pattern of sensory gating deficits, including repetition suppression deficits in P50 and stimulus registration deficits in N100/200. These results suggest that sensory gating is a pervasive cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia patients that is not limited to the pre-attentive phase of information processing. Since P200 exhibited a large effect size and did not require additional time during recruitment, future studies of P50-N100-P200 collectively are highly recommended.
