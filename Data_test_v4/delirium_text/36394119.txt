36394119|a|We present the results of a phase 1 study that evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary disease response to cusatuzumab, a novel anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody, in combination with azacitidine, in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia Japanese participants who were not candidates for intensive treatment. In this multicenter, single-arm study, six participants were enrolled and treated. Only in cycle 1, participants received cusatuzumab monotherapy on day 14. Subsequently, cusatuzumab was administered intravenously on days 3 and 17 at 20 mg/kg in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m2 ) on days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. All six participants had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades) were leukopenia (four participants [66.7%]) and constipation (three participants [50.0%]). No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during the study period. The combination of cusatuzumab and azacitidine is generally well tolerated in Japanese participants, and further exploration of this combination is warranted.
