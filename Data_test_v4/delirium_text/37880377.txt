37880377|t|Effect of AT1 receptor blockade on cardiovascular outcome after cardiac arrest: an experimental study in rats.
37880377|a|Angiotensin II receptor 1(AT1) antagonists are beneficial in focal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, in cases of global I/R, such as cardiac arrest (CA), AT1 blocker's potential benefits are still unknown. Wistar male rats were allocated into four groups: Control group (CG)-animals submitted to CA by ventricular fibrillation induced by direct electrical stimulation for 3 min, and anoxia for 5 min; Group AT1 (GAT1)-animals subjected to CA and treated with 0.2 mg/kg of candesartan diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1%); Vehicle Group (VG): animals subjected to CA and treated with 0.2 ml/kg of DMSO and Sham group (SG)-animals submitted to surgical interventions, without CA. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation consisted of group medications, chest compressions, ventilation, epinephrine (20 mcg/kg) and defibrillation. The animals were observed up to 4 h after spontaneous circulation (ROSC) return, and survival rates, hemodynamic variables, histopathology, and markers of tissue injury were analyzed. GAT1 group had a higher rate of ROSC (62.5% vs. 42.1%, p < 0.0001), survival (100% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.027), lower incidence of arrhythmia after 10 min of ROSC (10% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.000), and lower neuronal and cardiac injury scores on histology evaluation (p = 0.025 and p = 0.0052, respectively) than GC group. The groups did not differ regarding CA duration, number of adrenaline doses, or number of defibrillations. AT1 receptor blockade with candesartan yielded higher rates of ROSC and survival, in addition to neuronal and myocardial protection.
