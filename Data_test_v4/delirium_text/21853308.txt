21853308|t|In vivo imaging of astrocytosis in Alzheimer's disease: an 11C-L-deuteriodeprenyl and PIB PET study.
21853308|a|PURPOSE: Astrocytosis is an important feature of the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet there is currently no way of detecting this phenomenon in vivo. METHODS: In this study we examine the retention of the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer (11)C-L-deuteriodeprenyl (DED), thought to bind activated astrocytes, in 9 patients with moderate to severe AD compared with 11 healthy controls. As a measure of amyloid load, (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) retention was determined. RESULTS: Results show a significantly higher (11)C-L-DED retention in the frontal (35.1% increase, p = 0.001), parietal (35.2%, p = 0.001), temporal (30.9%, p = 0.0001) and medial temporal lobes (22.3%, p = 0.001) in AD compared to healthy controls after blood flow correction. DED retention in the sensorimotor and occipital cortices, and in white matter and subcortical structures, did not differ between groups. There was a moderate but statistically significant (r = 0.492, p = 0.01) correlation between DED and PIB retention values. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is that DED may serve as an in vivo marker for astrocytosis in AD, providing a window into intermediate processes between amyloidosis and neuronal loss and a means of monitoring immunotherapy.
