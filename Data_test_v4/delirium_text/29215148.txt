29215148|a|PURPOSE: To determine the phosphorus-31 T2 s of phosphomonoesters, phosphodiesters, and inorganic phosphate in the healthy human brain at 7T. METHODS: A 3D chemical shift imaging multi-echo sequence with composite block pulses for refocusing was used to measure one free induction decay (FID) and seven full echoes with an echo spacing of 45 ms on the brain of nine healthy volunteers (age range 22-45 years; average age 27 +- 8 years). Spectral fitting was used to determine the change in metabolic signal amplitude with echo time. RESULTS: The average apparent T2 s with their standard deviation were 202 +- 6 ms, 129 +- 6 ms, 86 +- 2 ms, 214 +- 10 ms, and 213 +- 11 ms for phosphoethanolamine, phosphocholine, inorganic phosphate, glycerophosphoethanolamine, and glycerophosphocholine, respectively. CONCLUSION: The determined apparent T2 for phosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphocholine, and glycerophosphoethanolamine is approximately 200 ms. The lower apparent T2 value for phosphocholine is attributed to the overlap of this resonance with the 3-phosphorous resonance of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate from blood, with an apparent shorter T2 . Omitting the FID signal and the first echo of phosphocholine leads to a T2 of 182 +- 7 ms, whereas a biexponential analysis leads to 203 +- 4 ms. These values are more in line with phosphoethanolamine and the phosphodiesters. The short T2 of inorganic phosphate is subscribed to the fast reversible exchange with gamma-adenosine triphosphate, which is mediated by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase within the glycolytic pathway.
