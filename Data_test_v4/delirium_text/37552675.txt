37552675|a|There is a growing focus on interventions at the health system level to promote healthy aging and provide age-friendly health services (AFHS) in low- and middle-income countries where populations are aging. This study aimed to determine the provider and facility readiness for AFHS. We developed and implemented surveys to collect PHC facility capacity and readiness to deliver AFHS and a KAP survey for facility healthcare workers based on guidelines from the WHO age-friendly tool kit and questionnaires from other studies. Direct observation and structured interviews of facility heads were conducted in a stratified random sample of 15 out of the 57 comprehensive PHC facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. One hundred and twenty providers were conveniently sampled for the KAP survey. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA version 15 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). For facility readiness, only 13.3% of PHCs sometimes offered hearing assessment and none of the PHCs offered colorectal cancer assessment. Few (20.0%) facilities offered home services and only 1 (0.7%) had dedicated funding for care of older people. Ramps were at the entrance in 60.0% of facilities and almost half (43.3%) of the PHCs had wheelchair accessible entrances to the public toilets. The majority of HCWs (81.7%) had heard about healthy aging but only 5.0% about AFHS, only 10.8% reported formal training. Around a third knew about specific conditions which affect people as they age, including; depression (37.5%), urinary incontinence (35.0%), and falls/immobility (33.3%). Over half of the providers (54.2%) screened for malnutrition in older patients, 25.8% screened for suspected elder abuse and much less (19.2%) for delirium. This study found some areas of strength but also gaps in facility readiness as well as knowledge and training needed to support AFHS care. We recommend identifying interventions to improve the availability and delivery of care for older adults.
