36823628|t|The critical role of KLF4 in regulating the activation of A1/A2 reactive astrocytes following ischemic stroke.
36823628|a|BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that the expression of kruppel-like transcription factor-4 (KLF-4) is upregulated in astrocytes following acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and found that KLF4 confers vascular protection against cerebral ischemic injury. However, the functional role of KLF4 in astrocyte after AIS is far from clear. METHODS: The intrinsic relationship between KLF4 and A1/A2 reactive astrocytes and the impact of astrocytic KLF4 on the activation of A1/A2 subtype astrocytes were evaluated in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation and restoration (OGD/R) astrocytes. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that astrocytic KLF4 expression and complement C3-positive A1 and S100 calcium binding protein A10 (S100A10)-positive A2 astrocytes were induced in the ischemic penumbra following focal cerebral ischemia, and the time course of upregulation of astrocytic KLF4 correlated closely with the activation of A2 astrocytes. The dual immunofluorescent studies displayed that in the ischemic hemisphere, where the high levels of KLF4 were expressed, there were relatively low levels of C3 expressed in the reactive astrocytes and vice versa, but KLF4 was always co-stained well with S100A10. Mechanistic analyses revealed that astrocytic KLF4 inhibited the activation of A1 astrocyte but promoted A2 astrocyte polarization after OGD/R by modulating expressions of nuclear factor-kB. CONCLUSIONS: Astrocyte-derived KLF4 has a critical role in regulating the activation of A1/A2 reactive astrocytes following AIS.
