35052535|t|On the Antioxidant Properties of L-Kynurenine: An Efficient ROS Scavenger and Enhancer of Rat Brain Antioxidant Defense.
35052535|a|L-kynurenine (L-KYN) is an endogenous metabolite, that has been used as a neuroprotective strategy in experimental models. The protective effects of L-KYN have been attributed mainly to kynurenic acid (KYNA). However, considering that L-KYN is prone to oxidation, this redox property may play a substantial role in its protective effects. The aim of this work was to characterize the potential impact of the redox properties of L-KYN, in both synthetic and biological systems. First, we determined whether L-KYN scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prevents DNA and protein oxidative degradation in synthetic systems. The effect of L-KYN and KYNA (0.1-100 microM) on redox markers (ROS production, lipoperoxidation and cellular function) was compared in rat brain homogenates when exposed to FeSO4 (10 microM). Then, the effect of L-KYN administration (75 mg/kg/day for 5 days) on the GSH content and the enzymatic activity of glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was determined in rat brain tissue. Finally, brain homogenates from rats pretreated with L-KYN were exposed to pro-oxidants and oxidative markers were evaluated. The results show that L-KYN is an efficient scavenger of  OH and ONOO-, but not O2 - or H2O2 and that it prevents DNA and protein oxidative degradation in synthetic systems. L-KYN diminishes the oxidative effect induced by FeSO4 on brain homogenates at lower concentrations (1 microM) when compared to KYNA (100 microM). Furthermore, the sub-chronic administration of L-KYN increased the GSH content and the activity of both GR and GPx, and also prevented the oxidative damage induced by the ex vivo exposure to pro-oxidants. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that L-KYN can be considered as a potential endogenous antioxidant.
