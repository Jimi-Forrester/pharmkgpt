20628482|a|Introduction. Colonic cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and most often occurs in patients aged 65 years or older. Aim. To evaluate the outcome of colonic surgery in the elderly in our hospital and to compare five-year survival rates between the younger and elderly patients. Methods. 207 consecutive patients underwent surgery for colon cancer. Patients were separated in patients younger than 75 and older than 75 years. Results. Elderly patients presented significantly more (P < .05) as a surgical emergency, had a longer duration of admission and were more often admitted to the ICU (P < .01). Also, elderly patients had significant more co-morbidities, especially cardiovascular pathology (P < .01). Post-operative complications were seen more often in the elderly, although no significant difference was seen in anastomotic leakage. The five-year survival rate in the younger group was 62% compared with 36% in the elderly (P < .05). DFS was 61% in the younger patients compared with 32% in the elderly (P < .05). Conclusion. Curative resection of colonic carcinoma in the elderly is well tolerated and age alone should not be an indication for less aggressive therapy. However, the type and number of co-morbidities influence post-operative mortality and morbidity.
