37292926|a|Excessive brain iron accumulation is observed in early in the onset of Alzheimer's disease, notably prior to widespread proteinopathy. These findings suggest that increases in brain iron levels are due to a dysregulation of the iron transport mechanism at the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes release signals (apo- and holo-transferrin) that communicate brain iron needs to endothelial cells in order to modulate iron transport. Here we use iPSC-derived astrocytes and endothelial cells to investigate how early-disease levels of amyloid-beta disrupt iron transport signals secreted by astrocytes to stimulate iron transport from endothelial cells. We demonstrate that conditioned media from astrocytes treated with amyloid-beta stimulates iron transport from endothelial cells and induces changes in iron transport pathway protein levels. The mechanism underlying this response begins with increased iron uptake and mitochondrial activity by the astrocytes which in turn increases levels of apo-transferrin in the amyloid-beta conditioned astrocyte media leading to increased iron transport from endothelial cells. These novel findings offer a potential explanation for the initiation of excessive iron accumulation in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. What's more, these data provide the first example of how the mechanism of iron transport regulation by apo- and holo-transferrin becomes misappropriated in disease to detrimental ends. The clinical benefit from understanding early dysregulation in brain iron transport in AD cannot be understated. If therapeutics can target this early process, they could possibly prevent the detrimental cascade that occurs with excessive iron accumulation. Significance Statement: Excessive brain iron accumulation is hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease that occurs early in the disease staging and before widespread proteinopathy deposition. This overabundance of brain iron has been implicated to contribute to disease progression, thus understandingthe mechanism of early iron accumulation has significant therapeutic potential to slow to halt disease progression. Here, we show that in response to low levels of amyloid-beta exposure, astrocytes increase their mitochondrial activity and iron uptake, resulting in iron deficient conditions. Elevated levels of apo (iron free)-transferrin stimulate iron release from endothelial cells. These data are the first to propose a mechanism for the initiation of iron accumulation and the misappropriation of iron transport signaling leading to dysfunctional brain iron homeostasis and resultant disease pathology.
