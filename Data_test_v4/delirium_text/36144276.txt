36144276|t|Non-Invasive Metabolic and Structural Retinal Markers in Patients with Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica: A Cross-Sectional Study.
36144276|a|Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a potential sight-threatening disease. Although it is associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), visual loss is not common in PMR. A retinal oximeter can be used to conduct a direct, non-invasive, in vivo assessment of the vascular system. In a cross-sectional study, we measured the retinal oxygen saturation and retinal vessel calibers in GCA patients, PMR patients, and control participants. Twenty GCA patients (38 eyes), 19 PMR patients (33 eyes), and 12 controls (20 eyes) were investigated. Images were analyzed using Oxymap Analyzer software 2.5.0 (Oxymap ehf., Reykjavik, Iceland). Groups were compared using an age- and sex-adjusted linear mixed model regression. The median (IQR) age for GCA patients was 69.0 (66.5-76.5) years, for PMR 69.0 (67.0-72.0) years, and for the controls 75.5 (71.5-81.0) years, respectively. As compared to the controls (115.3 microm), the retinal arterioles were significantly wider in patients with GCA (124.4 microm; p = 0.023) and PMR (124.8 microm; p = 0.049). No difference was found in the retinal venular caliber or vascular oxygen saturation. These results indicate that GCA and PMR patients differ similarly in the retinal arteriolar diameter compared to controls. Further studies are needed in order to clarify the underlying inflammatory mechanisms in retinal arteriolar vessels and if these parameters can be used to predict clinical outcomes.
