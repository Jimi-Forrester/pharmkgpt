34368424|t|Light Levels in ICU Patient Rooms: Dimming of Daytime Light in Occupied Rooms.
34368424|a|One-third of patients report disruption of sleep by overnight light. Importantly, light causes both immediate sleep disturbance and influences circadian function, a fundamental process underpinning high-quality sleep. Short bursts of light at night and/or lack of bright daytime light disrupt circadian alignment, leading to sleep deficiency. To improve understanding of 24-hour light patterns, we conducted a longitudinal study of light levels in intensive care unit (ICU) rooms. Over 450 room-days, we observed high variability, dim daytime light, and active dimming of natural sunlight in occupied rooms. Such noncircadian light patterns have multifactorial influences on sleep and are a key target for sleep improvement in the ICU.
