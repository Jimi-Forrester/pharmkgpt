In addition to environmental factors, numerous studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in the development of NAFLD. Copy number variation (CNV) as a genetic variation plays an important role in the evaluation of disease susceptibility and genetic differences. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of CNV to the evaluation of NAFLD in a Chinese population. METHODS: Genome-wide analysis of CNV was performed using high-density comparative genomic hybridisation microarrays (ACGH). To validate the CNV regions, TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was utilized. RESULTS: A total of 441 CNVs were identified, including 381 autosomal CNVs and 60 sex chromosome CNVs. By merging overlapping CNVs, a genomic CNV map of NAFLD patients was constructed. A total of 338 autosomal CNVRs were identified, including 275 CNVRs with consistent trends (197 losses and 78 gains) and 63 CNVRs with inconsistent trends. The length of the 338 CNVRs ranged from 5.7 kb to 2.23 Mb, with an average size of 117.44 kb. These CNVRs spanned 39.70 Mb of the genome and accounted for ~ 1.32% of the genome sequence. Through Gene Ontology and genetic pathway analysis, we found evidence that CNVs involving nine genes may be associated with the pathogenesis of NAFLD progression. One of the genes (NLRP4 gene) was selected and verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) method with large sample size. We found the copy number deletion of NLRP4 was related to the risk of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicate the copy number variation is associated with NAFLD. The copy number deletion of NLRP4 was related to the risk of NAFLD. These results could prove valuable for predicting patients at risk of developing NAFLD.
