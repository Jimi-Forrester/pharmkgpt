30843389|a|In this work, the ferrocene-encapsulated Zn zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) was prepared by the self-assembly of Zn ions and 2-methylimidazole and used for the dual detection of amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO), which is the main neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Ferrocene is an optically and electrochemically active signal which was successfully encapsulated inside of the ZIF-8 and released by the competitive coordination between Zn ions and AbetaO after being treated with AbetaO. The released ferrocene content was monitored by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry and cyclic voltammetry. The dual determination of AbetaO played a synergetic role in the quick qualitative and precise quantitative analyses in a wide detection range of 10-5 to 102 muM and good feasibility in artificial cerebrospinal fluid.
