36572725|t|Effect of learning on slow gamma propagation between hippocampus and cortex in the wild-type and AD mice.
36572725|a|Slow gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been suggested to coordinate information transfer between brain structures involved in memory formation. Whereas the involvement of slow gamma in memory processing was studied by means of correlation between the gamma power and the occurrence of a given event (sharp wave ripples (SWRs), cortical transients), our approach consists of the analysis of the transmission of slow gamma itself. We use the method based on Granger causality principle-direct Directed Transfer Function, which allows to determine directed propagation of brain activity, including bidirectional flows. Four cortical sites along with CA1 ipsi- and contralateral were recorded in behaving wild-type and APP/PS1 mice before and after learning session of a spatial memory task. During slow wave sleep propagation of slow gamma was bidirectional, forming multiple loops of interaction which involved both CA1 and some of cortical sites. In episodes coincident with SWRs the number and strength of connectivity pathways increased in both groups compared to episodes without SWRs. The effect of learning was expressed only in APP/PS1 mice and consisted in strengthening of the slow gamma transmission from hippocampus to cortex as well as between both CA1 which may serve more efficient transmission of information from impaired CA1.
