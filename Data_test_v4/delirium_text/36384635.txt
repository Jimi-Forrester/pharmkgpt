36384635|a|Precision medicine is the ultimate goal for current disease therapies, including tumor and infection. The lack of specific targeted drugs for liver cancer and the lack of specific anti-infective drugs in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer with infection (DFI) are the representative obstacles in those 2 major diseases currently plaguing human beings. Inventing natural biocompatible polymers derived from natural materials is one of the main development directions of current bio-medical materials. Though previous studies have demonstrated the potential application values of human black hair-derived nanoparticles (HNP) in cancer, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, and thrombosis scenarios treatments, it still has not solved the problem of low local therapeutic concentration and general targeting ability. Here, we firstly modified the HNP with membrane encapsulations, which endowed these dual-pure natural bio-fabricated materials with better targeting ability at the disease sites with no reduction in photothermal therapy (PTT) effect. HNP coated by red blood cell membrane loaded with DSPE-PEG-cRGD peptide for the therapeutic application of liver cancer greatly prolonged in vivo circulation time and enhanced local targeting efficacy as well as low toxicity; HNP coated by the murine macrophage cell membrane (RAWM) for the DFIs treatment greatly promoted the adhesive ability of HNP on the bacteria and thereby improved the killing effect. Briefly, the appropriate cell membranes camouflaged HNP nanomedicine has the characteristics of excellent photothermal effect, an all-natural source with excellent biocompatibility and easy access, which is expected to have huge potential in both benign and malignant diseases.
