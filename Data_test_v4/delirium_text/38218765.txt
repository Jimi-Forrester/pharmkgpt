38218765|a|BACKGROUND: High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous danger signal that mediates activation of the innate immune response including NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and proinflammatory cytokine release. Although HMGB1 and NLRP3 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of seizures, the correlation between HMGB1 and NLRP3 expression has not been determined in children with febrile seizures (FS). To explore the relationship between extra-cellular HMGB1 and NLRP3 in children with FS, we analyzed serum HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1, and proinflammatory cytokines in patients with FS. METHODS: Thirty children with FS and thirty age-matched febrile controls were included in this study. Blood was obtained from the children with FS within 1 h of the time of the seizure; subsequently, the serum contents of HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1beta, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare serum cytokine levels between FS patients and controls. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated to detect significant correlations between cytokine levels. RESULTS: Serum levels of HMGB1, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in FS patients than in febrile controls (p < 0.05). Serum levels of HMGB1 were significantly correlated with levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1 (both, p < 0.05). Serum levels of caspase-1 were significantly correlated with levels of IL-1beta (p < 0.05). Serum levels of IL-1beta were significantly correlated with levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 is up-regulated in the peripheral serum of FS patients, which may be responsible, at least in part, for the increased expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1. Increased expression of caspase-1 was significantly associated with elevated serum levels of IL-1beta. Given that activated Caspase-1 directly regulates the expression of mature IL-1beta and positively correlates with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, our data suggest that increased levels of peripheral HMGB1 possibly mediate IL-1beta secretion through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in children with FS. Thus, both HMGB1 and NLRP3 might be potential targets for preventing or limiting FS.
