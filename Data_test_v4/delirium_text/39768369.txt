39768369|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of death among neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting around 2% of the population. It is expected that the incidence of PD will exceed 12 million by 2040. Meanwhile, there is a recognized difference in the phenotypical expression of the disease and response to treatment between men and women. Men have twice the incidence of PD compared to women, who have a late onset and worse prognosis that is usually associated with menopause. In addition, the incidence of PD in women is associated with the cumulative estrogen levels in their bodies. These differences are suggested to be due to the protective effect of estrogen on the brain, which cannot be given in clinical practice to improve the symptoms of the disease because of its peripheral side effects, causing cancer in both males and females in addition to the feminizing effect it has on males. As PD pathophysiology involves alteration in the expression levels of multiple LncRNAs, including metastatic-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and as estrogen has been illustrated to control the expression of MALAT1 in multiple conditions, it is worth investigating the estrogen-MALAT1 interaction in Parkinson's disease to mimic its protective effect on the brain while avoiding its peripheral side effects. The following literature review suggests the potential regulation of MALAT1 by estrogen in PD, which would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, improving the development of more tailored and effective treatments.
