35092416|t|Insights into the role of paraoxonase 2 in human pathophysiology.
35092416|a|Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular enzyme that is known to have a protective role from oxidative stress. Clinical studies have also demonstrated the significance of PON2 in the manifestation of cardiovascular and several other diseases, and hence, it is considered an important biomarker. Recent findings of its expression in brain tissue suggest its potential protective effect on oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Polymorphisms of PON2 in humans are a risk factor in many pathological conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism of its anti-oxidative property probably through lactonase activity. However, exogenous factors may also modulate the expression and activity of PON2. Hence, this review aims to report the mechanism by which PON2 expression is regulated and its role in oxidative stress disorders such as neurodegeneration and tumor formation. The role of PON2 owing to its lactonase activity in bacterial infectious diseases and association of PON2 polymorphism with pathological conditions are also highlighted.
