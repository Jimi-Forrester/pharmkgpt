30131243|a|The beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque is one of the neuropathological hallmarks in the Alzheimer's disease brain. The detection of Abeta plaques with fluorescence probes is useful for preclinical studies of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we developed four novel fluorescence probes based on chalcone scaffold. In an in vitro binding study, all FCH derivatives showed moderate binding affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates (Ki = 72-114 nM). The fluorescence intensities of FCH-3 and FCH-4 dramatically changed in the presence of Abeta(1-42) aggregates (6.7 and 14.2 fold), but the changes of FCH-1 and FCH-2 were minor (2.0 and 2.4 fold). In a fluorescence staining study using Tg2576 mouse brain sections, FCH-3 and FCH-4 clearly visualized Abeta plaques, but FCH-1 and FCH-2 did not stain. Taken together, all FCH derivatives could bind to Abeta aggregates, but only FCH-3 and FCH-4 may be useful fluorescence probes for in vitro staining of Abeta plaques.
