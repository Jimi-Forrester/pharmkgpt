37159849|a|The disease progression of neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, is inextricably tied to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, although the contribution by nuclear gene mutations is recognised for familial onset of NDD, the degree to which cytoplasmic inheritance serves as a predetermining factor for the predisposition and onset of NDD is not yet fully understood. We review the reproductive mechanisms responsible for ensuring a healthy mitochondrial population within each new generation and elucidate how advanced maternal age can constitute an increased risk for the onset of NDD in the offspring, through the increased heteroplasmic burden. On the one hand, this review draws attention to how assisted reproductive technologies (ART) can impair mitochondrial fitness in offspring. On the other hand, we consider qualified ART approaches as a significant tool for the prevention of NDD pathogenesis.
