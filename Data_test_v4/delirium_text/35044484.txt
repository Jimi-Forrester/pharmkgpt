35044484|a|PURPOSE: This prospective post-marketing surveillance (PMS) was designed to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of naldemedine in routine clinical practice in patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and cancer pain in Japan and explore the characteristics of patients prone to diarrhea. METHODS: The enrolled patients received naldemedine (0.2 mg, once a day) orally for up to 12 weeks. In the safety analysis, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including diarrhea as a special interest, were assessed. Effectiveness was evaluated, especially regarding the frequency and condition of bowel movement. RESULTS: In the safety analysis set (n = 1177), 145 ADRs occurred in 133 (11.30%) patients, and diarrhea was the most frequent event (n = 107, 9.09%). Most cases of diarrhea were non-serious (98.1%). Most ADRs were non-serious (93.8%), and they resolved within 2 weeks (75.9%). No patient characteristics influenced the risk of diarrhea development or aggravation. Both the frequency (75.0% and 83.2%) and condition of bowel movement (80.0% and 88.0%) were improved at 2 and 12 weeks, respectively in the effectiveness analysis set (n = 953). Frequency and condition of bowel movement were also improved in patients excluded (e.g., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was >= 3) or with very small numbers (e.g., received weak opioid) in the clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: This PMS indicates that naldemedine is well tolerated and effective in patients of various backgrounds in routine clinical practice who have OIC and cancer pain.
