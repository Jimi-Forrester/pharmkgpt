39599040|t|A Comprehensive Review of Biomarker Sensors for a Breathalyzer Platform.
39599040|a|Detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal tool in non-invasive disease diagnostics. VOCs are metabolic byproducts, mostly found in human breath, urine, feces, and sweat, whose profiles may shift significantly due to pathological conditions. This paper presents a thorough review of the latest advancements in sensor technologies for VOC detection, with a focus on their healthcare applications. It begins by introducing VOC detection principles, followed by a review of the rapidly evolving technologies in this area. Special emphasis is given to functionalized molecularly imprinted polymer-based biochemical sensors for detecting breath biomarkers, owing to their exceptional selectivity. The discussion examines SWaP-C considerations alongside the respective advantages and disadvantages of VOC sensing technologies. The paper also tackles the principal challenges facing the field and concludes by outlining the current status and proposing directions for future research.
