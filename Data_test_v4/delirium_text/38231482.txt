Environmental enrichment (EE) is considered to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for improving cognitive decline. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of EE, on cognitive impairment in aged offspring induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) and the underlying mechanisms involved to investigate its potential value in clinical practice. METHODS: CD-1 damns were subjected or not to sleep deprivation during late gestation. Twenty-one days after birth, the offspring were assigned to standard or EE cages. At 18 months-old, the learning and memory function of the offspring mice was evaluated using Morris water maze. The hippocampal and prefrontal cortical levels of protein, gene, proinflammation cytokines, and oxidative stress indicators was examined by Western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and biochemical assays. RESULTS: Offspring in MSD group exhibited declined learning and memory abilities compared with control animals. Moreover, the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical levels of Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), postsynaptic density protein-95, and synaptophysin were lower and those of proinflammation cytokines higher in the MSD group; meanwhile, the superoxide dismutase content was higher and the malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species contents were lower. However, these deleterious changes were ameliorated by exposure to EE. CONCLUSIONS: EE attenuates MSD-induced cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation and reverses the reduction in synaptic protein levels in aged offspring mice via the Sirt1/PGC-1alpha pathway.
