39335787|a|The number of people with dementia is increasing annually worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for the highest percentage of dementia-causing diseases, remains difficult to cure, and prevention of its onset is important. We aimed to discover new AD-preventive ingredients and investigate the inhibitory effects of ten different species of seafood digests prepared by protease treatment on beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity. Substantial inhibition of BACE1 activity was observed in five species of seafood, and protease-digested whitebait (WPD) showed the highest inhibitory effect among the ten marine samples. We further examined the potential of WPD as an AD preventive component using a familial AD strain (5xFAD) murine model. The intraperitoneal administration of WPD for 28 days substantially decreased the insoluble amyloid beta1-42 content and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of astrogliosis, in the cerebral cortex of the 5xFAD mice. These results strongly suggest that WPD is a novel functional food-derived ingredient with preventive effects against AD.
