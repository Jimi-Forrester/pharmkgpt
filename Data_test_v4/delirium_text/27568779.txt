27568779|a|AIM: This study aimed to explore carer experiences of inpatient unit (IPU) hospice care for people with dementia, delirium and related cognitive impairment, following implementation of the Te Kete Marie (TKM) initiative aimed at improving care for this patient group. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 10 carers of people affected by these conditions to ascertain their experiences of the care provided during the IPU stay. RESULTS: Analysis of interviews found carer experience could be described by three underlying themes: staff attunement, environmental support, and discharge preparedness, which contributed to a central theme of carer confidence. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that carer confidence is enhanced by: staff awareness and response to individual patient needs, interests and preferences, as well as carer requirements for information and consultation; an environment that engenders experience of comfort, safety, flexibility, privacy and outdoor connection; carer preparedness for patients who subsequently transition home or to alternative residential care.
