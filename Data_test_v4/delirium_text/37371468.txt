37371468|t|Temporal Dynamic Alterations of Regional Homogeneity in Parkinson's Disease: A Resting-State fMRI Study.
37371468|a|Brain activity is time varying and dynamic, even in the resting state. However, little attention has been paid to the dynamic alterations in regional brain activity in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to test for differences in dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo) between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs) and to further investigate the pathophysiological meaning of this altered dReHo in PD. We included 57 PD patients and 31 HCs with rs-fMRI scans and neuropsychological examinations. Then, ReHo and dReHo were calculated for all subjects. We compared ReHo and dReHo between PD patients and HCs and then analyzed the associations between altered dReHo variability and clinical/neuropsychological measurements. Support vector machines (SVMs) were also used to assist in differentiating PD patients from HCs using the classification values of dReHo. The results showed that PD patients had increased ReHo in the bilateral medial temporal lobe and decreased ReHo in the right posterior cerebellar lobe, right precentral gyrus, and supplementary motor area, compared with controls. The coefficient of variation (CV) of dReHo was considerably higher in the precuneus in PD patients compared with HCs, and the CV of dReHo in the precuneus was found to be highly associated with HAMD, HAMA, and NMSQ scores. Multiple linear regression analysis controlling for demographic, clinical, and neuropsychiatric variables confirmed the association between altered dReHo and HAMD. Using the leave-one-out cross validation procedure, 98% (p < 0.001) of individuals were properly identified using the SVM classifier. These results provide new evidence for the aberrant resting-state brain activity in the precuneus of PD patients and its role in neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD.
