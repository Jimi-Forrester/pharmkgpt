32073481|t|Development of a Simple and Practical Delirium Screening Tool for Use in Surgical Wards.
32073481|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an important and common medical condition, particularly in hospitalized patients, that is associated with adverse outcomes. The identification, prevention, and treatment of delirium are increasingly regarded as major public health priorities. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to create a simple-to-use screening tool for delirium in hospitalized patients using clinical manifestations of delirium regularly observed by nurses. METHODS: This study was conducted using data on 2,168 patients who had been admitted to the surgical ward between January 2011 and December 2014. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and a logistic regression model was constructed for the development of a predictive screening tool. After constructing a new screening tool for delirium, a receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn, the most appropriate cutoff value was decided, and the area under the curve was obtained. Bootstrapping was used for the internal model validation. RESULTS: A screening tool for delirium (Subjective Delirium Screening Scale by Nurse) with a total score of 5 points was constructed as follows: 2 points for disorientation and 1 point each for restlessness, somnolence, and hallucination. The area under the curve for the Subjective Delirium Screening Scale by Nurse was 81.9% (95% CI [77.9%, 85.8%]), and the most appropriate cutoff value was determined to be 2 (sensitivity of 61.0% and specificity of 96.7%). Bootstrapped validation beta coefficients of the predictive factors were similar to the original cohort beta coefficients. CONCLUSIONS: We created a screening tool for delirium using factors that were regularly observed and recorded by nurses. This tool is simple and practical and has adequate diagnostic accuracy.
