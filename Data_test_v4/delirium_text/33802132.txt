33802132|t|Local Protein Translation and RNA Processing of Synaptic Proteins in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
33802132|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental condition associated with impairments in social interaction, communication and repetitive behaviors. While the underlying disease mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, dysfunction of neuronal plasticity and local translation control have emerged as key points of interest. Translation of mRNAs for critical synaptic proteins are negatively regulated by Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is lost in the most common single-gene disorder associated with ASD. Numerous studies have shown that mRNA transport, RNA metabolism, and translation of synaptic proteins are important for neuronal health, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. Accordingly, dysfunction of these mechanisms may contribute to the abnormal brain function observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we summarize recent studies about local translation and mRNA processing of synaptic proteins and discuss how perturbations of these processes may be related to the pathophysiology of ASD.
