38231364|a|This study aimed to investigate the impact of dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine on continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) in postoperative analgesia and delirium in elderly patients with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A total of 120 patients who undergone TKA were randomly assigned into group D + R (dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine) and group R (only ropivacaine), with 60 cases in each group. The pain scores at rest and exercise at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively. The occurrence of delirium on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 postoperatively were measured, and the sleep quality was evaluated before surgery, the night of surgery, and 24 h postoperatively to observe the occurrence of postoperative complications. The Visual analogu scale (VAS) of group D + R at 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h postoperatively were lower than those of group R in both rest and exercise states. The incidence of postoperative delirium in group D + R was lower than that in group R on Day 1 and Day 2. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores in group D + R were lower than those in group R. There was no significant difference in postoperative adverse reactions between the two groups. Dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine improves postoperative analgesia and sleep quality, and alleviates the occurrence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients with TKA.
