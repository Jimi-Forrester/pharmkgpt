28465483|a|The traditional method to establish a cardiovascular disease model induced by high fat and high cholesterol diets is time consuming and laborious and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. A suitable pig model to study metabolic disorders and subsequent atherosclerosis is not currently available. For this purpose, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to Bama minipigs, targeting apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene simultaneously. Six biallelic knockout pigs of these two genes were obtained successfully in a single step. No off-target incidents or mosaic mutations were detected by an unbiased analysis. Serum biochemical analyses of gene-modified piglets showed that the levels of low density lipoprotein choleserol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) were elevated significantly. This model should prove valuable for the study of human cardiovascular disease and related translational research.
