34371878|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aberrant processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, both of which are accompanied by neuroinflammation. Dietary supplementation with spray-dried porcine plasma (SDP) has anti-inflammatory effects in inflammation models. We investigated whether dietary supplementation with SDP prevents the neuropathological features of AD. The experiments were performed in 2- and 6-month-old SAMP8 mice fed a control diet, or a diet supplemented with 8% SDP, for 4 months. AD brain molecular markers were determined by Western blot and real-time PCR. Senescent mice showed reduced levels of p-GSK3beta (Ser9) and an increase in p-CDK5, p-tau (Ser396), sAPPbeta, and the concentration of Abeta40, (all p < 0.05). SDP prevented these effects of aging and reduced Bace1 levels (all p < 0.05). Senescence increased the expression of Mme1 and Ide1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il-17 and Il-18; all p < 0.05); these changes were prevented by SDP supplementation. Moreover, SDP increased Tgf-beta expression (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in aged mice, the gene expression levels of the microglial activation markers Trem2, Ym1, and Arg1 were increased, and SDP prevented these increases (all p < 0.05). Thus, dietary SDP might delay AD onset by reducing its hallmarks in senescent mice.
