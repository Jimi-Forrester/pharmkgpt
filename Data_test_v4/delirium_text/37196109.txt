37196109|t|Lipidomic Alterations in the Cerebral Cortex and White Matter in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.
37196109|a|Non-targeted LC-MS/MS-based lipidomic analysis was conducted in post-mortem human grey matter frontal cortex area 8 (GM) and white matter of the frontal lobe centrum semi-ovale (WM) to identify lipidome fingerprints in middle-aged individuals with no neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, and cases at progressive stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Complementary data were obtained using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that WM presents an adaptive lipid phenotype resistant to lipid peroxidation, characterized by a lower fatty acid unsaturation, peroxidizability index, and higher ether lipid content than the GM. Changes in the lipidomic profile are more marked in the WM than in GM in AD with disease progression. Four functional categories are associated with the different lipid classes affected in sAD: membrane structural composition, bioenergetics, antioxidant protection, and bioactive lipids, with deleterious consequences affecting both neurons and glial cells favoring disease progression.
