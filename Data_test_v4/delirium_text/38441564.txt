38441564|a|BACKGROUND: Neuronal injury in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is the main pathogenic factor of vascular dementia (VD). Clinically, there isn't a drug specifically for VD; instead, the majority of medications used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) are also used to treat VD. Based on the proven anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Probucol, we hypothesized that it may have therapeutic effects on VD, but more research is required to determine its exact mechanism of action. METHODS: In vivo experiment: We used SD rats and most commonly used bilateral carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) in VD for modeling. After successful modeling, SD rats were given Probucol 3.5 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks to evaluate the therapeutic effect. In vitro experiment: BV-2 microglia of rats were cultured and divided into Control group and Probucol group. Each group was treated with hypoxia-hypoglycemia, hypoxia-hypoglycemia hydrogen peroxide and hypoxia-hypoglycemia hydrogen peroxide Syk inhibitor respectively. RESULTS: The results of immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that Probucol could significantly improve the cognitive impairment induced by CCH, and the neuronal damage was also attenuated. On the one hand, the underlying mechanism of Probucol was to reduce oxidative stress and cell apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the expression of phosphorylated spleen tyrosine kinase (P-Syk); On the other hand, it exerted a protective effect by reducing NLRP3-dependent cell pyroptosis and inhibiting neuroinflammation induced by microglia activation. CONCLUSION: Probucol could reduce oxidative stress and cell apoptosis by inhibiting the Syk/ROS signaling pathway, thereby improving CCH-induced cognitive impairment in vitro and in vivo.
