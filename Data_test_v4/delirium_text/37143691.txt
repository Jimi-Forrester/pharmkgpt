37143691|a|Background: The genetic basis of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) is still unknown. Here, we investigated genetic variants involved in Abeta deposition in patients with SVCI. Methods: We recruited a total of 110 patients with SVCI and 424 patients with Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive impairment (ADCI), who underwent Abeta positron emission tomography and genetic testing. Using candidate AD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously identified, we investigated Abeta-associated SNPs that were shared or distinct between patients with SVCI and those with ADCI. Replication analyses were performed using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project cohorts (ROS/MAP). Results: We identified a novel SNP, rs4732728, which showed distinct associations with Abeta positivity in patients with SVCI (P interaction = 1.49 x 10-5); rs4732728 was associated with increased Abeta positivity in SVCI but decreased Abeta positivity in ADCI. This pattern was also observed in ADNI and ROS/MAP cohorts. Prediction performance for Abeta positivity in patients with SVCI increased (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.780; 95% confidence interval = 0.757-0.803) when rs4732728 was included. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci analysis demonstrated that rs4732728 was associated with EPHX2 expression in the brain (normalized effect size = -0.182, P = 0.005). Conclusion: The novel genetic variants associated with EPHX2 showed a distinct effect on Abeta deposition between SVCI and ADCI. This finding may provide a potential pre-screening marker for Abeta positivity and a candidate therapeutic target for SVCI.
