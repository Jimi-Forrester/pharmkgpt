11941374|a|We have previously shown that chronic treatment with the monoclonal antibody m266, which is specific for amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), increases plasma concentrations of Abeta and reduces Abeta burden in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We now report that administration of m266 to PDAPP mice can rapidly reverse memory deficits in both an object recognition task and a holeboard learning and memory task, but without altering brain Abeta burden. We also found that an Abeta/antibody complex was present in both the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid of m266-treated mice. Our data indicate that passive immunization with this anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody can very rapidly reverse memory impairment in certain learning and memory tasks in the PDAPP mouse model of AD, owing perhaps to enhanced peripheral clearance and (or) sequestration of a soluble brain Abeta species.
