3395257|a|The partially purified transketolase from each of eight well-nourished patients with Alzheimer's disease contained significantly less heat-stable component with a significantly longer half-life of heat inactivation than that from eight controls. Immunochemical studies utilizing antibodies to the purified human liver transketolase did not distinguish between red blood cell transketolases of patients with Alzheimer's disease and those of controls. However, three brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease that were deficient in transketolase activity lacked a 69-kilodalton form on immunoblots. Subtle structural abnormalities of transketolase appear to occur in a high proportion of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
