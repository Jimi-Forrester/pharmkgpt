39221291|a|INTRODUCTION: The utilization of healthcare services in a growing population has raised concerns about its impact on clinical outcomes. Studies have shown that increased hospital census is associated with higher admission rates and unnecessary consults, tests, and procedures in various areas of healthcare. Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), a significant concern due to their potential for long-term disabilities, are commonly encountered in intensive care units (ICUs) and are a leading cause of patient mortality. Despite extensive research on various aspects of TBI, the effect of the patient census on TBI outcomes remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate the relationship between healthcare provider patient census and clinical outcomes in TBI patients at a level I trauma center. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted from 2017 to 2022. The mean number of patients per day in the trauma service was determined, with patients below this average considered to be present on low-census days and those above it on high-census days. Patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, vital signs, TBI severity, and associated injuries were analyzed. Adjusted regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1,527 TBI patients were identified. Demographics were similar between patients admitted on high- and low-census days. Patients with moderate TBI were 30% less likely to be admitted to the ICU on high-census days, whereas there was no difference in ICU admission for patients with mild or severe TBI. Delirium was significantly higher in patients admitted on high-census days compared to those on low-census days. This was further identified to be predominantly driven by patients with mild TBI admitted on high-census days. CONCLUSION: While most outcomes remained consistent, significant rates of delirium were found in our mild TBI patients admitted on high-census days suggesting the need for additional factors in the evaluation of these patients on admission. This study also reveals potential under-triage in moderate TBI patients on high-census days as they had significantly lower rates of ICU admission. These findings emphasize the need for further investigations to optimize patient care strategies within the context of fluctuating healthcare system demands.
