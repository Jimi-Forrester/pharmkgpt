35232339|t|Casein Kinase 1delta Inhibitors as Promising Therapeutic Agents for Neurodegenerative Disorders.
35232339|a|Casein kinase 1 (CK1) belongs to the serine-threonine kinase family and is expressed in all eukaryotic organisms. At least six human isoforms of CK1 (termed alpha, gamma1-3, delta and epsilon) have been cloned and characterized. CK1delta isoform modulates several physiological processes, including DNA damage repair, circadian rhythm, cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore, CK1delta dysfunction may trigger diverse pathologies, such as cancer, inflammation and central nervous system disorders. Overexpression and aberrant activity of CK1delta have been connected to hyperphosphorylation of key proteins implicated in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Thus, CK1delta inhibitors have attracted attention as potential drugs for these pathologies and several compounds have been synthesized or isolated from natural sources to be evaluated for their CK1delta inhibitory activity. Here we report a comprehensive review on the development of CK1delta inhibitors, with a particular emphasis on structure-activity relationships and computational studies, which provide useful insight for the design of novel inhibitors.
