38993579|a|Background: Microglia and inflammation play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Physical exercise and peripheral signals can influence microglial activity in the brain. Modulating the inflammatory response in the brain may provide therapeutic approaches for AD. Objective: To assess the effects of intravenously administered blood plasma from exercise-trained donor rats on cognitive function, microglia, and cytokine levels in an AD rat model at two different pathological stages; an early pre-plaque stage and a later stage closer to the emergence of extracellular plaques. Methods: Male transgenic McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats aged 2 and 5 months received 14 injections over 6 weeks: 1) plasma from exercise-trained rats (ExPlas), 2) plasma from sedentary rats (SedPlas), or 3) saline. Cognitive function was evaluated in a novel object recognition task. Microglia count and morphology were analyzed in cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum. Amyloid plaque number and size were assessed in the rats with the later treatment start. A multiplex assay was used to measure 23 cytokines in cornu ammonis. Results: In rats treated from 2 months of age, ExPlas and SedPlas increased number and length of microglial branches in cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus compared to saline. Only ExPlas-treated rats exhibited similar changes in subiculum, while entorhinal cortex showed no differences across treatments. Microglia count remained unaffected. In rats treated from 5 months of age, there were no significant differences in microglia count or morphology or the number or size of amyloid plaques in any brain region. Compared to both other treatments in early pre-plaque stage rats, SedPlas increased TNF-alpha levels. ExPlas upregulated GM-CSF, IL-18, and VEGF, while SedPlas increased IL-10 compared to saline. In later-stage rats, ExPlas upregulated IL-17, and SedPlas upregulated TNF-alpha compared to saline. There were no effects of treatments on recognition memory. Conclusions: Intravenous injections of blood plasma from exercise-trained and sedentary donors differentially modulated microglial morphology and cytokine levels in the AD rat model at an early pre-plaque stage of pathology. Exercised plasma may reduce proinflammatory TNF-alpha signaling and promote microglial responses to early Abeta accumulation but the lack of treatment effects in the later-stage rats emphasizes the potential importance of treatment timing.
