32568206|t|Analysis of Taste Sensitivities in App Knock-In Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
32568206|a|BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported a decline in taste sensitivities in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the detail remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of cognitive impairment on taste sensitivity using an App knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Behavioral assays, a brief access test, and a 48 h two-bottle preference test, to assess taste sensitivities were started from 12 months of age in mice that were confirmed to have impaired cognition. RESULTS: In the assays, there was no significant difference in taste sensitivities between wild type and App knock-in mice. Additionally, no apparent difference was observed in the expression of taste markers in their taste bud cells. CONCLUSION: We concluded that cognitive impairment might not greatly affect taste sensitivity.
