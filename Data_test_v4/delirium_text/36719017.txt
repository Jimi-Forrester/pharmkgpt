36719017|t|Clinical Outcomes of Endoscope-Assisted Pulmonary Endarterectomy for Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension.
36719017|a|PURPOSE: Pulmonary thromboembolism is a potentially life-threatening condition in patients with heart disease; however, limited studies discussing long-term outcomes exist. This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), focusing on the improvement of functional class and right ventricular (RV) pressure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of patients with CTEPH were obtained from Yonsei Hospital between May 2012 and December 2021, and reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients underwent endoscope-guided PEA during the study period, and the mean follow-up duration was 24.8+-23.4 months. RESULTS: After PEA, most patients (88.5%) were weaned from inotropes without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support during the first few days. Two patients (7.6%) had cerebrovascular accidents without neurological deficits. On echocardiography, the RV systolic pressure and tricuspid regurgitation grades significantly improved (p<0.001). Furthermore, the mean left ventricle end-diastolic diameter was significant increased (p=0.003), and the left ventricular end-systolic diameter increased (p<0.001). The median intensive care unit stay was 3.0+-9.4 days, and median hospital stay 16.0+-26.5 days. The 5-year survival rate was 95.5%, and the 5-year freedom rate of cardiac death was 100%. There was a marked improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) status (p<0.001). Cox regression suggested that the main pulmonary artery (MPA) involvement is a significant predictor of non-improvement in functional class post-PEA. CONCLUSION: Mortality rates are low and patients experience a marked improvement in NYHA class and health status after PEA. Moreover, MPA involvement may affect functional outcomes.
