10847437|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of gastric carcinoma is increasing in elderly patients. It has not been determined whether surgery improves the quality of life or prolongs survival in patients older than 85 years. This study was designed to evaluate surgery as a treatment option in patients more than 85 years of age. METHODS: The records of 18 patients aged 85 to 91 years (mean 87.3 years), who underwent surgery for gastric carcinoma between 1983 and 1997 were analysed. RESULTS: Three patients had multiple lesions. A total of 21 lesions were examined. Operative procedures included distal gastrectomy (n = 12), total gastrectomy (n = 4), proximal gastrectomy (n = 1), and laparoscopic wedge resection (n = 1). Perigastric lymphadenectomy was performed in 15 patients. No lymph node dissection was performed in three patients. Postoperative complications, including delirium, respiratory dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, anastomotic leakage, bleeding, and ileus, occurred in 11 patients. There were two hospital deaths in patients who underwent emergency surgery. Survival was neither shortened nor prolonged by surgery as determined by life table analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment should not be avoided based solely on the age of the patient, and quality of life in this population may be improved by surgery. Careful patient selection should include an assessment of the will to live.
