36275622|t|CK2 and protein kinases of the CK1 superfamily as targets for neurodegenerative disorders.
36275622|a|Casein kinases are involved in a variety of signaling pathways, and also in inflammation, cancer, and neurological diseases. Therefore, they are regarded as potential therapeutic targets for drug design. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the casein kinase 1 superfamily as well as protein kinase CK2 in the development of several neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. CK1 kinases and their closely related tau tubulin kinases as well as CK2 are found to be overexpressed in the mammalian brain. Numerous substrates have been detected which play crucial roles in neuronal and synaptic network functions and activities. The development of new substances for the treatment of these pathologies is in high demand. The impact of these kinases in the progress of neurodegenerative disorders, their bona fide substrates, and numerous natural and synthetic compounds which are able to inhibit CK1, TTBK, and CK2 are discussed in this review.
