32641145|a|BACKGROUND: Following acute infection, Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) establishes lifelong latency and recurrent reactivation in the sensory neurons of trigeminal ganglia (TG). Infected tree shrew differs from mouse and show characteristics similar to human infection. A detailed transcriptomic analysis of the tree shrew model could provide mechanistic insights into HSV-1 infection in humans. METHODS: We sequenced the transcriptome of infected TGs from tree shrews and mice, and 4 human donors, then examined viral genes expression up to 58 days in infected TGs from mouse and tree shrew, and compare the latency data with that in human TGs. RESULTS: Here, we found that all HSV-1 genes could be detected in mouse TGs during acute infection, but 22 viral genes necessary for viral transcription, replication and viral maturation were not expressed in tree shrew TGs during this stage. Importantly, during latency, we found that LAT could be detected both in mouse and tree shrew, but the latter also has an ICP0 transcript signal absent in mouse but present in human samples. Importantly, we observed that infected human and tree shrew TGs have a more similar LAT region transcription peak. More importantly, we observed that HSV-1 spontaneously reactivates from latently infected tree shrews with relatively high efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first longitudinal transcriptomic characterization of HSV-1 infection in during acute, latency and recurrent phases, and revealed that tree shrew infection has important similar features with human infection.
