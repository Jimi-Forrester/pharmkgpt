25024465|t|Post-operative delirium in elderly patients.
25024465|a|Delirium is a common, but an often underdiagnosed complication in the elderly following major surgery. Recognising delirium in early stages and diagnosing the condition based on established criteria can improve the outcome and management. Managing delirium with environmental, supportive and pharmacological interventions will possibly reduce the incidence and side-effects associated with post-operative delirium. The purpose of this article is to provide an over view of the current knowledge about the disease, diagnosis, pathogenesis, preventive strategies, and treatment of post-operative delirium.
