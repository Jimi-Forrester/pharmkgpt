35949020|t|Preoperative Disc Angle is an Important Predictor of Segmental Lordosis After Degenerative Spondylolisthesis Fusion.
35949020|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort Study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of interbody cages inserted via posterior approach on segmental lordosis in the setting of preoperative lordotic vs kyphotic discs in patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on assessment and management of LDS patients from 2 contributing centres. Patients were analyzed preoperatively and at 12-month follow-up with standing lumbar radiographs. Index level segmental lumbar lordosis (SLL), disc angle and global lumbar lordosis was measured. Patients were stratified into 4 groups based on index level disc angle and procedure: preoperative lordotic posterolateral fusion (group L-PLF); preoperative kyphotic PLF (group K-PLF); preoperative lordotic interbody fusion (IF) (group L-IF); preoperative kyphotic IF (group K-IF). RESULTS: A total of 100/111 (90%) patients completed follow-up with 40 in group L-IF and 48 in group K-IF. There were 18 patients in group L-PLF and 5 in group K-PLF. Among patients with preoperatively lordotic disc angles who had a worsening of SLL, group L-IF had worse SLL than group L-PLF patients, with differences persisting at one-year (mean difference 2.30, 95% CI, .3, 4.3, P = .029). Patients in group K-IF achieved improvement in SLL at one-year more frequently than group L-IF (67% vs 44%, P = .046), with similar mean improvement magnitude between groups L-IF and K-IF (-1.1, 95% CI, -3.7, 1.6, P = .415). CONCLUSION: Segmental lordosis worsening was greater with preoperative index lordotic disc angles when an interbody cage was used. Patients who have a kyphotic disc preoperatively gain more lordosis with interbody cage use.
