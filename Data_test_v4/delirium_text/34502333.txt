34502333|t|Usage of Natural Volatile Organic Compounds as Biological Modulators of Disease.
34502333|a|Plants produce a wide variety of natural volatile organic compounds (NVOCs), many of which are unique to each species. These compounds serve many purposes, such as fending off herbivores and adapting to changes in temperature and water supply. Interestingly, although NVOCs are synthesized to deter herbivores, many of these compounds have been found to possess several therapeutic qualities, such as promoting nerve stability, enhancing sleep, and suppressing hyperresponsiveness, in addition to acting as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore, many NVOCs are promising drug candidates for disease treatment and prevention. Given their volatile nature, these compounds can be administered to patients through inhalation, which is often more comfortable and convenient than other administration routes. However, the development of NVOC-based drug candidates requires a careful evaluation of the molecular mechanisms that drive their therapeutic properties to avoid potential adverse effects. Furthermore, even compounds that appear generally safe might have toxic effects depending on their dose, and therefore their toxicological assessment is also critical. In order to enhance the usage of NVOCs this short review focuses not only on the biological activities and therapeutic mode of action of representative NVOCs but also their toxic effects.
