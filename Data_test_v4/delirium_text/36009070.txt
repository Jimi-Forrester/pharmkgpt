36009070|t|Effect of Scalp Nerve Block Combined with Intercostal Nerve Block on the Quality of Recovery in Patients with Parkinson's Disease after Deep Brain Stimulation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
36009070|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) have a higher risk of postoperative pain, which will affect their postoperative quality of recovery (QoR). Scalp nerve block (SNB) and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) can alleviate postoperative pain, yet their effect on postoperative QoR in PD patients has proven to be unclear. Therefore, we have aimed to explore the effect of SNB paired with ICNB on postoperative QoR. METHODS: To explore the effect, we have designed a randomized controlled trial in which 88 patients with PD will be randomly assigned to either an SNB group or control group, receiving either SNB combined with ICNB or without before surgery. The primary outcome will be a 15-item QoR score at 24 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes will include: 15-item QoR scores at 72 h and 1 month after surgery; the numeric rating scale pain scores before discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) at 24 h, 72 h, and 1 month after surgery; rescue analgesics; nausea and vomiting 24 h after operation and remifentanil consumption during operation; emergence agitation; the duration of anesthesia and surgery; time to respiratory recovery, time to response, and time to extubation; the PACU length of stay; as well as adverse events. Proposed protocol and conclusion: Our findings will provide a novel method for the management of recovery and acute pain after DBS in PD patients.
