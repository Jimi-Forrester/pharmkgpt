36109398|t|Risk Factors for Dysphagia in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19.
36109398|a|Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may be at risk for dysphagia and vulnerable to associated consequences. We investigated predictors for dysphagia and its severity in a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a single hospital center. A large level I trauma center database was queried for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographics, medical information associated with COVID-19, specific to dysphagia, and interventions were collected. 947 patients with confirmed COVID-19 met the criteria. 118 (12%) were seen for a swallow evaluation. Individuals referred for evaluation were significantly older, had a lower BMI, more severe COVID-19, and higher rates of intubation, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy placements, prone positioning, and ARDS. Pneumonia (OR 3.57, p = 0.004), ARDS (OR 3.57, p = 0.029), prone positioning (OR 3.99, p = 0.036), ventilation (OR 4.01, p = 0.006), and intubation (OR 4.75, p = 0.007) were significant risk factors for dysphagia. Older patients were more likely to have more severe dysphagia such that for every 1-year increase in age, the odds of severe dysphagia were 1.04 times greater (OR 1.04, p = 0.028). Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk for dysphagia. We show predictive variables that should be considered when referring COVID-19 patients for dysphagia services to reduce time to intervention/evaluation.
