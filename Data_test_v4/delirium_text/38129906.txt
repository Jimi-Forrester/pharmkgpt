38129906|a|BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical inflammatory response syndrome that rapidly develops into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Currently, no effective therapeutic modalities are available for patients with ALI/ARDS. According to recent studies, inhibiting both the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as early as possible may be a promising therapy for ALI. RESULTS: In this study, a ROS-responsive nano-delivery system based on oxidation-sensitive chitosan (Ox-CS) was fabricated for the simultaneous delivery of Ce NPs and RT. The in vitro experiments have shown that the Ox-CS/Ceria-Resatorvid nanoparticles (Ox-CS/CeRT NPs) were rapidly and efficiently internalised by inflammatory endothelial cells. Biological evaluations validated the significant attenuation of ROS-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis by Ox-CS/CeRT NPs, while maintaining mitochondrial function. Additionally, Ox-CS/CeRT NPs effectively inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory factors. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, Ox-CS/CeRT NPs passively targeted the lungs of LPS-induced inflamed mice and released the drug activated by the high ROS levels in inflammatory tissues. Finally, Ox-CS/CeRT NPs significantly alleviated LPS-induced lung injury through inhibiting both oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. CONCLUSIONS: The created Ox-CS/CeRT NPs could act as a prospective nano-delivery system for a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant therapy of ALI.
