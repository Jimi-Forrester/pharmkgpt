36983069|a|The main pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggregation of amyloid-beta into amyloid fibrils, leading to a neurodegeneration cascade. The current medications are far from sufficient to prevent the onset of the disease, hence requiring more research to find new alternative drugs for curing AD. In vitro inhibition experiments are one of the primary tools in testing whether a molecule may be potent to impede the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42). However, kinetic experiments in vitro do not match the mechanism found when aggregating Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid. The different aggregation mechanisms and the composition of the reaction mixtures may also impact the characteristics of the inhibitor molecules. For this reason, altering the reaction mixture to resemble components found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is critical to partially compensate for the mismatch between the inhibition experiments in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we used an artificial cerebrospinal fluid that contained the major components found in CSF and performed Abeta42 aggregation inhibition studies using oxidized epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and fluorinated benzenesulfonamide VR16-09. This led to a discovery of a complete turnaround of their inhibitory characteristics, rendering EGCG ineffective while significantly improving the efficacy of VR16-09. HSA was the main contributor in the mixture that significantly increased the anti-amyloid characteristics of VR16-09.
