39113912|a|Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes capable of performing oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth. Besides their traditional roles serving as primary producers, cyanobacteria also synthesize abundant secondary metabolites including carotenoids, alkaloids, peptides, which have been reported to possess medicinal potentials. More importantly, the advancement of synthetic biology technology has further expanded their potential biomedical applications especially using living/engineered cyanobacteria, providing promising and attractive strategies for future disease treatments. To improve the understanding and to facilitate future applications, this review aims to discuss the current status and future prospects of cyanobacterial-based biomedical engineering. Firstly, specific properties of cyanobacteria related with biomedical applications like their natural products of bioactive compounds and heavy metal adsorption were concluded. Subsequently, based on these properties of cyanobacteria, we discussed the progress of their applications in various disease models like hypoxia microenvironment alleviation, wound healing, drug delivery, and so on. Finally, the future prospects including further exploration of cyanobacteria secondary metabolites, the integration of bioactive compounds synthesized by cyanobacteria in situ with medical diagnosis and treatment, and the optimization of in vivo application were critically presented. The review will promote the studies related with cyanobacteria-based biomedical engineering and its practical application in clinical trials in the future.
