17069783|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele frequency of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to determine the effects of oxidant-antioxidant balance on AD. DESIGN AND METHODS: PCR-RFLP was undertaken in 62 cases with AD and 56 aged-matched controls. Activities of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were measured in same groups. RESULTS: Patients with at least one E4 allele genotype were significantly different in patients with AD (21%) than controls (9%) (p=0.01). Serum MDA levels were significantly different between AD patients and Control group (p=0.0001). There was no significant difference in serum GSH levels between AD patients and C groups. CONCLUSION: These results confirmed that the APOE4 allele occurs frequently in late onset AD compared with normal controls. Also elevated MDA levels are likely an essential factor in the pathogenesis and neuronal damage of AD.
