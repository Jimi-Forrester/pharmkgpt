35707993|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and postoperative delirium (POD). METHODS: This cohort study was conducted in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III (MIMIC-III) version 1.4 database. MLR was measured according to the complete blood count. ICD-9 was used to measure postoperative delirium. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to examine the relationship between MLR and POD. RESULTS: Three thousand eight hundred sixty-eight patients who had received cardiac surgery were retrospectively enrolled, including 2171 males and 1697 females, with a mean age of 63.9 +- 16.2 years. The univariate analysis suggested that high MLR (as a continuous variable) as associated with a 21% higher risk of POD (O R: 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02, 1.43, p = 0.0259), After adjustments for other confounding factors, gender, age, race, temperature, SBP, DBP, MAP, respiratory rate, SOFA, peripheral vascular disease, AG, psychoses, drug, and alcohol addiction, the results showed that high MLR (as a continuous variable) independently served as a risk factor for POD (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01-1.44; p = 0.0378). MLR was assessed as quintile and tertiles, high MLR was an independent risk factor for POD. In the subgroup analysis, there were no differences in MLR for patients with POD in pre-specified subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio was a risk factor for POD. More research is necessary to thoroughly examine the function of MLR in POD.
