35625816|a|The non-coding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 gene is a dominant cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This intronic mutation elicits the formation of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions containing RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and HRE-derived dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), leading to neurodegeneration via the gain-of-toxic function or loss-of-function of relevant proteins. Using C9-500 mice harboring ~500 repeats of the GGGGCC sequence in human C9orf72 gene, we investigated the effects of rifampicin against HRE-related pathological phenotypes. Rifampicin was administered intranasally to 4.5- to 5-month-old mice for 1 month, and their cognitive function and neuropathology were assessed by the Morris water maze test and immunohistochemical staining. Rifampicin treatment reduced the formation of RNA foci and cytoplasmic inclusions containing DPRs or phosphorylated TDP-43, and furthermore, the levels of phosphorylated double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) that regulates repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. Synapse loss in the hippocampus and neuronal loss and microglial activation in the prefrontal and motor cortices were also attenuated, and mouse memory was significantly improved. Our findings suggest a therapeutic potential of nasal rifampicin in the prevention of C9orf72-linked neurodegenerative disorders.
