29351559|t|Characterisation of ictal and interictal states of epilepsy: A system dynamic approach of principal dynamic modes analysis.
29351559|a|Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterised by the recurrent and unpredictable interruptions of normal brain function, called epileptic seizures. The present study attempts to derive new diagnostic indices which may delineate between ictal and interictal states of epilepsy. To achieve this, the nonlinear modeling approach of global principal dynamic modes (PDMs) is adopted to examine the functional connectivity of the temporal and frontal lobes with the occipital brain segment using an ensemble of paediatric EEGs having the presence of epileptic seizure. The distinct spectral characteristics of global PDMs are found to be in line with the neural rhythms of brain dynamics. Moreover, we find that the linear trends of associated nonlinear functions (ANFs) associated with the 2nd and 4th global PDMs (representing delta, theta and alpha bands) of Fp1-F3 may differentiate between ictal and interictal states of epilepsy. These findings suggest that global PDMs and their associated ANFs may offer potential utility as diagnostic neural measures for ictal and interictal states of epilepsy.
