27554669|a|Mitochondria play a key role in various cell processes including ATP production, Ca2+ homeostasis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis. The selective removal of impaired mitochondria by autophagosome is known as mitophagy. Cerebral ischemia is a common form of stroke caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain. Emerging evidence suggests that mitophagy plays important roles in the pathophysiological process of cerebral ischemia. This review focuses on the relationship between ischemic brain injury and mitophagy. Based on the latest research, it describes how the signaling pathways of mitophagy appear to be involved in cerebral ischemia.
