After completing the demographic information, the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor Self Report Tool was used to assess post-intensive care syndrome. Sixty-nine percent of participants experienced different degrees of post-intensive care syndrome, and its mean score was 8.86 +- 12.50; the most common disorder was related to the physical dimension. Among individual social variables, age and duration after discharge were able to predict 12.3% and 8.4% of the variance of post-intensive care syndrome, respectively.
