29412849|t|Evaluating Cognitive Reserve Through the Prism of Preclinical Alzheimer Disease.
29412849|a|The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) was proposed to account for the discrepancy between levels of brain pathologic features or damage and clinical and cognitive function. This article provides a detailed review of prospective longitudinal studies that have investigated the interaction between CR and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers on clinical and cognitive outcomes among individuals with preclinical AD. Current evidence shows that higher levels of CR are associated with a delay in the onset of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and that there may be multiple pathways by which CR exerts its protective effects.
