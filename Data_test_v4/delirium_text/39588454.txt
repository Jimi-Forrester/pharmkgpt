39588454|t|Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Burn Trauma: Insights From a Tertiary Care Hospital.
39588454|a|HIGHLIGHTS: Burn injuries pose a significant risk for individuals with neurological disorders, particularly during altered states of consciousness. This study investigated the relationship between various neurological disorders and burn injuries in a tertiary care hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted over 24 months at a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital. Medical records of patients with burn injuries attributed to neuropsychiatric causes were analyzed. Data collected included demographic details, neurological cause, burn severity, anatomical distribution, and management. RESULTS: The study revealed a higher prevalence of burn injuries among females (47, 54.76%) compared to males (37, 45.23%). While there was no statistically significant difference in the duration of neuropsychiatric disorders between males (8.5 +- 2.8 years) and females (10.43 +- 3.94 years) (p = 0.321), epilepsy was the most common neurological disorder (56, 66.52%), followed by mental disability (15, 17.85%), dementia (6, 7.15%), cerebrovascular disorders (5, 5.95%), and Parkinson's disease (3, 3.57%). Females experienced a higher percentage of scald burns (26.19%) compared to males (29.76%) (p = 0.012) and a higher proportion of third-degree burns (24.4% vs. 11.9% in males) (p = 0.010). Anatomically, burns were most prevalent on the head and neck (26, 30.95% females vs. 14, 31.1% males) (p = 0.003), upper extremities (16, 19.04% females vs. 17, 20.23% males), and anterior trunk (18, 21.40% females vs. 11, 24.4% males). Common interventions included debridement and dressings (17, 31.1% females vs. 14, 20.23% males), tangential excision with split-thickness skin grafting (18, 21.40% females vs. 16, 19.04% males), and conservative dressings (9, 10.71% females vs. 5, 5.90% males). Females had a longer mean duration of hospital stay (13.65 days +- 4.68) compared to males (10.54 days +- 3.27). CONCLUSION: Neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly epilepsy, mental disability, and dementia, significantly contribute to burn injuries among affected individuals. This underscores the importance of targeted interventions in seizure management, home safety, and comprehensive medical care. Multidisciplinary collaboration and culturally informed strategies are essential for addressing this public health challenge effectively and improving patient outcomes.
