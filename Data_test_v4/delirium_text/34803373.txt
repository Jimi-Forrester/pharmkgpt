34803373|t|Study of Selected Flavonoid Structures and Their Potential Activity as Breast Anticancer Agents.
34803373|a|Flavonoids contain pharmacological effects that help to protect cells from damage. However, the anticancer activity of flavonoids is related to their modulation of signal transduction pathways within cancer cells. Natural substances such as flavonoids have immune-stimulating anti-tumor effect that could lower breast cancer risk. However, various diseases included Alzheimer's and cancer disease are associated with flavonoids intake due to their ability as antioxidant agent to alter essential cellular enzyme's function. Therefore, through interaction between flavonoids and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes led to make them chemopreventive agents for breast cancer. In this analysis, the chemo-informatics properties of 5 selective flavonoid derivatives and their efficiency as anti-breast cancer drugs were evaluated. Flavonoid ligands were docked with the predicted protein, which is human placental aromatase complexes with exemestane, a breast cancer drug (3S7S). Based on various docking energies, the molecular characteristics and bioactivity score of the following components, C15H12O6 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-4H-chromen-4-one and C15H12O5 5,8-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-4H-chromen-4-one showed greatest molecular properties and bioactivity docking scores of -8.633117 and -8.633117 kcal/mol respectively. Therefore, both compounds could be considered antitumor agent.
