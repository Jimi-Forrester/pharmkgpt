32712274|t|Slow-binding inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase of medical interest.
32712274|a|Certain ligands slowly bind to acetylcholinesterase. As a result, there is a slow establishment of enzyme-inhibitor equilibrium characterized by a slow onset of inhibition prior reaching steady state. Three mechanisms account for slow-binding inhibition: a) slow binding rate constant kon, b) slow ligand induced-fit following a fast binding step, c) slow conformational selection of an enzyme form. The slow equilibrium may be followed by a chemical step. This later that can be irreversible has been observed with certain alkylating agents and substrate transition state analogs. Slow-binding inhibitors present long residence times on target. This results in prolonged pharmacological or toxicological action. Through several well-known molecules (e.g. huperzine) and new examples (tocopherol, trifluoroacetophenone and a 6-methyluracil alkylammonium derivative), we show that slow-binding inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are promising drugs for treatment of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease and myasthenia gravis. Moreover, they may be of interest for neuroprotection (prophylaxis) against organophosphorus poisoning.
