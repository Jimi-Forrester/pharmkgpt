37130687|t|Effects of qCON and qNOX-guided general anaesthesia management on patient opioid use and prognosis: a study protocol.
37130687|a|INTRODUCTION: The adverse effects of general anaesthetic drugs (especially opioids) cannot be ignored. However, current nociceptive-monitoring techniques still lack consistency in guiding the use of opioids. This trial will study the demand for opioid use and patient prognosis in qCON and qNOX-guided general anaesthesia management. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective, randomised, controlled trial will randomly recruit 124 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for non-cardiac surgery in equal numbers to either the qCON or BIS group. The qCON group will adjust intraoperative propofol and remifentanil dosage according to qCON and qNOX values, while the BIS group will adjust according to BIS values and haemodynamic fluctuations. The differences between the two groups will be observed in remifentanil dosing and prognosis. The primary outcome will be intraoperative remifentanil use. Secondary outcomes will include propofol consumption; the predictive ability of BIS, qCON and qNOX on conscious responses, noxious stimulus and body movements; and changes in cognitive function at 90 days postoperatively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study involves human participants and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital (IRB2022-YX-075-01). Participants gave informed consent to participate in the study before taking part. The study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant academic conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200059877.
