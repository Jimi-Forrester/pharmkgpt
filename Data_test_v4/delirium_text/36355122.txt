36355122|t|Metabolic Phenotyping Study of Mouse Brain Following Microbiome Disruption by C.difficile Colonization.
36355122|a|Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is responsible for an increasing number of cases of post-antibiotic diarrhea worldwide, which has high severity and mortality among hospitalized elderly patients. The disruption of gut microbiota due to antibacterial medication facilitates the intestinal colonization of C. difficile. In the present study, a murine model was used to investigate the potential effects of antibiotic administration and subsequent colonization by C. difficile, as well as the effects of three different 10-day treatments (metronidazole, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation), on the brain metabolome for the first time. Four different metabolomic-based methods (targeted HILIC-MS/MS, untargeted RP-LC-HRMS/MS, targeted GC-MS/MS, and untargeted GC-MS) were applied, resulting in the identification of 217 unique metabolites in the brain extracts, mainly glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis revealed that CDI, as well as the subsequent treatments, altered significantly several brain metabolites, probably due to gut dysbiosis, and affected the brain through the gut-brain axis. Notably, none of the therapeutic approaches completely restored the brain metabolic profile to the original, healthy, and non-infected phenotype, even after 10 days of treatment.
