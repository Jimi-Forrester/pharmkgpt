31823162|t|Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Following Acute Delirium.
31823162|a|Delirium is a significant medical condition that is common in hospitalized patients. Beyond the increased risk of mortality, patients who experience an episode of delirium often go on to develop long-term psychiatric disturbance, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While there is a growing interest in understanding the complex relationship between delirium and PTSD, the existing literature is sparse and lacking harmony. Thus, this review seeks to develop a unified and thorough description of the cognitive and psychiatric underpinnings of post-delirium PTSD with the aims of promoting awareness of this condition amongst clinicians in medical settings, improving patient care, and sparking further research on this topic. While specific underlying mechanisms are yet unclear, PTSD was found to be associated with delirium in that delirious patients may have decreased factual recall of hospital events and increased hallucinations/delusions of a traumatic nature. Several potential interventions were identified, as well as suggestions for future research and clinical practice.
