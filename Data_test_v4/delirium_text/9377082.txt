9377082|t|Experimental model of neuropathological changes characteristic for Alzheimer's disease.
9377082|a|Data suggest that either proteolytically cleaved fragments of the full-length beta-amyloid precursor protein or the entire beta-amyloid precursor protein molecule are accumulated extracellularly and intracellularly in rat brain after cardiac arrest with survival time from 3 hours to 12 months. Direct evidence that precursors for fragments of the full-length beta-amyloid precursor protein can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain parenchyma from the circulation is provided for the first time.
