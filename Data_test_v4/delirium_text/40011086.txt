40011086|a|OBJECTIVE: Analyze the effects of frailty and prefrailty in patients admitted to the ICU without age limits and to determine the factors associated with mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit, Spain. PATIENTS: 1462 critically ill patients without age limits. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Hospital mortality and health outcomes. RESULTS: Patients' ages ranged from 15 to 93 years, median of 66 years. Predisposing factors independently associated with frailty and prefrailty were age older than 65 years, female sex, respiratory and renal comorbidities, longer pre-ICU stays, and weekend admission. There is a greater use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation, greater colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria, and the development of delirium. The risk of hospital mortality was RR 4.04 (2.11-7.74; P<.001) for prefail and 5.88 (2.45-14.10; P<.001) for frail. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality in prefrail and frail were pre-ICU hospital length of stay (cutpoint 4.5 days [1.6-7.4]), greater severity on admission (SAPS3) (cutpoint 64.5 [63.6-65.4]), Glasgow Coma Scale deterioration (OR 4.14 [1.23-13.98]; P .022) and thrombocytopenia (OR 11.46 [2.21-59.42]; P .004). CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of frailty are most common in ICU patients and are associated with worse health outcomes. Our data suggest that frailty and pre frailty should be determined in all patients admitted to the ICU, regardless of their age.
