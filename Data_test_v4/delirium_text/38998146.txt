38998146|t|Structure and Properties of Metastable beta Ti-25Nb-8Sn Alloy following Cold Rolling and Aging Treatments.
38998146|a|Metal implants require an elastic modulus close to cortical bone (<30 GPa) to avoid stress shielding and ensure adequate load-bearing strength. The metastable beta-type Ti-25Nb-8Sn alloy has a low elastic modulus (52 GPa), but its yield strength (<500 MPa) needs enhancement. This study enhances Ti-25Nb-8Sn's elastic admissible strain through cold rolling and aging heat treatments, investigating the microstructure's impact on mechanical and corrosion properties. The results show that lower-temperature aging (<450  C) leads to omega-phase precipitation, yielding a 300% increase in yield strength (>1900 MPa). However, this also increases the elastic modulus (~80 GPa), limiting the deformation ability. Higher-temperature aging (>500  C) eliminates the omega phase, transforming it into alpha precipitates, resulting in a lower elastic modulus (~65 GPa) and improved deformation ability, with substantial yield strength (>1000 MPa). In summary, the optimal process conditions are determined as 90% cold rolling followed by aging treatment at 550  C. Under these conditions, Ti-25Nb-8Sn achieves the most suitable yield strength (1207 MPa) and high corrosion resistance, retaining a relatively low elastic modulus (64.7 GPa) and high elastic admissible strain (1.93%). This positions it as an ideal material for biomedical implants.
