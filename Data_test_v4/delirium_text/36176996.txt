36176996|a|Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate surgical modalities and outcomes in patients with type A aortic dissection involving arch anomalies. Method: Patients with type A aortic dissection who underwent surgical treatment at our center between January 2017 and 31 December 2020 were selected for this retrospective analysis. Data including computed tomography (CT), surgical records, and cardiopulmonary bypass records were analyzed. Perioperatively survived patients were followed up, and long-term mortality and aortic re-interventions were recorded. Result: A total of 81 patients with arch anomalies were included, 35 with "bovine" anomalies, 23 with an aberrant right subclavian artery, 22 with an isolated left vertebral artery, and one with a right-sided arch + aberrant left subclavian artery. The strategies of arch management and cannulation differed according to the anatomic variation of the aortic arch. In total, seven patients (9%) died after surgery. Patients with "bovine" anomalies had a higher perioperative mortality rate (14%) and incidence of neurological complications (16%). Overall, four patients died during the follow-up period, with a 6-year survival rate of 94.6% (70/74). A total of four patients underwent aortic re-intervention during the follow-up period; before the re-intervention, three received the en bloc technique (13.6% 3/22) and one received hybrid therapy (11.1% 1/9). Conclusion: With complete preservation and reconstruction of the supra-arch vessels, patients with type A aortic dissection combining arch anomalies can achieve a favorable perioperative prognostic outcome. Patients who received the en bloc technique are more likely to require aortic re-intervention than patients who underwent total arch replacement with a four-branched graft vessel. Cannulation strategies should be tailored according to the variation of anatomy, but routine cannulation with the right axillary artery can still be performed in most patients with arch anomalies, even for patients with an aberrant right subclavian artery.
