37815179|a|BACKGROUND: After Alzheimer's disease, the second slot for the most common neurodegenerative disease, is occupied by Parkinson's disease. The symptoms of Parkinson's are classified as motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms involve rigidity, tremors, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms consist of cognitive dysfunction, salivation, lacrimation, etc. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to find out the most recent treatment options for Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Research and review papers are collected from different databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, Mendeley, Scopus, Science Open, and the Directory of Open Access Journals using different keywords such as "Parkinson's disease, biomarkers, animal models". RESULTS: Currently, various novel therapeutics have been emerging for PD. These may include treatments that may control the symptoms without causing any other severe side effects with already available treatments. Better therapies such as gene therapies, cell-based treatments, and regenerative therapies, which may evolve over time, can be a better therapeutic option. CONCLUSION: There is a need for the development of novel and potential therapeutic strategies that offer fewer side effects to patients. Several clinical, biochemical, and imaging markers that are noteworthy in Parkinson's disease examination have been discussed here. Current work in the field of Parkinson's disease has developed a variety of significant small animal models, such as viral vector models and seeding models, including the insertion of preformed fibrils of alpha-synuclein. The brief concepts regarding risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and emerging treatments of PD are discussed in this review article.
