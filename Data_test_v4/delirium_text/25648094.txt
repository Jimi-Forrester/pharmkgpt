25648094|t|Frequency and Outcome of Neuroleptic Rotation in the Management of Delirium in Patients with Advanced Cancer.
25648094|a|PURPOSE: The response to haloperidol as a first-line neuroleptic and the pattern of neuroleptic rotation after haloperidol failure have not been well defined in palliative care. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of haloperidol as a first-line neuroleptic and the predictors associated with the need to rotate to a second neuroleptic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the charts of advanced cancer patients admitted to our acute palliative care unit between January 2012 and March 2013. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of delirium and first-line treatment with haloperidol. RESULTS: Among 167 patients with delirium, 128 (77%) received only haloperidol and 39 (23%) received a second neuroleptic. Ninety-one patients (71%) who received haloperidol alone improved and were discharged alive. The median initial haloperidol dose was 5 mg (interquartile ranges [IQR], 3 to 7 mg) and the median duration was 5 days (IQR, 3 to 7 days). The median final haloperidol dose was 6 mg (IQR, 5 to 7 mg). A lack of treatment efficacy was the most common reason for neuroleptic rotation (87%). Significant factors associated with neuroleptic rotation were inpatient mortality (59% vs. 29%, p=0.001), and being Caucasian (87% vs. 62%, p=0.014). Chlorpromazine was administered to 37 patients (95%) who were not treated successfully by haloperidol. The median initial chlorpromazine dose was 150 mg (IQR, 100 to 150 mg) and the median duration was 3 days (IQR, 2 to 6 days). Thirteen patients (33%) showed reduced symptoms after the second neuroleptic. CONCLUSION: Neuroleptic rotation from haloperidol was only required in 23% of patients with delirium and was associated with inpatient mortality and white race.
