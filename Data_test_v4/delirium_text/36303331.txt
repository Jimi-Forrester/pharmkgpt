36303331|t|Adropin and MOTS-c as new peptides: Do levels change in neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke?
36303331|a|BACKGROUND: Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (AD, PD), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are thought to be deeply affected by changes in the pathophysiological processes of neurons. As new peptides, it was aimed to evaluate the level of adropin and MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c) and its possible relationship with NSE (neuron-specific enolase) and NF-L (neurofilament light chain) in terms of neuronal interaction. METHODS: This study was conducted with 32 patients from each subgroup and group-appropriate controls. Disease identifiers and hemogram/biochemical parameters specific to the groups of participants were obtained. Additionally, plasma adropin, MOTS-c, NSE, and NF-L levels were evaluated by the ELISA method. RESULTS: Plasma adropin levels were decreased in the AD group and decreased in MOTS-c, AIS, and AD groups compared to the control (p < 0.05). Similar values were found in the MS group compared to its control (p > 0.05). In correlation analysis of these markers with laboratory parameters, while platelet and cholesterol levels were negatively correlated with adropin levels; platelet, lymphocyte, and triglyceride levels were positively correlated with MOTS-c (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides new information about adropin may be potentially important markers in AD and MOTS-C in AIS and AD. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolic profiles and these peptides.
