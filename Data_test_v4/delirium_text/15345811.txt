15345811|a|Evidence suggests that there is a selective sensitivity to oxidative stress (OSS) among muscarinic receptor (MAChR) subtypes with M1, M2 and M4 showing > OSS than M3 or M5 subtypes in transfected COS-7 cells. This may be important in determining the regional specificity in neuronal aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). We assessed the effectiveness of blueberry (BB) and other high antioxidant (HA) fruit extracts (boysenberry, BY; cranberry, CB; black currant, BC; strawberry, SB; dried plums, DP; and grape, GR) on the toxic effects of Abeta 25-35 (100 microM, 24 hrs) and DA (1 mM, 4 hrs) on calcium buffering (Recovery) following oxotremorine (750 microM) -induced depolarization in M1AChR-transfected COS-7 cells, and on cell viability following DA (4 hrs) exposure. The extracts showed differential levels of Recovery protection in comparisons to the non-supplemented controls that was dependent upon whether DA or Abeta was used as the pretreatment. Interestingly, assessments of DA-induced decrements in viability revealed that all of the extracts had some protective effects. These findings suggest that the putative toxic effects of Abeta or DA might be reduced by HA fruit extracts.
