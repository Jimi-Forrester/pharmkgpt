23037915|t|Back-scattering interferometry: an ultrasensitive method for the unperturbed detection of acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor interactions.
23037915|a|A series of inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) have been screened by back-scattering interferometry (BSI). Enzyme levels as low as 100 pM (22,000 molecules of AChE) can be detected. This method can be used to screen for mixed AChE inhibitors, agents that have shown high efficacy against Alzheimer's disease, by detecting dual-binding interactions. E = enzyme, I = inhibitor, S = substrate.
