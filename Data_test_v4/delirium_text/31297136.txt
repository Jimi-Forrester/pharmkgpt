31297136|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive training refers to a series of standardized tasks with inherent challenges that target specific cognitive domains. Positive outcome of cognitive training in persons with Alzheimer's disease has been reported. In this study, the objective was to design sets of cognitive training program, "Gipum-seo" which is combined cognitive training, consists of different levels of difficulty using predesigned paper-and-pencil exercises. Also, to evaluate the effects of the cognitive training on patients' with early stage of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The subjects for this study were forty participants who were diagnosed with early stage of Alzheimer's dementia. To test the efficacy of paper-based cognitive training programs to cognition, all patients were randomly grouped to either an intervention group (n=20) or a control group (n=20). The intervention group regularly received 24 sessions of paper-based cognitive training over a 12-week period. Neuropsychological examinations were conducted before and after this training period. RESULTS: After the 12 weeks, the intervention group showed a significant change in Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (25.90+-3.8), compared to the control group (23.7+-2.8) (p=0.042). The training group also showed a significant improvement in language, attention and executive function, as compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Paper-based cognitive training might have beneficial effects on the general cognitive functions in the early stage of Alzheimer's dementia.
