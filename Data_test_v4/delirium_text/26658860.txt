26658860|a|Maintenance of context is necessary for execution of appropriate responses to diverse environmental stimuli. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a pivotal role in executive function, including working memory and representation of abstract rules. DLPFC activity is modulated by the ascending cholinergic system through nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. Although muscarinic receptors have been implicated in executive performance and gating of synaptic signals, their effect on local primate DLPFC neuronal activity in vivo during cognitive tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of muscarinic receptor blockade on rule-related activity in the macaque prefrontal cortex by combining iontophoretic application of the general muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine with single-cell recordings while monkeys performed a mnemonic rule-guided saccade task. We found that scopolamine reduced overall neuronal firing rate and impaired rule discriminability of task-selective cells. Saccade and visual direction selectivity measures were also reduced by muscarinic antagonism. These results demonstrate that blockade of muscarinic receptors in DLPFC creates deficits in working memory representation of rules in primates. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Acetylcholine plays a pivotal role in higher-order cognitive functions, including planning, reasoning, impulse-control, and making decisions based on contingencies or rules. Disruption of acetylcholine function is central to many psychiatric disorders manifesting cognitive impairments, including Alzheimer's disease. Although much is known about the involvement of acetylcholine and its receptors in arousal and attention, its involvement in working memory, an essential short-term memory component of cognition dependent on the integrity of prefrontal cortex, remains poorly understood. Herein, we explored the impact of suppressing acetylcholine signaling on neurons encoding memorized rules while macaque monkeys made responses based on those rules. Our findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms by which a disruption in acetylcholine function impairs working memory in the prefrontal cortex.
