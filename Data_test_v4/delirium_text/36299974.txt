36299974|t|Two Cases of Acute Urinary Retention Associated With Acute Sarcopenia in Older Women.
36299974|a|Acute urinary retention during hospitalization is a poor prognostic predictor. Therefore, prevention of the same is important. Herein, we describe two cases of acute urinary retention in older women admitted to the hospital for acute illness, with severe sarcopenia being the only predisposing cause. Both women developed urinary problems shortly after admission. In both, acute urinary retention was preceded by an in-hospital period of poor nutritional intake and a lack of progress in rehabilitation. There was no evidence of genitourinary disorder, neurological disease, drug-induced dysuria, bone fracture, or pain. Both patients presented with severe sarcopenia and severe frailty.Although the loss of mass in the voiding muscles is difficult to detect, the possibility of dysuria as one of the complications of acute and severe sarcopenia was indicated in our patients. Of note, however, is that many patients with severe sarcopenia do not develop dysuria. Therefore, accumulating evidence on the possible association between severe sarcopenia and dysuria is needed to inform prevention.
