9072868|t|[A clinic for the study of dementia--110 consecutive patients].
9072868|a|Case reports of 110 patients referred to a neurological dementia clinic were reviewed to evaluate a standardized diagnostic program. The patients were evaluated by a neurologist, a gerontopsychiatrist, and a neuropsychologist. ICD-10 criteria were used. Fifty-two patients had dementia while 58 had not; of these, 27 suffered from other non-dementia diseases and 31 were without dementia or other psychiatric or neurological disease. Thirteen patients with Alzheimer's disease were treated with tacrine. Four patients underwent cobalamin substitution treatment and seven started antidepressant medication. Ten patients received acetylsalicylic acid (150 mg Q.D.) and two a levo-dopa-type drug. Twenty-six patients were followed by gerontopsychiatric district care. Because only 47% of the patients suspected of dementia actually fulfilled dementia criteria, the evaluation suggests that patients suspected of dementia benefit from a standardized diagnostic program in a specialist setting.
