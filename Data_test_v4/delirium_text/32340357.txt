32340357|t|Fluorescence Methods Applied to the Description of Urea-Dependent YME1L Protease Unfolding.
32340357|a|ATP-dependent proteases are ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life and are critical to the maintenance of intracellular protein quality control. The enzymatic function of these enzymes requires structural stability under conditions that may drive instability and/or loss of function in potential protein substrates. Thus, these molecular machines must demonstrate greater stability than their substrates in order to ensure continued function in essential quality control networks. We report here a role for ATP in the stabilization of the inner membrane YME1L protease. Qualitative fluorescence data derived from protein unfolding experiments with urea reveal non-standard protein unfolding behavior that is dependent on [ATP]. Using multiple fluorophore systems, stopped-flow fluorescence experiments demonstrate a depletion of the native YME1L ensemble by urea-dependent unfolding and formation of a non-native conformation. Additional stopped-flow fluorescence experiments based on nucleotide binding and unfoldase activities predict that unfolding yields significant loss of active YME1L hexamers from the starting ensemble. Taken together, these data clearly define the stress limits of an important mitochondrial protease.
