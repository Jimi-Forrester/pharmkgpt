38842931|a|Increasing research efforts focus on exploiting antibodies to inhibit the amyloid formation of neurodegenerative proteins. Nevertheless, it is challenging to discover antibodies that inhibit this process in a specific manner. Using ribosome display, we screened for synthetic single-domain antibodies, i.e., sybodies, of the P1 region of alpha-synuclein (residues 36-42), a protein that forms amyloid in Parkinson's disease and multiple-system atrophy. Hits were assessed for direct binding to a P1 peptide and the inhibition of amyloid formation. We discovered a sybody, named alphaSP1, that inhibits amyloid formation of alpha-synuclein at substoichiometric concentrations in a specific manner, even within highly crowded heterogeneous mixtures. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based binding assays and seeding experiments with and without alphaSP1 further demonstrate the importance of the P1 region for both primary and secondary nucleation mechanisms of amyloid assembly.
