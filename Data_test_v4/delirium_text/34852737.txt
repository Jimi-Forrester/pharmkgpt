34852737|a|Neurodegeneration is a syndrome that occurs through the loss of the neuronal system's structure and function. In the 21st century, major health issues are related to cognitive impairment and neurological disorders such as autism, learning disabilities, Huntington's, cerebral palsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, neuromuscular, lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease may be life-threatening. Various experimental and epidemiological studies reveal the risk factors associated with the disease, like oxidative stress, hypertension, antioxidant enzyme abnormalities, metabolic toxicity, advanced age, cytoskeletal abnormalities, genetic defects, autoimmunity, mineral deficiencies, and other vascular disorders. Various compounds have been screened for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), but, due to their side effects, they have solitary symptomatic benefits. Phytochemicals play a crucial role in maintaining the chemical balance of the brain by affecting the receptor function of specific inhibitory neurotransmitters. This review highlights the importance of phytochemicals for neurodegenerative diseases, in particular the possible mechanism of action of these natural compounds used for the treatment.
