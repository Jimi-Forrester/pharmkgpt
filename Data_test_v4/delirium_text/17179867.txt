17179867|a|The cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator p25, which is derived from cleavage of p35, is thought to be formed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Female, but not male, transgenic mice expressing low levels of p25 have enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation and improved spatial learning, raising the hypothesis that p25 may compensate for early learning deficits in Alzheimer's disease in a sex-dependent manner. Here, we show that low levels of p25 do not alter latent inhibition, a phenomenon that is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. We also demonstrate that contextual fear conditioning is impaired in female, but not in male, p25 transgenic mice. Thus, low levels of p25 are not always beneficial for learning as was previously hypothesized.
