35304432|t|Adie's Pupil: A Diagnostic Challenge for the Physician.
35304432|a|Adie's pupil, also called tonic pupil, is mainly seen in young women. Most patients have unilateral eye involvement. The pupil of the affected side is significantly larger than that on the healthy side. The direct and indirect light reflection from the pupil on the affected side disappears. The pupil on the affected side is sensitive to low concentrations of pilocarpine. The pathogeneses of Adie's pupil are complex, some of which are insidious and lack corresponding specific diseases. Through a literature review, we found that Adie's pupil is mainly associated with infectious diseases, most commonly syphilis, followed by immune diseases and paraneoplastic syndromes. The ophthalmological symptoms and pupil abnormalities can disappear after active treatment of the primary disease. Pilocarpine can be used to treat ophthalmologic symptoms, such as blurred vision, for which patients might visit an ophthalmologist or neurologist. It is essential for clinicians to improve their understanding of the disease to avoid misdiagnosis. Differential diagnosis between Adie's pupil, oculomotor nerve palsy, anticholinergic drug overdose, Argyll-Robertson pupil, and congenital mydriasis need to be identified by the physician. Here, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, relationship between Adie's pupil and diseases, and differential diagnosis of Adie's pupil are reviewed.
