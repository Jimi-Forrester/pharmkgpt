17146946|t|[Role of peroxynitrite anion in different diseases].
17146946|a|Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is a reactive nitrogen specie produced by the reaction between nitric oxide (NO*) and superoxide anion (O2*-). NO* is produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and O2*- is formed by the addition of an electron to O2 in enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic way. NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase are some of the enzymes involved in O2*- formation. ONOO- is an oxidant specie which is able to modify a great number of biomolecules such as aminoacids, proteins, enzymes and cofactors. ONOO- is able to induce nitration leading to the formation of 3-nytrotyrosine. This change has been widely studied, and although it is not only produced by ONOO-, but also by other reactive nitrogen species, it has been accepted like footprint of ONOO-. The excessive production of reactive nitrogen species is known as nitrosative stress that is able to induce structural damage leading to the loss of cell function. Furthermore, synthetic metalloporphyrins that metabolize ONOO- in a specific way are being used to determine if ONOO- is involved in different diseases, such as Alzheimer, Huntington, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, colitis, cardiac and renal complications. Finally, these metalloporphyrins may be of potential therapeutic value in diseases related to ONOO- production.
