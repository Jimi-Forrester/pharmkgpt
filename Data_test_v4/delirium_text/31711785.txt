31711785|a|Inhibition of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) to prevent brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide's formation is a potential effective approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. In this report we described a structure-based optimization of a series of BACE1 inhibitors derived from an iminopyrimidinone scaffold W-41 (IC50 = 7.1 muM) by Wyeth, which had good selectivity and brain permeability but low activity. The results showed that occupying the S3 cavity of BACE1 enzyme could be an effective strategy to increase the biological activity, and five compounds exhibited stronger inhibitory activity and higher liposolubility than W-41, with L-5 was the most potent inhibitor against BACE1 (IC50 = 0.12 muM, logP = 2.49).
