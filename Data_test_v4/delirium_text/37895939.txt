37895939|a|Based on the multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) approach, two series of tryptanthrin derivatives with benzenesulfonamide substituents were evaluated as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro biological assays indicated most of the derivatives had good cholinesterase inhibitory activity and neuroprotective properties. Among them, the target compound 4h was considered as a mixed reversible dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, IC50 = 0.13 +- 0.04 muM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE, IC50 = 6.11 +- 0.15 muM). And it could also potentially prevent the generation of amyloid plaques by inhibiting self-induced Abeta aggregation (63.16 +- 2.33%). Molecular docking studies were used to explore the interactions of AChE, BuChE, and Abeta. Furthermore, possessing significant anti-neuroinflammatory potency (NO, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha; IC50 = 0.62 +- 0.07 muM, 1.78 +- 0.21 muM, 1.31 +- 0.28 muM, respectively) reduced ROS production, and chelated biometals were also found in compound 4h. Further studies showed that 4h had proper blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and suitable in vitro metabolic stability. In in vivo study, 4h effectively ameliorated the learning and memory impairment of the scopolamine-induced AD mice model. These findings suggested that 4h may be a promising compound for further development as a multifunctional agent for the treatment of AD.
