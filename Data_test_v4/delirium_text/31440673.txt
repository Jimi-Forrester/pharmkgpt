31440673|t|Risk Factors for Postoperative Ileus after Scoliosis Surgery.
31440673|a|INTRODUCTION: One complication after scoliosis surgery is ileus; however, few reports have described the frequency of and risk factors for this complication. We conducted a retrospective clinical study with logistic regression analysis to confirm the frequency of and risk factors for ileus after scoliosis surgery. METHODS: After a retrospective review of data from patients who underwent surgical correction of spinal deformity from 2009 to 2014, 110 cases (age range, 4-73 yr; median, 14 yr) were included in the study. We defined postoperative ileus (POI) as a surgical complication characterized by decreased intestinal peristalsis and the absence of stool for more than 3 days postoperatively. Various parameters were compared between patients with POI and those without POI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors associated with ileus; a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Fifteen of 110 (13.6%) cases developed POI. The median height, weight, operation time, and blood loss volume of the patients with versus without POI were 146 versus 152 cm, 39.0 versus 44.0 kg, 387 versus 359 min, and 1590 versus 1170 g, respectively. There were no significant differences between patients with versus without POI in the measured parameters, with the exception of patient height, bed rest period, and presence of neuromuscular scoliosis. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed neuromuscular scoliosis as a significant risk factor for POI (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.23-14.40). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a high probability of POI after scoliosis surgery, with an incidence of 13.6%. Neurogenic scoliosis, but not lowest instrumented vertebra or correction rate, was a risk factor for POI after scoliosis surgery. Digestive symptoms should be carefully monitored after surgery, particularly in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis.
