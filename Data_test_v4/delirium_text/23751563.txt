23751563|a|OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine ischemia modified albumin (IMA) and oxidant status in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, we evaluated the IMA and oxidant status by measuring serum uric acid, albumin and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in AD. METHODS: The plasma albumin, uric acid, GGT and IMA levels were measured by spectrophotometric methods in 32 AD patients and 32 healthy controls. The Mini Mental Status Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale were used to evaluate the cognitive functions of AD patients. RESULTS: AD patients had significantly higher IMA levels as compared to those of the controls respectively. Uric acid concentrations were significantly decreased and GGT values were significantly increased in AD when compared with control group. Albumin levels of the patients were also compared and no significant difference was detected. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress and IMA levels rise in AD. However, large prospective studies are required to understand the mechanisms leading to increased IMA levels during AD, whether preceded or not by AD.
