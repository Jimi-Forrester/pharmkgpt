30165567|t|Differences in healthcare outcomes between teaching and non teaching hospitals for patients with delirium: a retrospective cohort study.
30165567|a|BACKGROUND: The physician workforce at teaching hospitals differs compared to non-teaching hospitals, and data suggest that patient outcomes may also be dissimilar. Delirium is a common, costly disorder among hospitalized patients and approaches to care are not standardized. OBJECTIVE: This study set out to explore differences in healthcare outcomes between teaching and non-teaching hospitals for patients admitted with delirium. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the 2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Adult patients (>=18 years of age) hospitalized in acute-care hospitals in the USA with delirium (defined with ICD-9 code) were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge status and several measures of healthcare resource utilization: length of stay, total hospitalization costs and multiple procedures performed. RESULTS: In 2014, out of 57 460 adult patients admitted to hospitals with delirium, 58.4% were hospitalized at teaching hospitals and the remainder 41.6% at non-teaching hospitals. The in-hospital mortality of delirium patients in teaching hospitals was 1.33% (95% CI 1.08%-1.63%), and 1.26% (95% CI 0.97%-1.63%) in non-teaching hospitals. The mean total hospital costs were $7642 (95% CI 7384-7900) in teaching hospitals, and $6650 (95% CI 6460-6840) in non-teaching hospitals. After adjustment for confounders, total hospitalization costs were statistically significantly different between the hospitals types-with non-teaching providing less expensive care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with delirium admitted to non-teaching hospitals had comparable clinical and process outcomes achieved at lower costs. Further research can be conducted to explore the contextual issues and reasons for these differences in healthcare costs.
