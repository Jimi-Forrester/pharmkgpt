7839023|t|[Reye's syndrome in an adult. Review of pathogenic mechanisms].
7839023|a|Reye's syndrome is considered a disease of the pediatric age. It is characterized by a prodrome of viral illness followed by vomiting and encephalopathy with associated hepatic dysfunction. This syndrome is potentially life-threatening with high morbidity and mortality rates. There are 27 other cases of adult onset Reye's syndrome reported in the literature. We describe a 18-year-old woman who developed varicella and four days later started with vomiting, delirium and in the following day she became comatose. Laboratory tests of liver function and pathology of a liver biopsy proved the diagnosis. The patient survived. A review of the proposed pathogenic mechanisms are presented. Our patient represents case the number 28 in world literature and the first in the mexican literature.
