38608487|a|BACKGROUND: Food products undergo a pronounced Maillard reaction (MR) during the cooking process, leading to the generation of substantial quantities of Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Within this category, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), acrylamide (AA), and heterocyclic amines (HAs) have been implicated as potential risk factors associated with the development of diseases. PURPOSE: To explore the effects of polyphenols, a class of bioactive compounds found in plants, on the inhibition of MRPs and related diseases. Previous research has mainly focused on their interactions with proteins and their effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other diseases, while fewer studies have examined their inhibitory effects on MRPs. The aim is to offer a scientific reference for future research investigating the inhibitory role of polyphenols in the MR. METHODS: The databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library were searched for appropriate research. RESULTS: Polyphenols have the potential to inhibit the formation of harmful MRPs and prevent related diseases. The inhibition of MRPs by polyphenols primarily occurs through the following mechanisms: trapping alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, scavenging free radicals, chelating metal ions, and preserving protein structure. Simultaneously, polyphenols exhibit the ability to impede the onset and progression of related diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease through diverse pathways. CONCLUSION: This review presents that inhibition of polyphenols on Maillard reaction products and their induction of related diseases. Further research is imperative to enhance our comprehension of additional pathways affected by polyphenols and to fully uncover their potential application value in inhibiting MRPs.
