20837322|t|Delirium--awareness, observation and interventions in intensive care units: a national survey of Swedish ICU head nurses.
20837322|a|OBJECTIVES: To survey the awareness and observation of delirium, and interventions used for delirium in Swedish intensive care units (ICUs) and to examine the influence of hospital categories and staff education on the afore-mentioned. DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent to all Swedish adult patient ICUs (n=82) and completed by 55 units. RESULTS: The reported prevalence of delirium was 9.4%. Assessment of delirium was performed by 62% of the ICUs, commonly by observing symptoms. Most of the suggested non-pharmacologic interventions were reported to be used by at least 85% of the units. Drugs were used by 96%, most commonly haloperidol, propofol and benzodiazepines. Written pharmacological guidelines existed in 26% of the units, while 9% had non-pharmacological guidelines. Regular observation of delirium was more common in larger hospitals than in smaller ones and education was associated with reporting a higher prevalence of delirium. CONCLUSION: As in other countries, this study demonstrated that the awareness of delirium in ICUs is low with a lack of implementation of validated screening tools for its diagnosis. Emphasis should be placed on education and implementation of these tools to improve the quality of care for ICU patients.
