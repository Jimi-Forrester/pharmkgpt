37482408|t|Clostridium tetani infection in a geriatric patient: don't let your guard off!
37482408|a|Tetanus is an infectious disease caused by Clostridium tetani toxin. Although easily preventable through vaccination, over 73,000 new infections and 35,000 deaths due to tetanus occurred worldwide in 2019, with higher rates in countries with healthcare barriers. Here, we present a clinical case of C. tetani infection in an 85-year-old patient. Patient robustness and high functional reserve before infection are favorable predictors of survival for an otherwise fatal disease. However, the patient did not experience any severe complications. Therefore, this report is a strong call for tetanus vaccination.
