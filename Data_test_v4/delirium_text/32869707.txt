32869707|a|Although migraine is a major global public health problem, its impact on cognitive abilities remains controversial. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of repeated administration of inflammatory soup to the dura of rats, over three weeks, on spatial cognition, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits. Additionally, low doses of amitriptyline (5 mg/kg) were applied to assess its therapeutic effects. The inflammatory soup group exhibited significant reductions in the cutaneous stimulation threshold, presence of mild cognitive impairment, and decreased long-term potentiation in right hippocampus. However, amitriptyline improved pain behaviors, enhanced cognitive function, and increased synaptic plasticity in the inflammatory soup rats. On the other hand, the administration of amitriptyline to normal rats negatively influenced synaptic plasticity and reduced the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits. The present results indicate that inflammatory soup-induced dural nociception led to impairments in spatial cognition that could be attributed to reductions in hippocampal long-term potentiation and the decreased expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits.
