19661627|t|Neuropathology in the adult changes in thought study: a review.
19661627|a|The neuropathology underlying dementia syndromes in older populations is complex. The contributions of Alzheimer's and Lewy body pathology are well appreciated. Recent studies with brain autopsies have highlighted the high prevalence of vascular disease as an independent, but often co-morbid contributor to dementia. The Adult Changes in Thought Study is a community-based, longitudinal study of brain aging and cognitive decline which has recently confirmed cerebral microinfarcts as a strong correlate of cognitive impairment and dementia. This study examines correlations between clinical characteristics including extensive, longitudinal medication histories, and longitudinal cognitive testing against structural and biochemical features of disease.
