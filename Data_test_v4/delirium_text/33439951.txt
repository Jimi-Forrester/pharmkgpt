33439951|t|Hospitalized older adult: predictors of functional decline.
33439951|a|OBJECTIVE: to identify the predictors of functional decline in hospitalized individuals aged 70 or over, between: baseline and discharge; discharge and follow-up, and baseline and three-month follow-up. METHOD: a prospective cohort study conducted in internal medicine services. A questionnaire was applied (clinical and demographic variables, and predictors of functional decline) at three moments. The predictors were determined using the binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: the sample included 101 patients, 53.3% female, mean age of 82.47 +- 6.57 years old. The predictors that most contributed to decline in hospitalization were the following: previous hospitalization (OR=1.8), access to social support (OR=4.86), cognitive deficit (OR=6.35), mechanical restraint (OR=7.82), and not having a partner (OR=4.34). Age (OR=1.18) and medical diagnosis (OR=0.10) were the predictors between discharge and follow-up. Being older, delirium during hospitalization (OR=5.92), and presenting risk of functional decline (OR=5.53) were predictors of decline between the baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSION: the most relevant predictors were age, previous hospitalization, cognitive deficit, restraint, social support, not having a partner, and delirium. Carrying out interventions aimed at minimizing the impact of these predictors can be an important contribution in the prevention of functional decline.
