34523757|a|The bone remodelling process is closely related to bone health. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts participate in the bone remodelling process under the regulation of various factors inside and outside. Excessive activation of osteoclasts or lack of function of osteoblasts will cause occurrence and development of multiple bone-related diseases. Ca2+ /Calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway regulates the growth and development of many types of cells, such as cardiomyocyte differentiation, angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, myogenesis, bone development and regeneration, etc. Some evidences indicate that this signalling pathway plays an extremely important role in bone formation and bone pathophysiologic changes. This review discusses the role of Ca2+ /Calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway in the process of osteogenic differentiation, as well as the influence of regulating each component in this signalling pathway on the differentiation and function of osteoblasts, whereby the relationship between Ca2+ /Calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway and osteoblastogenesis could be deeper understood.
