This study aims to identify distinct FC patterns as potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis. METHODS: Resting-state EEG data from 36 AD patients, 23 FTD patients, and 29 healthy controls were analyzed using time-frequency and bandpass filtering FC metrics. These metrics were estimated through Pearson's correlations, mutual information, and phase lag index, and served as input features in a support vector machine (SVM) with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for group classification. RESULTS: Both AD and FTD exhibited significantly decreased FC in the theta band within the frontal lobe and increased FC in the beta band in the posterior regions. Additionally, a decreased FC in central regions at theta band was observed uniquely in AD, but not in FTD. SVM classification accuracies reached 95% for AD and 86% for FTD. CONCLUSIONS: High classification accuracies underscore the potential of these FC alterations as reliable biomarkers for AD and FTD. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to integrate time-frequency and bandpass filtering FC metrics to reveal brain network alterations in AD and FTD, providing new insights for diagnostics and neurodegenerative pathologies.
