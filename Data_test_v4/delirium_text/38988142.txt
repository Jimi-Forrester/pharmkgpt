38988142|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging was used to deeply analyze the changes of hippocampal subfields perfusion and function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), aiming to provide image basis for the diagnosis of hippocampal-related nerve injury in patients with T2DM. METHODS: We recruited 35 patients with T2DM and 40 healthy control subjects (HCs). They underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), arterial spin labeling (ASL) scans, and a series of cognitive tests. Then, we compared the differences of two groups in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) value, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) value, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) value of the bilateral hippocampus subfields. RESULTS: The CBF values of cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1), dentate gyrus (DG), and subiculum in the right hippocampus of T2DM group were significantly lower than those of HCs. The ALFF values of left hippocampal CA3, subiculum, and bilateral hippocampus amygdala transition area (HATA) were higher than those of HCs in T2DM group. The ReHo values of CA3, DG, subiculum, and HATA in the left hippocampus of T2DM group were higher than those of HCs. In the T2DM group, HbAc1 and FINS were negatively correlated with imaging characteristics in some hippocampal subregions. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that T2DM patients had decreased perfusion in the CA1, DG, and subiculum of the right hippocampus, and the right hippocampus subiculum was associated with chronic hyperglycemia. Additionally, we observed an increase in spontaneous neural activity within the left hippocampal CA3, subiculum, and bilateral HATA regions, as well as an enhanced local neural coordination in the left hippocampal CA3, DG, HATA, and subiculum among patients with type 2 diabetes, which may reflect an adaptive compensation for cognitive decline. However, this compensation may decline with the exacerbation of metabolic disorders.
