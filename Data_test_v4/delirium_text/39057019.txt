39057019|t|The Evolving Role of Calcium Channel Blockers in Hypertension Management: Pharmacological and Clinical Considerations.
39057019|a|Worldwide, hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death. An estimated 122 million people, per the American Heart Association in 2023, have been diagnosed with this common condition. It is generally agreed that the primary goal in the treatment of hypertension is to reduce overall blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg, with a more optimal goal of 130/80 mmHg. Common medications for treating hypertension include calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics. CCBs are one of the most widely studied agents and are generally recommended as first-line therapy alone and in combination therapies. This is largely based on the vast knowledge of CCB mechanisms and their minimal side effect profile. CCBs can be separated into two classes: dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs act on voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels of cardiac and smooth muscle to decrease muscle contractility. Dihydropyridine CCBs act by vasodilating the peripheral vasculature. For many patients with only mild increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (e.g., stage 1 hypertension), the medical literature indicates that CCB monotherapy can be sufficient to control hypertension. In this regard, CCB monotherapy in those with stage 1 hypertension reduced renal and cardiovascular complications compared to other drug classes. Combination therapy with CCBs and angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown to be an effective dual therapy based on recent meta-analyses. This article is a review of calcium channel blockers and their use in treating hypertension with some updated and recent information on studies that have re-examined their use. As for new information, we tried to include some information from recent studies on hypertensive treatment involving calcium channel blockers.
