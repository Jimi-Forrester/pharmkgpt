23085983|t|Diffuse near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy during heatstroke in a mouse model: pilot study.
23085983|a|Heatstroke, a form of hyperthermia, is a life-threatening condition characterized by an elevated core body temperature that rises above 40 C (104 F) and central nervous system dysfunction that results in delirium, convulsions, or coma. Without emergency treatment, the victim lapses into a coma and death soon follows. The study presented was conducted with a diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) setup to assess the effects of brain dysfunction that occurred during heatstroke in mice model (n=6). It was hypothesized that DRS can be utilized in small animal studies to monitor change in internal brain tissue temperature during heatstroke injury since it induces a sequence of pathologic changes that change the tissue composition and structure. Heatstroke was induced by exposure of the mice body under general anesthesia, to a high ambient temperature. A type of DRS in which the brain tissue was illuminated through the intact scalp with a broadband light source and diffuse reflected spectra was employed, taking in the spectral region between 650 and 1000 nm and acquired at an angle of 90 deg at a position on the scalp ~12  mm from the illumination site. The temperature at the onset of the experiment was ~34 C (rectal temperature) with increasing intervals of 1 C until mouse death. The increase in temperature caused optical scattering signal changes consistent with a structural alteration of brain tissue, ultimately resulting in death. We have found that the peak absorbance intensity and its second derivative at specific wavelengths correlate well with temperature with an exponential dependence. Based on these findings, in order to estimate the influence of temperature on the internal brain tissue a reflectance-temperature index was established and was seen to correlate as well with measured temperature. Overall, results indicate variations in neural tissue properties during heatstroke and the feasibility to monitor and assess internal temperature variations using DRS. Although several approaches have described the rise in temperature and its impact on tissue, to the best of our knowledge no information is available describing the ability to monitor temperature during heatstroke with DRS. The motivation of this study was to successfully describe this ability.
