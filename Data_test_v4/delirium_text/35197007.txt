35197007|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis on inpatient outcomes of geriatric hip fracture surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using population-based retrospective study design, this study extracted data from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2005-2014, identifying patients aged >= 65 years undergoing hip fracture repair. Main outcomes were in-hospital mortality, any/specific complications, non-routine discharge, extended length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs. Associations between cirrhosis, non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease and outcomes were determined using regression analysis. RESULTS: Data of 347,363 hip fracture patients included 344,035 without liver disease, 1257 with non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease and 2,071 with cirrhosis. After adjustments, non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease was significantly associated with non-routine discharge (OR: 1.247, 95% CI: 1.038-1.498), acute kidney injury (OR: 1.266, 95% CI: 1.039-1.541), extended LOS (OR: 1.285, 95% CI: 1.122-1.473) and hospital costs (beta: 9173.42, 95% CI: 6925.9-11,420.95) compared to no liver disease; while cirrhosis was significantly associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR: 2.325, 95% CI: 1.849-2.922), any complication (OR: 1.295, 95% CI: 1.143-1.467), acute kidney injury (OR: 1.242, 95% CI: 1.177-1.433), non-routine discharge (OR: 1.650, 95% CI: 1.412-1.928), extended LOS (OR: 1.405, 95% CI: 1.263-1.562) and hospital costs (beta: 6680.24, 95% CI: 4921.53-8438.95) compared to no liver disease. CONCLUSION: In geriatric hip fracture patients undergoing surgical repair, non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease and cirrhosis independently predict non-routine discharge, acute kidney injury, prolonged LOS and greater hospital costs, and cirrhosis is also significantly associated with greater risk of any complication and in-hospital mortality.
