38339193|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by several pathological hallmarks, including the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Current treatment options include monoclonal antibody drugs, acetylcholinesterase, and n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. Although those treatments provide some improvements in patients' quality of life, they fail to prevent or cure AD. Current research aims to identify novel targets and tools for AD prevention and modification. In this context, several studies showed the beneficial effect of the Mediterranean diet in the prevention and treatment of AD. One integral component of the Mediterranean diet is olive oil and extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), which is high in phenolic compounds. EVOO and other olive-related phenolic compounds have been shown to reduce the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which EVOO and phenolic compounds exert neuroprotective effects, including modulation of AD pathologies and promotion of cognitive health. Findings indicate that EVOO and its phenolic constituents influence key pathological processes of AD, such as Abeta aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, while also enhancing BBB integrity and reducing oxidative stress. The human studies cited reveal a consistent trend where the consumption of olive oil is associated with cognitive benefits and a decreased risk of AD and related dementias. In conclusion, EVOO and its phenolic compounds hold promising potential for the prevention and treatment of AD, representing a significant shift towards more effective strategies against this complex neurodegenerative disorder.
