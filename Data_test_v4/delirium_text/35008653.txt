35008653|t|Morphometry and Stiffness of Red Blood Cells-Signatures of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Aging.
35008653|a|Human red blood cells (RBCs) are unique cells with the remarkable ability to deform, which is crucial for their oxygen transport function, and which can be significantly altered under pathophysiological conditions. Here we performed ultrastructural analysis of RBCs as a peripheral cell model, looking for specific signatures of the neurodegenerative pathologies (NDDs)-Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), utilizing atomic force (AFM) and conventional optical (OM) microscopy. We found significant differences in the morphology and stiffness of RBCs isolated from patients with the selected NDDs and those from healthy individuals. Neurodegenerative pathologies' RBCs are characterized by a reduced abundance of biconcave discoid shape, lower surface roughness and a higher Young's modulus, compared to healthy cells. Although reduced, the biconcave is still the predominant shape in ALS and AD cells, while the morphology of PD is dominated by crenate cells. The features of RBCs underwent a marked aging-induced transformation, which followed different aging pathways for NDDs and normal healthy states. It was found that the diameter, height and volume of the different cell shape types have different values for NDDs and healthy cells. Common and specific morphological signatures of the NDDs were identified.
