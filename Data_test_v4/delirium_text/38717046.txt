38717046|a|INTRODUCTION: The use of antidepressants in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been reported to influence long-term risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD), but studies are conflicting. METHODS: We used inverse probability weighted (IPW) Cox models with time-varying covariates in a retrospective cohort study among midlife veterans with MDD within the US Veterans Affairs healthcare system from January 1, 2000 to June 1, 2022. RESULTS: A total of 35,200 patients with MDD were identified. No associations were seen regarding the effect of being exposed to any antidepressant versus no exposure on AD/ADRD risk (events = 1,056, hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 1.09) or the exposure to specific antidepressant classes versus no exposure. A risk reduction was observed for female patients in a stratified analysis; however, the number of cases was small. DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that antidepressant exposure has no effect on AD/ADRD risk. The association in female patients should be interpreted with caution and requires further attention. HIGHLIGHTS: We studied whether antidepressant use was associated with future dementia risk. We specifically focused on patients after their first-ever diagnosis of depression. We used IPW Cox models with time-varying covariates and a large observation window. Our study did not identify an effect of antidepressant use on dementia risk. A risk reduction was observed in female patients, but the number of cases was small.
