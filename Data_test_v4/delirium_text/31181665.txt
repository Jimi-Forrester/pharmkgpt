31181665|t|In Silico Analysis of Bioactive Peptides in Invasive Sea Grass Halophila stipulacea.
31181665|a|Halophila stipulacea is a well-known invasive marine sea grass in the Mediterranean Sea. Having been introduced into the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Channel, it is considered a Lessepsian migrant. Although, unlike other invasive marine seaweeds, it has not demonstrated serious negative impacts on indigenous species, it does have remarkable invasive properties. The present in-silico study reveals the biotechnological features of H. stipulacea by showing bioactive peptides from its rubisc/o protein. These are features such as antioxidant and hypolipideamic activities, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitions. The reported data open up new applications for such bioactive peptides in the field of pharmacy, medicine and also the food industry.
