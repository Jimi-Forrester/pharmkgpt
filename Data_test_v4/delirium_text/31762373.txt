31762373|t|Increased REST to Optimize Life Span?
31762373|a|Reduced levels of neural activity are associated with a longer life span in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and in mice. Augmented neural activity is associated with a shorter life span. Recent studies show that levels of repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) increase with normal aging in mice and humans, and reduce neuronal excitation. In C. elegans, increased expression of spr-4, a functional REST homologue, increased the worm life span and is required for classical life span increase mediated by reduced DAF-2/insulin-IGF-1 and increased DAF-16. Preliminary evidence shows that REST and FOXO1, a DAF-16, homologue increase during mammalian aging, and that REST activity is needed for the age-related FOXO1 increase. On the contrary, REST is activated in epilepsy and plays a role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. A simple unifying hypothesis suggests that REST is a "goldilocks-effect factor": too little REST promotes excitotoxic activity, which in turn leads to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Appropriate increased levels of REST maintain the excitation/inhibition (E-I) balance by reducing potential excitotoxic activity. Increased levels of REST beyond this are toxic as neurons become dysfunctional due to loss of a neuronal phenotype.
