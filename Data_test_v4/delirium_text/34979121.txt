34979121|a|Air pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems that afflict our planet and one of the greatest risk factors for human health. In particular, PM2.5 is able to cross the blood-alveolar and blood-brain barriers, thus increasing the onset of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative disease is a progressive neuronal dysfunction that leads to neuronal lesions in both structure and function, and includes several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), vascular dementia (VaD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and others. We carried out a systematic review using PRISMA approach to investigate on the possible association between exposure to PM2.5 and neurodegenerative diseases. The international databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Sciences) were used to find published studies on the topic. The search period was between January 2011 and June 2021. About 2000 full research articles were selected, and finally, we included 20 full-research articles. Selected studies have highlighted how PM2.5 exposure can be associated with the onset of neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, MS, VaD). This association depends not only on age, PM2.5 levels and exposure time, but also on exposure to other air pollutants, proximity to areas with high vehicular traffic, and the presence of comorbidities. Exposure to PM2.5 promotes neuroinflammation processes, because through breathing the particles can reach the nasal epithelial mucosa and transferred to the brain through the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with an increased expression of markers of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. alpha-synuclein or beta-amyloid), which can contribute to the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Although many studies have revealed the pathological relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cognitive impairment, the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of PM2.5 leading to neurodegenerative disease remain not entirely clear, and then, further studies need to be carried out on the topic.
