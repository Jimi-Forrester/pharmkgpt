37484359|a|Background: Neuroinflammation can occur during sepsis and is now regarded as the main mechanism underlying various related central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Another well-known factor causing neuroinflammation is psychological stress. In the current study, we examined the effects of prior exposure to stress on sepsis-induced neuroinflammation and CNS symptoms. Experimental procedure: Balb/c mice were subjected to wet bedding stress for 2 days, then lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intraperitoneally administered. For examining the neuroinflammation, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and NF-kappaB activity in the brain was analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA-based assay. Additionally, immunohistochemical study using Iba-1 was performed. Finally, behavior tests were examined one month after LPS treatment. Result and conclusion: Stress exposure induced the upregulation of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNFalpha mRNA in the cerebral cortex 4 h after LPS administration. Suggesting an underlying mechanism, LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was significantly upregulated with stress in the brain. Histologically, microglia in the cerebral cortex were reactive and became more abundant with stress, while these effects were further increased with LPS injection. Behavioral analysis conducted showed a significant increase of anxiety-like behaviors in the stressed mice. These results suggest that prior exposure to stress exacerbates neuroinflammation during sepsis and induces long-term behavior changes.
