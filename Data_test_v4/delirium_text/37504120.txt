37504120|t|The Fabrication of a La2Sn2O7/f-HNT Composite for Non-Enzymatic Electrochemical Detection of 3-Nitro-l-tyrosine in Biological Samples.
37504120|a|Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), including 3-nitro-l-tyrosine, play a dual role in human health, inducing oxidative damage and regulating cellular functions. Early and accurate detection of such molecules, such as L-tyrosine in urine, can serve as critical biomarkers for various cancers. In this study, we aimed to enhance the electrochemical detection of these molecules through the synthesis of La2Sn2O7/f-HNT nanocomposites via a simple hydrothermal method. Detailed structural and morphological characterizations confirmed successful synthesis, consistent with our expected outcomes. The synthesized nanocomposites were utilized as nanocatalysts in electrochemical sensors, showing a notable limit of the detection of 0.012 microM for the real-time detection of 3-nitro-l-tyrosine. These findings underscore the potential of nanomaterial-based sensors in advancing early disease detection with high sensitivity, furthering our understanding of cellular oxidative processes.
