33562156|t|Potential of Caffeine in Alzheimer's Disease-A Review of Experimental Studies.
33562156|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment. Considering that pharmacological treatment options for AD are few and not satisfactory, increasing attention is being paid to dietary components that may affect the development of the disease. Such a dietary component may be caffeine contained in coffee, tea or energy drinks. Although epidemiological data suggest that caffeine intake may counteract the development of cognitive impairment, results of those studies are not conclusive. The aim of the present study is to review the existing experimental studies on the efficacy of caffeine against AD and AD-related cognitive impairment, focusing on the proposed protective mechanisms of action. In conclusion, the reports of studies on experimental AD models generally supported the notion that caffeine may exert some beneficial effects in AD. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of caffeine in the effects of its sources on cognition and possibly AD risk.
