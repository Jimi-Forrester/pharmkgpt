38701286|a|BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the efficacy of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in reducing postoperative delirium (POD) and modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in elderly patients undergoing thoracolumbar compression fracture surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from October 2022 to January 2023 at Anting Hospital in Shanghai, 218 elderly patients were randomized into DEX (n = 110) and normal saline (NS, n = 108) groups. The DEX group received 0.5 microg/kg/h DEX, and delirium incidence was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) on days 1 to 3 post-surgery. Levels of interleukins IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured pre-operation (T0) and on postoperative days 1 (T1) and 3 (T3). Preoperative (T0) and postoperative day 1 (T1) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were treated with varying concentrations of olanzapine or DEX to observe their regulatory effects on the expression of Phospho-ERK1/2 and Phospho-JNK. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine significantly lowered the incidence of POD to 18.2%, compared to 30.6% in the NS group (P = .033). While all patients showed an initial increase in cytokine levels after surgery, by T3, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels notably decreased in the DEX group, with no significant change in IL-1beta levels across groups. The adverse events rate was similar between groups, demonstrating the safety of DEX in this population. In postoperative CSF samples, treatment with 0.5 mM DEX significantly downregulated Phospho-JNK and upregulated Phospho-ERK1/2 expression, demonstrating a dose-dependent modulation of inflammatory responses. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine is effective in reducing early POD in elderly patients post-thoracolumbar compression fracture surgery. It also decreases IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels, indicating its potential in managing postoperative inflammatory responses. Treatment with 0.5 mM DEX significantly modulated Phospho-ERK1/2 and Phospho-JNK expressions in postoperative CSF samples, indicating a dose-dependent effect on reducing inflammation. This study contributes to understanding DEX's role in improving postoperative outcomes in elderly patients.
