23380994|a|The relationship of cerebrovascular risk and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology to cognition in pre-dementia has been extensively investigated and is well-established. Cerebrovascular risk can be measured using a Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) score, while positron emission tomography (PET) scans with 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) measure AD neuropathology (i.e., amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles). Here we report results of 75 healthy non-demented subjects (mean age, 63 years) who underwent neuropsychological testing, physical assessments, and FDDNP-PET scans. Controlling for AD family history, education, and APOE4 status in a general linear model, higher FSRP risk and global FDDNP-PET binding were each associated with poorer cognitive functioning. The interaction of FSRP and global FDDNP-PET binding was not significant in the model, indicating that stroke risk and plaque and tangle burden each contributed to worse cognitive performance. Within our healthy volunteers, age, blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication use were vascular risks that contributed significantly to the above findings. These findings suggest that even mild cerebrovascular risk may influence the extent of cognitive dysfunction in pre-dementia, along with amyloid-beta and tau burden.
