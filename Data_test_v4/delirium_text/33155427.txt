33155427|a|OBJECTIVES: Not much is known about influenza-associated neurological complications. We aimed to describe the case series of hospitalized patients who were confirmed with influenza A and presented with neurological symptoms in order to capture the broad spectrum of influenza clinical manifestation and suggest including influenza diagnostic in some neurological conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inclusion criteria were age >= 18 and laboratory-confirmed influenza presenting with neurological symptoms. Influenza-associated neurological complication was described as a development of neurological symptom with no other origin. The outcomes were classified into 5 categories: 1. recovery with no significant disability; 2. minor disability (able to manage on their own); 3. moderate disability (requiring some help but able to walk without assistance); 4. severe disability (unable to walk without assistance and perform daily activities); 5. death. RESULTS: In total, 12 patients (five women and seven men) were enrolled, with age range 18-71 years old. Neurological complications of pandemic A(H1 N1 )2009pdm influenza developed in seven out of 69 (10.1%) hospitalized patients. The most common neurological complication was encephalopathy. Neurological complications developed in two out of 24 (8.3%) hospitalized patients during postpandemic (H1 N1 )V period. One patient presented with encephalopathy, another with meningoencephalitis. During the 2018 influenza season, there was one patient who has developed influenza A neurological complications. Overall, two out of 104 (1.9%) influenza A patients developed influenza-associated neurological complications in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Every patient with unexplained neurological symptoms and signs similar to aseptic and septic meningitis/encephalitis has to be tested for influenza virus during epidemics and pandemics.
