34621890|t|Combined fascia iliaca compartment block and monitored anesthesia care for geriatric patients with hip fracture: Two case reports.
34621890|a|BACKGROUND: Major hip surgery usually requires neuraxial or general anesthesia with tracheal intubation and may be supplemented with a nerve block to provide intraoperative and postoperative pain relief. CASE SUMMARY: This report established that hip surgical procedures can be performed with a fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) and monitored anesthesia care (MAC) while avoiding neuraxial or general anesthesia. This was a preliminary experience with two geriatric patients with hip fracture, American Society of Anesthesiologists status III, and with many comorbidities. Neither patient could be operated on within 48 h after admission. Both general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia were high-risk procedures and had contraindications. Hence, we chose nerve block combined with a small amount of sedation. Intraoperative analgesia was provided by single-injection ultrasound-guided FICB. Light intravenous sedation was added. Surgical exposure was satisfactory, and neither patient complained of any symptoms during the procedure. CONCLUSION: This report showed that hip surgery for geriatric patients can be performed with FICB and MAC, although complications and contraindications are common. The anesthetic program was accompanied by stable respiratory and circulatory system responses and satisfactory analgesia while avoiding the adverse effects and problems associated with either neuraxial or general anesthesia.
