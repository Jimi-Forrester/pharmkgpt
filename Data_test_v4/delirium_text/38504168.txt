38504168|a|BACKGROUND: In older individuals, the role of low serum uric acid (SUA) as risk factor for mortality is debated. We therefore studied whether SUA levels, particularly low SUA concentrations, are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in older population, and to clarify potential effect modification of kidney function. METHODS: We identified 14,005 older people in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2018. SUA was measured only at baseline. The relationship between SUA and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline Cox regression stratified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: During mean 8.3 years of follow-up, 4852 all-cause death and 1602 CV death were recorded. A significant U-shaped association was observed between SUA with all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk concentration of 5.5 mg/dL. Comparing to the reference group (5 to 7 mg/dL), the HR of 2 to < 5 mg/dL group was 1.11 (1.03-1.21) and 1.14 (1.00-1.30). This relationship was more pronounced in participants with an eGFR >= 60 ml/min/1.73m2 (HR, 1.16; 95%CI, 1.06-1.28). This situation similarly occurred in Urine protein negative group (HR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.04-1.25). CONCLUSIONS: Low SUA concentrations are associated with an increased risk in all-cause and CV mortality among older participants. Extremely low SUA concentrations are especially undesirable, especially in the older adults with normal kidney function.
