39070181|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited by malignant tumor cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of malignant tumors. This role encompasses immune evasion, promotion of angiogenesis, stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, correlation with cancer stem cells, multilineage differentiation within the TME, and development of treatment resistance. Simultaneously, extensive research is exploring the homing effect of MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSCs-EVs) in tumors, aiming to design them as carriers for antitumor substances. These substances are targeted to deliver antitumor drugs to enhance drug efficacy while reducing drug toxicity. This paper provides a review of the supportive role of MSCs in tumor progression and the associated molecular mechanisms. Additionally, we summarize the latest therapeutic strategies involving engineered MSCs and MSCs-EVs in cancer treatment, including their utilization as carriers for gene therapeutic agents, chemotherapeutics, and oncolytic viruses. We also discuss the distribution and clearance of MSCs and MSCs-EVs upon entry into the body to elucidate the potential of targeted therapies based on MSCs and MSCs-EVs in cancer treatment, along with the challenges they face.
