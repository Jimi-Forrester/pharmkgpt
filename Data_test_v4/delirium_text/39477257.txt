39477257|t|Impact of awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on patients mortality with cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and trial sequential meta-analysis based on observational studies.
39477257|a|OBJECTIVES: The use of awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, without intubation or sedation under ECMO support in patients with cardiogenic shock is growing rapidly because emerging clinical investigations indicates it may reduce morbidity associated with sedation and intubation. We systematically reviewed the efficacy of awake ECMO and provided evidence for clinical practitioners and researchers. DESIGN: Systematic review and trial sequential meta-analysis based on observational studies. DATA SOURCES: Data was retrieved from seven databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and Cochrane Library) up to 1 March 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included observational studies that compared the differences in clinical outcomes between awake ECMO and non-awake ECMO in patients with cardiogenic shock. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers rigorously conducted literature retrieval, screening and data extraction. The RevMan software was used for data synthesis. RESULTS: Five retrospective observational studies involving 1044 patients with cardiogenic shock were included. Compared with non-awake ECMO, awake ECMO was associated with a lower mortality rate of patients with cardiogenic shock (OR=0.28; 95% CI, (0.15, 0.49); p<0.0001; I2=50%). Trial sequential analysis indicated that the sample mortality outcome reached the required information size. No significant differences were observed between the two groups on secondary outcomes such as the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning from ECMO, tracheostomy, haemorrhage, thrombosis, limb ischaemia and nosocomial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing awake ECMO may result in better clinical outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock. Because of the limited sample sizes and potential bias of the current studies, more rigorously designed large-scale trials are urgently needed to verify the above findings.
