37621756|a|BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a recently discovered gaseous neurotransmitter in the nervous and gastrointestinal systems. It exerts its effects through multiple signaling pathways, impacting various physiological activities. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), a vital nucleus involved in visceral sensation, was investigated in this study to understand the role of H2S in regulating gastric function in rats. AIM: To examine whether H2S affects the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 pathways and the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor in the NTS. METHODS: Immunohistochemical and fluorescent double-labeling techniques were employed to identify cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and c-Fos co-expressed positive neurons in the NTS during rat stress. Gastric motility curves were recorded by inserting a pressure-sensing balloon into the pylorus through the stomach fundus. Changes in gastric motility were observed before and after injecting different doses of NaHS (4 nmol and 8 nmol), physiological saline, Capsazepine (4 nmol) + NaHS (4 nmol), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 4 nmol) + NaHS (4 nmol), and L703606 (4 nmol) + NaHS (4 nmol). RESULTS: We identified a significant increase in the co-expression of c-Fos and CBS positive neurons in the NTS after 1 h and 3 h of restraint water-immersion stress compared to the expressions observed in the control group. Intra-NTS injection of NaHS at different doses significantly inhibited gastric motility in rats (P < 0.01). However, injection of saline, first injection NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC or transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist Capsazepine or NK1 receptor blockers L703606 and then injection NaHS did not produce significant changes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NTS contains neurons co-expressing CBS and c-Fos, and the injection of NaHS into the NTS can suppress gastric motility in rats. This effect may be mediated by activating TRPV1 and NK1 receptors via the NF-kappaB channel.
