32759766|t|Far-Off Resonance: Multiwavelength Raman Spectroscopy Probing Amide Bands of Amyloid-beta-(37-42) Peptide.
32759766|a|Several neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are linked with protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Conformational changes of native protein into the beta-sheet structure are associated with a significant change in the vibrational spectrum. This is especially true for amide bands which are inherently sensitive to the secondary structure of a protein. Raman amide bands are greatly intensified under resonance conditions, in the UV spectral range, allowing for the selective probing of the peptide backbone. In this work, we examine parallel beta-sheet forming GGVVIA, the C-terminus segment of amyloid-beta peptide, using UV-Vis, FTIR, and multiwavelength Raman spectroscopy. We find that amide bands are enhanced far from the expected UV range, i.e., at 442 nm. A reasonable two-fold relative intensity increase is observed for amide II mode (normalized according to the deltaCH2/deltaCH3 vibration) while comparing 442 and 633 nm excitations; an increase in relative intensity of other amide bands was also visible. The observed relative intensification of amide II, amide S, and amide III modes in the Raman spectrum recorded at 442 nm comparing with longer wavelength (633/785/830 nm) excited spectra allows unambiguous identification of amide bands in the complex Raman spectra of peptides and proteins containing the beta-sheet structure.
