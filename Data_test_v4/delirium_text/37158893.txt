37158893|a|Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are known for their significant capability to reconstitute and preserve a functional hematopoietic system in long-term periods after transplantation into conditioned hosts. HSCs are thus crucial cellular targets for the continual repair of inherited hematologic, metabolic, and immunologic disorders. In addition, HSCs can undergo various fates, such as apoptosis, quiescence, migration, differentiation, and self-renewal. Viruses continuously pose a remarkable health risk and request an appropriate, balanced reaction from our immune system, which as well as affects the bone marrow (BM). Therefore, disruption of the hematopoietic system due to viral infection is essential. In addition, patients for whom the risk-to-benefit ratio of HSC transplantation (HSCT) is acceptable have seen an increase in the use of HSCT in recent years. Hematopoietic suppression, BM failure, and HSC exhaustion are all linked to chronic viral infections. Virus infections continue to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients, despite recent advancements in the field. Furthermore, whereas COVID-19 manifests initially as an infection of the respiratory tract, it is now understood to be a systemic illness that significantly impacts the hematological system. Patients with advanced COVID-19 often have thrombocytopenia and blood hypercoagulability. In the era of COVID-19, Hematological manifestations of COVID-19 (i.e., thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia), the immune response, and HSCT may all be affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in various ways. Therefore, it is important to determine whether exposure to viral infections may affect HSCs used for HSCT, as this, in turn, may affect engraftment efficiency. In this article, we reviewed the features of HSCs, and the effects of viral infections on HSCs and HSCT, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, etc. Video Abstract.
