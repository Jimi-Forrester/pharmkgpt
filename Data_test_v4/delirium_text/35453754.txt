35453754|t|The Expression of Signaling Genes in Breast Cancer Cells.
35453754|a|The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of paclitaxel on the expression of genes encoding signaling factors in breast cancer cells in in vitro conditions after incubation with the said chemotherapeutic. The tested cells were harvested from the mammary glands of 36 patients with early breast cancer. The microarray technology was employed for the identification of gene expression. For this purpose, mRNA isolated from tumor cells was used. A significant effect of paclitaxel on the genome of breast cancer cells was confirmed. Paclitaxel changed the functions of cancer cells by increasing the expression of most genes encoding signaling proteins and receptors. The analysis of the results suggested that this cytostatic agent produces a beneficial therapeutic effect at a lower dose (60 ng/mL). In contrast, a high dose of paclitaxel (300 ng/mL) was associated with a high cytotoxicity.
