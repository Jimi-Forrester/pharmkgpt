19935094|a|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and safe treatment even in the frail and in the medically ill. A case report of ECT being administered to a patient with a history of a recently resected meningioma and the presence of a metallic skull plate is presented here. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder in remission but had an acute manic episode with psychotic features after resection of suprasellar meningioma. He presented with superimposed delirium that complicated the presentation. Because there was no effective resolution with medications, ECT was administered. This case documents the safe administration of ECT in complicated situations such as these. This case also demonstrates that ECT can be successfully administered in the presence of superimposed delirium and after a recent meningioma resection. Clinical skills and expertise are required to safely and effectively administer ECT in such cases.
