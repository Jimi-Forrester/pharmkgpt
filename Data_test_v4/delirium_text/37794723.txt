37794723|t|Pharmacological management of neurocognitive impairment in schizophrenia: A narrative review.
37794723|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment are among the core features of schizophrenia, experienced by up to 75% of patients. Available treatment options for schizophrenia including dopamine antagonists and traditional antipsychotic medications have not been shown to confer significant benefits on cognitive deficits. Contrary to the focus on management of positive symptoms in schizophrenia, cognitive abilities are main predictor of independent living skills, functional abilities, employment, engagement in relapse prevention, and patients' subjective sense of well-being and quality of life. This review aims to provide a summary of recent literature on pharmacological options for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. METHODS: We conducted a literature search of studies from 2011 to 2021 across four electronic databases including PubMed, PsycInfo, MEDLINE, and Embase. Human studies using a pharmacological treatment for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia were included. RESULTS: Fifty-eight eligible publications, representing 11 pharmacological classes, were included in this review. Major limitations involved small sample size, methodological limitations as well as heterogeneity of participants and outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Overall evidence remains inconclusive for any pharmacological classes studied for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Methodological limitations in a majority of the studies rendered their findings preliminary. We further discuss possible explanations for these findings that could guide future research.
