38024319|t|The gut microbiome meets nanomaterials: exposure and interplay with graphene nanoparticles.
38024319|a|Graphene-based nanoparticles are widely applied in many technology and science sectors, raising concerns about potential health risks. Emerging evidence suggests that graphene-based nanomaterials may interact with microorganisms, both pathogens and commensal bacteria, that dwell in the gut. This review aims to demonstrate the current state of knowledge on the interplay between graphene nanomaterials and the gut microbiome. In this study, we briefly overview nanomaterials, their usage and the characteristics of graphene-based nanoparticles. We present and discuss experimental data from in vitro studies, screening tests on small animals and rodent experiments related to exposure and the effects of graphene nanoparticles on gut microbiota. With this in mind, we highlight the reported crosstalk between graphene nanostructures, the gut microbial community and the host immune system in order to shed light on the perspective to bear on the biological interactions. The studies show that graphene-based material exposure is dosage and time-dependent, and different derivatives present various effects on host bacteria cells. Moreover, the route of graphene exposure might influence a shift in the gut microbiota composition, including the alteration of functions and diversity and abundance of specific phyla or genera. However, the mechanism of graphene-based nanomaterials' influence on gut microbiota is poorly understood. Accordingly, this review emphasises the importance of studies needed to establish the most desirable synthesis methods, types of derivatives, properties, and safety aspects mainly related to the routes of exposure and dosages of graphene-based nanomaterials.
