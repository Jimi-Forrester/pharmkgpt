32727337|t|Rebalancing the Oral Microbiota as an Efficient Tool in Endocrine, Metabolic and Immune Disorders.
32727337|a|The current treatment and prevention procedures of oral disorders follow a very targeted approach considering mouth and its structures as a system that is completely independent, than the rest of the body. The main therapeutic approach is to keep the levels of oral bacteria and hygiene in an acceptable range compatible with oral-mouth health, completely separated from systemic microbial homeostasis (eubiosis vs dysbiosis). This can negatively impact the diagnosis of a more complex systemic disease and its progression. Dysbiosis occurs as a consequence of imbalance in oral and gut microbiota which leads to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, as reported in current literature. Likewise, there is a need to highlight and develop a novel philosophical approach in the treatments for oral diseases that will necessarily involve nonconventional approaches.
