16922439|a|A 47-year old woman, who was diagnosed as Stanford type A acute aortic dissection, underwent an emergent operation. Because of obesity and bleeding, it was impossible to find the right axillary artery. Only we could have for inflow line was the femoral line. After starting cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and crossclamping the ascending aorta, mean blood pressure of the right radial artery dropped to 15 mmHg, suggesting the occurrence of malperfusion. The ascending aorta was immediately transected, and the CPB was ceased. Inflow cannula was directly inserted into the true rumen of the ascending aorta, and resumed the CPB. The mean blood pressure rose up to 80 mmHg. Such procedure took about 10 minutes. Abnormal neurological findings were not apparent except for the transient postoperative delirium. The patient was discharged on the 48th day after operation. It is suggested that this method was useful and safe to have the new inflow line when emergently necessary.
