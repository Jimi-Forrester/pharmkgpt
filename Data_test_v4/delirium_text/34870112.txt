34870112|t|Dysphagia management during COVID-19 pandemic: A review of the literature and international guidelines.
34870112|a|In this review, we present the safest and most effective diagnosis and treatment approaches to dysphagia during the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the light of available data, relevant literature, and personal experiences. Evaluations for dysphagia patients should be based on clinical assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and instrumental assessment should be planned for very few number of patients. The main approach to rehabilitation must depend on compensatory methods, texture-modified foods, and postural strategies. Direct treatment methods should be avoided and home-based exercise programs should be encouraged. It is also obvious that there is a need for the development of new strategies for telemedicine/telerehabilitation practices in the new world order.
