28451223|t|Imaging specific newly synthesized proteins within cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
28451223|a|Metabolic azide amino acid labelling followed by the use of bioorthogonal chemistry is an efficient technique for imaging newly synthesized proteins. Recently, AHA-labelling together with the proximity-ligation assay was used to identify newly synthesized proteins of interest (POI) (Tom Dieck et al., Nat. Meth. 2015, 12, 411). Here we build on this study replacing the proximity-ligation assay with FRET to improve the spatial resolution. Herein, we develop a FRET-based strategy for imaging the newly synthesized endogenous POI within cells: a FRET acceptor is installed onto the newly synthesized proteins via click chemistry, and a FRET donor onto the POI via immunocytochemistry. We found that a photobleaching based FRET efficiency imaging mode and a fluorescence lifetime imaging mode showed the distribution of newly synthesized proteins more accurately compared to the direct observation of FRET signals. We demonstrated the capability of this FRET-based imaging method by visualizing several newly synthesized proteins including TDP-43, tubulin and CaMKIIalpha in different cell lines. This novel analytical imaging method could be used to visualize other specific endogenous proteins of interest in situ.
