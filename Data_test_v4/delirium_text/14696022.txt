14696022|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of risperidone on the behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPS), cognitive function and activities of daily living (ADL) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The optimal dose of risperidone in Korean patients with AD was determined with respect to both efficacy and safety profiles. METHODS: This was an 8 week prospective, open-labelled study with risperidone. The following efficacy measures were implemented: Behaviour Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale, Korean version for BPS; Korean version of mini-mental state examination for cognitive function; Barthel activities of daily living and blessed dementia rating scale for ADL; and global deterioration scale for global assessment of severity. Adverse events were recorded using the UKU side effect rating scale. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients completed the study. Risperidone was effective in reducing the BPS without affecting the cognitive and ADL domains of AD symptomatology. Risperidone dosages of 0.25 or 0.5 mg/day were most frequently administered and demonstrated the most favourable outcomes by efficacy and safety measures. Risperidone treatment was generally well tolerated, although extrapyramidal symptoms were noted in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that low dosages of risperidone are effective and favourable in reduction of the BPS for Korean patients with AD.
