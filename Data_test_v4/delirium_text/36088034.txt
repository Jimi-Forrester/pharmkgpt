36088034|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. The pathology is characterized by the generation of amyloid plaques and neuronal fiber tangles in the brain. Although decades of research have been conducted, there is still a lack of effective treatments and countermeasures. Polysaccharide components of natural origin obtained by extraction and isolation possess a variety of pharmacological activities and medicinal values, and they are receiving increasing attention. Polysaccharides have shown good promise in the field of AD prevention and treatment, and polysaccharides ameliorate AD in multiple ways by targeting different mechanisms with almost no toxic side effects. In this paper, we review the research on polysaccharides of natural sources regulation in AD in recent years and list systematically the possible intervention pathways of polysaccharides targeting different mechanisms.
