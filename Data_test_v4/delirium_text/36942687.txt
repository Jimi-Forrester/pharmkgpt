36942687|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases that are presently incurable. There have been reports of aberrant activation of cell cycle pathways in neurodegenerative diseases. Previously, we have found that Cdc25A is activated in models of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD. In the present study, we have synthesized a small library of molecules targeting Cdc25A and tested their neuroprotective potential in cellular models of neurodegeneration. The Buchwald reaction and amide coupling were crucial steps in synthesizing the Cdc25A-targeting molecules. Several of these small-molecule inhibitors significantly prevented neuronal cell death induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation as well as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment. Lack of NGF signaling leads to neuron death during development and has been associated with AD pathogenesis. The NGF receptor TrkA has been reported to be downregulated at the early stages of AD, and its reduction is linked to cognitive failure. 6-OHDA, a PD mimic, is a highly oxidizable dopamine analogue that can be taken up by the dopamine transporters in catecholaminergic neurons and can induce cell death by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Some of our newly synthesized molecules inhibit Cdc25A phosphatase activity, block loss of mitochondrial activity, and inhibit caspase-3 activation caused by NGF deprivation and 6-OHDA. Hence, it may be proposed that Cdc25A inhibition could be a therapeutic possibility for neurodegenerative diseases and these Cdc25A inhibitors could be effective treatments for AD and PD.
