33198164|t|Multiple Sclerosis: Shall We Target CD33?
33198164|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Myeloid lineage cells (microglia and macrophages) may participate in the pathogenic mechanisms leading to MS. CD33 is a transmembrane receptor, mainly expressed by myeloid lineage cells. CD33 rs3865444 is a promoter variant previously associated with Alzheimer's disease, whose role in MS remains obscure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of CD33 rs3865444 in MS risk. METHODS: We genotyped 1396 patients with MS and 400 healthy controls for the presence of the CD33 rs3865444 variant. Odds ratios (ORs) with the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated with the SNPStats software, assuming five genetic models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant, and log-additive), with the G allele as the reference allele. The value of 0.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance. RESULTS: CD33 rs3865444 was associated with MS risk in the dominant (GG vs. GT + TT; OR (95% C.I.) = 0.79 (0.63-0.99), p = 0.041) and the over-dominant (GG + TT vs. GT; OR (95% C.I.) = 0.77 (0.61-0.97), p = 0.03) modes of inheritance. Given that the GG genotype was more frequent and the GT genotype was less frequent in MS patients compared to controls-while the observed frequency of the TT genotype did not differ between the two groups-the observed difference in MS risk may be stemming from either the GG (as a risk factor) or the GT (as a protective factor) genotype of CD33 rs3865444. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest a possible contribution of CD33 rs3865444 to MS. Therefore, larger multiethnic studies should be conducted, investigating the role of CD33 rs3865444 in MS.
