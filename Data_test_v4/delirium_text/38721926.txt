38721926|t|Interrelationship of Sleep Disturbances and Cognitive Status on Mortality.
38721926|a|Sleep disturbances may promote the development and advancement of Alzheimer's disease. Our purpose was to determine if sleep disturbances were associated with earlier mortality while accounting for cognition. The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database was used to evaluate mortality risk conferred by sleep, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score determined cognitive status. Demographics, sleep disturbances, cognitive status, and comorbid/other neuropsychiatric conditions were examined as predictors of survival time via Cox regression. The sample (N = 31,110) had a median age [interquartile range] of 72 [66, 79] years, MoCA score of 23 [16, 26], and survival time of 106.0 months [104.0,108.0]; 10,278 (33%) died during follow-up; 21% (n = 6461) experienced sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances impacted survival time depending on cognition, with the greatest effect in transition from normal to cognitive impairment (P < .001). Findings support that sleep disturbances negatively impact survival time, and the impact of sleep disturbances on survival time is interrelated with cognition.
