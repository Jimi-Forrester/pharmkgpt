33780370|t|Bradycardia Due to Donepezil in Adults: Systematic Analysis of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.
33780370|a|BACKGROUND: Bradycardia is a physiological condition characterized by a decrease in heart rate and is a side effect of many drug classes. Bradycardia has been reported as an adverse event for patients receiving donepezil for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the paper is to systematically investigate the association between the occurrence of bradycardia in adults and the usage of donepezil using clinical data derived from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. METHODS: The risk of bradycardia in patients who only took donepezil was compared with those of patients who only took over-the-counter medications, multiple arrhythmia drugs, or other medications for AD treatment. In addition, this study sought to determine if this heightened bradycardia risk was influenced by sex, age, and dosage. RESULTS: The results indicated that there was a significant greater likelihood of reporting bradycardia in patients administered donepezil than most of the drugs investigated. There was no significant association between age or the dosage of donepezil and the likelihood of reporting bradycardia. However, males were found to be more likely than females to report bradycardia as an adverse event. Tumor necrosis factor inhibition and the stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase were proposed to be the primary mechanism of actions which confer elevated bradycardia risk when using donepezil. CONCLUSION: These findings identified strong association between the usage of donepezil and bradycardia in adults as well as provided insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms that induce bradycardia by donepezil.
