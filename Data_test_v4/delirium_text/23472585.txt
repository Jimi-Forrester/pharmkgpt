23472585|a|The bioactivities of two novel compounds (TAE-1 and TAE-2) that contain a sym-triazine scaffold with acetylcholine-like substitutions are examined as promising candidate agents against Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of amyloid-beta fibril formation in the presence of Abeta1-42, evaluated by Thioflavin T fluorescence, demonstrated comparable or improved activity to a previously reported pentapeptide-based fibrillogenesis inhibitor, iAbeta5p. Destabilization of Abeta1-42 assemblies by TAE-1 and TAE-2 was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy imaging. sym-Triazine inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was observed in cytosol extracted from differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and also using human erythrocyte AChE. The sym-triazine derivatives were well tolerated by these cells and promoted beneficial effects on human neurons, upregulating expression of synaptophysin, a synaptic marker protein, and MAP2, a neuronal differentiation marker.
