29936730|a|Background: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is very common and can be experienced at all stages of disease and insurvivors. CRF causes patients more distress than pain or nausea and vomiting. Different pharmacologic interventionshave been evaluated for the management of CRF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of bupropionsustained release (SR) as a treatment for fatigue in patients with cancer. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled trial, patients with fatigue due to cancer were randomly assigned to either 150mg daily of bupropionSR or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was the changes in average daily fatigue from baseline to week 4 usingthe Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-therapy- Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire. Results: 40 patients wererandomly assigned to treatment with bupropion SR or placebo (20 in each group). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)showed a significant improvement in fatigue and quality of life in the bupropion group compared to baseline (P=0.000).Secondary outcome, including depression, severity of fatigue and performance status didn't show significant differencebetween groups. Generally, bupropion SR was tolerated well. Conclusion: Four weeks of 150 mg bupropion SRimprove fatigue significantly in cancer patients. Bupropion has potential as an effective and safe pharmaceutical agentfor treating CRF.
