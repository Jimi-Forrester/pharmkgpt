25336599|t|Opposite Neural Trajectories of Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and epsilon2 Alleles with Aging Associated with Different Risks of Alzheimer's Disease.
25336599|a|The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a confirmed genetic risk factor and the APOE epsilon2 allele is a protective factor related to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intriguingly, recent studies demonstrated similar brain function alterations between APOE epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles, despite their opposite susceptibilities to AD. To address this apparent discrepancy, we recruited 129 cognitively normal elderly subjects, including 36 epsilon2 carriers, 44 epsilon3 homozygotes, and 49 epsilon4 carriers. All subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI scans. We hypothesized that aging could influence the APOE epsilon2 and epsilon4 allele effects that contribute to their appropriate AD risks differently. Using the stepwise regression analysis, we demonstrated that although both epsilon2 and epsilon4 carriers showed decreased functional connectivity (FC) compared with epsilon3 homozygotes, they have opposite aging trajectories in the default mode network-primarily in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex. As age increased, epsilon2 carriers showed elevated FC, whereas epsilon4 carriers exhibited decreased FC. Behaviorally, the altered DMN FC positively correlated with information processing speed in both epsilon2 and epsilon4 carriers. It is suggested that the opposite aging trajectories between APOE epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles in the DMN may reflect the antagonistic pleiotropic properties and associate with their different AD risks.
