39554163|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are produced by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which can occur during synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling at presynapses. Precisely how amyloidogenic APP processing may impair presynaptic proteostasis and how to therapeutically target this process remains poorly understood. Using App knock-in mouse models of early Abeta pathology, we found proteins with hampered degradation accumulate at presynaptic sites. At this mild pathological stage, amyloidogenic processing leads to accumulation of Abeta 42 inside SVs. To explore if targeting SVs modulates Abeta accumulation, we investigated levetiracetam (Lev), a SV-binding small molecule drug that has shown promise in mitigating AD-related pathologies despite its mechanism of action being unclear. We discovered Lev reduces Abeta 42 levels by decreasing amyloidogenic processing of APP in a SV2a-dependent manner. Lev corrects SV protein levels and cycling, which results in increased surface localization of APP, where it favors processing via the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Using metabolic stable isotopes and mass spectrometry we confirmed that Lev prevents the production of Abeta 42 in vivo. In transgenic mice with aggressive pathology, electrophysiological and immunofluorescent microscopy analyses revealed that Lev treatment reduces SV cycling and minimizes synapse loss. Finally, we found that human Down syndrome brains with early Abeta pathology, have elevated levels of presynaptic proteins, confirming a comparable presynaptic deficit in human brains. Taken together, we report a mechanism that highlights the therapeutic potential of Lev to modify the early stages of AD and represent a promising strategy to prevent Abeta 42 pathology before irreversible damage occurs. One Sentence Summary: We discovered that the SV-binding drug levetiracetam prevents Abeta 42 production by modulating SV cycling which alters APP localization and thus proteolytic processing, highlighting its therapeutic potential for AD.
