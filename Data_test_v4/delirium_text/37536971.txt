37536971|a|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Digital biomarkers can provide a cost-effective, objective and robust measure for neurological disease progression, changes in care needs and the effect of interventions. Motor function, physiology and behaviour can provide informative measures of neurological conditions and neurodegenerative decline. New digital technologies present an opportunity to provide remote, high-frequency monitoring of patients from within their homes. The purpose of the living lab study is to develop novel digital biomarkers of functional impairment in those living with neurodegenerative disease (NDD) and neurological conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Living Lab study is a cross-sectional observational study of cognition and behaviour in people living with NDDs and other, non-degenerative neurological conditions. Patients (n>=25 for each patient group) with dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mild cognitive impairment, traumatic brain injury and stroke along with controls (n>=60) will be pragmatically recruited. Patients will carry out activities of daily living and functional assessments within the Living Lab. The Living Lab is an apartment-laboratory containing a functional kitchen, bathroom, bed and living area to provide a controlled environment to develop novel digital biomarkers. The Living Lab provides an important intermediary stage between the conventional laboratory and the home. Multiple passive environmental sensors, internet-enabled medical devices, wearables and electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to characterise functional impairments of NDDs and non-NDD conditions. We will also relate these digital technology measures to clinical and cognitive outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals have been granted by the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 21IC6992). Results from the study will be disseminated at conferences and within peer-reviewed journals.
