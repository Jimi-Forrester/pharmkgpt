34385535|a|Vascular mechanisms are increasingly recognized in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less is known about the occurrence of stroke in AD patients. We aimed to quantify the risk of stroke in patients with AD and compare the incidence rates (IR) of stroke in individuals without AD. Systematic search of Embase and MEDLINE between 1970 and 2020. Inclusion criteria: reports with >= 50 patients with non-familial AD, which reported the occurrence of stroke (all types) and/or ischemic stroke and/or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) during follow-up. Meta-analyses of pooled data using random-effects model were performed. IR were calculated for each study. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for studies presenting a control-group without AD. Among 5109 retrieved studies, 29 (0.6%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria, reporting a total of 61,824 AD patients. In AD patients the IR were 15.4/1000 person-years for stroke (all types), 13.0/1000 person-years for ischemic stroke and 3.4/1000 person-years for ICH. When compared to controls without AD, incidence rate for ICH in AD patients was significantly higher (IRR = 1.67, 95%CI 1.43-1.96), but similar for ischemic stroke. Incident stroke is not a rare event in AD population. AD is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage which warrants further clarification.
