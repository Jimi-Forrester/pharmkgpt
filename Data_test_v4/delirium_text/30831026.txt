30831026|t|Isotope Corrected Chiral and Achiral Nontargeted Metabolomics: An Approach for High Accuracy and Precision Metabolomics Based on Derivatization and Its Application to Cerebrospinal Fluid of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
30831026|a|We propose a chiral metabolomics approach based on a data-dependent MS/MS analysis (DDA) using high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOFMS) and 13C-isotope coded derivatization (ICD) reagents, i.e., iDMT-( S)-A and iDMT-( S)-PO. The advantage of the method is the correction of all detected derivatives by parallel derivatization of the isotope-coded and noncoded reagents. The automatic data analysis platform using an MSDIAL and ICD discrimination program, called DINA, was also developed and used for the data analysis process. As a result, a 0.5-2.0% (d-/l-isomer) variation of the isomers was correctly recognized in the automatic data analysis step. Both the semiquantitative comparison and identification efficiency were improved as a result of the high resolution/accuracy of the MS and MS/MS spectra derived from the DDA analysis. This method was used for biomarker discovery in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty-four biomarker candidates were successfully determined, including 8 chiral ones.
