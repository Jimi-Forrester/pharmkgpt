30911348|t|Physical Exercise Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Morphofunctional Cerebellar Damages Induced by the Ethanol Binge Drinking Paradigm from Adolescence to Adulthood in Rats.
30911348|a|Ethanol (EtOH) binge drinking is characterized by high EtOH intake during few hours followed by withdrawal. Protection strategies against the damages generated by this binge are poorly explored. Thus, this study is aimed at investigating the protective role of treadmill physical exercise (PE) on the damage caused after repeated cycles of binge-like EtOH exposure in the oxidative biochemistry, morphology, and cerebellar function of rats from adolescence to adulthood. For this, animals were divided into four groups: control group (sedentary animals with doses of distilled water), exercised group (exercised animals with doses of distilled water), EtOH group (sedentary animals with doses of 3 g/kg/day of EtOH, 20% w/v), and exercised+EtOH group (exercised animals with previous mentioned doses of EtOH). The PE occurred on a running treadmill for 5 days a week for 4 weeks, and all doses of EtOH were administered through intragastric gavage in four repeated cycles of EtOH in a binge-like manner. After the EtOH protocol and PE, animals were submitted to open field and beam walking tests. In sequence, the cerebellums were collected for the biochemical and morphological analyses. Biochemical changes were analyzed by measurement of Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), reduced glutathione content measurements (GSH), and measurement of nitrite and lipid peroxidation (LPO). In morphological analyses, Purkinje cell density evaluation and immunohistochemistry evaluation were measured by antimyelin basic protein (MBP) and antisynaptophysin (SYP). The present findings demonstrate that the binge drinking protocol induced oxidative biochemistry misbalance, from the decrease of TEAC levels and higher LPO related to tissue damage and motor impairment. In addition, we have shown for the first time that treadmill physical exercise reduced tissue and functional alterations displayed by EtOH exposure.
