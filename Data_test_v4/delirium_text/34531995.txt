34531995|a|The root of Scutellaria baicalensis (Scutellaria Radix) has been used as herbal medicine for years, while its stem and leaf (aerial part) are considered as waste. The water extract from the aerial part of S. baicalensis (named as SBA) being included in the feeding of Siganus fuscescens (grey rabbit fish) has been shown to replace antibiotics in aquaculture with excellent outcome. To strengthen the usage of SBA in fish feeding, the total fish output and its nutritive value were determined here. Feeding the fishes with different doses of SBA for a month, the body length and weight were significantly increased after intake of standard feed containing 1% SBA. In parallel, the expressions of alkaline phosphatase and growth-related factors in bone, liver, and muscle of 1% SBA-fed fishes were markedly increased, suggesting the beneficial effects of SBA. The composition of amino acid and fatty acid in fish muscle, after intaking 1% SBA-containing feed, was altered. In SBA-fed fish muscle, the amounts of threonine and methionine were increased, while the amount of leucine was decreased, as compared with control group. The amounts of fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, were increased in the 1% SBA-fed fish, while the amounts of triglycerides were decreased. The results indicated the growth-promoting activity of SBA in an in vivo culture of S. fuscescens, as well as to increase the nutritive values of the muscle. Thus, the re-cycle of waste products during the farming of S. baicalensis herb in serving as fish feeding should be encouraged.
