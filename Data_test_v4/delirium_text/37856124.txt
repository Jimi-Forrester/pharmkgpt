37856124|t|Practice-Level Documentation of Alcohol-Related Problems in Primary Care.
37856124|a|Importance: Rates of alcohol-associated deaths increased over the past 20 years, markedly between 2019 and 2020. The highest rates are among individuals aged 55 to 64 years, primarily attributable to alcoholic liver disease and psychiatric disorders due to use of alcohol. This study investigates potential geographic disparities in documentation of alcohol-related problems in primary care electronic health records, which could lead to undertreatment of alcohol use disorder. Objective: To identify disparities in documentation of alcohol-related problems by practice-level social deprivation. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study using secondary data from the Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care clinical trial (September 21, 2017, to January 8, 2021) was performed. A national sample of 44 primary care practices with co-located behavioral health services was included in the analysis. Patients with 2 primary care visits within 2 years and at least 1 chronic medical condition and 1 behavioral health condition or at least 3 chronic medical conditions were included. Exposure: The primary exposure was practice-level Social Deprivation Index (SDI), a composite measure based on county income, educational level, employment, housing, single-parent households, and access to transportation (scores range from 0 to 100; 0 indicates affluent counties and 100 indicates disadvantaged counties). Main Outcomes and Measures: Documentation of an alcohol-related problem in the electronic health record was determined by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes or use of medications for alcohol use disorder in past 2 years. Multivariable models adjusted for alcohol consumption, screening for a substance use disorder, urban residence, age, sex, race and ethnicity, income, educational level, and number of chronic health conditions. Results: A total of 3105 participants (mean [SD] age, 63.7 [13.0] years; 64.1% female; 11.5% Black, 7.0% Hispanic, 76.7% White, and 11.9% other race or chose not to disclose; 47.8% household income <$30 000; and 80.7% urban residence). Participants had a mean (SD) of 4.0 (1.7) chronic conditions, 9.1% reported higher-risk alcohol consumption, 4% screened positive for substance use disorder, and 6% had a documented alcohol-related problem in the electronic health record. Mean (SD) practice-level SDI score was 45.1 (20.9). In analyses adjusted for individual-level alcohol use, demographic characteristics, and health status, practice-level SDI was inversely associated with the odds of documentation (odds ratio for each 10-unit increase in SDI, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, higher practice-level SDI was associated with lower odds of documentation of alcohol-related problems, after adjusting for individual-level covariates. These findings reinforce the need to address primary care practice-level barriers to diagnosis and documentation of alcohol-related problems. Practices located in high need areas may require more specialized training, resources, and practical evidence-based tools that are useful in settings where time is especially limited and patients are complex.
