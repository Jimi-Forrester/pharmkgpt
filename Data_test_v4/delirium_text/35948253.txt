35948253|a|BACKGROUND: Catatonia is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that can be associated with several underlying etiologies including primary psychiatric and autoimmune disorders. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder typically characterized by seizures, movement abnormalities, and behavioral changes. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate can present with complex neuropsychiatric symptoms including catatonia which can be challenging for clinicians to identify as excited catatonia can mimic delirium and psychiatric disorders such as psychosis and mania. OBJECTIVES: To identify and present cases of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis where excited catatonia is the presenting symptom. METHODS: We present 2 case studies of agitation and disinhibition in an adolescent and young adult that were ultimately found to be secondary to autoimmune receptor encephalitis, in both cases, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid analysis to be due to anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies. RESULTS: Excited catatonia was suspected and initially treated with immunological therapy and high doses of lorazepam. As the severity of catatonia progressed with limited improvement with lorazepam, both cases were ultimately effectively treated with electroconvulsive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Excited catatonia should be considered with presentations of bizarre behavior, agitation, disinhibition, and other psychotic symptoms in patients with no prior psychiatric history. Although the primary treatment for catatonia associated with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is immunomodulatory therapy paired with benzodiazepines, electroconvulsive therapy has been shown to be an effective and safe adjuvant treatment that is especially useful for management of excited catatonia.
