33579846|a|BACKGROUND: In recent years, the efficacy of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has attracted extensive interest owing to the close associations between the two diseases. OBJECTIVE: Here, we screened traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and multi-target ingredients that may have potential therapeutic effects on both T2DM and AD from T2DM prescriptions. METHODS: Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used. RESULTS: Firstly, the top 10 frequently used herbs and corresponding 275 active ingredients were identified from 263 T2DM-related TCM prescriptions. Secondly, through the comparative analysis of 208 potential targets of ingredients, 1,740 T2DM-related targets, and 2,060 AD-related targets, 61 common targets were identified to be shared. Thirdly, by constructing pharmacological network, 26 key targets and 154 representative ingredients were identified. Further enrichment analysis showed that common targets were involved in regulating multiple pathways related to T2DM and AD, while network analysis also found that the combination of Danshen (Radix Salviae)-Gancao (Licorice)-Shanyao (Rhizoma Dioscoreae) contained the vast majority of the representative ingredients and might be potential for the cotreatment of the two diseases. Fourthly, MAPK1, PPARG, GSK3B, BACE1, and NR3C1 were selected as potential targets for virtual screening of multi-target ingredients. Further docking studies showed that multiple natural compounds, including salvianolic acid J, gancaonin H, gadelaidic acid, icos-5-enoic acid, and sigmoidin-B, exhibited high binding affinities with the five targets. CONCLUSION: To summarize, the present study provides a potential TCM combination that might possess the potential advantage of cotreatment of AD and T2DM.
