37220447|a|Introduction The goal of palliative care (PC) is to improve the quality of life of patients and their families through the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. PC improves symptom control and end-of-life care. Despite the fact that the benefits of PC have long been acknowledged, Portugal's demands are currently unmet. The majority of patients have been identified as having a high level of complexity and are referred for symptom management and end-of-life care. Study aim The study aimed to analyze the sociodemographic, disease and hospitalization characteristics of the patients admitted to a specialized PC unit. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of palliative care patients admitted to a Portuguese oncology institute's acute palliative care unit during a three-month period. Patients' information such as social demographics, clinical data, patient and family member's psychological, social, nutritional and spiritual counseling and knowledge on diagnosis and therapy objectives were collected from physician's records and analyzed using SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows). Results A total of 41 patients were included, with a mean age of 66.4 years. Spouses were the primary caregivers. There was no indication for targeted therapy in any of the patients. Prior to hospitalization, 58.5% did not receive follow-up by PC. The most frequently reported symptoms were pain (75.6%), tiredness (68.3%), anorexia (61%) and emotional distress (58.5%). Patients were referred to counseling for psychological (43.3%), spiritual (19.5%), nutritional (58.5%) and social services (34.1%). During hospitalization, 75% of patients died; out of which, 70.9% were not previously followed up on by the PC team. Conclusion PC patients are complex, with multiple clinical-psychological-social-spiritual issues, and their management in non-PC wards can be challenging. Since the use of a multidisciplinary approach can improve patients' and families' quality of life, it is critical to train, expand and integrate the PC teams into the existing teams, allowing patients a better quality of life until they pass.
