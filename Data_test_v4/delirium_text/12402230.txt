12402230|a|INTRODUCTION AND METHOD: Dementia with Lewy bodies is a generative brain disease of unknown origin, characterised clinically by progressive mental deterioration, with striking fluctuations and transitory episodes of confusion, hallucinations and psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and paranoid deliria), extrapyramidal signs and hypersensitivity to neuroleptic drugs. The main pathological finding was the abundance of Lewy bodies in the neurons of the cortex, brain stem and other subcortical nuclei. In many cases, however, varying amounts of Alzheimer like degenerative lesions are associated. CONCLUSION: This study analyses the anatomopathological, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of this disease.
