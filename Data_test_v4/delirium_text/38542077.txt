38542077|a|Novel technologies such as single-cell RNA and single-nucleus RNA sequencing have shed new light on the complexity of different microglia populations in physiological and pathological states. The transcriptomic profiling of these populations has led to the subclassification of specific disease-associated microglia and microglia clusters in neurodegenerative diseases. A common profile includes the downregulation of homeostasis and the upregulation of inflammatory markers. Furthermore, there is concordance in few clusters between murine and human samples. Apolipoprotein E, which has long been considered a high-risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, is strongly regulated in both these murine and human clusters. Transforming growth factor-beta plays an essential role during the development and maturation of microglia. In a pathological state, it attenuates their activation and is involved in numerous cell regulatory processes. Transforming growth factor-beta also has an influence on the deposition of amyloid-beta, as it is involved in the regulation of key proteins and molecules. Taken together, this review highlights the complex interaction of apolipoprotein E, the triggering receptor on myeloid cells 2, and transforming growth factor-beta as part of a regulatory axis in microglia at the onset and over the course of Alzheimer's disease.
