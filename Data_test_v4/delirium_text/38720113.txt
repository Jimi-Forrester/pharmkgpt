38720113|a|PURPOSE: Children recovering from anesthesia commonly experience early postoperative negative behaviour, caused by pain and emergence delirium. Differentiating the two is challenging in young children. Perioperative pain influences the heart rate variability-derived Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE) index and may also affect emergence delirium. We sought to investigate whether the perioperative NIPE index can discriminate between mild, moderate, or severe pain levels and can detect emergence delirium. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled children aged three years or younger undergoing elective adenotonsillectomy, tonsillectomy, or adenoidectomy. The NIPE index, the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) score, and the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score were recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The primary aim was to investigate the relationship between the postoperative NIPE index and postoperative pain severity. The secondary aims were to evaluate the association between the NIPE index and emergence delirium (PAED >= 10) and its delirium-specific (ED-I) and pain-specific (ED-II) components. RESULTS: Sixty-nine children were recruited. In the PACU, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) NIPE values in children experiencing moderate and severe pain were 50 (12) and 49 (14), respectively. These values were significantly lower than the mean (SD) value of 64 (13) observed in children with mild pain (mean difference moderate vs no/mild pain, -14; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17 to -11; P < 0.001, and mean difference severe vs no/mild pain, -17; 95% CI, -20 to -14; P < 0.001, respectively). The NIPE index was significantly lower in children experiencing pain-specific ED-II (mean [SD] NIPE instantaneous [NIPEi] for ED-II 49 [10] vs no ED-II 55 [13]; mean difference, -6; 95% CI, -11 to -2; P = 0.009). The NIPE index was unable to detect emergence delirium (mean [SD] NIPEi for ED, 54 [15] vs no ED, 51 [10]; mean difference, 3; 95% CI, -2 to 8; P = 0.23) or the delirium-specific component ED-I (mean [SD] NIPEi for ED-I, 55 [15] vs no ED-I, 51 [11]; mean difference, 4; 95% CI, 0 to 8; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: The NIPE index can identify moderate and severe postoperative pain after adenotonsillectomy but not emergence delirium in children aged three years and younger. This discrimination can be valuable in the early postoperative phase when the differentiation between pain and emergence delirium is difficult.
