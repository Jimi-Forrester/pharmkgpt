38136721|t|Cannabinoids in Periodontology: Where Are We Now?
38136721|a|INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoids are a well-documented treatment modality for various immune and inflammatory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn's disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and a range of neurodegenerative conditions. However, limited information is available regarding the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in treating periodontal disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to analyze the current evidence on the antibacterial and immunomodulatory effects of cannabis and its role in the healing and regeneration processes within periodontal tissues. RESULTS: This review discusses the potential role of cannabinoids in restoring periodontal tissue homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: The examination of the endocannabinoid system and the physiological effects of cannabinoids in the periodontium suggests that they possess immunomodulatory and antibacterial properties, which could potentially promote proper tissue healing and regeneration.
