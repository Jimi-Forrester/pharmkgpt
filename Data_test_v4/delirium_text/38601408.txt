38601408|t|Naldemedine and Magnesium Oxide as First-Line Medications for Opioid-Induced Constipation: A Comparative Database Study in Japanese Patients With Cancer Pain.
38601408|a|Introduction Naldemedine and magnesium oxide are common first-line early laxative medications used in the real-world scenario in Japan, for patients with cancer pain who receive opioid prescriptions, as per a nationwide hospital claims database study. However, the real-world prescription patterns and associated outcomes are unknown. Methods In this retrospective, cohort study using the Medical Data Vision (MDV) database (January 2018 to December 2020), data were collected from eligible patients (who had a long-term prescription of strong opioids, for >30 days) in Japan with naldemedine or magnesium oxide as the first-line laxative prescription, for a long-term opioid prescription for cancer pain with >=6 months post-opioid observation period. A laxative prescription within three days after the opioid prescription date was termed an "early" prescription. The composite incidence of dose increase or addition/change of laxatives at three months after the start of the opioid prescription was the primary endpoint after adjusting baseline characteristics between the treatment arms by propensity score matching. Results After propensity score matching, 1717 and 544 patients who were prescribed naldemedine and magnesium oxide each were included in the early prescription and non-early prescription groups, respectively. Even after matching, the incidence of death was not adjusted enough and was significantly higher in the naldemedine arm than in the magnesium oxide arm in the non-early group but comparable in the early group. The incidence of addition, change, or dose increase was significantly higher in the naldemedine arm than in the magnesium oxide arm of the early prescription group (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.08 (1.00, 1.17); p=0.0402); the incidence was comparable between the arms of the non-early group. Conclusion These findings may provide valuable insights into real-world clinical treatment patterns and preliminary evidence for the selection of first-line medications to mitigate opioid-induced constipation in Japanese patients with cancer pain.
