1677459|t|Quantitative changes in the amyloid beta A4 precursor protein in Alzheimer cerebrospinal fluid.
1677459|a|The major three secretory isoforms of Alzheimer beta A4 amyloid precursor protein (APP) were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using (1) a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and (2) densitometric analysis of CSF Western blots. The protease inhibitor-containing APP751/770 isoforms represented an average of 10.5% of total APP in CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 22), multi-infarct dementia (MID, n = 5) and normal controls (n = 10). APP levels in CSF did not depend on total CSF protein. Both findings are inconsistent with a hematogeneous origin of APP in CSF and suggest an intracerebral source. Total APP, APP695 and APP751/770 were significantly decreased in the AD and in the MID groups, but were not correlated to the ages of patients or controls.
