36554802|t|Determinants of Physical Activity in Older Adults in South-Eastern Poland.
36554802|a|The aim of our study is to assess factors determining the uptake of physical activity (PA) by older people living in south-eastern Poland. This is a cross-sectional study. The study included 858 older people aged 75 and over living in south-eastern Poland. PA was assessed by asking about the time spent on any at least moderate PA per week and about doing planned strengthening exercises to improve muscle strength and muscular endurance. Functional status, disability and quality of life in older people were also assessed. Logistic regression models were used to identify the factors related to PA. In the study group, only 25.64% performed a minimum of 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise, while strengthening exercises were performed by 22.49%. The most important factors influencing the uptake of PA were age, number of chronic diseases, place of residence, education, social activity, housing conditions, quality of life and health status. In summary, the study population represents a low level of PA uptake, with the majority not meeting the World Health Organization recommendations for PA uptake by older people. Our findings suggest individualized efforts to promote public health and increase PA among older people over 75 years of age.
