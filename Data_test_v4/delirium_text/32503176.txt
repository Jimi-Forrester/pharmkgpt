32503176|t|Could the Heat Shock Proteins 70 Family Members Exacerbate the Immune Response in Multiple Sclerosis? An in Silico Study.
32503176|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. It represents one of the main causes of neurological disability in young people. In MS, the autoimmune response is directed against myelin antigens but other possible bio-molecular markers are investigated. The aim of this work was, through an in silico study, the evaluation of the transcriptional modifications between healthy subjects and MS patients in six brain areas (corpus callosum, hippocampus, internal capsule, optic chiasm, frontal and parietal cortex) in order to identify genes representative of the disease. Our results show the upregulation of the Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA7, HSPA6, HSPH1 and HSPA4L of the HSP70 family, among which HSPA1A and HSPA1B are upregulated in all the brain areas. HSP70s are molecular chaperones indispensable for protein folding, recently associated with immune system maintenance. The little overexpression of the HSPs protects the cells from stress but extreme upregulation can contribute to the MS pathogenesis. We also investigated the genes involved in the immune system that result in overall upregulation in the corpus callosum, hippocampus, internal capsule, optic chiasm and are absent in the cortex. Interestingly, the genes of the immune system and the HSP70s have comparable levels of expression.
