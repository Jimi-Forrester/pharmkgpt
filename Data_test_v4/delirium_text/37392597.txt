37392597|a|BACKGROUND: Anti-amyloid vaccines may offer a convenient, affordable, and accessible means of preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease. UB-311 is an anti-amyloid-beta active immunotherapeutic vaccine shown to be well-tolerated and to have a durable antibody response in a phase 1 trial. This phase 2a study assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of UB-311 in participants with mild Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A 78-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 2a study was conducted in Taiwan. Participants were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive seven intramuscular injections of UB-311 (Q3M arm), or five doses of U311 with two doses of placebo (Q6M arm), or seven doses of placebo (placebo arm). The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of UB-311. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02551809). FINDINGS: Between 7 December 2015 and 28 August 2018, 43 participants were randomised. UB-311 was safe, well-tolerated, and generated a robust immune response. The three treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with the highest incidence were injection-site pain (14 TEAEs in seven [16%] participants), amyloid-related imaging abnormality with microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits (12 TEAEs in six [14%] participants), and diarrhoea (five TEAEs in five [12%] participants). A 97% antibody response rate was observed and maintained at 93% by the end of the study across both UB-311 arms. INTERPRETATION: These results support the continued development of UB-311.
