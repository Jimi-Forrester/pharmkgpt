36518386|t|Safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessment of oral Withaferin-A in mice.
36518386|a|Withaferin-A (WA) is the principle component of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha). It has several biological activities including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective and immune-modulatory properties. The acute and sub-acute toxicity of oral WA was investigated in mice. In the acute toxicity study, up to 2000 mg/kg of WA was well tolerated without any signs of toxicity or death. In the sub-acute toxicity study, mice were orally administered 10, 70 and 500 mg/kg of WA respectively, daily for 28 days. Upon physiological, serum chemistry, hematology and histopathogical examination, no features suggestive of drug-induced toxicity were observed at any dose levels, thereby confirming the No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to be at least 500 mg/kg. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability of WA was evaluated using single intravenous and oral doses of 10 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg respectively using sparse sampling strategy. Bioanalysis was carried out using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The AUC of WA was found to be 3996.9 +- 557.6 ng/mL*h and 141.7 +- 16.8 ng/mL*h for the intravenous and oral routes of administration respectively. The oral bioavailability was determined to be 1.8%. To conclude, WA was found to be extremely safe even at high doses, with a low oral bioavailability.
