37609338|a|Innate immune activation plays a vital role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Among which, the DNA sensing cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)- STING pathway has been implicated in diverse aspects of AD progression. In the current study, we showed that the cGAS-STING signaling was up-regulated in AD and this elevation was mainly contributed by the microglial population other than non-microglial cell types in the brain. By establishing an inducible, microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in 5xFAD background, we found that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology significantly limited plaque formation, and protected mice from Abeta-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, we found cGAS was necessary for plaque-associated microglial enrichment potentially driven by IRF8, and was indispensable for the development of disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype. Meanwhile, the loss of microglial cGAS reduced the levels of dystrophic neurites which led to preserved synaptic integrity and neuronal function. Our study provides new insights in understanding the effects of innate immune in AD via a cell-type specific manner, and lays the foundation for potential targeted intervention of the microglial cGAS-STING pathway toward the improvement of AD.
