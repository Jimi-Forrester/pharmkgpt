37686011|a|Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) occurs in about 5% of children. Orthopedic treatment of ITW is complicated by the lack of a known etiology. Only half of the conservative and surgical methods of treatment give a stable positive result of normalizing gait. Available data indicate that the disease is heterogeneous and multifactorial. Recently, some children with ITW have been found to have genetic variants of mutations that can lead to the development of toe walking. At the same time, some children show sensorimotor impairment, but these studies are very limited. Sensorimotor dysfunction could potentially arise from an imbalanced production of neurotransmitters that play a crucial role in motor control. Using the data obtained in the studies of several pathologies manifested by the association of sensory-motor dysfunction and intestinal dysbiosis, we attempt to substantiate the notion that malfunction of neurotransmitter production is caused by the imbalance of gut microbiota metabolites as a result of dysbiosis. This review delves into the exciting possibility of a connection between variations in the microbiome and ITW. The purpose of this review is to establish a strong theoretical foundation and highlight the benefits of further exploring the possible connection between alterations in the microbiome and TW for further studies of ITW etiology.
