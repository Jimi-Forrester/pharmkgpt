37624178|t|Fatal Overdose with the Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-ABUTINACA: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
37624178|a|A case of a 26-year-old male who died from consuming synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-ABUTINACA is reported. MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-ABUTINACA are potent synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs). This is the first detailed reporting of MDMB-4-en-PINACA and 4F-ABUTINACA associated fatality, which can help the routine forensic work. The scientific literature on the symptoms associated with these substances are evaluated, along with the pharmacological properties and possible mechanism of death. A forensic autopsy was performed according to Recommendation No. R (99)3 of the Council of Europe on medico-legal autopsies. Histological samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Complement component C9 immunohistochemistry was applied to all heart samples. Toxicological analyses were carried out by supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) and headspace gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (HS-GC-FID). The literature was reviewed to identify reported cases of MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-ABUTINACA use. Autopsy findings included brain edema, internal congestion, petechial bleeding, pleural ecchymoses, and blood fluidity. Toxicological analyses determined 7.2 ng/mL of MDMB-4en-PINACA and 9.1 ng/mL of 4F-ABUTINACA in the peripheral blood. MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-ABUTINACA are strong, potentially lethal SCRA, and their exact effects and outcome are unpredictable.
