36040406|a|Crinum malabaricum Lekhak & Yadav is a recently discovered and critically endangered aquatic bulbous plant of the family Amaryllidaceae. It gained attention as a wild source of the acetylcholinesterase inhibiting alkaloid 'galanthamine' used to treat Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. The bulbs of this plant contain the highest amount of galanthamine among Crinum species. In vitro regeneration systems were developed to produce quality uniform plantlets of C. malabaricum. Bright field light microscopy was used to analyse micro-morpho-anatomical developments taking place in the leaves and roots during in vitro, ex vitro and in vivo transitions of plantlets. Leaves and roots of plants raised in vitro possessed a higher degree of microscopic structural anomalies, such as underdeveloped epicuticular wax deposition, immature and non-functional stomata, more aquiferous parenchyma with a reduced lumen. Roots developed in vitro were characterized by extremely large, uneven cortical cells and reduced intercellular spaces. The vascular tissues were under-developed and only primary vascular tissues were observed. As a result of ex vitro acclimation, there was a significant acceleration in the improvement of tissue systems in leaves and roots. Such plantlets can tolerate elevated temperatures and light under in vivo conditions. Thus, the microscopic evaluation of the structural trajectory in different stages of plantlet development provides an understanding of the acclimation process and structural adaptations, which could help enhance survival of in vitro raised plantlets under ex vitro and in vivo conditions.
