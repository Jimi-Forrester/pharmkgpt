35340996|a|Oxidative stress is an unbalanced redox state caused due to high concentration of reactive species and comparatively a very lower concentration of endogenous antioxidants in the body. When established, oxidative stress can disrupt cell structure and protein conformation and even damage genetic materials. Considering the degree of damage that oxidative stress can cause and the lack of promising treatment, preventing its onset is the best possible solution. Nutraceuticals, food or their extract that provides an added health benefit along with nutrition, can be used to prevent oxidative stress. An entire class of nutraceuticals are known for their inherent antioxidant properties, which can be included in our daily diet to prevent the occurrence of oxidative stress. Regulatory consumption of nutraceuticals can maintain a stable redox state, and thus prevents oxidative stress. In addition to managing oxidative stress, nutraceuticals can also help to control conditions like diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer, organ inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and other such conditions which are caused due to cellular oxidation. This review highlights the potential nutraceutical effect of several food and supplements which with further research along with genetic analysis can pave the road for nutrigenomics.
