36362682|t|Significance of Temporal Muscle Thickness in Chronic Subdural Hematoma.
36362682|a|Background: Reduced temporal muscle thickness (TMT) was verified as an independent negative prognostic parameter for outcome in brain tumor patients. Independent thereof, chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a neurosurgical condition with high recurrence rates and unreliable risk models for poor outcome. Since sarcopenia was associated with poor outcome, we investigated the possible role of TMT and the clinical course of CSDH patients. Methods: This investigation is a single-center retrospective study on patients with CSDH. We analyzed the radiological and clinical data sets of 171 patients with surgically treated CSDH at a University Hospital from 2017 to 2020. Results: Our analysis showed a significant association between low-volume TMT and increased hematoma volume (p < 0.001), poor outcome at discharge (p < 0.001), and reduced performance status at 3 months (p < 0.002). Conclusion: TMT may represent an objective prognostic parameter and assist the identification of vulnerable CSDH patients.
