35898907|a|The increasing incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is still an emergency for global public health and a major obstacle to tuberculosis treatment. Therefore, deciphering the novel mechanisms of mycobacterial antibiotic resistance is crucial for combatting the rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains. In this study, we identified an unexpected role of Mycobacterium smegmatis GntR family transcriptional regulator MSMEG_5174 and its homologous gene Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1152 in aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance. Deficiency of MSMEG_5174 rendered Mycobacterium smegmatis highly resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment, and ectopic expression of Rv1152 in MSMEG_5174 mutants restored antibiotic-induced bacterial killing. We further demonstrated that MSMEG_5174 negatively regulates the expression of purine metabolism-related genes and the accumulation of purine metabolites. Moreover, overexpression of xanthine dehydrogenase MSMEG_0871 or xanthine treatment elicited a significant decrease in aminoglycoside antibiotic lethality for Mycobacterium smegmatis. Together, our findings revealed MSMEG_5174 as a metabolic regulator and hint toward unexplored crosstalk between purine metabolism and antibiotic resistance.
