32523058|t|Measuring the Frequency-Specific Functional Connectivity Using Wavelet Coherence Analysis in Stroke Rats Based on Intrinsic Signals.
32523058|a|Optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISi) method is an optical technique to evaluate the functional connectivity (FC) of the cortex in animals. Already, using OISi, the FC of the cortex has been measured in time or frequency domain separately, and at frequencies below 0.08 Hz, which is not in the frequency range of hemodynamic oscillations which are able to track fast cortical events, including neurogenic, myogenic, cardiac and respiratory activities. In the current work, we calculated the wavelet coherence (WC) transform of the OISi time series to evaluate the cerebral response changes in the stroke rats. Utilizing WC, we measured FC at frequencies up to 4.5 Hz, and could monitor the time and frequency dependency of the FC simultaneously. The results showed that the WC of the brain diminished significantly in ischemic motor and somatosensory cortices. According to the statistical results, the signal amplitude, responsive area size, correlation, and wavelet coherence of the motor and the somatosensory cortices for stroke hemisphere were found to be significantly lower compared to the healthy hemisphere. The obtained results confirm that the OISi-based WC analysis is an efficient method to diagnose the relative severity of infarction and the size of the infarcted region after ischemic stroke.
