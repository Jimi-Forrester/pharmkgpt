31099668|t|A Practical Guide to Geriatric Syndromes in Older Adults With Cancer: A Focus on Falls, Cognition, Polypharmacy, and Depression.
31099668|a|Geriatric syndromes are multifactorial conditions that are prevalent in older adults. Geriatric syndromes are believed to develop when an individual experiences accumulated impairments in multiple systems that compromise their compensatory ability. In older adults with cancer, the presence of a geriatric syndrome is common and may increase the complexity of cancer treatment. In addition, the physiologic stress of cancer and cancer treatment may precipitate or exacerbate geriatric syndromes. Common geriatric syndromes include falls, cognitive syndromes and delirium, depression, and polypharmacy. In the oncology setting, the presence of geriatric syndromes is relevant; falls and cognitive problems have been shown to be predictive of chemotherapy toxicity and overall survival. Polypharmacy and depression are more common in older adults with cancer compared with the general geriatric population. Multiple screening tools exist to identify falls, cognitive problems, polypharmacy, and depression in older adults and can be applied to the oncology setting to identify patients at risk. When recognized, several interventions exist that could be considered for this vulnerable population. We review the available evidence of four geriatric syndromes in the oncology setting, including clinical implications, validated screening tools, potential supportive care, and therapeutic interventions.
