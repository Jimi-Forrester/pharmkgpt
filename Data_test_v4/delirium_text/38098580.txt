38098580|t|Toxicities of CAR T-cell therapy: a review of current literature.
38098580|a|The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) design, first invented by Zelig Eshhar, paved the way for the use of genetically modified T-cells in targeted therapy against cancer cells. Since then, it has gone through many generations, especially with the integration of co-stimulation in the second and third-generation CARs. However, it also mounts a hyperactive immune response named as cytokine release syndrome with the release of several cytokines eventually resulting in multiple end-organ toxicities. The severity of cytokine release syndrome depends upon certain factors such as the tumor burden, choice of co-stimulation, and degree of lymphodepletion, and can manifest as pulmonary edema, vascular leak, renal dysfunction, cardiac problems, hepatic failure, and coagulopathy. Many grading criteria have been used to define these clinical manifestations but they lack harmonization. Neurotoxicity has also been significantly associated with CAR T-cell therapy but it has not been studied much in previous literature. This review aims to provide a comprehensive account of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and treatment of CAR T-cell associated neurotoxicity.
