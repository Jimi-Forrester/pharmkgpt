2687119|t|Recognition and treatment of depression in Alzheimer's disease.
2687119|a|Although there is no generally effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease, some common psychiatric symptoms associated with the disease, including depression, may respond to pharmacological intervention. Recognition of the depression requires a high index of suspicion from the primary care physician and caregivers and a history from family members or other caregivers. Several groups of medications, including tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and psychostimulants, have been used for treatment of depression in dementia patients. Generally, Alzheimer's patients require lower dosages of medication and longer drug treatment trials than younger patients treated for depression.
