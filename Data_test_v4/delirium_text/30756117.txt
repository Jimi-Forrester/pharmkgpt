30756117|t|Shift in Hospitalizations for Alzheimer's Disease to Related Dementias in France between 2007 and 2017.
30756117|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the first cause of dementia. Diagnostic criteria have evolved: proposals to revise the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria were published in 2007. Our aim was to analyze the evolution in the coding of AD in the French nationwide exhaustive hospital discharge database (PMSI) between 2007 and 2017. METHODS: We analyzed evolution of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (ICD-10) coding for AD and AD dementia in the PMSI database from 2008 to 2017 (285,748,938 inpatient stays). RESULTS: We observed a 44% decrease in the number of inpatient stays with a principal diagnosis of AD or AD dementia from 2007 (46,313 inpatient stays) to 2017 (25,856 inpatient stays) in France. Over the same period, we observed a 49% increase in the number of inpatient stays with a principal diagnosis of related dementias (other organic mental disorders or other degenerative disorders). Overall, the number of inpatient stays for dementia remained stable despite the increase in the total number of inpatient stays: 95,377 in 2007 (0.409% of inpatient stays) and 99,190 in 2017 (0.344%). CONCLUSION: We therefore note a shift from AD and AD dementia to other dementia diagnoses since 2007. This study suggests a more accurate use of AD related ICD-10 codes since the revised criteria in 2007.
