38791281|t|The Serotonin 4 Receptor Subtype: A Target of Particular Interest, Especially for Brain Disorders.
38791281|a|In recent years, particular attention has been paid to the serotonin 4 receptor, which is well expressed in the brain, but also peripherally in various organs. The cerebral distribution of this receptor is well conserved across species, with high densities in the basal ganglia, where they are expressed by GABAergic neurons. The 5-HT4 receptor is also present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, where they are carried by glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons. Outside the central nervous system, the 5-HT4 receptor is notably expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. The wide distribution of the 5-HT4 receptor undoubtedly contributes to its involvement in a plethora of functions. In addition, the modulation of this receptor influences the release of serotonin, but also the release of other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine. This is a considerable asset, as the modulation of the 5-HT4 receptor can therefore play a direct or indirect beneficial role in various disorders. One of the main advantages of this receptor is that it mediates a much faster antidepressant and anxiolytic action than classical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Another major benefit of the 5-HT4 receptor is that its activation enhances cognitive performance, probably via the release of acetylcholine. The expression of the 5-HT4 receptor is also altered in various eating disorders, and its activation by the 5-HT4 agonist negatively regulates food intake. Additionally, although the cerebral expression of this receptor is modified in certain movement-related disorders, it is still yet to be determined whether this receptor plays a key role in their pathophysiology. Finally, there is no longer any need to demonstrate the value of 5-HT4 receptor agonists in the pharmacological management of gastrointestinal disorders.
