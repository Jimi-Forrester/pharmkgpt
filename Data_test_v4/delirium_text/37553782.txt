37553782|a|BACKGROUND: Necroptosis induced by receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is engaged in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) pathology. In this study, we explored the impact of RIPK3 activation on neuronal necroptosis and the mechanism of the death domain-associated protein (DAXX)-mediated nuclear necroptosis pathway after ICH. METHODS: Potential molecules linked to the progression of ICH were discovered using RNA sequencing. The level of DAXX was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA, and western blotting. DAXX localization was determined by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays. The RIPK3 inhibitor GSK872 and DAXX knockdown with shRNA-DAXX were used to examine the nuclear necroptosis pathway associated with ICH. Neurobehavioral deficit assessments were performed. RESULTS: DAXX was increased in patients and mice after ICH. In an ICH mouse model, shRNA-DAXX reduced brain water content and alleviated neurologic impairments. GSK872 administration reduced the expression of DAXX. shRNA-DAXX inhibited the expression of p-MLKL. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays showed that RIPK3 and AIF translocated into the nucleus and then bound with nuclear DAXX. CONCLUSIONS: RIPK3 revitalization promoted neuronal necroptosis in ICH mice, partially through the DAXX signaling pathway. RIPK3 and AIF interacted with nuclear DAXX to aggravate ICH injury.
