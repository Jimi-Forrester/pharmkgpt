39556451|a|Stressful life events and glucocorticoid (stress) hormones appear to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and hasten its progression, but the reasons for this remain unclear. One potential explanation is that when amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology is accumulating in the preclinical disease stage, glucocorticoid receptor signalling during stressful events exacerbates cellular dysfunction caused by Abeta. Alternatively, Abeta may disrupt glucocorticoid receptor signalling. To explore these possibilities, we investigated whether the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and Abeta have overlapping effects on the cellular proteome and whether Abeta influences canonical glucocorticoid receptor function. Human olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells, collected from the olfactory mucosa of six adult donors, were treated with soluble Abeta40 or Abeta42 followed by dexamethasone. Proteins were quantified by mass spectrometry. After 32 h treatment, Abeta40 and Abeta42 both induced profound changes in innate immunity-related proteins. After 72 h, Abeta42 formed widespread aggregates and induced few proteomic changes, whereas Abeta40 remained soluble and altered expression of mitochondrial and innate immunity-related proteins. ONS cells revealed overlapping impacts of Abeta40 and dexamethasone, with 23 proteins altered by both treatments. For 16 proteins (including eight mitochondrial proteins) dexamethasone counteracted the effects of Abeta40. For example, caspase 4 and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase were increased by Abeta40 and decreased by dexamethasone. Consistent with this finding, Abeta40 increased, but dexamethasone decreased, ONS cell proliferation. For seven proteins, including superoxide dismutase [Mn] mitochondrial, dexamethasone exacerbated the effects of Abeta40. For some proteins, including complement C3, the effects of dexamethasone differed depending on whether Abeta40 was present or absent. Neither Abeta species influenced glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation. Overall, this study revealed that glucocorticoid receptor signalling modifies the intracellular effects of Ass40, counteracting some effects and exacerbating others. It suggests that cellular mechanisms through which glucocorticoid receptor signalling influences Alzheimer's disease risk/progression are complex and determined by the balance of beneficial and detrimental glucocorticoid effects.
