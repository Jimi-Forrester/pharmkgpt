33053935|a|A 3-month alcoholism rehabilitation program at psychiatric hospitals is common in Japan for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, many AUD patients are often hospitalized for the treatment of digestive disorders due to alcohol-related liver diseases and pancreatitis. In this sense, AUD patients need to be better supported by professionals and departments in general hospitals. Here we analyzed the problems in alcohol-related medical care in Japan and examined the measures to be taken at general hospitals.
