24427444|t|The role of mobility as a protective factor of cognitive functioning in aging adults: a review.
24427444|a|CONTEXT: Over 33 chronic disease states and health disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, are grouped into what is known as sedentary death syndrome. All these conditions are positively affected by 30 minutes of brisk exercise daily. In addition, only 30% of aging is based on genetics, with 70% on lifestyle. Therefore, a large majority of aging is controlled by individual health behaviors. Exercise is a powerful tool for healthy aging of the body and the mind. Courses of short- and long-term exercise provide benefits to musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health and can prevent age-related brain structural and functional losses. This review examines the evidence in support of mobility as an inexpensive and effective protective factor in maintaining brain health and preventing cognitive decline in aging adults. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search was performed for articles in English from 1990 to 2012. Reference lists were also reviewed and relevant articles obtained. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. RESULTS: Evidence suggests that maintaining a high level of cardiopulmonary fitness and mobility exhibits protective effects on structural changes that occur with aging in areas of the brain associated with memory, attention, and task completion. Chronic exercise is also associated with preservation of overall cognitive functioning and prevention of dementia. CONCLUSION: In combination with other preventative measures, physical mobility can assist in preventing or slowing cognitive decline in aging adults.
