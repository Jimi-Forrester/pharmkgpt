32939741|a|PURPOSE: The Cingulate Island Sign score (CIScore) by rCBF SPECT is used in the differentiation between Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has some false-positive AD cases. To resolve the problem, we developed new differential diagnosing method incorporating occipital lobe and para-hippocampal rCBF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 27 DLB and 31 AD cases undertaken Tc-99 m-ECD SPECT, we evaluated the mean Z score in the bilateral superior, middle, inferior occipital gyri, cuneus, amygdala, hippocampus, and para-hippocampus. One criterion of DLB was defined as the case with CIScore lower than 0.27. The other criteria were the cases of following either or both two conditions were satisfied. (1) The number of occipital gyri with mean Z score higher than 1 is three or more. (2) The number of hippocampal regions with mean Z score higher than 1 is one or less. We compared the differential diagnostic ability among these four criterions. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy by CIscore was 69% and that of the occipital gyri analysis 84%, para-hippocampal regions analysis 76% and combined occipital gyri and para-hippocampal regions analysis 93%. CONCLUSION: The new method by combined rCBF analysis of occipital gyri and para-hippocampal regions showed best diagnostic ability in differentiating DLB from AD.
