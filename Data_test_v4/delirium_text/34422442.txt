34422442|t|Commentary on "Multi-Component Care Bundle in Geriatric Fracture Hip for Reducing Postoperative Delirium".
34422442|a|The letter to the editor suggested several questions regarding the methodology of the recent article by Lam et al who determined effect of multicomponent care bundle on the development of postoperative delirium. This article is published in Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation .  2021; 12:21514593211004530. Our concerns included the incomplete preoperative assessment, possible influences of anaesthetic and intraoperative managements on the development of postoperative delirium, bias effect of postoperative analgesia on the primary and secondary findings, and real clinical value of multicomponent care bundle to decrease the risk of postoperative delirium. We believe that clarifying these issues would improve the transparency of this study and interpretation of findings.
