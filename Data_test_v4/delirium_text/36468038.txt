36468038|a|Background: The molecular mechanisms underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its comorbidities may involve mitochondrial dysfunction. However, very little is known about the relationships between mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes and OSA. Methods: Mitochondrial dysfunction-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OSA and control adipose tissue samples were identified using data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and information on mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes from the GeneCards database. A mitochondrial dysfunction-related signature of diagnostic model was established using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression and then verified. Additionally, consensus clustering algorithms were used to conduct an unsupervised cluster analysis. A protein-protein interaction network of the DEGs between the mitochondrial dysfunction-related clusters was constructed using STRING database and the hub genes were identified. Functional analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and gene set variation analysis (GSVA), were conducted to explore the mechanisms involved in mitochondrial dysfunction in OSA. Immune cell infiltration analyses were conducted using CIBERSORT and single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). Results: we established mitochondrial dysfunction related four-gene signature of diagnostic model consisted of NPR3, PDIA3, SLPI, ERAP2, and which could easily distinguish between OSA patients and controls. In addition, based on mitochondrial dysfunction-related gene expression, we identified two clusters among all the samples and three clusters among the OSA samples. A total of 10 hub genes were selected from the PPI network of DEGs between the two mitochondrial dysfunction-related clusters. There were correlations between the 10 hub genes and the 4 diagnostic genes. Enrichment analyses suggested that autophagy, inflammation pathways, and immune pathways are crucial in mitochondrial dysfunction in OSA. Plasma cells and M0 and M1 macrophages were significantly different between the OSA and control samples, while several immune cell types, especially T cells (gamma/delta T cells, natural killer T cells, regulatory T cells, and type 17 T helper cells), were significantly different among mitochondrial dysfunction-related clusters of OSA samples. Conclusion: A novel mitochondrial dysfunction-related four-gen signature of diagnostic model was built. The genes are potential biomarkers for OSA and may play important roles in the development of OSA complications.
