34366356|a|BACKGROUND: Small vessel disease (SVD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers including deep and periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMH), lacunes, and microbleeds are frequently observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD), but their implication has not been clearly elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the implication of SVD MRI markers in cognitively impaired patients with AD and/or LBD. METHODS: We consecutively recruited 57 patients with pure AD-related cognitive impairment (ADCI), 49 with pure LBD-related cognitive impairment (LBCI), 45 with mixed ADCI/LBCI, and 34 controls. All participants underwent neuropsychological tests, brain MRI, and amyloid positron emission tomography. SVD MRI markers including the severity of deep and PWMH and the number of lacunes and microbleeds were visually rated. The relationships among vascular risk factors, SVD MRI markers, ADCI, LBCI, and cognitive scores were investigated after controlling for appropriate covariates. RESULTS: LBCI was associated with more severe PWMH, which was conversely associated with an increased risk of LBCI independently of vascular risk factors and ADCI. PWMH was associated with attention and visuospatial dysfunction independently of vascular risk factors, ADCI, and LBCI. Both ADCI and LBCI were associated with more lobar microbleeds, but not with deep microbleeds. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PWMH could reflect degenerative process related with LBD, and both AD and LBD independently increase lobar microbleeds.
