38379358|a|AIMS: This scoping review aimed to identify and map the available information on the nutrition care process in older adults with delirium to analyse and summarise key concepts, and gaps, including the barriers and enablers to providing nutrition care for this group. DESIGN: Scoping review. METHODS: This review was conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Published and grey sources in English were considered. DATA SOURCES: Databases searched were CINAHL, Medline, Embase, JBI Evidence-based Practice, Scopus, ProQuest and Google. The initial search was conducted from October 2021 to March 2022 and repeated in October 2023. RESULTS: The database search identified 1561 articles, 186 underwent full-text review and 17 articles were included. The grey literature search identified eight articles. Malnutrition and delirium were identified as mutually reinforcing, and nutrition strategies were included as part of multicomponent interventions for delirium management. There was no mention of barriers or enablers to nutrition care and minimal descriptive or empirical data available to guide nutrition care processes in this group. CONCLUSION: This scoping review revealed a need for further research into nutrition care processes in older patients with delirium, in particular the barriers and enablers, to inform appropriate management strategies in this vulnerable group. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: Providing nutrition care for older patients with delirium is important and further practical guidance could help patients, healthcare staff and families. IMPACT: This scoping review yielded instructive data suggesting that delirium is an important risk factor for malnutrition and vice versa, which leads to poor patient and health service outcomes. REPORTING METHOD: This scoping review adhered to relevant EQUATOR guidelines and used the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). PATIENT OF PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.
