36771112|t|Rational Design of Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Dots for Inhibiting beta-Amyloid Aggregation.
36771112|a|The fibrillization and abnormal aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are commonly recognized risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, and require an effective strategy to inhibit the Abeta deposition and treat AD. Herein, we designed and synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) as an Abeta-targeted probe, which exhibits the capacity of inhibiting the 1-42 Abeta (Abeta1-42) self-assembly in vitro. The N-CDs exhibited orange emission with an emission wavelength of 570 nm, which demonstrates their excellent optical properties with excitation-independent behavior. Meanwhile, the N-CDs have spherical morphologies with an average size of 2.2 nm, whose surface enriches the amino, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups. These preparties are conducive to improving their biological water solubility and provide a large number of chemical bonds for further interaction with proteins. Contrary to this, the kinetic process, size evolutions, and morphologies changes of Abeta1-42 were inhibited in the presence of N-CDs in the determination of a thioflavin T assay, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscope, etc. Finally, the safety application of N-CDs on Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity was further demonstrated via in vitro cytotoxicity experiments. This work demonstrates the effective outcome of suppressing Abeta aggregation, which provides a new view into the high-efficiency and low-cytotoxicity strategy in AD theranostics.
