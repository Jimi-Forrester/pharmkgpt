35932437|t|Combined ligand-based and structure-based design of PDE 9A inhibitors against Alzheimer's disease.
35932437|a|PDE9 enzyme hydrolyzes cGMP, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity through the NMDA pathway (a well-known excitotoxic target for AD) via activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent neuronal NO synthases in the postsynaptic neurons. The inhibition of PDE9 leads to elevated cGMP levels, causing enhanced NMDA signaling and thus contributing to an increase in synaptic plasticity and stabilization. Therefore, it could be considered a pertinent target for AD drug discovery. PF-04447943 and BI-409306 targeting PDE9 are undergoing clinical trials (Phase II). The present study encompasses a pharmacophoric approach to identify potent PDE9 inhibitors using various computational methods. Pharmacophores generated from the PDB 6A3N yielded 37,554 virtual hits, which underwent drug likeliness and PAINS filtering to arrive at a few virtual leads. The leads were further subjected to extra precision docking, ADMET predictions, and molecular dynamics. The final hits, ZINC000001305675 and ZINC000000377099, showed superior docking scores of - 10.90 and - 10.30 kcal/mol and satisfactory predicted ADMET scores. The hits were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies, wherein they formed stable complexes with PDE9 protein and had ligand RMSDs within acceptable limits. The processes involved in the combined ligand and structure-based strategies.
