9444355|a|Alterations in the processing and patterns of trophic and/or toxic factors might lead to the increased neuronal vulnerability in the entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body variant (LBV). Therefore, patterns and levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and glutamate receptor (gluR) expression in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in relation to disease severity were investigated. Sections from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were single and double immunolabeled for APP, gluR2/3, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R). Within the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, image analysis revealed progressively decreased APP and gluR2/3 levels during the course of AD and LBV, whereas levels of NMDA-R were unaltered. Furthermore, the present study showed a positive correlation and close co-localization of APP and gluR2/3 immunoreactivity in neurons, suggesting a possible interaction between these two factors. In conclusion, these data imply that alterations in neuronal APP and gluR2/3 expression in the entorhinal cortex lead to increased susceptibility to neurodegeneration and might be markers of vulnerability.
