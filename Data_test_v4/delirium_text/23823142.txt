23823142|t|Cognitive interventions targeting subjective cognitive complaints.
23823142|a|Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are being increasingly recognized as a preclinical phase of dementia. Thus, SCCs may represent a "promising" stage for planning and implementing preventive interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of cognitive disorders. The aim of the present study is to present and discuss the available evidence coming from clinical trials adopting cognitive interventions in individuals with SCCs. A systematic review of literature was conducted to evaluate the available trials testing nonpharmacological cognitive interventions for the prevention of dementia in subjects with SCCs. Six studies were included in the present study. Overall, most interventions showed to objectively improve cognitive performance in subjects with SCCs. A relevant heterogeneity was found concerning their characteristics and feasibility. Conversely, there is a current lack of evidence in the literature about the efficacy of nonpharmacological cognitive interventions for preventing dementia or cognitive impairment.
