33496823|a|In order to effectively and conveniently detect the beta-amyloid oligomer (AbetaO) for earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disposable aptamer biosensor has been developed with high performance, facile operation, and low cost. Using a nanocomposite by in situ reduction of chloroauric acid to decorate Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) on Fe-MIL-88NH2 material via Au-N bond to effectively enhance the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of luminol, the functioned basal electrode provides adequate background for sensing response. When the aptamer is linked via Au-S bond on the surface, the sensor gets the ability of specific recognition and coalescence toward the target (AbetaO). After incubating the sample on the aptasensor, its ECL signal is inhibited owing to the steric hindrance of the AbetaO macromolecules. The relative inhibition ratio linearly depends to the logarithm of AbetaO concentration in the range 0.1 pM to 10 pM, with an LOD of 71 fM. The aptasensor has high selectivity to AbetaO among its analogs. The recoveries in human serum were 98.9-105.4%. This research provides a new approach for sensitive detection of AbetaO in clinic laboratories for investigation and diagnosis of AD.
