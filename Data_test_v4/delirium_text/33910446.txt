33910446|t|Nutraceuticals-based therapeutic approach: recent advances to combat pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
33910446|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease accompanying memory deficits. The available pharmaceutical care has some limitations mostly entailing side effects, shelf-life, and patient's compliance. The momentous implications of nutraceuticals in AD have attracted scientists. Several preclinical studies for the investigation of nutraceuticals have been conducted.Areas covered: This review focuses on the potential use of a nutraceuticals-based therapeutic approach to treat and prevent AD. Increasing knowledge of AD pathogenesis has led to the discovery of new therapeutic targets including pathophysiological mechanisms and various cascades. Hence, the present contribution will attend to the most popular and effective nutraceuticals with proposed brief mechanisms entailing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, autophagy regulation, mitochondrial homeostasis, and more. Therefore, even though the effectiveness of nutraceuticals cannot be dismissed, it is essential to do further high-quality randomized clinical trials.Expert opinion: According to the potential of nutraceuticals to combat AD as multi-target directed drugs, there is critical importance to assess them as feasible lead compounds for drug discovery and development. To the best of the authors' knowledge, modification of blood-brain barrier permeability, bioavailability, and features of randomized clinical trials should be considered in prospective studies.
