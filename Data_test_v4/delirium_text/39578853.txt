39578853|a|BACKGROUND: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid beta (Abeta) in human plasma may provide an affordable and minimally invasive method to evaluate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is susceptible to changes in structural integrity that are indicative of the disease progression. Among healthy adults, higher dynamic network flexibility within the MTL was shown to mediate better generalization of prior learning, a measure which has been demonstrated to predict cognitive decline and neural changes in preclinical AD longitudinally. Recent developments in cognitive, neural, and blood-based biomarkers of AD risk that may correspond with MTL changes. However, there is no comprehensive study on how these generalization biomarkers, long-term memory, MTL dynamic network flexibility, and plasma biomarkers are interrelated. This study investigated (1) the relationship between long-term memory, generalization performance, and MTL dynamic network flexibility and (2) how plasma p-tau231, p-tau181, and Abeta42/Abeta40 influence generalization, long-term memory, and MTL dynamics in cognitively unimpaired older African Americans. METHODS: 148 participants (Meanage: 70.88,SDage: 6.05) were drawn from the ongoing longitudinal study, Pathways to Healthy Aging in African Americans conducted at Rutgers University-Newark. Cognition was evaluated with the Rutgers Acquired Equivalence Task (generalization task) and Rey Auditory Learning Test (RAVLT) delayed recall. MTL dynamic network connectivity was measured from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. Plasma p-tau231, p-tau181, and Abeta42/Abeta40 were measured from blood samples. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between generalization performance and MTL Dynamic Network Flexibility (t = 3.372, beta = 0.280, p < 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between generalization performance and plasma p-tau231 (t = -3.324, beta = -0.265, p = 0.001) and p-tau181 (t = -2.408, beta = -0.192, p = 0.017). A significant negative correlation was found between plasma p-tau231 and MTL Dynamic Network Flexibility (t = -2.825, beta = -0.232, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of p-tau231 are associated with impaired generalization abilities and reduced dynamic network flexibility within the MTL. Plasma p-tau231 may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing cognitive decline and neural changes in cognitively unimpaired older African Americans.
