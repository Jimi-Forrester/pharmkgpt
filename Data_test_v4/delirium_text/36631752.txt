36631752|a|INTRODUCTION: AIMS Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease in which patients suffer from recurrent exacerbation. There are insufficient data measuring the effects of the resources employed before and during acute exacerbation on subsequent disease outcomes. This study aims to identify factors which lead to lengthened hospital stay. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of acute MG exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Exacerbations were identified using ICD-9/ICD-10 codes and considered the following variables: age and Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class at initial MG diagnosis, age and MGFA class at exacerbation, sex, thymectomy, cause of exacerbation, treatment regimen at time of exacerbation, inpatient treatment regimen, length of hospital stay (LOS), intubation, use of noninvasive ventilation, complications, and disposition. RESULTS: Seventy patients with 141 hospitalizations were identified. Crisis management characterized by intubation and plasmapheresis positively correlated with LOS (both p < .001). Almost 1/5 hospitalizations required intubation. Previous thymectomy negatively correlated with LOS (p < .05). In contrast, male sex correlated with longer LOS (p < .05). One-third of hospital stays were followed by discharge to a post-acute care facility, 7% home with home health, and 1 hospitalization resulted in death. DISCUSSION: Plasmapheresis, intubation, and male sex were associated with increased LOS in acute MG exacerbation. Intubation appears to be the strongest predictor of LOS. Those with previous thymectomy had shorter hospital stays. The role of thymectomy in the acute setting merits further analysis.
