33109792|a|The association with cardiac surgery with cognitive decline was first reported in the 1960s after the introduction of coronary artery surgery. The incidence in cognitive decline was thought to be more after cardiac surgery, especially with the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass. Anesthesia and surgery are both associated with cognitive decline but many other factors appear to contribute its genesis. On-pump surgery, microembolization during manipulation of the heart and great vessels, temperature changes, pH changes, and altered cerebral perfusion, during cardiac surgery, have all been blamed for this. Postoperative cognitive decline is associated with poor clinical outcomes and higher mortality. Several studies have been conducted in the last decade to determine the genesis of this malady. Current evidence is absolving cardiac surgery and anesthesia to be the primary causes per se of cognitive dysfunction.
