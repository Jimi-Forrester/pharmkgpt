37033675|t|Delusion of Pregnancy: A Case Report and Literature Review.
37033675|a|Delusion of pregnancy is defined as a persistent belief that one is pregnant despite concrete evidence to the contrary. Despite being reported as an isolated event, delusion of pregnancy has been reported in many patients with underlying psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, and other physiological disorders of mental function. This case study reports a case of a 44-year-old, drug-naive female with delusion of pregnancy affected by paranoid schizophrenia. Pharmacological treatments are frequently insufficient in controlling this condition and are often supplemented with adjunctive psychotherapy.
