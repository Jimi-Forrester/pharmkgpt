35163023|a|Smaller oligomeric chaperones of alpha-crystallins (alphaA- and alphaB-) have received increasing attention due to their improved therapeutic potential in preventing protein aggregating diseases. Our previous study suggested that deleting 54-61 residues from the N-terminal domain (NTD) of alphaB-crystallin (alphaBDelta54-61) decreases the oligomer size and increases the chaperone function. Several studies have also suggested that NTD plays a significant role in protein oligomerization and chaperone function. The current study was undertaken to assess the effect of deleting conserved 21-28 residues from the activated alphaBDelta54-61 (to get alphaBDelta21-28, Delta54-61) on the structure-function of recombinant alphaBDelta21-28, Delta54-61. The alphaBDelta21-28, Delta54-61 mutant shows an 80% reduction in oligomer size and 3- to 25-fold increases in chaperone activity against model substrates when compared to alphaB-WT. Additionally, the alphaB 21-28,  54-61 was found to prevent beta-amyloid (Abeta1-42) fibril formation in vitro and suppressed Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity in ARPE-19 cells in a more effective manner than seen with alphaB-WT or alphaB 54-61. Cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection studies with sodium iodate (SI) showed that the double mutant protein has higher anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative activities than the wild-type or alphaB 54-61 in oxidatively stressed cells. Our study shows that the residues 21-28 and 54-61 in alphaB-crystallin contribute to the oligomerization and modulate chaperone function. The deletion of conserved 21-28 residues further potentiates the activated alphaBDelta54-61. We propose that increased substrate affinity, altered subunit structure, and assembly leading to smaller oligomers could be the causative factors for the increased chaperone activity of alphaBDelta21-28, Delta54-61.
