36287105|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. When patients with PD undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for knee osteoarthritis, poorer knee function and poorer quality of life are obtained than in matched cohorts (MCs). However, the degree of patient satisfaction is usually high. The mean length of stay is 6.5% longer in patients with PD than in MCs. Compared with MCs, patients with PD undergoing TKA have a 44% higher risk of complications. In patients with PD, the overall complication rate is 26.3% compared with 10.5% in MCs; the periprosthetic joint infection rate is 6.5% in patients with PD vs 1.7% in MCs; and the periprosthetic fracture rate is 2.1% in patients with PD vs 1.7% in MCs. The 90-day readmission rate is 16.29% in patients with PD vs 12.66% in MCs. More flexion contractures occur in patients with PD. The rate of medical complications is 4.21% in patients with PD vs 1.24% in MCs, and the rate of implant-related complications is 5.09% in patients with PD vs 3.15% in MCs. At 5.3 years' mean follow-up, the need for revision surgery is 23.6%. The 10-year implant survival, taking revision of any of the components as an endpoint, is 89.7% in patients with PD vs 98.3% in MCs.
