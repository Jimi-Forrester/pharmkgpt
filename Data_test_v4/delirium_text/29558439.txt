29558439|a|From 1,2;3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-d-galactopyranose, a preliminary series of highly functionalized amino(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentanes was easily available. These amine-containing basic carbasugars featuring the d-galacto configuration are potent inhibitors of the GH20 beta-d-hexosaminidases probed and may bear potential as regulators of N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidase activities in vivo.
