35458111|t|Lower Blood Vitamin D Levels Are Associated with Depressive Symptoms in a Population of Older Adults in Kuwait: A Cross-Sectional Study.
35458111|a|Low serum vitamin D has been associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatry disorders. This study aimed to examine the association between vitamin D deficiency and depression in adults aged 65 years and older. This cross-sectional study was conducted in seven primary healthcare centers across Kuwait (November 2020 to June 2021). The participants (n = 237) had their serum vitamin D 25-(OH)-D concentrations (analyzed by LC-MS) classified as sufficient, >=75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL); insufficient, 50-75 nmol/L (20-30 ng/mL); or deficient, <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the 15-Item Geriatric Depression Scale (15-item GDS). The mean serum 25-OH-D levels (nmol/L) in volunteers with normal, mild, moderate, and severe depression were 100.0 +- 31.7, 71.2 +- 38.6, 58.6 +- 30.1 and 49.0 +- 6.93, respectively (p < 0.001). The participants in the vitamin D sufficiency group were significantly less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms (88.2%) than patients with mild (36%) and moderate (21%) depression (p < 0.001). Ordinal logistic regression showed that vitamin D deficiency (OR = 19.7, 95% CI 5.60, 74.86, p < 0.001) and insufficiency (OR = 6.40, 95% CI 2.20, 19.91, p < 0.001) were associated with higher odds of having depressive symptoms. A low serum vitamin D level is a significant predictor of symptoms of depression among older individuals.
