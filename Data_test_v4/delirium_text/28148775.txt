28148775|a|With the consideration of the broad involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of molecular networks in the brain, it is not surprising that miRNA dysregulation causes neurodegeneration in animal models. miRNA profiling in the human brain has revealed miR-132 as one of the most severely down-regulated miRNAs at the intermediate and late Braak stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders. Suppression of miR-132 aggravates multiple layers of pathology at the molecular and functional level. We describe the potential therapeutic implications of these findings and suggest miRNA targeting or replacement as a realistic multi-hit, therapeutic strategy for AD.
