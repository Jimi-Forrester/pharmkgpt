36115098|t|Self-supervised learning of neighborhood embedding for longitudinal MRI.
36115098|a|In recent years, several deep learning models recommend first to represent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as latent features before performing a downstream task of interest (such as classification or regression). The performance of the downstream task generally improves when these latent representations are explicitly associated with factors of interest. For example, we derived such a representation for capturing brain aging by applying self-supervised learning to longitudinal MRIs and then used the resulting encoding to automatically identify diseases accelerating the aging of the brain. We now propose a refinement of this representation by replacing the linear modeling of brain aging with one that is consistent in local neighborhoods in the latent space. Called Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE), we derive an encoding so that neighborhoods are age-consistent (i.e., brain MRIs of different subjects with similar brain ages are in close proximity of each other) and progression-consistent, i.e., the latent space is defined by a smooth trajectory field where each trajectory captures changes in brain ages between a pair of MRIs extracted from a longitudinal sequence. To make the problem computationally tractable, we further propose a strategy for mini-batch sampling so that the resulting local neighborhoods accurately approximate the ones that would be defined based on the whole cohort. We evaluate LNE on three different downstream tasks: (1) to predict chronological age from T1-w MRI of 274 healthy subjects participating in a study at SRI International; (2) to distinguish Normal Control (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI) from progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI) based on T1-w MRI of 632 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and (3) to distinguish no-to-low from moderate-to-heavy alcohol drinkers based on fractional anisotropy derived from diffusion tensor MRIs of 764 adolescents recruited by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Across the three data sets, the visualization of the smooth trajectory vector fields and superior accuracy on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information related to brain aging, which could help study the impact of substance use and neurodegenerative disorders.
