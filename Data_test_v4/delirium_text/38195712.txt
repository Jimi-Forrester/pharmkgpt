38195712|t|Inflammasomes in neurological disorders - mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
38195712|a|Inflammasomes are molecular scaffolds that are activated by damage-associated and pathogen-associated molecular patterns and form a key element of innate immune responses. Consequently, the involvement of inflammasomes in several diseases that are characterized by inflammatory processes, such as multiple sclerosis, is widely appreciated. However, many other neurological conditions, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, sepsis-associated encephalopathy and neurological sequelae of COVID-19, all involve persistent inflammation in the brain, and increasing evidence suggests that inflammasome activation contributes to disease progression in these conditions. Understanding the biology and mechanisms of inflammasome activation is, therefore, crucial for the development of inflammasome-targeted therapies for neurological conditions. In this Review, we present the current evidence for and understanding of inflammasome activation in neurological diseases and discuss current and potential interventional strategies that target inflammasome activation to mitigate its pathological consequences.
