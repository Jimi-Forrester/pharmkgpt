36655459|t|Experimental Approaches to Diabetes Mellitus.
36655459|a|One of the most common health problems today, diabetes is a serious, chronic, and complex disease characterized by high blood glucose levels. Nowadays, experimental diabetes models are being developed to study existing diabetes in depth, to improve diabetes medications, or to develop new medications. The protocols developed to date to create an experimental diabetes model are finalized in different time intervals and depending on various factors. With these models, which can be designed in vivo and in vitro, a picture similar to type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be created. In this review, we aimed to present the methodology, advantages, and disadvantages of all currently used experimental diabetes models in the light of current literature.
