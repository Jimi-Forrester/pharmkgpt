30979338|t|APH-1A Component of gamma-Secretase Forms an Internal Water and Ion-Containing Cavity.
30979338|a|Anterior pharynx-defective 1A (APH-1A) is a seven transmembrane component of gamma-secretase (GS), an aspartyl protease enzyme involved in the production of toxic amyloid-beta peptides in Alzheimer's disease patients. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the enzyme complex revealed a central cavity in its APH-1A component, similar to water-containing cavities in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this work, we performed molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling simulations to understand the role of the APH-1A cavity in the GS complex. Our results suggest that APH-1A is able to store water molecules in its inner cavity and transport some of them between cell spaces. Additionally, APH-1A allows the influx of extracellular cations into a central hydrophilic cavity but cannot transport them into the intracellular space. Overall, this study seeks to describe an alternative APH-1A function in GS besides its complex stabilization role and provide novel approaches to understand the functioning of the GS enzyme.
