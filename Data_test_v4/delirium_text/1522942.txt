1522942|a|The 24-h growth hormone secretory pattern and GH response to growth hormone releasing hormone, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and the somatostatin-analogue SMS 201-995 were evaluated in 9 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 9 age- and body body-matched control subjects. The secretory profile did not differentiate between patients and controls. Both secreted the largest amount of GH during the early nighthours between 22.00-02.00, whereas the majority of daytime GH levels were below the assay's detection limit (0.4 ng/ml). No difference was found in GH response to GHRH between patients and controls. All subjects showed significantly enhanced GH secretion after GHRH. Dividing the patients into two groups according to age-of-onset (less than 60 years greater than), there was a trend toward larger GH responses to GHRH for the early-onset group. No other parameter differentiated the groups. GH levels after clonidine were blunted in all subjects but one AD patient, probably due to an age-dependent attenuation frequently observed in subjects over 45 years of age. Finally, the administration of the somatostatin-analogue did not render conclusive results, since spontaneous decline of GH concentration was already beginning 2 hours before the drug was given and continued steadily throughout the observation period. In conclusion, patients with only mild to moderate degree of Alzheimer's disease have no prominent changes in GH regulation.
