35408585|t|Tocotrienols Attenuate White Adipose Tissue Accumulation and Improve Serum Cholesterol Concentration in High-Fat Diet-Treated Mice.
35408585|a|Tocotrienols (T3s), which are vitamin E homologs, have not only antioxidant function but also inhibitory effects on body weight gain and hepatic lipid droplet accumulation. However, the mechanisms of the anti-obesity effects of T3s are not yet understood. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet in the presence or absence of T3s. Treatment with T3s inhibited white adipose tissue accumulation and elevation of serum cholesterol concentrations. Additionally, to clarify the relationship between obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction and the neuroprotective effect of T3s, cognitive function, brain oxidation, and protein expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is strongly involved in neuronal growth and differentiation, were measured. Although mice behaviors were improved by oral T3 intake, there were no significant differences in brain oxidation levels and BDNF expression. These results suggest that T3s attenuate obesity via inhibition of body fat and serum cholesterol increase.
