37836461|t|Nutritional Risk of Candidates for Simultaneous Pancreatic-Kidney Transplantation-A Narrative Review.
37836461|a|INTRODUCTION: Not much is known about the significance of nutritional status and support in transplant surgery, least of all in simultaneous pancreatic and kidney transplantation. Malnutrition in the context of simultaneous pancreatic-kidney transplantation seems to be complex and a still poorly investigated problem. Since SPKTX is highly qualified and also has a small volume procedure, it is difficult to obtain data from large cohorts of patients. The aim of this article is to gather existing evidence and information about the subject, as well as to elicit some questions and goals for the future. METHODS: We searched through the Pub-Med database using the keywords "pancreas and kidney transplantation" combined with "nutritional risk", "nutritional status", "malnutrition", "nutritional intervention", and "frailty", finding a total of 4103 matching results. We then narrowed it down to articles written in English with the full text available. We also researched through the references of articles most accurately matching our researched terms. RESULTS: There are numerous tools that have been investigated for the screening of malnutrition, such as the NRI index, PNI index, NLR, SGA scale, and NRS-2002 scale, each of which proved to be of some use in predicting patient outcomes in different surgical settings. Since all of them differed in components and assessed parameters and, in the absence of more sensitive or infallible indicators, the most reasonable approach seems to evaluate them jointly. CONCLUSION: It is important to underline the necessity of nutritional screening and the subsequent introduction of adequate therapy while awaiting transplantation in an attempt to improve results. Considering the complexity of surgical procedures and the severity of underlying diseases with their intense metabolic components, the patient's nutritional status seems to significantly influence results. Consequently, nutritional risk assessments should be a part of the routine care of patients qualified for transplantation.
