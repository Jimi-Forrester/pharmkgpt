37193699|a|Loosely bound iron, due to its contribution to oxidative stress and inflammation, has become an important therapeutic target for many diseases. A water-soluble chitosan-based polymer exhibiting both antioxidant and chelating properties due to the dual functionalization with DOTAGA and DFO has been developed to extract this iron therefore preventing its catalytic production of reactive oxygen species. This functionalized chitosan was shown to have stronger antioxidant properties compared to conventional chitosan, improved iron chelating properties compared to the clinical therapy, deferiprone, and provided promising results for its application and improved metal extraction within a conventional 4 h hemodialysis session with bovine plasma.
