39143032|a|RNA-sensing pathways play a pivotal role in host defense against pathogenic infections to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, even in the absence of infection, certain endogenous self-RNAs still serve as the activators of RNA-sensing pathways. The inappropriate activation of RNA sensors by self-ligands leads to systemic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we summarize current findings on the sterile activation of RNA sensors, as well as its implications in autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases, and therapeutics.
