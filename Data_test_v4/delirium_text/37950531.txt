37950531|t|Psychiatric disorders associated with PCSK9 inhibitors: A real-world, pharmacovigilance study.
37950531|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between Protein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin Type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) and psychiatric adverse events (AEs) remains unclear due to the limitations of clinical trials. In this study, PCSK9i-related psychiatric AEs were realistically observed and systematically summarized in the real world by data mining the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS). METHOD: Total AEs between the third quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2023 were obtained from FAERS. Psychiatric AEs were identified using disproportionality analysis and clinical prioritization of signals using a rating scale, followed by univariate logistic regression to explore factors influencing psychiatric AEs. RESULTS: Psychiatric AEs accounted for 6.7% of the total number of PCSK9i reports. Eighteen psychiatric AEs were defined as PCSK9i-related psychiatric adverse events (ppAEs) (lower 95% CI of both ROR >1 and IC025  > 0). The median age of ppAE reports was 68 years, and female patients accounted for 22.67% of reports, including 41.40% of reports with a serious outcome. Eleven (61.11%) and seven (38.89%) ppAEs were classified as weak and moderate clinical priority, respectively. The median time to onset of ppAEs was 149 and 196 days after treatment with evolocumab and alirocumab, respectively. Patients weighing >=80 kg were 1.59 times more likely to experience ppAEs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study facilitate the prioritization of psychiatric AE signals by healthcare professionals with the goal of mitigating the risk of PCSK9i-related psychiatric AEs. However, as an exploratory study, our findings need to be confirmed in large-scale prospective studies.
