36716673|a|Disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) leads to inflammatory cell infiltration and neural cell death, thus, contributing to poor functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Previous studies have suggested that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase, is abundantly expressed in endothelial cells and promotes endothelial homeostasis. However, the role of SIRT1 in BSCB function after SCI remains poorly defined. Here, we report that SIRT1 is highly expressed in spinal cord endothelial cells, and its expression significantly decreases after SCI. Using endothelial cell-specific SIRT1 knockout mice, we observed that endothelial cell-specific knockout of SIRT1 aggravated BSCB disruption, thus, resulting in widespread inflammation, neural cell death and poor functional recovery after SCI. In contrast, activation of SIRT1 by the agonist SRT1720 had beneficial effects. In vitro, knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated IL-1beta-induced endothelial barrier disruption in bEnd.3 cells, whereas overexpression of SIRT1 was protective. Using RNA-seq and IP/MS analysis, we identified p66Shc, a redox protein, as the potential target of SIRT1. Further studies demonstrated that SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates p66Shc, thereby attenuating oxidative stress and protecting endothelial barrier function. Overall, our results indicate that SIRT1 decreases endothelial ROS production and attenuates BSCB disruption by deacetylating p66Shc after SCI, and suggest that SIRT1 activation has potential as a therapeutic approach to promote functional recovery against BSCB disruption following SCI.
