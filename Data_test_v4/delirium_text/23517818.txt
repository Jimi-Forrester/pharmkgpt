23517818|a|OBJECTIVE: The safety of concurrent mood stabilizers during the course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is yet to be clearly established. Delirium with concurrent administration of ECT and lithium carbonate is described in this case report. METHODS: A 30-year-old male with a past history of significant head injury developed delirium during the course of bitemporal ECT. RESULTS: The clinical picture and the details of the cognitive impairment have been discussed in the report with a focus on relationship between the lithium carbonate administration and the concurrent ECT. CONCLUSION: Patients with preexisting organic brain damage could be prone to develop the cognitive adverse effect while on a combination of lithium and ECT. Possible interactions between lithium and ECT need further systematic evaluation.
