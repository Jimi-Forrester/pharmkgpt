35836717|a|INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with various neuropsychiatric manifestations. This study reports on patients with COVID-19 who were referred to the consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatry services in Qatar and compares the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of those diagnosed with delirium versus other psychiatric diagnoses. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the first 100 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were referred to the CL services. RESULTS: Within the total cohort (n=100), most patients (92%) were male, and the mean age was 46 years. About 27% of patients had asymptomatic COVID-19, 35% had a past psychiatric history, and 48% reported pandemic related psychosocial stress. Delirium was the most common psychiatric diagnosis (n=29), followed by acute stress reaction/adjustment disorder, depression, mania, anxiety, non-affective psychosis, and dementia. Among patients with delirium, agitation was the most common symptom (76%), 86% were treated with psychotropic medications, and 17% died. Higher age, longer hospital stays, lower oxygen saturation, lower lymphocytic count, and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) values were significantly associated with delirium versus other psychiatric diagnoses. Higher age and lower oxygen saturations predicted delirium. CONCLUSION: Delirium was associated with a range of clinical variables and had significant mortality, despite the relatively young age of the patients. COVID-19 should be considered in patients presenting with delirium. Finally, early identification and management of delirium should be integral to COVID-19 protocols.
