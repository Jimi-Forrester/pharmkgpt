35890196|a|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after exposure to traumatic events and is characterized by overwhelming fear and anxiety. Disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders, including anxiety, PTSD, and major depressive disorders. Studies have demonstrated the relationship between the HPA axis response and stress vulnerability, indicating that the HPA axis regulates the immune system, fear memory, and neurotransmission. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), sertraline and paroxetine, are the only drugs that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD. However, SSRIs require long treatment times and are associated with lower response and remission rates; therefore, additional pharmacological interventions are required. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies ameliorate HPA axis disturbances through regulation of gut dysbiosis, insomnia, chronic stress, and depression. We have described the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which the HPA axis is involved in PTSD pathogenesis and have evaluated the potential of herbal medicines for PTSD treatment. Herbal medicines could comprise a good therapeutic strategy for HPA axis regulation and can simultaneously improve PTSD-related symptoms. Finally, herbal medicines may lead to novel biologically driven approaches for the treatment and prevention of PTSD.
