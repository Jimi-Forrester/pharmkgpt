25051506|a|Neural stem cells (NSCs) are important pluripotent stem cells, which have potential applications in cell replacement therapy. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) have been demonstrated to exert a marked impact on the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. The effects of NGF, BDNF, and BDNF combined with NGF on NSC neuronal differentiation and the possible mechanisms for these effects were investigated in this study. An adherent monolayer culture was employed to obtain highly homogeneous NSCs. The cells were divided into four groups: Control, NGF, BDNF and combination (BDNF + NGF) groups. Neuron differentiation was examined using immunocytochemistry and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) levels were analyzed using western blotting. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of the HES1, HES5, MASH1, NGN1 and NeuroD transcription factors at different time intervals following neurotrophin-induced differentiation. NGF and BDNF were observed to induce NSC neuronal differentiation, and beta-tubulin III-positive cells and p-ERK expression levels were highest in the NGF + BDNF combination group at all time points. The proportion of beta-tubulin III-positive neurons in each group was associated with the expression levels of MASH1, NGN1 and NeuroD in the group. In conclusion, BDNF combined with NGF significantly improved NSC neuronal differentiation, which may provide support for the practical application of NSCs in neurodegenerative diseases.
