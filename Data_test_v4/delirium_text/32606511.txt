32606511|a|CONTEXT: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by traditional motor features. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are also seen in PD, which inevitably emerge through the disease progression and are often under-recognized and untargeted. AIMS: We studied the prevalence of NMS in PD and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study from January 2017 to July 2017 of PD patients (n = 100) was done. NMS and HRQoL are measured using NMS scoring scale; PD questionnaire-39 and Hoehn and Yahr scale, respectively. Motor symptoms were assessed using scales for outcome in Parkinson's disease (SCoPA) - motor scoring scale. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics calculated for NMS' prevalence. Continuous variables were assessed by two-tailed t-test and discrete and categorical variables by chi-square test. Multiple linear regression analysis was done among scoring scales to identify the influence on 39-item Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39) scoring scale. All statistical data collected are analyzed with SSPS software version- 20 for windows. RESULTS: In 100 study population, 66 were males and 34 females. The mean age was 68.35 years and median onset of duration of PD was 3.49 with 64.6% on treatment. Fatigue, pain, and lightheadedness were more prevalent NMS with 78%, 75%, and 69%, respectively. With regression analysis, strongest predictor was NMSS score (P = 0.000), with each unit increase, it is associated with nearly 0.65 increase in PDQ-39 score. CONCLUSION: Though motor symptoms define the disease, NMS have a larger impact on HRQoL in PD and on caregiver's life. Understanding the pattern and effect of NMS is needed for targeted treatment strategies.
