37652560|a|This study investigated the molecular spectrum of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed Abeta deposition in the temporal cortex and striatum in 116 autopsies, including Lewy body disease (LBD; N = 51), multiple system atrophy (MSA; N = 10), frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP; N = 16), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; N = 39). The LBD group exhibited the most Abeta deposition in the temporal cortex and striatum (90/76%, respectively), followed by PSP (69/28%), FTLD-TDP (50/25%), and the MSA group (50/10%). We conducted immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies targeting eight Abeta epitopes in the LBD and PSP groups. Immunohistochemical findings were evaluated semi-quantitatively and quantitatively using digital pathology. Females with LBD exhibited significantly more severe Abeta deposition, particularly Abeta42 and Abeta43 , along with significantly more severe tau pathology. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of all Abeta peptides in the LBD group revealed an association with the APOE-epsilon4 genotypes. No significant differences were observed between males and females in the PSP group. Finally, we compared striatal Abeta deposition in cases with LBD (N = 15), AD without alpha-synuclein pathology (N = 6), and PSP (N = 5). There were no differences in the pan-Abeta antibody (6F/3D)-immunolabeled deposition burden among the three groups, but the deposition burden of peptides with high aggregation capacity, especially Abeta43 , was significantly higher in the AD and LBD groups than in the PSP group. Furthermore, considerable heterogeneity was observed in the composition of Abeta peptides on a case-by-case basis in the AD and LBD groups, whereas it was relatively uniform in the PSP group. Cluster analysis further supported these findings. Our data suggest that the type of concomitant proteinopathies influences the spectrum of Abeta deposition, impacted also by sex and APOE genotypes.
