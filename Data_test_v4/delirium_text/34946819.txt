34946819|t|Genome-Wide RNA-Sequencing Reveals Massive Circular RNA Expression Changes of the Neurotransmission Genes in the Rat Brain after Ischemia-Reperfusion.
34946819|a|Ischemic brain stroke is one of the most serious and socially significant diseases. In addition to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), encoding protein, the study of regulatory RNAs in ischemic has exceptional importance for the development of new strategies for neuroprotection. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have a closed structure, predominantly brain-specific expression, and remain highly promising targets of research. They can interact with microRNAs (miRNAs), diminish their activity and thereby inhibit miRNA-mediated repression of mRNA. Genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis of the subcortical structures of the rat brain containing an ischemic damage focus and penumbra area revealed 395 circRNAs changed their expression significantly at 24 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model (tMCAO) conditions. Furthermore, functional annotation revealed their association with neuroactive signaling pathways. It was found that about a third of the differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) originate from genes whose mRNA levels also changed at 24 h after tMCAO. The other DECs originate from genes encoding non-regulated mRNAs under tMCAO conditions. In addition, bioinformatic analysis predicted a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network which was associated with the neurotransmission signaling regulation. Our results show that such circRNAs can persist as potential miRNA sponges for the protection of mRNAs of neurotransmitter genes. The results expanded our views about the neurotransmission regulation in the rat brain after ischemia-reperfusion with circRNA action.
