39206485|t|In-silico Studies and Antioxidant and Neuroprotective Assessment of Microencapsulated Celecoxib against Scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's Disease.
39206485|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an enervating and chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Celecoxib (CXB) possesses efficacious antioxidants and has neuroprotective, anti- inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. However, the poor bioavailability of CXB limits its therapeutic utility. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the microencapsulated celecoxib MCXB) for neuroprotection. METHODOLOGY: CXB was screened by molecular docking study using AutoDock (version 5.2), and the following proteins, such as 4EY7, 2HM1, 2Z5X, and 1PBQ were selected for predicting its neuroprotective effect. Scopolamine 20 mg/kg/day for approximately 7 days was administered to albino rats. Pure CXB 100 mg/kg/- day and 200 mg/kg/day, and MCXB 100 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day were administered, respectively. Further, to assess the oxidative stress, the nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated using chemical methods. The neurochemical biomarkers like AChE, glutamate, and dopamine were evaluated using the ELISA method. Further, the histopathology of brain cells was carried out to assess the neuro-regeneration and neurodegeneration of the neurons. RESULTS: There was a significant binding interaction of CXB (score -6.3, -6.5, -5.1, -9.1) and donepezil (score- 5.5, -7.6, -7.0, and -8.6) with AchE (4EY7), beta-secretase (2HM1, monoamine oxidase (2Z5X), and glutamate (1PBQ), respectively. MCXB-treated rats (100 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day) showed increased SOD levels (p < 0.001), whereas NO, catalase, and LPO levels were significantly (p < 0.001) decreased as compared to scopolamine-treated rats. Further, MCXB-treated rats showed a modulatory effect in the level of dopamine and AchE. However, the glutamate level was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased. CONCLUSION: In addition to that, histopathological examination of the hippocampus part showed remarkable improvement in brain cells. So, the findings of the results revealed that MCXB, in a dose-dependent manner, showed a neuroprotective effect against scopolamine-induced AD. This effect may be attributed to the activation of cholinergic pathways.
