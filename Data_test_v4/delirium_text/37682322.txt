37682322|t|Commentaries: Lecanemab: pioneering the way as the first approved drug for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
37682322|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and neuronal abnormalities. Current therapies address symptoms without altering disease progression. Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid antibody, binds to amyloid-beta (Abeta) protofibrils. Phase II trials revealed dose-dependent amyloid clearance and reduced clinical decline. Phase III trials demonstrated cognitive benefits with potential adverse events. Full FDA approval was granted for lecanemab due to its ability to eliminate toxic brain amyloids. However, longer trials are needed to assess its efficacy and safety. While lecanemab marks a significant advancement, further breakthroughs are essential for effective AD treatment.
