22527776|a|Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and frontotemporal dementias (FTD) are common and their clinical differential diagnosis may be complicated by overlapping symptoms, which is why biomarkers may have an important role to play. Cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) Abeta2-42 and 1-42 have been shown to be similarly decreased in AD, but 1-42 did not display sufficient specificity for exclusion of other dementias from AD. The objective of the present study was to clarify the diagnostic value of Abeta2-42 peptides for the differential diagnosis of AD from FTD. For this purpose, 20 non-demented disease controls (NDC), 22 patients with AD and 17 with FTD were comparatively analysed by a novel sequential aminoterminally and carboxyterminally specific immunoprecipitation protocol with subsequent Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, allowing the quantification of peptides 1-38(ox), 2-40 and 2-42 along with Abeta 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 1-40(ox) and 1-42. CSF Abeta1-42 was decreased in AD as compared to NDC, but not to FTD. In a subgroup of the patients analyzed, the decrease of Abeta2-42 in AD was evident as compared to both NDC and FTD. Abeta1-38 was decreased in FTD as compared to NDC and AD. For differentiating AD from FTD, Abeta1-42 demonstrated sufficient diagnostic accuracies only when combined with Abeta1-38. Abeta2-42 yielded diagnostic accuracies of over 85 % as a single marker. These accuracy figures could be improved by combining Abeta2-42 to Abeta1-38. Abeta2-42 seems to be a promising biomarker for differentiating AD from other degenerative dementias, such as FTD.
