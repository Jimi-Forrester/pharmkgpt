33051948|a|Delirium may lead to poor outcomes in hospitalized older adults, and sleep deprivation may contribute to its pathogenesis. Thus, we sought to measure sleep duration and fragmentation using wrist-worn actigraphy in older, hospitalized patients with and without delirium, and to determine if actigraphy-based parameters could be used to predict delirium prior to clinical recognition. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a recent, randomized clinical trial aimed at preventing inpatient delirium. Participants (n = 70) were aged >= 65 years admitted to an internal medicine service. Delirium was defined by the Confusion Assessment Method, or altered mental status identified by a clinician. Sleep measurements were actigraphy-based, and included total sleep time, median sleep bout duration and other measures of sleep fragmentation. We found that total sleep duration was similar between patients with (n = 17) and without (n = 53) delirium (mean 384.9 +- SD 162.7 versus mean 456.6 +- SD 135.8 min; p = .081). Mean sleep bout times were shorter in delirious versus never-delirious patients (median 6.1 [interquartile range 4.3-8.9] versus 7.9 [interquartile range 5.7-11.3] min, p = .048). Patients with delirium had more short sleep bouts (< 10 min) and fewer longer sleep bouts (> 30 min) compared with those without delirium. Increased sleep fragmentation was present prior to the clinical recognition of delirium. Overall, delirium was associated with increased sleep fragmentation detected by actigraphy, and sleep fragmentation might be useful as a biomarker for delirium prediction in the future.
