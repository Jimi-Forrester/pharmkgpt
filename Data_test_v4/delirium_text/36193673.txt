36193673|a|BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with mental health problems are more predisposed to cardiovascular disease, including cardiac surgery. Nevertheless, health outcomes after cardiac surgery for patients with mental health problems as a discrete group are unknown. This study examined the association between secondary care mental health service use and postoperative health outcomes following cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational research, utilizing data from a large South London mental healthcare supplier linked to national hospitalization data. OPCS-4 codes were applied to classify cardiac surgery. Health results were compared between those individuals with a mental health disorder diagnosis from secondary care and other local residents, including the length of hospital stay (LOS), inpatient mortality, and 30-day emergency hospital readmission. RESULTS: Twelve thousand three hundred and eighty-four patients received cardiac surgery, including 1,481 with a mental disorder diagnosis. Patients with mental health diagnosis were at greater risk of emergency admissions for cardiac surgery (odds ratio [OR] 1.60; 1.43, 1.79), longer index LOS (incidence rate ratio 1.28; 1.26, 1.30), and at higher risk of 30-day emergency readmission (OR 1.53; 1.31, 1.78). Those who underwent pacemaker insertion and major open surgery had worse postoperative outcomes during index surgery hospital admission while those who had major endovascular surgery had worse health outcomes subsequent 30-day emergency hospital readmission. CONCLUSION: People with a mental health disorder diagnosis undertaking cardiac surgery have significantly worse health outcomes. Personalized guidelines and policies to manage preoperative risk factors require consideration and evaluation.
