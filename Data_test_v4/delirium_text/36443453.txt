36443453|a|The physiological functions of endogenous amyloid-beta (Abeta), which plays important role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have not been paid enough attention. Here, we review the multiple physiological effects of Abeta, particularly in regulating synaptic transmission, and the possible mechanisms, in order to decipher the real characters of Abeta under both physiological and pathological conditions. Some worthy studies have shown that the deprivation of endogenous Abeta gives rise to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficiency, while the moderate elevation of this peptide enhances long term potentiation and leads to neuronal hyperexcitability. In this review, we provide a new view for understanding the role of Abeta in AD pathophysiology from the perspective of physiological meaning.
