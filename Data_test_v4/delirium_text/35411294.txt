35411294|a|Introduction:  Neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by loss of neuronal function and integrity. Stem cell therapy is utilized to regenerate neurons to repair the damaged area. Regeneration potential of stem cells can be enhanced by using chemicals with known bioactive properties. In the current study, two bioactive compounds, alpha-pinene (AP) and thymoquinone (TQ) were explored for their neuronal differentiation potential of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Methods:  MSCs were isolated, cultured and characterized immunocytochemically for the presence of specific surface markers. Optimized concentrations of both compounds (20 microM AP and 12 microM TQ) as determined by MTT assay, were used to treat MSCs in separate and combined groups. All groups were assessed for the presence of neuronal, astroglial, and germ layer markers through qPCR. Neuronal and glial protein expression were analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Results:  Both compounds alone and in combination induced differentiation in MSCs with significant gene expression of neuronal markers i.e. neuron specific enolase (NSE), nestin, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), neurofilament light chain (Nefl) and Tau, and astroglial marker i.e. glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). AP treated group also showed significant upregulation of endodermal and mesodermal markers indicating transition of ectoderm towards the other two germ layers. Conclusion:  This study concludes that AP and TQ potentially differentiate MSCs into neuronal and astroglial lineages. However, AP treated group followed germ layer transition. Expression of neuronal as well as glial markers indicate that the differentiated neurons are at the neuroprogenitor stage and can be potential candidates for cellular therapeutics against neurodegenerative disorders.
