39213385|a|Mitochondria are essential organelles known to serve broad functions, including in cellular metabolism, calcium buffering, signaling pathways and the regulation of apoptotic cell death. Maintaining the integrity of the outer (OMM) and inner mitochondrial membranes (IMM) is vital for mitochondrial health. Cardiolipin (CL), a unique dimeric glycerophospholipid, is the signature lipid of energy-converting membranes. It plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function, stabilizing protein complexes and facilitating efficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) whilst regulating cytochrome c release from mitochondria. CL is especially enriched in the IMM and at sites of contact between the OMM and IMM. Disorders of protein misfolding, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, involve amyloidogenic peptides like amyloid-beta, tau and alpha-synuclein, which form metastable toxic oligomeric species that interact with biological membranes. Electrophysiological studies have shown that these oligomers form ion-conducting nanopores in membranes mimicking the IMM's phospholipid composition. Poration of mitochondrial membranes disrupts the ionic balance, causing osmotic swelling, loss of the voltage potential across the IMM, release of pro-apoptogenic factors, and leads to cell death. The interaction between CL and amyloid oligomers appears to favour their membrane insertion and pore formation, directly implicating CL in amyloid toxicity. Additionally, pore formation in mitochondrial membranes is not limited to amyloid proteins and peptides; other biological peptides, as diverse as the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, gasdermin proteins, cobra venom cardiotoxins and bacterial pathogenic toxins, have all been described to punch holes in mitochondria, contributing to cell death processes. Collectively, these findings underscore the vulnerability of mitochondria and the involvement of CL in various pathogenic mechanisms, emphasizing the need for further research on targeting CL-amyloid interactions to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction.
