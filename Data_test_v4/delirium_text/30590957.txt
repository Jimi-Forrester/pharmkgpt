OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the caregivers of persons with memory impairment or Alzheimer's disease know if their persons are able to recall their own drugs and medical histories. METHOD: Persons with prodromal or probable AD (persons with AD) and their caregivers who were visiting our medical school's neurology and internal medicine clinics for routine follow-up care were recruited on the days of their appointments. Sixty-four caregiver-person with AD dyads were recruited. We first asked the caregivers to predict the ability of their persons with AD to answer questions about their drugs and medical histories. We then asked the persons with AD the questions to determine the accuracy of their caregivers' predictions. RESULTS: Considering the caregivers of those with Mini-Mental State Exam scores >=24, 41% incorrectly predicted whether their persons with AD could recall the number of drugs they were taking, 24% incorrectly predicted whether they could recall the names of the drugs, and 34% incorrectly predicted whether they could recall why they were taking the drugs. Most of the caregivers' errors were overestimations. As expected, the persons with AD themselves had much difficulty in answering the questions; only 30% could recall the number of drugs they were taking, only 14% could recall the names of the drugs, and only 16% could recall why they were taking the drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Many caregivers of persons with memory impairment or AD are unaware of their persons' inability to recall their drugs and medical histories. Particularly concerning is the relatively high frequency of caregiver overestimations of the abilities of their persons with AD, which highlights a safety concern and presents an opportunity for caregiver education.
