36834883|t|The Multifaceted Role and Regulation of Nlrp3 Inflammasome in Colitis-Associated Colo-Rectal Cancer: A Systematic Review.
36834883|a|Colitis-associated colo-rectal cancer remains the leading cause of mortality in inflammatory bowel diseases, with inflammation remaining one of the bridging points between the two pathologies. The NLRP3 inflammasome complex plays an important role in innate immunity; however, its misregulation can be responsible for the apparition of various pathologies such as ulcerative colitis. Our review focuses on the potential pathways of upregulation or downregulation of the NLRP3 complex, in addition to evaluating its role in the current clinical setting. Eighteen studies highlighted the potential pathways of NLRP3 complex regulation as well as its role in the metastatic process in colo-rectal cancer, with promising results. Further research is, however, needed in order to validate the results in a clinical setting.
