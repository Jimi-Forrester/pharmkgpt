37711255|a|This critical review explores the review material on physical activity combined with cognitive stimulation interventions in older adults with cognitive impairment and/or dementia. A critical, systematic, review of the review method was used, considering four electronic databases: WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and the COCHRANE ELECTRONIC LIBRARY. The search terms "exercise," "physical activity," "cognitive impairment," "dementia," and "systematic review" were used. All available reviews were marked against predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were 32 reviews that met the inclusion criteria. A combination of various types of training and aerobic exercises were the most frequently reported interventions; meanwhile, dual task training programs (combining physical exercise with cognitive stimulation), functional training programs along with exercises combination, aerobic exercise as well as strength, stretching, or balance workouts were also reported. The evidence is compelling; exercise can improve physical health by ensuring cognitive, psychological, and behavioral benefits. Overall, exercise can improve the physical and mental health of people living with dementia: there is sufficient evidence to recommend multimodal exercise.
