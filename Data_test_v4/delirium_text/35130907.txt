35130907|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive ability. Exosomes derived from bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-exos) are extracellular vesicles that can execute the function of bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Given the versatile therapeutic potential of BMSC and BMSC-exos, especially their neuroprotective effect, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect of BMSC-exos on AD-like behavioral dysfunction in mice and explore the possible molecular mechanism. METHODS: BMSC-exos were extracted from the supernatant of cultured mouse BMSCs, which were isolated from the femur and tibia of adult C57BL/6 mice, purified and sorted via flow cytometry, and cultured in vitro. BMSC-exos were identified via transmission electron microscopy, and typical marker proteins of exosomes were also detected via Western blot. A sporadic AD mouse model was established by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Six weeks later, BMSC-exos were administered via lateral ventricle injection or caudal vein injection lasting five consecutive days, and the control mice were intracerebroventricularly administered an equal volume of solvent. Behavioral performance was observed via the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPM), novel object recognition test (NOR), Y maze test (Y-maze), and tail suspension test (TST). The mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus were measured via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. Moreover, the protein expression of Abeta1-42, BACE, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, GFAP, p-Tau (Ser396), Tau5, synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1), synapsin-1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus was detected using Western blot, and the expression of GFAP, IBA1, Abeta1-42 and DCX in the hippocampus was measured via immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Lateral ventricle administration, but not caudal vein injection of BMSC-exos improved AD-like behaviors in the STZ-injected mouse model, as indicated by the increased number of rearing, increased frequency to the central area, and increased duration and distance traveled in the central area in the OFT, and improved preference index of the novel object in the NOR. Moreover, the hyperactivation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus of the model mice was inhibited after treatment with BMSC-exos via lateral ventricle administration, accompanied by the reduced expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Abeta1-42, and p-Tau and upregulated protein expression of synapse-related proteins and BDNF. Furthermore, the results of the Pearson test showed that the preference index of the novel object in the NOR was positively correlated with the hippocampal expression of BDNF, but negatively correlated with the expression of GFAP, IBA1, and IL-1beta. Apart from a positive correlation between the hippocampal expression of BDNF and Syt-1, BDNF abundance was found to be negatively correlated with markers of glial activation and the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, Abeta1-42, and p-Tau, which are characteristic neuropathological features of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral ventricle administration, but not caudal vein injection of BMSC-exos, can improve AD-like behavioral performance in STZ-injected mice, the mechanism of which might be involved in the regulation of glial activation and its associated neuroinflammation and BDNF-related neuropathological changes in the hippocampus.
