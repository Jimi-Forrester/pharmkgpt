Electrochemical immunosensor (EI) is a method that is in the spotlight in the medical and bioanalytical fields due to its portability and field usability. Here, we quantified four AD specific biomarkers using EIs based on enzyme immunoassay. We selected and developed quantitative methods for the biomarkers using screen-printed gold electrodes. For three biomarkers, quantification was performed using competition immunoassays in which antigen-antibody premix mixtures were applied to antigen-immobilized electrodes and the limit of detection (LOD) values were secured, 1.20 ng/ml, 1.30 ng/ml, and 1.74 ng/ml, respectively. For the other, a sandwich immunoassay using antibody pair was selected for quantification and LOD was also achieved as 0.077 ng/ml. All four biomarkers in buffer samples were successfully quantified and reliable R2 values were obtained, and reliable calibration curves were secured for three biomarkers in spiked human serum samples. The immunosensors developed and will be optimized are expected to be used in various fields, including detection of biomarkers for not only AD but also related diseases.
