34281567|t|Mutation of copper binding sites on cellular prion protein abolishes its inhibitory action on NMDA receptors in mouse hippocampal neurons.
34281567|a|We have previously reported that cellular prion protein (PrPC) can down-regulate NMDA receptor activity and in a copper dependent manner. Here, we employed AAV9 to introduce murine cellular prion protein into mouse hippocampal neurons in primary cultures from PrP null mice to determine the role of the six copper binding motifs located within the N-terminal domain of PrPC. The results demonstrate that viral expression of wild type PrPC lowers NMDAR activity in PrP null mouse hippocampal neurons by reducing the magnitude of non-desensitizing currents. Elimination of the last two copper binding sites alone, or in combination with the remaining four attenuates this protective effect. Thus our data suggest that copper ion interactions with specific binding sites on PrPC are critical for PrPC dependent modulation of NMDA receptor function.
