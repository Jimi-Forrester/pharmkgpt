37648599|a|INTRODUCTION: The usage of immersive virtual reality (iVR) in the context of an intensive care unit (ICU) is scarce. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of the usage of iVR in critical patients with or without mechanical ventilation (MV) and to determine the anxiety degree before and after each session. METHODS: Analytical, descriptive, prospective, and cross-sectional research. Pilot test with 20 patients from a polyvalent ICU of a tertiary hospital. Adult patients were included, either connected or not to MV, watchful and calmed (RASS -1/+1) and without delirium (negative CAM-ICU). Oculus Go (Facebook Technologies, LLC) iVR glasses were the model used. The relaxation strategy consisted in the visualization of an experience of 15 min with scenes related to nature and fantasy, relaxing music with a plot. The sessions were individual, with the patient monitored in a fowler position or seated. The anxiety degree before and after each session was evaluated following a reduced version of the Spanish "Cuestionario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo (STAI-e)" and they were analysed using T samples coupled (statistical significance when p-value was <0.05). RESULTS: Incorporation of 20 patients with an average age of 63.9 years old (60% men). A total of 34 sessions of iVR were conducted. 32% patients mechanically ventilated, 32% high-flow oxygen therapy, 36% other breathing supports. 80% of the sessions were completed without serious side effects. A significant decrease in the anxiety degree was observed after each iVR session: first session mean change -2.68 (SD = 2.75), p = 0.000; second session mean change -1.86 (SD = 1.57), p = 0.021; third session mean change -1.67 (SD = 1.63), p = 0.054. CONCLUSION: The usage of iVR in the context of an ICU is feasible, even with patients mechanically ventilated. iVR reduces the anxiety degree in the critic patient, which suggests that "digital therapies" can be effective to improve the emotional state during their stay in the ICU.
