32699670|t|Cholesterol Embolization Syndrome From Penetrating Aortic Ulcer.
32699670|a|Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) is an important, albeit, rarer cause of embolization to internal organs and distal extremities. Embolization occurs as a result of the disruption of cholesterol deposition in the wall of the aorta by a PAU. The classic presentation of cholesterol embolization syndrome (CES) includes pain, pallor, poikilothermia, paresthesia, and paralysis with intact pulses. The patient will classically have livedo reticularis or "blue toes." We present a case of a patient who presented to the emergency department with the complaint of a painful, blue toe. The patient had intact distal pulses on exam with the distal 2/3 of the first toe having a markedly blue/black color with livedo reticularis spreading proximally on the other 1/3 of the toe. CT angiogram with runoff to the lower extremities revealed a 3.6-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 5-mm penetrating aortic ulcer with a three-vessel runoff to the distal lower extremities. The diagnosis of CES secondary to a PAU was made. While thrombotic embolization from PAU causing acute limb ischemia is less common, it is well described. In contrast, cholesterol embolization from PAU remains a rare phenomenon without adequate treatment options.
