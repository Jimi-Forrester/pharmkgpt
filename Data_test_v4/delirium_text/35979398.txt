35979398|t|Diagnostic and Therapeutic Roles of Extracellular Vesicles in Aging-Related Diseases.
35979398|a|Aging shows a decline in overall physical function, and cellular senescence is the powerful catalyst leading to aging. Considering that aging will be accompanied with the emergence of various aging-related diseases, research on new antiaging drugs is still valuable. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as tools for intercellular communication, are important components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and they can play pathological roles in the process of cellular senescence. In addition, EVs are similar to their original cells in functions. Therefore, EVs derived from pathological tissues or body fluids may be closely related to the progression of diseases and become potential biomarkers, while those from healthy cells may have therapeutic effects. Moreover, EVs are satisfactory drug carriers. At present, numerous studies have supported the idea that engineered EVs could improve drug targeting ability and utilization efficiency. Here, we summarize the characteristics of EVs and cellular senescence and focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of EVs in various aging-related diseases, including Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and its complications, and skin aging.
