35406293|t|Contributions of Women in Recent Research on Biopolymer Science.
35406293|a|Nowadays, biopolymers are playing a fundamental role in our society because of the environmental issues and concerns associated with synthetic polymers. The aim of this Special Issue entitled 'Women in Polymer Science and Technology: Biopolymers' is highlighting the work designed and developed by women on biopolymer science and technology. In this context, this short review aims to provide an introduction to this Special Issue by highlighting some recent contributions of women around the world on the particular topic of biopolymer science and technology during the last 20 years. In the first place, it highlights a selection of important works performed on a number of well-studied natural polymers, namely, agar, chitin, chitosan, cellulose, and collagen. Secondly, it gives an insight into the discovery of new polysaccharides and enzymes that have a role in their synthesis and in their degradation. These contributions will be paving the way for the next generation of female and male scientists on this topic.
