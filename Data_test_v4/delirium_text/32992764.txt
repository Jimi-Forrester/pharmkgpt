32992764|t|Cellular Prion Protein (PrPc): Putative Interacting Partners and Consequences of the Interaction.
32992764|a|Cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein most abundantly found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM) in the central nervous system (CNS). PrPc misfolding causes neurodegenerative prion diseases in the CNS. PrPc interacts with a wide range of protein partners because of the intrinsically disordered nature of the protein's N-terminus. Numerous studies have attempted to decipher the physiological role of the prion protein by searching for proteins which interact with PrPc. Biochemical characteristics and biological functions both appear to be affected by interacting protein partners. The key challenge in identifying a potential interacting partner is to demonstrate that binding to a specific ligand is necessary for cellular physiological function or malfunction. In this review, we have summarized the intracellular and extracellular interacting partners of PrPc and potential consequences of their binding. We also briefly describe prion disease-related mutations at the end of this review.
