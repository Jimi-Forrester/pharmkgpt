21354962|a|Ubiquitin ligase was an important protease in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Currently, a handful of drugs were available and they are at best only able to offer some relief from symptoms. Cure for this disease is currently not available. Tacrine hybrids show inhibitory activities to the ubiquitin ligase. The three-dimensional quantitative structure?activity relationship (3D QSAR) models and in-silico studies would be useful in developing new drug leads against Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this work involves the designing of new substances, with potential inhibitory activity over AcetylCholinesterase Enzyme (AChE), using rational drug design strategies.
