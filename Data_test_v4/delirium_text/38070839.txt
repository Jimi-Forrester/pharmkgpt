38070839|t|Assessing cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using a hypercapnic challenge and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL).
38070839|a|Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is a measure of cerebral small vessels' ability to respond to changes in metabolic demand and can be quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coupled with a vasoactive stimulus. Reduced CVR occurs with neurodegeneration and is associated with cognitive decline. While commonly measured in humans, few studies have evaluated CVR in animal models. Herein, we describe methods to induce hypercapnia in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) under gas anesthesia to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CVR using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). Fifteen (13 M, 2 F) adult rhesus macaques underwent pCASL imaging that included a baseline segment (100% O2) followed by a hypercapnic challenge (isoflurane anesthesia with 5% CO2, 95% O2 mixed gas). Relative hypercapnia was defined as an end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) >=5 mmHg above baseline ETCO2. The mean ETCO2 during the baseline segment of the pCASL sequence was 34 mmHg (range: 23-48 mmHg). During this segment, mean whole-brain CBF was 51.48 ml/100g/min (range: 21.47-77.23 ml/100g/min). Significant increases (p<0.0001) in ETCO2 were seen upon inspiration of the mixed gas (5% CO2, 95% O2). The mean increase in ETCO2 was 8.5 mmHg and corresponded with a mean increase in CBF of 37.1% (p<0.0001). The mean CVR measured was 4.3%/mmHg. No anesthetic complications occurred as a result of the CO2 challenge. Our methods were effective at inducing a state of relative hypercapnia that corresponds with a detectable increase in whole brain CBF using pCASL MRI. Using these methods, a CO2 challenge can be performed in conjunction with pCASL imaging to evaluate CBF and CVR in rhesus macaques. The measured CVR in rhesus macaques is comparable to human CVR highlighting the translational utility of rhesus macaques in neuroscience research. These methods present a feasible means to measure CVR in comparative models of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular dysfunction.
