Understanding the related health beliefs is bound to enable lifestyle-based interventions that maximize public engagement in dementia risk reduction behaviors.

Data were collected using a demographic characteristic form and the Turkish version of the Motivation for Changing Lifestyle and Health Behavior for Reducing the Risk of Dementia scale. The study utilized the value, mean, percentage frequency distribution, correlation, independent t test, and the one-way analysis of variance test. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants included in the study was 56.99 +- 12.05, 68.7% of individuals were males. The mean education years of the participants were 11.22 +- 4.55.
