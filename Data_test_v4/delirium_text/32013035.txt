32013035|t|Cognitive Improvement in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment: Evidence from a Multi-Strategic Metamemory Training.
32013035|a|Intervention programs to relieve memory impairment and memory-related complaints in older adults with mild cognitive impairment are needed. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to assess the efficacy of a novel cognitive training approach-named multi-strategic metamemory training-in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Among a total of 113 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, 66 participated in the memory training program (training group) and 47 did not (control group). Repeated measures of analysis of variance revealed that compared with the control group, the training group experienced: i) a significantly greater increase in cognitive test scores of long-term delayed free recall (Finteraction = 6.04, p = .016) and fluency (Finteraction = 4.11, p = .045) and ii) significantly greater decrease in their subjective memory complaints for everyday memory (Finteraction = 7.35, p = .009). These results suggest that the training program can improve verbal memory (i.e., delayed free recall), language processing (i.e., categorical fluency) and limit complaints in everyday instrumental memory activities of mildly impaired older adults.
