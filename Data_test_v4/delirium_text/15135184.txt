15135184|t|Homocysteine and Alzheimer's disease: a modifiable risk?
15135184|a|A hypothesis is proposed that reconciles the epidemiological observation of elevated homocysteine in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with clinical features of the disease, particularly evidence of increased oxidative stress. We propose homocysteine is involved in an iron dysregulation/oxidative stress cycle that has a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. The implications of the hypothesis and some strategies for testing it are discussed.
