16290147|a|This paper presents a surface-based approach to inhibit the binding of proteins to Alzheimer's-related beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils with small molecules. It reports the idea of using an intracellular, disease-related fibril as a material whose surface can be coated with small molecules. Using an ELISA-based assay, molecular surface coatings with thioflavin T are shown to inhibit 65+/-10% of the binding of two different anti-Abeta IgGs to Abeta fibrils. A molecular surface coating with 3,6-diamino acridine was able to inhibit 76+/-10% of the binding of an anti-Abeta IgG to Abeta fibrils. Maximal inhibition of these protein-amyloid interactions appears in the low to mid-micromolar range of small molecule. This demonstration that molecular surface coatings can be used to attenuate the interaction of proteins with these fibrils suggests a potentially new strategy for therapeutics in neurodegenerative amyloid diseases.
