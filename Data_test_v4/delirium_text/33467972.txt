Method: Non-protocolized analysis using data from a larger multicenter, single-blind, randomized, parallel two-arm RCT of RT for people with neurocognitive disorders. A sample of 148 people with probable Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia attending 23 Portuguese institutions providing care and support services for older adults were selected. Intervention group (n = 74) received 26 individual RT sessions, twice a week for 13 weeks. Control group (n = 74) maintained their treatment as usual. Outcomes were global cognitive function (MMSE), memory (MAT), executive function (FAB), mood (GDS-15), and self-reported quality of life (QoL-AD). All participants were assessed at baseline (T0) and 15 weeks later (T1). Results: The results showed a significant effect of the intervention on global cognition (Group X Time interaction F(1, 128) = 10.542, p = .001, etap2 = .076), memory (F(1,128) = 9.881, p = .002, etap2 = .072), and quality of life (F(1,128) = 0.181, p = .671, etap2 = .001), with medium effect sizes. A small effect on executive function (F(1,127) = 11.118, p = .001, etap2 = .080) was also found. No effects were found on depressive symptoms (F(1,128) = 0.181, p = .671, etap2 = .001). Conclusion: Individual RT may have beneficial effects on cognition and quality of life of people with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.
