11455135|t|Innovative dementia care: functional status over time of persons with Alzheimer disease in a residential care centre compared to special care units.
11455135|a|Residential care centres (RCCs) for persons with Alzheimer disease are increasing worldwide, but there are few studies that compare the functional outcomes of RCC residents to residents of other types of continuing care settings. This study compared residents of the first Canadian RCC on physical, cognitive, behavioural and emotional functioning 6, 12 and 18 months after admission to residents of special care units (SCUs) operated by the same continuing care provider. SCU residents were initially functioning lower than RCC residents on most outcome measures and these differences persisted over time. Resident functioning declined over time regardless of care setting and, when the initial status was controlled for, the rates of decline were similar. However, RCC residents experienced greater independence/freedom of choice, fewer physical or psychotropic medication restraints and were more active, which may have enhanced their quality of life.
