32380752|t|Peptide Interference with APP and Tau Association: Relevance to Alzheimer's Disease Amelioration.
32380752|a|The two major proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau. Here, we demonstrate that these two proteins can bind to each other. Four possible peptides APP1 (390-412), APP2 (713-730), Tau1 (19-34) and Tau2 (331-348), were predicted to be involved in this interaction, with actual binding confirmed for APP1 and Tau1. In vivo studies were performed in an Alzheimer Disease animal model-APP double transgenic (Tg) 5xFAD-as well as in 5xFAD crossed with Tau transgenic 5xFADXTau (FT), which exhibit declined cognitive reduction at four months of age. Nasal administration of APP1 and Tau1 mixture, three times a week for four or five months, reduced amyloid plaque burden as well as the level of soluble Abeta 1-42 in the brain. The treatment prevented the deterioration of cognitive functions when initiated at the age of three months, before cognitive deficiency was evident, and also at the age of six months, when such deficiencies are already observed, leading to a full regain of cognitive function.
