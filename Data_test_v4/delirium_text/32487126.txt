32487126|a|BACKGROUND: We recently reported that older patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) more frequently than the general population. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of iNPH in a larger number of older SZ patients and explored useful examination values for diagnosis in the SZ population. METHODS: We enrolled older inpatients with SZ (n = 39, mean age = 68.6 +- 7.7 years) from several psychiatric hospitals in Ehime, Japan and acquired brain imaging data using computed tomography. We evaluated three iNPH symptoms (dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence). In addition, we combined these data with our previous data to elucidate the relationship between iNPH and characteristics of SZ symptoms. RESULTS: In total, five (12.8%) patients were diagnosed with possible iNPH. Evans' index for patients with iNPH was significantly higher than for those without iNPH (p = 0.002). The number of disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH) findings was significantly higher in patients with iNPH than in those without iNPH (p <  0.001). Using combined data, Drug-Induced Extra-pyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) subscales of gait and bradykinesia showed an increasing trend in the SZ with iNPH group. CONCLUSIONS: We reconfirmed that older inpatients with SZ experienced possible iNPH more frequently than the general population. We should pay attention to the DIEPSS subscales of gait and bradykinesia and DESH findings in addition to the three main symptoms of iNPH and Evans' index so as to not miss SZ patients with iNPH.
