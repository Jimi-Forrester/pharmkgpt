31355271|t|MAPK Pathway Inhibitors Attenuated Hydrogen Peroxide Induced Damage in Neural Cells.
31355271|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species plays a central role in pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades attenuates the oxidative induced cell stress and behaves as potential neuroprotection agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we evaluate hydrogen peroxide induced neural cell stress and determine how different MAPK inhibitors restore the cell damage. RESULTS: The results indicated that oxidative stress induced by neural cell damage commonly exists, and MAPK inhibitors partially and selectively attenuated the cell damage by reducing ROS production and cell apoptosis. The cultured neurons are more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide than subculture cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the essential role of different MAPK inhibitors is to attenuate the hydrogen peroxide induced neuronal cell damage. Those data broaden the implication between individual neural cells and different MAPK inhibitors and give clues for oxidative stress induced neural diseases.
