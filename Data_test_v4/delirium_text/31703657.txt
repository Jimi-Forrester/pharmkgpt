31703657|t|A case report of persistent risky dietary behaviors in a bipolar disorder patient.
31703657|a|BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is associated with complicated medical comorbidities. The risk-taking behavior of bipolar disorder patients may lead to many problems. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old male patient had gastrointestinal symptoms for 4 months. He was talkative, agitative, and grandiose but showed poor cognition. Multisystem injury required multidepartment, multidisciplinary consultation. Repeated fecal examination found multiple infections of Opisthorchis sinensis, Heterophyes, and Echinostomatidae. The diagnostic criteria for parasitic infections, bipolar disorder and organic mental disorder were met. After treatment with a mood stabilizer and helminthic, his mood became stable, but risky dietary behavior continued. CONCLUSIONS: The case describes persistent risky dietary behaviors in a bipolar patient even after affective symptoms were under control, which ultimately led to diverse parasitic infections and chronic encephalopathy. We call for clinical and scientific attention to possible dangerous behavior changes in bipolar patients even after their emotions are stabilized.
