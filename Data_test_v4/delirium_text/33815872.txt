33815872|t|Metabolic Abnormalities in Patients with Chronic Disorders of Consciousness.
33815872|a|The vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) are two major types of chronic disorders of consciousness (DoC). The assessment of these two consciousness states generally relies on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score, but a high misdiagnosis rate limits the generalized use of this score. To identify metabolites in human plasma that can accurately distinguish VS from MCS patients, comprehensive plasma metabolic profiles were obtained with targeted metabolomics analysis and untargeted and targeted lipidomics analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the significance of differences. Compared with healthy controls (HCs), the DoC groups, Emerged from Minimally Conscious State (EMCS) group and Alzheimer's disease (AD) group had significantly different metabolic profiles. Purine metabolism pathway differed the most between the DoC (MCS and VS) and HC groups. In this pathway, adenosine, ADP, and AMP, which are the derived products of ATP degradation, were decreased in the MCS and VS groups compared to healthy controls. More importantly, we identified certain lipids for which the levels were enriched in the VS or MCS groups. Specifically, phosphatidylcholine, (38:5)-H (PC(38:5)-H), and arachidonic acid (AA) differed substantially between the VS and MCS groups and may be used to distinguish these two groups of patients. Together, our findings suggest that metabolic profiling is significantly altered in patients with chronic DoC.
