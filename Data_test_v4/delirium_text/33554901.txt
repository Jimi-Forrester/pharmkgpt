33554901|a|BACKGROUND: To date, there are no effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, a significant need for research of therapies remains. OBJECTIVE: One promising pharmacological target is the hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which is thought to be neuroprotective. A clinical candidate for medical use could be the FGF21 analogue LY2405319 (LY), which has a specificity and potency comparable to FGF21. METHODS: The present study investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of LY via PPARgamma/apoE/abca1 pathway, which is known to degrade amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques by using primary glial cells and hippocampal organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSCs) from 30- and 50-week-old transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (tg) mice. By LY treatment of 52-week-old tg mice with advanced Abeta deposition, we further aimed to elaborate the effect of LY on AD pathology in vivo. RESULTS: LY application to primary glial cells caused an upregulation of ppargamma, apoE, and abca1 mRNA expression and significantly decreased number and area of Abeta plaques in OBSCs. LY treatment in tg mice increased cerebral [18F] FDG uptake and N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio indicating enhanced neuronal activity and integrity. Although LY did not reduce the number of Abeta plaques in tg mice, the number of iba1-positive cells was significantly decreased indicating reduced microgliosis. CONCLUSION: These data identified LY in vitro as an activator of Abeta degrading genes leading to cerebral Abeta load amelioration in early and late AD pathology. Although Abeta plaque reduction by LY failed in vivo, LY may be used as therapeutic agent to treat AD-related neuroinflammation and impaired neuronal integrity.
