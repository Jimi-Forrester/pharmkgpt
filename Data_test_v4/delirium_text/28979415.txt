28979415|t|The psychological and neurocognitive consequences of critical illness. A pragmatic review of current evidence.
28979415|a|Mortality rates alone are no longer a sufficient guide to quality of care. Due to medical advances, patients are surviving for longer following critical illness and major surgery; therefore, functional outcomes and long-term quality of life are of increasing consequence. Post-operative cognitive dysfunction has been acknowledged as a complication following anaesthesia for many years, and interest in persistent cognitive dysfunction following a critical illness is growing. Psychological and neurocognitive sequelae following discharge from intensive care are acknowledged to occur with sufficient significance to have recently coined the term 'the post-intensive care syndrome'. Rehabilitation following critical illness has been highlighted as an important goal in recently published national UK guidelines, including the need to focus on both physical and non-physical recovery. Neuropsychological and cognitive consequences following anaesthesia and critical illness are significant. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms linking delirium, cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychological symptoms following critical illness are not fully elucidated but have been studied elsewhere and are outside the scope of this article. There is limited evidence as yet for specific peri-operative preventative strategies, but early management and rehabilitation strategies following intensive care discharge are now emerging. This article aims to summarise the issues and appraise current options for management, including both neuroprotective and neurorehabilitative strategies in intensive care.
