33425557|t|Thyroid Storm: Unusual Presentation and Complication.
33425557|a|Thyroid storm is a rare and a life-threatening condition, and serious complications could happen if not diagnosed and managed early. The typical clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism are exaggerated in thyroid storm, particularly marked pyrexia and tachycardia, and altered mental status as agitation, delirium, or coma. Many precipitating factors contribute to the presentation of thyroid storm, and new recent factors like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) could play a significant role. Serious and rare complications from the thyroid storm can increase the risk of mortality and morbidity up to 30% as fulminant hepatic failure, which is reported only a handful of times in the literature. Also, congestive heart failure can be part of the multiorgan dysfunction from the presentation, if associated with the thyroid storm. In this report, we present a case of thyroid storm precipitated by EBV and causing fast atrial fibrillation complicated by congestive heart failure and fulminant hepatic failure for 46-year-old Bangladeshi male not known to have any medical illness. He presented to the emergency department with 10-day history of an on and off subjective fever, associated with generalized abdominal pain and vomiting. He developed palpitation at the day of presentation. He was managed, stabilized, intubated, and shifted to the ICU as the patient started to be apneic after the conscious sedation for the cardioversion. During the admission anti-EBV viral capsid antigen IgM antibody was positive. The patient was discharged after five days in ICU and 14 days of overall hospital stay. Although the complication of thyroid storm as fulminant hepatic failure and congestive heart failure are rare, they should be considered in cases with thyroid storm. The pre-existing of EBV as a precipitating factor should always be considered, and more studies in these regards need to be done.
