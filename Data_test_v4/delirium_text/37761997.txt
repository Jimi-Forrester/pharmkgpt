37761997|t|In the Search for Biomarkers of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, Are Cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-Gamma the Right Indicators to Use?
37761997|a|Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a complex disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right heart failure. While the exact mechanisms underlying PAH are not fully understood, cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Cytokines play a crucial role in regulating immune responses and inflammation. These small proteins also play a key role in shaping the immunophenotype, which refers to the specific characteristics and functional properties of immune cells, which can have a significant impact on the development of PAH. The aim of this study was to determine the immunophenotype and the concentration of selected cytokines, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma, in patients diagnosed with PAH (with particular emphasis on subtypes) in relation to healthy volunteers. Based on the obtained results, we can conclude that in patients with PAH, the functioning of the immune system is deregulated as a result of a decrease in the percentage of selected subpopulations of immune cells in peripheral blood and changes in the concentration of tested cytokines in relation to healthy volunteers. In addition, a detailed analysis showed that there are statistically significant differences between the PAH subtypes and the tested immunological parameters. This may indicate a significant role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of PAH.
