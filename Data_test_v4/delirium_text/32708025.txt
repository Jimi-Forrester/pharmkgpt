32708025|t|Phosphorus Dendrimers as Nanotools against Cancers.
32708025|a|This review concerns the use of dendrimers, especially of phosphorhydrazone dendrimers, against cancers. After the introduction, the review is organized in three main topics, depending on the role played by the phosphorus dendrimers against cancers: (i) as drugs by themselves; (ii) as carriers of drugs; and (iii) as indirect inducer of cancerous cell death. In the first part, two main types of phosphorus dendrimers are considered: those functionalized on the surface by diverse organic derivatives, including known drugs, and those functionalized by diverse metal complexes. The second part will display the role of dendrimers as carriers of anticancer "drugs", which can be either small molecules or anticancer siRNAs, or the combination of both. In the third part are gathered a few examples of phosphorhydrazone dendrimers that are not cytotoxic by themselves, but which under certain circumstances induce a cytotoxic effect on cancerous cells. These examples include a positive influence on the human immune system and the combination of bioimaging with photodynamic therapy properties.
