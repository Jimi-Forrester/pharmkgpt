33024515|a|The newly emerged coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2) and the disease that it causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have changed the world we know. Yet, the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 remain mostly vague. Many virulence factors and immune mechanisms contribute to the deteriorating effects on the organism during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, where the principal and effective immune response towards viral infection is the cell-mediated immunity. The clinical picture of COVID-19, which includes immune memory and reinfection, remains unclear and unpredictable. However, many hopes are put in developing an effective vaccine against the virus, and different therapeutic options have been implemented to find effective, even though not specific, treatment to the disease. We can assume that the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the individual's immune system determines the onset and development of the disease significantly.
