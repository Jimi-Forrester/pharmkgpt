26182906|a|Plasma levels of circulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are of particular interest in Alzheimer' disease, but little is known about cognitive and cortical correlates of peripheral Abeta levels in normal aging. Here, we compared cognitive functioning, vascular risk factors, and patterns of cortical thickness between cognitively intact elderly subjects with low (N = 60) and high (N = 60) plasma Abeta levels (cutoffs: 225 pg/mL and 23 pg/mL for Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, respectively). Overall, subjects with high Abeta levels showed lower cognitive performance and thinner cortex than those with low Abeta levels. More specifically, subjects with high Abeta1-40 showed bilateral thinning of the prefrontal cortex, poorer objective memory, slower processing speed, and lower nonverbal reasoning skills, whereas subjects with high Abeta1-42 had thinner temporal lobe, poorer everyday memory, and increased levels of homocysteine. Overall, these results suggest that high plasma Abeta levels in normal elderly subjects are associated with subclinical markers of vulnerable aging, which may be helpful at predicting different trajectories of aging in cognitively intact older adults.
