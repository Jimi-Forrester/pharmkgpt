38397435|t|Factors and Mechanisms of Thyroid Hormone Activity in the Brain: Possible Role in Recovery and Protection.
38397435|a|Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential in normal brain development, and cognitive and emotional functions. THs act through a cascade of events including uptake by the target cells by specific cell membrane transporters, activation or inactivation by deiodinase enzymes, and interaction with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. Several thyroid responsive genes have been described in the developing and in the adult brain and many studies have demonstrated a systemic or local reduction in TH availability in neurologic disease and after brain injury. In this review, the main factors and mechanisms associated with the THs in the normal and damaged brain will be evaluated in different regions and cellular contexts. Furthermore, the most common animal models used to study the role of THs in brain damage and cognitive impairment will be described and the use of THs as a potential recovery strategy from neuropathological conditions will be evaluated. Finally, particular attention will be given to the link observed between TH alterations and increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative and dementing condition worldwide.
