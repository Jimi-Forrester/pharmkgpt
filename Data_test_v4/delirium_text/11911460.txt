11911460|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, which enhance cholinergic transmission by reducing the enzymatic degradation of acetylcholine, are the only source of the compound that is currently approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The methanol extract from Fiatoua villosa among 100 traditional edible plants that were tested, showed the most potent inhibitory effect (51%) on acetylcholinesterase in vitro. After the sequential solvent fractionation of the methanol extract of Fiatoua villosa, the active fraction was repeatedly subjected to open-column chromatography on silica gel. From the highest inhibitory fraction, the chloroform fraction (75%) on AChE, the single compound, was obtained by the Sep-Pak Cartridge (C18: reverse phase column). This compound was finally purified by HPLC (micro-bondapack C18 reverse phase column: 19 x 300 mm). According to the electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS), we confirmed that the molecular mass was 219 m/z. The structure of this compound was identified as zeatin [2-methyl-4-(1H-purine-6-ylamino)-2-buten-1-ol], one of the derivatives of purine adenine. The concentration that was required for 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50 value) was 1.09 x 10(-4) M. This study demonstrated that the zeatin from Fiatoua villosa appeared to be the most potent AChE inhibitor in AD.
