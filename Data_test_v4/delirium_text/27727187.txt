27727187|t|Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Tacrine-Ferulic Acid Hybrids as Multifunctional Drug Candidates against Alzheimer's Disease.
27727187|a|Five novel tacrine-ferulic acid hybrid compounds (8a-e) were synthesized and their structures were identified on the basis of a detailed spectroscopic analysis. The activities of inhibiting acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE), reducing self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and chelating Cu2+ were evaluated in vitro. Among them, 8c and 8d displayed the higher selectivity in inhibiting AChE over BuChE. Moreover, 8d also showed dramatic inhibition of self-Abeta aggregation, activity of chelating Cu2+ and activity against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in Neuro-2A cells.
