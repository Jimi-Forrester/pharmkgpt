1573033|t|A group of potassium-channel blockers-acetylcholine releasers: new potentials for Alzheimer disease? A review.
1573033|a|This review of the literature examines systematically the data currently available for potassium-channel blockers to reassess their clinical potential in Alzheimer disease. The conclusion is that potassium-channel blockers may have been dismissed prematurely for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, an impression supported by data indicating intimate relationships between potassium-channel blockade and cholinergic transmission.
