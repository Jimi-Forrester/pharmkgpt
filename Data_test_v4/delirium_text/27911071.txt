27911071|t|Severe Brain Injury in Massachusetts: Assessing the Continuum of Care.
27911071|a|Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a major public health problem in Massachusetts (Hackman et al, 2014) and includes traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, ABI-related infectious diseases, metabolic disorders affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and brain tumor. Advances in emergency medical care and neurosurgery mean that more people are surviving severe traumatic brain injury (Trexler et al, 2014). Yet many patients with severe TBI in particular, are not receiving inpatient services after initial treatment (Hackman et al, 2014; CDC, 2014) or later that are known to be effective (Malec & Kean, 2015; Lewis & Horn, 2015; BI Commission, 2011; Kolakowsky-Hayner et al, 2000; Interviews). These services include post-acute rehabilitation, case management, and brain injury-specific community programming (CDC, 2014; BI Commission, 2011; Interviews). Governance and data for decision-making are also major gaps in the continuum of care for severe brain injury in MA (Interviews; NASHIA, 2005). The last two decades saw a surge in interest in the brain, with advances in neuroscience, diagnosis and measurement of brain injury, rehabilitation services, and brain theory (Boyle, 2001). Severe brain injury however is the new "hidden epidemic" in our society. For many, an injury to the brain is not a short-term event that can be "cured" but the beginning of a life-long disability (CDC, 2014; Langlois et al, 2006). Fortunately, even after a severe brain injury, when the right rehabilitation is provided at the right time, the "rest of life" journey can be a positive one for many (Marquez de la Plata, 2015; Langlois et al, 2006). Severe brain injury can lead to a "new normal" as patients regain skills, find new meaning and in life, and take on new family, volunteer, and work roles. Throughout this brief, the term "severe brain injury" refers to "severe acquired brain injury," or any injury to the brain that occurs after birth. This definition does not include neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Parkinson's Disease which do not usually result in an acute hospital admission. Clinically, severe TBI is defined as resulting in loss of consciousness for 6 to 24 hours or more (Corrigan et al, 2010; CDC, 2014). Yet even a "mild" TBI can result in long-term functional impairments (Corrigan et al, 2010) for an estimated 15 to 30% of people (Lewine et al, 2007; Cajigal, 2007). In the chronic phase of acquired brain injury from any cause, lifelong disabilities may affect the ability to work, perform activities of daily living (dressing, paying bills), participate in community life, and/or fulfill a family role.
