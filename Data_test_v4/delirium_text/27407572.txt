27407572|a|The varied clinical manifestations and management of 14 male patients with delirium tremens (DT) have been studied. Eight patients were initially hospitalised for diseases unrelated to ethanol abuse i.e. 2 each for gun shot wound, myocardial infarction and stroke, and one each for pneumonia and gastroenteritis. One patient was going through withdrawal because of prodrome of viral hepatitis before he was hospitalised for uncontrolled agitation and delirium. Two known cases of mild essential hypertension on dietary therapy reported for agitation, abnormal behaviour, a single episode of tonic clonic seizure and hypertensive encephalopathy as they could not/did not get alcohol for 3 days. Three patients presented denovo with DT without concomitant illness. The other features besides delirium and hallucinations were tremulousness in 10, tachycardia in 12, fever in 3, diaphoresis in 2 and tonic clonic seizures in 4 patients. The symptoms fluctuated markedly at short intervals and 2 patients did not have any features of sympathetic overactivity. Altered hepatic biochemical parameters and ketonuria with normal blood sugar were noted in 4 and one patients respectively. Other biochemical parameters including serum electrolytes were normal. CT scan brain done for 5 patients revealed subdural haematoma in one. Cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and EEG findings were noncontributory. All made good recovery with heavy doses of intravenous vitamin B complex, glucose and oral benzodiazepine. Short course of haloperidol was used in 2 patients. Two patients developed pancreatitis during follow up. All patients made complete recovery, and 8 patients have been followed for 8 to 12 months without relapse. The reason for hospitalisation in such cases is often unrelated to alcohol abuse; hence a detailed history of alcoholism is mandatory to identify those at risk as well as for prompt treatment and decreasing the mortality.
