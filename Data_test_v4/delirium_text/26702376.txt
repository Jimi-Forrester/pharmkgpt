26702376|a|Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 is implicated in learning and memory. Experimental studies have suggested that the IGF-1 system is beneficial in cognition, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), by opposing Abeta amyloid processing and hyperphosphorylated tau toxicity. Low IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 serum levels are significantly associated with AD. To assess the relationship between circulating IGF-I and IGFBP3 levels and change of postoperative cognition. The study was performed in patients scheduled for elective head and neck carcinoma surgery under general anesthesia. On the day before the operation and postoperative days 1, 3 and 7, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was performed by the same doctor, and blood samples were collected at 08:00 h after overnight fasting. The circulating levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP3 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One hundred and two patients completed all four MMSE tests and forty-four of them completed all the four blood samples collection. Postoperative circulating IGF-1 level, ratio of IGF-1/IGFBP3 and MMSE score significantly decreased, whereas IGFBP3 level significantly increased compared with preoperative values in total patients. The change trends of circulating IGF-1 level and MMSE score were similar. Preoperative circulating IGF-1 level, ratio and MMSE score were significantly lower in POCD group compared to non-POCD group. There was no significant difference in preoperative level of circulating IGFBP3 between the two groups. Preoperative circulating IGF-1 level was negatively correlated with age and positively with MMSE. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower preoperative IGF-1 level and elderly patients increased the odds of POCD. Down-regulation of circulating IGF-1 level may be involved in the mechanism of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Older patients had lower circulating IGF-1 levels and were more susceptible to POCD.
