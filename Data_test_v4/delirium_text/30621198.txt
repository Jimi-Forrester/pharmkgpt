30621198|t|Polyphenolic Profile and Antioxidant Activity of Leaf Purified Hydroalcoholic Extracts from Seven Mexican Persea americana Cultivars.
30621198|a|Persea americana (avocado) is a fruit consumed worldwide; however, since avocado leaves are apparently a natural ingredient that can be used as a traditional medicine, they can be a potential source of bioactive compounds. This study aimed to analyze the antioxidant activity of seven Mexican avocado leaf extracts by DPPH , ABTS +, and lipid peroxidation (LPO), and to identify the compound profile by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry/electron spray ionization. The highest free radical-scavenging activity was observed for Platano Delgado and Criollo 6 avocado cultivars havin IC50 values of 271.86 +- 13.69 and 269.56 +- 6.53 for DPPH  and ABTS + radicals, respectively, while the best result for lipid oxidation inhibition was registered in Criollo 6 cultivar extract. In this study forty-one compounds were detected in avocado leaves of the the seven cultivars analyzed, and of these compounds, eighteen phenolics were identified for first time in such plant material. The present study demonstrated that Mexican cultivars of Persea americana possess diverse polyphenolic compounds with strong antioxidant activity, which might be useful in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
