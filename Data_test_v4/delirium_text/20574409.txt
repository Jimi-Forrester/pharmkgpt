20574409|a|Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a 42-amino acid hormone, secreted from the enteroendocrine K cells, which has insulin-releasing and extra-pancreatic actions. GIP and its receptor present a widespread distribution in the mammalian brain where they have been implicated with synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, neuroprotection and behavioral alterations. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of the role of GIP in the central nervous system and to highlight recent findings from our group showing its potential involvement in neurological illnesses including epilepsies, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
