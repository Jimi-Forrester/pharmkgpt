16871855|t|Dementia and occupation: a review of the literature.
16871855|a|BACKGROUND: Recent evidence supports the usefulness of occupational therapy models, particularly the Occupational Performance Process, in structuring research evidence to inform practice. PURPOSE: In this paper we report the results of our work to identify and summarize quantitative and qualitative research evidence about occupational therapy intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregiver, relevant to the first stage of the Occupational Performance Process, which is to identify, validate and prioritize occupational performance issues. RESULTS: Review of literature from diverse sources deemed to be relevant was summarized under three themes: the experience of occupation among persons with dementia, the experience of occupation among caregivers of persons with dementia, and discussion of occupational performance issues. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Best practice recommendations are made based on this review.
