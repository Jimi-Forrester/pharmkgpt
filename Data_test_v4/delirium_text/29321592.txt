29321592|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. At the early stages of AD development, the soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) induces synaptic dysfunction, perturbs the excitation/inhibition balance of neural circuitries, and in turn alters the normal neural network activity leading to cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Here by using whole-cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices, we found that 50 nM Abeta induces hyperexcitability of excitatory pyramidal cells in the cingulate cortex, one of the most vulnerable areas in AD, via depressing inhibitory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, by simultaneously recording multiple cells, we discovered that the inhibitory innervation of pyramidal cells from fast-spiking (FS) interneurons instead of non-FS interneurons is dramatically disrupted by Abeta, and perturbation of the presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release underlies this inhibitory input disruption. Finally, we identified the increased dopamine action on dopamine D1 receptor of FS interneurons as a key pathological factor that contributes to GABAergic input perturbation and excitation/inhibition imbalance caused by Abeta. Thus, we conclude that the dopamine receptor 1-dependent disruption of FS GABAergic inhibitory input plays a critical role in Abeta-induced excitation/inhibition imbalance in anterior cingulate cortex.
