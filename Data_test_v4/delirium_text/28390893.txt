28390893|t|Targeting glutamatergic and cellular prion protein mechanisms of amyloid beta-mediated persistent synaptic plasticity disruption: Longitudinal studies.
28390893|a|Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are synaptotoxic, inappropriately increasing extracellular glutamate concentration and glutamate receptor activation to thereby rapidly disrupt synaptic plasticity. Thus, acutely promoting brain glutamate homeostasis with a blood-based scavenging system, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), and blocking metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor or its co-receptor cellular prion protein (PrP), prevent the acute inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) by exogenous Abeta. Here, we evaluated the time course of the effects of such interventions in the persistent disruptive effects of Abeta oligomers, either exogenously injected in wild type rats or endogenously generated in transgenic rats that model Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. We report that repeated, but not acute, systemic administration of recombinant GOT type 1, with or without the glutamate co-substrate oxaloacetate, reversed the persistent deleterious effect of exogenous Abeta on synaptic plasticity. Moreover, similar repetitive treatment reversibly abrogated the inhibition of LTP monitored longitudinally in freely behaving transgenic rats. Remarkably, brief repeated treatment with an mGlu5 receptor antagonist, basimglurant, or an antibody that prevents Abeta oligomer binding to PrP, ICSM35, also had similar reversible ameliorative effects in the transgenic rat model. Overall, the present findings support the ongoing development of therapeutics for early Alzheimer's disease based on these complementary approaches.
