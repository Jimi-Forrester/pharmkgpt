39307572|a|OBJECTIVES: Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are mostly designed for patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Long-term case management and planning for the remainder of life with disability require an estimation of the survival duration. METHODS: This cohort study utilized data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan, to identify incident cases of mild-to-moderate AD dementia diagnosed from 2000 to 2002, followed through December 31, 2017. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was constructed to compare the independent effects of age, sex, and comorbidities on all-cause mortality risk. Cumulative survival rates and survival times were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 5258 incident cases were identified, all treated with cholinesterase inhibitors after diagnosis confirmation by an expert committee. During the 15-year follow-up period, 4331 deaths occurred. The 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative survival rates were 95, 92, 67, 37, and 18, respectively. The median (95% CI) survival time after diagnosis was 7.69 (7.46-7.90) years overall, 6.37 (6.06-6.65) years in men, and 8.81 (8.49-9.12) years in women. After stratification by age and number of comorbidities, the median survival time ranged from 13.72 (ages 40-64) to 5.29 (ages >= 80) years among those without comorbidities. For those with >= 3 comorbidities, the median survival times decreased to 6.43 for individuals diagnosed at ages 40-64 and to 2.98 years for those diagnosed at age 80 or older. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide, large, long-term cohort study provided survival rates and durations from diagnosis to death, varying by sex, age group, and presence/number of comorbidities. This information can serve as a foundation for further cost-effectiveness studies on new treatments, and may aid clinicians, patients, and families in shared decision-making and advance personalized care planning for early dementia cases.
