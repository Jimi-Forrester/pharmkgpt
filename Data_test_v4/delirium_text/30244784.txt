30244784|t|Prescribing antipsychotics in older people: A mini-review.
30244784|a|Antipsychotic medications are widely prescribed in elderly populations for a range of psychiatric symptoms. Evidence for their efficacy in this population is limited, and such individuals are at increased risk of numerous side-effects, including stroke and death, particularly in those with dementia. There appears to be a mismatch between the current evidence base and what is occurring in clinical practice, especially in the use of antipsychotics to treat delirium and behavioural and psychological disturbance in dementia. We advise caution in the prescription of antipsychotics in older people and seeking specialist advice.
