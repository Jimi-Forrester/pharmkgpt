37044244|t|Local Anesthetic with Monitored Anesthesia Care in Cephalomedullary Nailing of Proximal Femur Fractures: a pilot study.
37044244|a|INTRODUCTION: Proximal femur fractures have high rates of morbidity, mortality, and perioperative complications. Limiting anesthesia, especially in the elderly population, is a priority from a medical perspective. The goal of the current study is to present a technique of using local anesthetic with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for the fixation of intertrochanteric (IT) femur fractures with cephalomedullary nailing (CMN), provide early clinical results in a small series of patients, and evaluate the safety, efficiency, and anesthetic efficacy of our technique. HYPOTHESIS: The use of only local anesthetic with MAC for the fixation of IT fractures is safe and leads to decreased operative times when compared to spinal and general anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing cephalomedullary nailing (CMN) with a long nail for intertrochanteric (IT) femur fractures by a single surgeon from January 2020 to June 2021 were identified retrospectively from a prospectively-collected patient registry. Patient demographics, operative time, length of hospital stay, perioperative medication use, and complications were collected. Analysis of variance, chi-squared, linear regression, and two-sampled T-tests were performed to analyze potential differences between the local anesthesia group and the general or spinal anesthesia group. RESULTS: 37 patients were identified. 11 patients underwent CMN using local anesthesia with MAC, 11 using spinal anesthesia, and 15 using general anesthesia. The local anesthesia group demonstrated significantly lower operating room times and anesthesia induction to incision time compared to other anesthesia techniques. The local anesthesia group also trended towards less need for vasopressors during surgery and less post-operative delirium. No differences were identified in intraoperative narcotic use, complications, patient mortality, or hospital readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Local anesthesia with MAC for the treatment of IT fractures with CMN was associated with decreased operating room times and had similar complication rates including blood transfusions, readmissions, and mortalities, when compared to spinal and general anesthesia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, Therapeutic.
