31408296|t|Intensive Care Psychological Assessment Tool (IPAT): Turkish validity and reliability study
31408296|a|Background/aim: It  is  of  crucial  importantance  to  be  able  to  detect  acute  psychological  distress  in  patients.  The  Intensive  Care  Psychological Assessment Tool (IPAT) was developed for this purpose in intensive care units. This study aims to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of IPAT. Materials and methods: In total, 98 patients were included. To assess concurrent validity, the Intensive Care Experiences Scale (ICES) and  the  Hospital  Anxiety  Depression  Scale  were  performed.  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficient  was  used  to  estimate  internal  consistency.  Interitem  and  item-total  score  correlations  were  also  performed.  Sensitivity  and  specificity  were  derived  for  concurrent  anxiety  and  depression. Results: The internal reliability was good. Cronbach's a = 0.85. Items were well-correlated, with an average interitem correlation of 0.38. The concurrent validity of IPAT was good. Correlation between IPAT scores, anxiety, depression, ICES, and the diagnosis of delirium were as follows, respectively: r = 0.61, P < 0.01, r = 0.54, P < 0.01,  r = -0.66, P < 0.01, r = 0.37, P < 0.01. With a cutoff score of >= 6, IPAT showed 85% sensitivity and 61% specificity to detect concurrent anxiety, and 74% sensitivity and 82% specificity to detect concurrent depression [AUC = 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92), respectively]. Conclusion: The Turkish version of IPAT was found to be a valid and reliable tool to assess acute psychological distress among patients in intensive care units.
