37630258|a|In this study, a series of novel benzofuran-based 1,2,4-triazole derivatives (10a-e) were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and bacterial strains (E. coli and B. subtilis). Preliminary results revealed that almost all assayed compounds displayed promising efficacy against AChE, while compound 10d was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of AChE. Similarly, these 5-bromobenzofuran-triazoles 10a-e were screened against B. subtilis QB-928 and E. coli AB-274 to evaluate their antibacterial potential in comparison to the standard antibacterial drug penicillin. Compound 10b was found to be the most active among all screened scaffolds, with an MIC value of 1.25 +- 0.60 microg/mL against B. subtilis, having comparable therapeutic efficacy to the standard drug penicillin (1 +- 1.50 microg/mL). Compound 10a displayed excellent antibacterial therapeutic efficacy against the E. coli strain with comparable MIC of 1.80 +- 0.25 microg/mL to that of the commercial drug penicillin (2.4 +- 1.00 microg/mL). Both the benzofuran-triazole molecules 10a and 10b showed a larger zone of inhibition. Moreover, IFD simulation highlighted compound 10d as a novel lead anticholinesterase scaffold conforming to block entrance, limiting the swinging gate, and disrupting the catalytic triad of AChE, and further supported its significant AChE inhibition with an IC50 value of 0.55 +- 1.00 microM. Therefore, compound 10d might be a promising candidate for further development in Alzheimer's disease treatment, and compounds 10a and 10b may be lead antibacterial agents.
