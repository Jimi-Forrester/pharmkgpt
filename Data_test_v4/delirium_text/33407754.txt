33407754|t|The child with medical complexity.
33407754|a|Children with medical complexity represent a big challenge for the physicians, their families and the society as well. Although there is no clear definition of this type of patients, they are affected by a chronic, often very severe condition for their whole life. They also represent a huge cost for the health care system due to their needs of continuous assistance.In this review we summarized the definitions of child with medical complexity. Then we illustrated the strategies to treat and take care of these children in order to look at them not as a burden or a cost but as an opportunity to growth and improve as clinicians and to improve the society, to give them the best life they can live.We also wanted to give voice to the physicians, the parents and the children themselves to really show and understand what are their experiences and their feelings in dealing with their conditions. We concluded with the description of one example of children with medical complexity: prematurity. We discussed the progresses in their treatment so far in order to illustrate what is the future of pediatrics. Since it has been more and more acknowledged that every child with medical complexity is unique, the future of pediatric is to organize an individualized approach and to "see things with the eye of a child".
