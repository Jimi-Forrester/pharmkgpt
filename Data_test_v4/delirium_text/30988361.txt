30988361|t|Selenium nanoparticles for targeted stroke therapy through modulation of inflammatory and metabolic signaling.
30988361|a|Ischemic cerebral stroke is a major cause of death and morbidity. Currently, no neuroprotective agents have been shown to impact the clinical outcomes in cerebral stroke cases. Here, we report therapeutic effects of Se nanoparticles on ischemic stroke in a murine model. Anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (OX26)-PEGylated Se nanoparticles (OX26-PEG-Se NPs) were designed and synthesized and their neuroprotective effects were measured using in vitro and in vivo approaches. We demonstrate that administration of the biodegradable nanoparticles leads to resolution of brain edema, protection of axons in hippocampus region, and myelination of hippocampal area after cerebral ischemic stroke. Our nanoparticle design ensures efficient targeting and minimal side effects. Hematological and biochemical analyses revealed no undesired NP-induced changes. To gain mechanistic insights into the therapeutic effects of these particles, we characterized the changes to the relevant inflammatory and metabolic signaling pathways. We assessed metabolic regulator mTOR and related signaling pathways such as hippo, Ubiquitin-proteasome system (ERK5), Tsc1/Tsc2 complex, FoxO1, wnt/beta-catenine signaling pathway. Moreover, we examined the activity of jak2/stat3 signaling pathways and Adamts1, which are critically involved in inflammation. Together, our study provides a promising treatment strategy for cerebral stroke based on Se NP induced suppression of excessive inflammation and oxidative metabolism.
