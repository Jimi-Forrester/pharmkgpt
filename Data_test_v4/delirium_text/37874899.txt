37874899|a|The expression of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), a pathological indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD), was reported to be inapparent in the early stage of AD. While peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is produced excessively and emerges earlier than Abeta plaques in the progression of AD, it is thus significant to sensitively detect ONOO- for early diagnosis of AD and its pathological research. Herein, we unveiled an integrated sensor for monitoring ONOO-, which consisted of a commercially available field-effect transistor (FET) and a high-performance multi-engineered graphene extended-gate (EG) electrode. In the configuration of the presented EG electrode, laser-induced graphene (LIG) intercalated with MnO2 nanoparticles (MnO2/LIG) can improve the electrical properties of LIG and the sensitivity of the sensor, and graphene oxide (GO)-MnO2/Hemin nanozyme with ONOO- isomerase activity can selectively trigger the isomerization of ONOO- to NO3-. With this synergistic effect, our EG-FET sensor can respond to the ONOO- with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, taking advantage of our EG-FET sensor, we modularly assembled a portable sensing platform for wireless tracking ONOO- levels in the brain tissue of AD transgenic mice at earlier stages before massive Abeta plaques appeared, and we systematically explored the complex role of ONOO- in the occurrence and development of AD.
