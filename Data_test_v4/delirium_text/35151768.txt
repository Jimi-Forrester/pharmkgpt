35151768|a|Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, or ACE2, is primarily a zinc-dependent peptidase and ectoenzyme expressed in numerous cell types and functioning as a counterbalance to ACE in the renin-angiotensin system. It was discovered 21 years ago more than 40 years after the discovery of ACE itself. Its primary physiological activity is believed to be in the conversion of angiotensin II to the vasodilatory angiotensin-(1-7) acting through the Mas receptor. As such it has been implicated in numerous pathological conditions, largely in a protective mode which has led to the search for ACE2 activatory mechanisms. ACE2 has a diverse substrate specificity allowing its participation in multiple peptide pathways. It also regulates aspects of amino acid transport through its homology with a membrane protein, collectrin. It also serves as a viral receptor for the SARS virus, and subsequently SARS-CoV2, driving the current COVID-19 pandemic. ACE2 therefore provides a therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID and understanding the biological events following viral binding can provide insight into the multiple pathologies caused by the virus, particularly inflammatory and vascular. In part this may relate to the ability of ACE2, like ACE, to be shed from the cell membrane. The shed form of ACE2 (sACE2) may be a factor in determining susceptibility to certain COVID pathologies. Hence, for just over 20 years, ACE2 has provided numerous surprises in the field of vasoactive peptides with, no doubt, more to come but it is its central role in COVID pathology that is producing the current intense interest in its biology.
