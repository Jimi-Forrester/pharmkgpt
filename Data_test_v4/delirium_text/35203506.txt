35203506|a|The cell-to-cell transmission of tau aggregates is considered a mechanism underlying the intracerebral spreading of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Recent studies suggest that tau oligomers, rather than fibrils, participate in this process. We previously showed that intranasal rifampicin inhibits tau oligomer accumulation and improves cognition in tauopathy mice. In the present study, we examined the effects of nasal rifampicin on tau propagation in a new mouse model of tauopathy. A tau oligomer-rich fraction prepared from the brain of an AD patient was injected into a unilateral hippocampus of tau264 mice that express both 3-repeat and 4-repeat wild-type human tau. Rifampicin administration was started one week after the injection and performed three times a week for 24 weeks. Cognitive function and tau pathology were assessed by the Morris water maze test and brain section staining. Rifampicin treatment inhibited the spreading of tau oligomers from the injection site to other brain regions and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the entorhinal cortex. Synapse and neuronal loss in the hippocampus were also prevented, and cognitive function remained normal. These results suggest that intranasal rifampicin could be a promising remedy that halts the progression of tauopathy by inhibiting tau oligomer propagation.
