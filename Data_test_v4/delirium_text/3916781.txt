3916781|t|Management of Reye's syndrome.
3916781|a|Reye's syndrome is a potentially devastating neurologic illness seen predominantly in children following a viral prodrome. The cause is unknown. The clinical history and laboratory presentation are stereotypical and easy to recognize if the clinician considers the diagnosis. Neurologic dysfunction is characterized by lethargy, obtundation, persistent vomiting, agitated delirium, and coma. Death is secondary to severe cerebral swelling with elevation of intracranial pressure. Although no specific therapy has been clearly demonstrated to be superior in terms of outcome, most clinicians have adopted a management scheme aimed at lowering and controlling the elevated ICP. We have described the management protocol in use at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The protocol is summarized in the Appendix for the convenience of the reader.
