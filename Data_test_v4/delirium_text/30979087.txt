30979087|a|The effect of elicitation with jasmonic acids (JA) and yeast extract (YE) on the production of phenolic compounds as well as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of phenolic extracts of lovage was evaluated. The analysis of phenolic compounds carried out with the UPLC-MS technique indicated that rutin was the dominant flavonoid, while 5-caffeoylquinic acid was the main component in the phenolic acid fraction in the lovage leaves. The application of 10 microM JA increased the content of most of the identified phenolic compounds. The highest antioxidant activities estimated as free radical scavenging activity against ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and reducing power were determined for the sample elicited with 10 microM JA, while this value determined as iron chelating ability was the highest for the 0.1% YE-elicited lovage. The 0.1% and 1% YE elicitation also caused significant elevation of the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibition ability, while all the concentrations of the tested elicitors significantly improved the ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (best results were detected for the 10 microM JA and 0.1% YE2 sample). Thus, 0.1% yeast extract and 10 microM jasmonic acid proved to be most effective in elevation of the biological activity of lovage.
