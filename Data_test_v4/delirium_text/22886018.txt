22886018|t|Validation of a multiplex assay for simultaneous quantification of amyloid-beta peptide species in human plasma with utility for measurements in studies of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.
22886018|a|The aim of this study was to validate the INNO-BIA plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) forms assay for quantification of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 according to regulatory guidance for bioanalysis and demonstrate its fitness for clinical trial applications. Validation parameters were evaluated by repeated testing of human EDTA-plasma pools. In 6 separate estimates, intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for repeated testing of 5 plasma pools were <=9% and relative error (RE) varied between -35% and +22%. Inter-assay CV (n = 36) ranged from 5% to 17% and RE varied from -17% to +8%. Dilutional linearity was not demonstrated for either analyte using diluent buffer, but dilution with immuno-depleted plasma by 1.67-fold gave results within 20% of target. Analyte stability was demonstrated in plasma at 2-8  C for up to 6 h. Stability during frozen storage up to 12 months and through 3 freeze-thaw cycles at <= -70  C was also demonstrated in 5 of 6 individuals but deteriorated thereafter. Neither semagacestat nor LY2811376 interfered with the assay but solanezumab at 500 mg/L reduced recovery of Abeta1-42 by 53%. Specimens from a Phase I human volunteer study of the beta-secretase inhibitor LY2811376 were tested at baseline and at intervals up to 12 h after single oral doses, demonstrating a clear treatment effect. During 1,041 clinical assay runs from semagacestat studies over 10 months, the CV for plasma quality control pools at three levels were <=15% and RE were <10%. In conclusion, the INNO-BIA plasma assay was successfully validated and qualified for use in clinical research.
