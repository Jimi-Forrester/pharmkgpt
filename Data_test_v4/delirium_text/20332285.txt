20332285|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious clinical problem for hospitalized patients and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and increased healthcare costs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the preliminary usefulness of a novel delirium training program to improve nurses' self-confidence in caring for patients with delirium. METHOD: One or more nurses were selected from each ward to become the "delirium-link nurses," and these nurses would then pass on their special training to the other nurses in their ward. RESULTS: The outcome was evaluated with a self-reported 15-item measure to assess self-confidence. A total of 390 nurses, including 32 delirium-link nurses, participated in this program. A significant effect was observed for 12 of the 15 items. CONCLUSION: This brief program can improve nurses' self-confidence in treating delirium patients; however, more work is needed to improve nurses' ability to detect delirium early.
