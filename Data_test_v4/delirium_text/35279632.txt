35279632|a|The use of starch based nanoparticles have gained momentum in stabilizing pickering emulsions for it's numerous advantages. In present study resistant starch (RS) was isolated from lotus stem using enzymatic digestion and subjected to nanoprecipitation and ultrasonication to yield resistant starch nanoparticles (RSN). RSN of varying concentrations (2%, 10% and 20%) were used to stabilize the flax seed-oil water mixture to form pickering emulsions. The emulsions were used to nanoencapsulate ferulic acid (FA) - a well known bioactive via ultrasonication. The emulsions were lyophilized to form FA loaded lyophilized pickering emulsion (FA-LPE). The FA-LPE (2%, 10 % and 20%) were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infra-spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). AFM showed FA-LPE as spherical droplets embedded in the matrix with maximum peak height of 8.47 nm and maximum pit height of 1.69 nm. SEM presented FA-LPE as an irregular and continuous surface having multiple folds and holes. The ATR-FTIR spectra of all the samples displayed peaks of C = C aromatic rings of FA at 1600 cm-1 and 1439 cm-1, signifying successful encapsulation. In vitro release assay displayed more controlled release of FA from FA-LPE (20%). Bioactivity of FA-LPE was evaluated in terms of anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and prevention against oxidative damage under simulated gastro-intestinal conditions (SGID). The bioactivity of FA-LPE (20%) was significantly higher than FA-LPE (2%) and FA-LPE (10%). Key findings reveal that pickering emulsions can prevent FA under harsh SGID conditions and provide an approach to facilitate the design of pickering emulsions with high stability for nutraceutical delivery in food and supplement products.
