35966933|a|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that causes dysfunction in respiration. Since late 2019, this virus has infected and killed millions of people around the world and imposed many medical and therapeutic problems in the form of a pandemic. According to recent data, COVID-19 disease can increase the risk of stroke, which can be deadly or cause many neurological disorders after the disease. During the last two years, many efforts have been made to introduce new therapies for management of COVID-19-related complications, including stroke. To achieve this goal, several conventional drugs have been investigated for their possible therapeutic roles. Minocycline, a broad-spectrum, long-acting antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, is one such conventional drug that should be considered for treating COVID-19-related stroke, as indirect evidence indicates that it exerts neuroprotective effects, can modulate stroke occurrence, and can play an effective and strategic role in management of the molecular signals caused by stroke and its destructive consequences. The matrix metalloprotease (MMP) signaling pathway is one of the main signaling pathways involved in the occurrence and exacerbation of stroke; however, its role in COVID-19-induced stroke and the possible role of minocycline in the management of this signaling pathway in patients with COVID-19 is unclear and requires further investigation. Based on this concept, we hypothesize that minocycline might act via MMP signaling as a neuroprotective agent against COVID-19-induced neurological dysfunction, particularly stroke.
