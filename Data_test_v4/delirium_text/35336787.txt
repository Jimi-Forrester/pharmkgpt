35336787|t|Small but Mighty-Exosomes, Novel Intercellular Messengers in Neurodegeneration.
35336787|a|Exosomes of endosomal origin are one class of extracellular vesicles that are important in intercellular communication. Exosomes are released by all cells in our body and their cargo consisting of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids has a footprint reflective of their parental origin. The exosomal cargo has the power to modulate the physiology of recipient cells in the vicinity of the releasing cells or cells at a distance. Harnessing the potential of exosomes relies upon the purity of exosome preparation. Hence, many methods for isolation have been developed and we provide a succinct summary of several methods. In spite of the seclusion imposed by the blood-brain barrier, cells in the CNS are not immune from exosomal intrusive influences. Both neurons and glia release exosomes, often in an activity-dependent manner. A brief description of exosomes released by different cells in the brain and their role in maintaining CNS homeostasis is provided. The hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of protein aggregates. Recent studies implicate exosomes' intercellular communicator role in the spread of misfolded proteins aiding the propagation of pathology. In this review, we discuss the potential contributions made by exosomes in progression of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Understanding contributions made by exosomes in pathogenesis of neurodegeneration opens the field for employing exosomes as therapeutic agents for drug delivery to brain since exosomes do cross the blood-brain barrier.
