19449521|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and one of the earliest sings of AD is deficit in short term memory. Till now, the pathogenesis of AD has not been elucidated and the present one-drug-one-target paradigm of anti-AD-drug treatment seems not to be effective in clinic. Multi-target-directed anti-AD-drugs are those agents that may act on two or more targets implicated in AD. Based on the brief introduction of progress in the development of present anti-AD-drugs, the paper mainly focused on the advances in the field of multi-target-directed drug development both home and abroad, especially those studies on selective estrogen receptor modulators.
