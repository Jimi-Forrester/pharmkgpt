38523764|a|Bell's mania is the co-occurrence of delirium and mania. We present two cases of Bell's mania in a neurosurgical setting. The first case is of a 52-year-old male who presented with holocranial headache, disorientation, and manic symptoms for five months. He was found to have suprasellar craniopharyngioma. He significantly improved with olanzapine, but re-emergence of mood symptoms was noted after surgery. The second case is of a 42-year-old male who presented with a 15-day history of seizures and disorientation. He was found to have a dural arteriovenous fistula. He developed Bell's mania in the post-procedural period, which improved with olanzapine. Compression of the hypothalamo-pituitary stalk in the first case and vascular and inflammatory changes in the second case could have led to Bell's mania. Atypical age of onset and presence of neurological symptoms in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms should raise the suspicion of an underlying organicity. Atypical anti-psychotics can be a useful management strategy for Bell's mania.
