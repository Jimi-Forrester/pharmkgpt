36389201|a|Introduction: Various classes of antibiotics have been linked to causing a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. These manifestations range from psychosis and delirium to encephalitis and intracranial hypertension. The prevalence of psychosis adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for individual antibiotics ranges from 0.3 to 3.8%. We report a rare case of linezolid-induced psychosis and hallucination. Case presentation: We report a 52-year-old Asian gentleman who presented with an altered level of consciousness and hallucinations. He was treated for third-degree burns of 31% of the body for two months. Based on clinical and laboratory investigations, linezolid-induced psychosis and hallucination were diagnosed. His Naranjo probability score was +8. The drug was stopped, and the patient recovered successfully. Conclusion: On rare occasions, toxic blood levels of linezolid can lead to neuropsychiatric manifestations. Both linezolid-induced psychosis and hallucinations are manageable by suspension of the drug. Therefore, physicians should monitor the blood levels of this antibiotic to keep their patients safe from such serious adverse effects.
