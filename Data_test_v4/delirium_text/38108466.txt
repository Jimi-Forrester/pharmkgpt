38108466|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications occur in up to 43% of patients after surgery, resulting in increased morbidity and economic burden. Prehabilitation has the potential to increase patients' preoperative health status and thereby improve postoperative outcomes. However, reported results of prehabilitation are contradictory. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of prehabilitation on postoperative outcomes (postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, pain at postoperative day 1) in patients undergoing elective surgery. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs published between January 2006 and June 2023 comparing prehabilitation programmes lasting >=14 days to 'standard of care' (SOC) and reporting postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO. The primary outcome examined was the effect of uni- or multimodal prehabilitation on 30-day complications. Secondary outcomes were length of ICU and hospital stay (LOS) and reported pain scores. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (including 2090 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio) met the inclusion criteria. Average methodological study quality was moderate. There was no difference between prehabilitation and SOC groups in regard to occurrence of postoperative complications (OR = 1.02, 95% c.i. 0.93 to 1.13; P = 0.10; I2 = 34%), total hospital LOS (-0.13 days; 95% c.i. -0.56 to 0.28; P = 0.53; I2 = 21%) or reported postoperative pain. The ICU LOS was significantly shorter in the prehabilitation group (-0.57 days; 95% c.i. -1.10 to -0.04; P = 0.03; I2 = 46%). Separate comparison of uni- and multimodal prehabilitation showed no difference for either intervention. CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation reduces ICU LOS compared with SOC in elective surgery patients but has no effect on overall complication rates or total LOS, regardless of modality. Prehabilitation programs need standardization and specific targeting of those patients most likely to benefit.
