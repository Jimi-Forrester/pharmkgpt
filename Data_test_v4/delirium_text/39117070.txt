39117070|t|Maresin1 restrains chronic inflammation and Abeta production to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease via modulating ADAM10/17 and its associated neuroprotective signal pathways: A pilot study.
39117070|a|Chronic inflammation is an important pathogenetic factor that leads to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) play critical role in regulating inflammatory responses during AD pathogenesis. Maresin1 (MaR1) is the latest discovered SPMs, and it is found that MaR1 improves AD cognitive impairment by regulating neurotrophic pathways to protect AD synapses and reduce Abeta production, which made MaR1 as candidate agent for AD treatment. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms are still largely known. In this study, the AD mice and cellular models were subjected to MaR1 treatment, and we found that MaR1 reduced Abeta production to ameliorate AD-related symptoms and increased the expression levels of ADAM10/17, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta to exert its anti-inflammatory role. In addition, as it was determined by Western Blot analysis, we observed that MaR1 could affected the neuroprotective signal pathways. Specifically, MaR1 downregulated p57NTR and upregulated TrkA to activate the p75NTR/TrkA signal pathway, and it could increase the expression levels of p-PI3K and p-Akt, and downregulated p-mTOR to activate the PI3K/AKT/ERK/mTOR pathway. Finally, we verified the role of ADAM10/17 in regulating AD progression, and we found that silencing of ADAM10/17 inactivated the above neuroprotective signal pathways to aggravate AD pathogenesis. In conclusion, MaR1 is verified as potential therapeutic agent for AD by eliminating Abeta production, upregulating ADAM10/17, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, and activating the neuroprotective p75NTR/TrkA pathway and the PI3K/AKT/ERK/mTOR pathway.
