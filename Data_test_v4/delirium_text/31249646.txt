31249646|t|The Effects of Age and Reproduction on the Lipidome of Caenorhabditis elegans.
31249646|a|Aging is a complex life process, and a unified view is that metabolism plays key roles in all biological processes. Here, we determined the lipidomic profile of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) using ultraperformance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). Using a nontargeted approach, we detected approximately 3000 species. Analysis of the lipid metabolic profiles at young adult and ten-day-old ages among wild-type N2, glp-1 defective mutant, and double mutant daf-16;glp-1 uncovered significant age-related differences in the total amount of phosphatidylcholines (PC), sphingomyelins (SM), ceramides (Cer), diglycerides (DG), and triglycerides (TG). In addition, the age-associated lipid profiles were characterized by ratio of polyunsaturated (PUFA) over monounsaturated (MUFA) lipid species. Lipid metabolism modulation plays an important role in reproduction-regulated aging; to identify the variations of lipid metabolites during germ line loss-induced longevity, we investigated the lipidomic profiles of long-lived glp-1/notch receptor mutants, which have reproductive deficiency when grown at nonpermissive temperature. The results showed that there was some age-related lipid variation, including TG 40:2, TG 40:1, and TG 41:1, which contributed to the long-life phenotype. The longevity of glp-1 mutant was daf-16-dependent; the lipidome analysis of daf-16;glp-1 double mutant revealed that the changes of some metabolites in the glp-1 mutant were daf-16-dependent, while other metabolites displayed more complex epistatic patterns. We first conducted a comprehensive lipidome analysis to provide novel insights into the relationships between longevity and lipid metabolism regulated by germ line signals in C. elegans.
