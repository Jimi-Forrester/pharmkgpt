38262944|a|BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare complication during or after angiography, usually transient and reversible. CIE diagnosis is challenging due to the absence of no formal diagnostic criteria. CIE can mimic stroke symptoms, including visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, coma, and focal neurological deficits. This case reports neurological deficit reversal in a CIE patient due to the embolization of an intracranial aneurysm, the second angiographic procedure in six days. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for headaches. The cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The first digital subtraction angiography (DSA) identified an aneurysm of 4 mm * 3 mm in size in the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Then, embolization surgery was performed for the cerebral aneurysm, which was successful. However, the patient had post-operative headaches, slurred speech, epilepsy, limb weakness, and delirium post-procedure. The non-contrast cerebral CT indicated widespread edema in the right cerebral hemisphere. The patient was diagnosed with CIE and treated with symptomatic supportive therapy. Eventually, the patient's neurological deficits and cerebral edema improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The current case emphasized the importance of early diagnosis and symptomatic treatment of CIE. Thus, CIE should be the first consideration during the differential diagnosis of a patient having acute neurological impairment after repeated DSA.
