33778130|a|The uncertainty related to prevention and treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 due to lack of effective vaccine candidates or drug molecules has resulted in extensive spread of infection and mortality worldwide. Although the asymptomatic or mild patients are becoming healthy with regular over-the-counter medicines and proper rest and care, for the severe patients, in the absence of definite cure, different drug combinations are being used to treat on trial basis without the assurance of efficacy and safety. This scenario has however changed now with some medicines including antiviral Remdesivir and Favipiravir and anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone and tocilizumab which have shown some positive results in trials such as decreasing need of mechanical or non-invasive ventilation or mortality. Further, a number of vaccine candidates are currently in pipeline and in advance stages of clinical trials, which will enhance their prospects in determining how the disease will be controlled in the times to come. In this article, an account of the under-trial potential drugs and vaccine candidates has been provided, and their future prospects have been discussed.
