37393503|a|GRN mutations, causing frontotemporal dementia, can be associated with atypical white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We hypothesized that the presence of WMH may impact neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, markers of neuroaxonal damage. We analyzed plasma NfL in 20 GRN patients and studied their association to visually-scored WMH burden. The 12 patients displaying atypical WMH had significantly higher NfL levels (98.4+-34.9 pg/mL) than those without WMH (47.2+-29.4 pg/mL, p = 0.003), independently from age, disease duration and Fazekas-Schmidt grade. NfL correlated with WMH burden (rho = 0.55, p = 0.01). This study prompts considering WMH burden as a variability factor when evaluating NfL levels in GRN patients.
