36980299|t|Reduced Levels of Misfolded and Aggregated Mutant p53 by Proteostatic Activation.
36980299|a|In malignant cancer, excessive amounts of mutant p53 often lead to its aggregation, a feature that was recently identified as druggable. Here, we describe that induction of a heat shock-related stress response mediated by Foldlin, a small-molecule tool compound, reduces the protein levels of misfolded/aggregated mutant p53, while contact mutants or wild-type p53 remain largely unaffected. Foldlin also prevented the formation of stress-induced p53 nuclear inclusion bodies. Despite our inability to identify a specific molecular target, Foldlin also reduced protein levels of aggregating SOD1 variants. Finally, by screening a library of 778 FDA-approved compounds for their ability to reduce misfolded mutant p53, we identified the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib with similar cellular effects as Foldlin. Overall, the induction of a cellular heat shock response seems to be an effective strategy to deal with pathological protein aggregation. It remains to be seen however, how this strategy can be translated to a clinical setting.
