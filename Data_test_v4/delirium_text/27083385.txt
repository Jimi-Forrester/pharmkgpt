27083385|t|Mania associated with ranitidine: a case report and review of literature.
27083385|a|H2 receptor antagonists can be associated with central adverse drug reactions (ADRs), like confusion, delirium, hallucinations, slurred speech or headaches. We report here a 'serious' case of severe mania leading to hospitalization in a 42-year-old alcohol-dependent man, 4 days after ranitidine introduction. Review of literature showed that this 'very rare' ADR occurs mainly in patients with predisposing factors: age, decrease in renal and/or hepatic function, polymedication, alcohol. Knowledge of this ADR can be particularly important for these drugs widely used as self-medication.
