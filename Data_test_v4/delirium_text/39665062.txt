39665062|t|The YSK Olfactory Function Test: Development of a New Korean Olfactory Test.
39665062|a|Olfaction is an important aspect of quality of life, beyond simply smelling food and recognizing danger. Recently, research has focused on its association with various diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases or viral infections. The evaluation of olfactory function must take into consideration the cultural experience of the target group. A new Korean culturefriendly olfactory function test, the YSK olfactory function test (YOF test, Kimex Co.), uses safe odorants, such as phenyl-ethyl alcohol (PEA) (not n-butanol), for the threshold test. Furthermore, odorants in the YOF identification test reflect each of eight major chemical functional groups. The diagnostic cut-off for anosmia was a Threshold Discrimination Identification (TDI) score of <=14.5 and that for hyposmia was 14.5<TDI<=21.0. The YOF test showed relevant diagnostic validity for olfactory dysfunction when compared with the Korean version of the Sniffin' Stick-II test. In this review, we share our experiences developing a new Korean-friendly olfactory function test.
