37790391|t|Occupational Exposures in Commercial Laundry and Dry Cleaning Industries and their Associative Cancers: A Scoping Review.
37790391|a|Background The laundry and dry cleaning industries are critical for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in our daily lives. However, these industries have also been identified as sources of hazardous chemical exposure for workers, leading to potentially severe health implications. Despite mounting evidence that solvents like perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene are carcinogenic to humans, they remain the most commonly used solvents in the industry. In addition, while alternative solvents are increasingly being utilized in response to evidence of adverse health and environmental effects, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the potential risks associated with exposure to these new agents. Methods A systematic scoping review was conducted to identify prevalent toxic substances in the commercial laundry and dry cleaning industries that workers are exposed to and, further, to identify gaps in the existing literature regarding those exposures and related cancer development. Reported study exposure values were compared with current occupational exposure limits and biological exposure indices. Results Most studies examined perchloroethylene exposure in the dry cleaning industry, with one notable finding being that genotoxic effects were found even below current occupational exposure limits. Separate studies on TCE and benzene presented varied exposure levels and health risks, raising concern due to their IARC Group 1 carcinogen classification. Lastly, data on alternative solvents was limited, with a lack of health outcome data and gaps in their exposure guidelines and carcinogenic classifications. Conclusion A gap in research exists regarding health outcomes, particularly cancer development, from solvent exposure in the dry cleaning industry. Most studies (66%) overlooked health implications, especially for emerging solvents. Further, results showed potential DNA damage from the established solvent, perchloroethylene, even below current occupational exposure limits, emphasizing the need to reevaluate safety limits. As alternative solvents like butylal and high-flashpoint hydrocarbons become more prevalent, investigations into the effects of their exposure are necessary to safeguard workers' health.
