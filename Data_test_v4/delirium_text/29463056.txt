29463056|t|A Comparative Assessment of Biological Effects and Chemical Profile of Italian Asphodeline lutea Extracts.
29463056|a|The present study aims to highlight the therapeutic potential of Asphodeline lutea (AL), a wild edible plant of the Mediterranean diet. Roots, aerial parts, and flowers of AL at two different phenological stages were collected from three locations in Italy. The inhibitory activities of extracts on strategic enzymes linked to human diseases were assessed. The antioxidant properties were evaluated in vitro, using six standard bioassays. The phenolic and anthraquinone profiles were also established using HPLC-PDA. Zinc, cadmium, lead, and copper contents were also determined. All the samples inhibited acetylcholinesterase (from 1.51 to 2.20 mg GALAEs/g extract), tyrosinase (from 7.50 to 25.3 mg KAEs/g extract), and alpha-amylase (from 0.37 to 0.51 mmol ACAEs/g extract). Aloe-emodin and physcion were present in all parts, while rhein was not detected. The phenolic profile and the heavy metals composition of specimens gathered from three different regions of Italy were different. It can be argued that samples collected near the street can contain higher concentrations of heavy metals. The experimental data confirm that the A. lutea species could be considered as a potential source of bioactive metabolites, and its consumption could play a positive and safe role in human health maintenance.
