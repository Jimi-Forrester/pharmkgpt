This research is to explore the potential molecular biological mechanisms of brain damage following cardiac surgery in preoperative CS rats by the analyses combining proteomics and metabolomics. METHODS: We constructed the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and cardiac surgery models in adult rats. We proved the brain injury in CUS cardiac surgery rats by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining, followed by separating the hippocampal tissue and investigating the potential mechanisms of brain injury by the methods of data-independent acquisition proteomics and untargeted metabolomics. RESULTS: The signaling pathways of glycoproteins and metabolism of amino acids were the main possible mechanisms of brain injury in CUS rats following cardiac surgery according to the proteomics and metabolomics. In addition, the pathways of animo acids metabolism such as the pathways of lysine degradation and beta-alanine metabolism may be the main mechanism of cardiac surgery related brain injury in preoperative CUS rats. CONCLUSIONS: The pathways of animo acids metabolism such as lysine degradation and beta-alanine metabolism may be the potential mechanisms of brain injury in CUS rats following cardiac surgery. We should focus on the varieties of bioproteins and metabolites in these pathways, and related changes in other signaling pathways induced by the two pathways.
