35754664|a|Background and Aim: Parkinson's disease (PD) a neurodegenerative disorder for which no preventive or long term effective treatment strategies are available. Epidemiological studies have failed to identify specific environmental, dietary or lifestyle factors for PD. However oxidative stress in the substantia nigra (SN) and Corpus striatum is the most broadly accepted hypothesis for the etiopathology of PD. Many experiments state the notion that augmentation of neurotrophic factors and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factors, could prevent or halt the progress of neurodegeneration in PD. Material and Methods: The present study was designed to assess the motor behaviour with apomorphine injection and level of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants after transplantation of Human Amniotic Epithelial (HAE) cells in 2,4,5 trihydroxyphenylethylamine (6-OHDA) lesioned striatum in rats. Results: Human Amniotic Epithelial (HAE) cells ameliorated 6-OHDA induced changes in rotational behaviour and modulated the antioxidants. 6-OHDA induced neurotoxicity by the generation of free radicals was pronounced by indication of increased Lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and decrease in antioxidants level. The present result suggest that increased free radicals and the decrease in the antioxidant defence system possibly lead to structural and functional alterations in membrane-related events and play significant role of the 6-OHDA induced neurotoxicity. In HAE cells transplanted animals the level of LPO was significantly reduced in striatum (36%) and moderately reduced (20%) in midbrain of the 6-OHDA lesioned animals. Conclusion: These alterations were found to be recovered after the HAE cells graft during long term. The 6-OHDA induced neurotoxicity by the generation of free radicals was pronounced by indication of the increased LPO level, decrease in antioxidants and alteration in the dopamine and its metabolites.
