33316730|t|Effect of aluminum combined with ApoEepsilon4 on Tau phosphorylation and Abeta deposition.
33316730|a|BACKGROUND: Aluminum is an environmental neurotoxin widely exposed to animals and humans. Studies have shown that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by abnormally phosphorylated tau and Abeta deposition, aluminum exposure can lead to abnormal phosphorylated tau and Abeta deposition. Numerous epidemiological data and studies have confirmed that ApoEepsilon4 is a risk factor for AD. However, whether there is an interaction effect between aluminum and ApoEepsilon4 has yet to be verified. METHODS: SH-SY5Y cells were exposed with AlCl3 and transfected with ApoEepsilon4 respectively. The experimental groups included the blank control group, the low dose group (200 muM AlCl3), the medium dose group (400 muM AlCl3), the high dose group (800 muM AlCl3), empty plasmid group, ApoEepsilon4 group and 400 muM AlCl3+ApoEepsilon4 group. The cell viability was determined by CCK-8 kit after transfection for 48 h.The contents of total tau proteins, tau-181, tau-231, tau-262, tau-396 and Abeta42, were determined by ELISA kit. The interaction between AlCl3 and ApoEepsilon4 was analyzed by factorial design. RESULTS: With the increase of aluminum exposure, SH-SY5Y cell viability decreased, and the expression of the total tau, tau-181, tau-231, tau-262, tau-396 and Abeta content increased. The viability of cells transfected with ApoEepsilon4 is significantly lower than control group, and the expressions of total tau, tau-181, tau-231, tau-262, tau-396 and Abeta in ApoEepsilon4 transfected cells were significantly higher than control group. The viability of cells treated with AlCl3 plus ApoEepsilon4 was lower than those treated with, either AlCl3, or ApoEepsilon4. The expression of total tau, tau-181, tau-231, tau-262, tau-396 and Abeta in the cells treated with AlCl3 plus ApoEepsilon4 were significantly higher than those in other groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, analyzing data based on the factorial design, there was existed an interaction between AlCl3 and ApoEepsilon4 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Al and ApoEepsilon4 gene can cause morphological changes of SH-SY5Y cells, reduce cell activity, and have obvious cytotoxic effects, and increase the phosphorylation levels of tau and the deposition of Abeta increases. In the presence of both Al and ApoEepsilon4 genes, the two factors interact with each other and show a synergistic effect.
