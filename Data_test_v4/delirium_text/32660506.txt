32660506|a|BACKGROUND: Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score is calculated using laboratory values, including serum albumin, total cholesterol concentration, and total lymphocyte count; it is reportedly valuable for making nutritional assessments. One advantage of CONUT score over other nutritional assessments is that it can be calculated retrospectively using only objective laboratory values. Studies demonstrated that CONUT score was a useful tool for predicting prognosis and complications in various surgical conditions. Nevertheless, few studies utilized the score as a potential predictive marker for postoperative complications among hip fracture patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between CONUT score and postoperative complications in hip fracture patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 211 elderly patients who underwent hip fracture surgery at a single institution from 2013 to 2018. CONUT score was calculated using preoperative routine laboratory tests for serum albumin, total cholesterol concentration, and total lymphocyte count. As potential confounders, we extracted data such as patient age, sex, fracture type, and general conditions/comorbidities, as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) classification and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Postoperative complications were defined as a Clavien-Dindo classification of 1 or more. Simple and multivaribale logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the incidence of postoperative complications as the outcome measures. RESULTS: The mean age [IQR] was 86 [80-90], and 80.1% of the reviewed patients were female. Based on the CONUT scores, 78.7% of hip fracture patients were classified as malnourished; 18% experienced postoperative complications. Simple analyses revealed significant risk factors for postoperative complications, including age, the ASA-PS, the CCI, and the CONUT score. Multivariable analysis found that CONUT score was the independent risk factor for postoperative complications (odd ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.45, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CONUT scores are independently associated with the incidence of postoperative complications. CONUT score can be used for risk assessment in hip fracture patients to predict early postoperative complications.
