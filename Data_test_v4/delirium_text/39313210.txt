39313210|t|Pharmacologic Treatment Strategies for Delirium in Hospitalized Adults: Past, Present, and Future.
39313210|a|Despite the use of multidomain prevention strategies, delirium still frequently occurs in hospitalized adults. With delirium often associated with undesirable symptoms and deleterious outcomes, including cognitive decline, treatment is important. Risk-factor reduction and the protocolized use of multidomain, nonpharmacologic bundles remain the mainstay of delirium treatment. There is a current lack of strong evidence to suggest any pharmacologic intervention to treat delirium will help resolve it faster, reduce its symptoms (other than agitation), facilitate hospital throughput, or improve post-hospital outcomes including long-term cognitive function. With the exception of dexmedetomidine as a treatment of severe delirium-associated agitation in the ICU, current practice guidelines do not recommend the routine use of any pharmacologic intervention to treat delirium in any hospital population. Future research should focus on identifying and evaluating new pharmacologic delirium treatment interventions and addressing key challenges and gaps surrounding delirium treatment research.
