32288699|a|The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was a major challenge to health services around the world. Previous experiences with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian Influenza A (H5N1) prompted initiation of formal pandemic planning. Essential and desirable features of pandemic plans include preparation for surveillance, investigation of cases, treatment modalities, prevention of community spread, maintenance of essential services, research and evaluation, and implementation, testing and revision of the plan. The experience of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic for emergency departments and their staff was problematic. The pace of the pandemic, coupled with untested pandemic plans, presented a unique range of challenges. In this paper, the contemporary challenges with respect to pandemic influenza prevention, control, and treatment are examined. The lessons learned are critical to our response to future pandemics, which are inevitable.
