35665063|t|In Situ Formation of Bi2MoO6-Bi2S3 Heterostructure: A Proof-Of-Concept Study for Photoelectrochemical Bioassay of l-Cysteine.
35665063|a|A novel signal-increased photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for l-cysteine (L-Cys) was proposed based on the Bi2MoO6-Bi2S3 heterostructure formed in situ on the indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode. To fabricate the PEC biosensor, Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles were prepared by a hydrothermal method and coated on a bare ITO electrode. When L-Cys existed, Bi2S3 was formed in situ on the interface of the Bi2MoO6/ITO electrode by a chemical displacement reaction. Under the visible light irradiation, the Bi2MoO6-Bi2S3/ITO electrode exhibited evident enhancement in photocurrent response compared with the Bi2MoO6/ITO electrode, owing to the signal-increased sensing system and the excellent property of the formed Bi2MoO6-Bi2S3 heterostructure such as the widened light absorption range and efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Under the optimal conditions, the sensor for L-Cys detection has a linear range from 5.0 x 10-11 to 1.0 x 10-4 mol L-1 and a detection limit of 5.0 x 10-12 mol L-1. The recoveries ranging from 90.0% to 110.0% for determining L-Cys in human serum samples validated the applicability of the biosensor. This strategy not only provides a method for L-Cys detection but also broadens the application of the PEC bioanalysis based on in situ formation of photoactive materials.
