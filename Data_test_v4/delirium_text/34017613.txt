34017613|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite an increasing number of elderly individuals undergoing surgical fixation for ankle fractures, few studies have investigated peri-operative outcomes and safety of surgery in an octogenarian and nonagenarian population (age >80 years). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 2012-2017 American College of Surgeons database was queried for patients undergoing open reduction internal fixation for isolated uni-malleolar, bi-malleolar and tri-malleolar ankle fractures. The study cohort was divided into 3 comparison groups (age <65 years, 65-75 and >80). Multi-variate regression analyzes were used to compare the independent effect of varying age groups on 30-day post-operative outcomes while controlling for baseline clinical characteristics and co-morbidity burdens. RESULTS: A total of 19,585 patients were included: 5.3% were >80 years, 18.1% were 65-79 years, and 76.6% were <65 years. When compared to the non-geriatric population, individuals >80 years were at a significantly Abstract: higher risk of 30-day wound complications (OR 1.84; p = 0.019), pulmonary complications (OR 3.88; p < 0.001), renal complications (OR 1.96; p = 0.015), septic complications (OR 3.72; p = 0.002), urinary tract infections (OR 2.24; p < 0.001), bleeding requiring transfusion (OR 1.90; p = 0.025), mortality (or 7.44; p < 0.001), readmissions (OR 1.65; p = 0.004) and non-home discharge (OR 13.91; p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Octogenarians undergoing ankle fracture fixation are a high-risk population in need of significant pre-operative surgical and medical optimization. With the majority of patients undergoing non-elective ORIF procedures, it is critical to anticipate potential complications and incorporate experienced geriatric providers early in the surgical management of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians and nonagenarians are fundamentally distinct and vulnerable age groups with a high risk of complications, readmissions, mortality and non-home discharges compared to other geriatric (65-79 years) and non-geriatric (<65 years) patients. Pre-operative counseling and risk-stratification are essential in this vulnerable patient population.
