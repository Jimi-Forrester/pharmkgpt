39600250|t|Factors Associated with Unplanned Intensive Care Unit Readmission Among Trauma Patients in Republic of Korea.
39600250|a|Background: In trauma patients, unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) readmission (UIR) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In this study, we aimed to analyze associated factors for UIR in trauma patients. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on trauma patients admitted to the ICU at a trauma center from January 2016 to December 2022. Clinical information at admission, the first ICU hospitalization, first discharge from the ICU, and reasons for readmission were collected. Patients who were successfully discharge from the ICU were compared to UIR patients. Logistic regression was performed to determine the factors with a significant impact on ICU readmission. Results: Here, 5,529 patients were admitted to the ICU over 7 years, and 212 patients (3.8%) experienced UIR. Among patients who experienced UIR, 9 (4.2%) died. In the UIR patients, hospital stay (20 days [interquartile range, 13-35] vs. 45 days [28-67], P<0.001), total ICU stay (5 days [3-11] vs. 17 days [9-35], P<0.001), and complications during the first ICU hospitalization were significantly higher. The most common reason for UIR was respiratory problem (53.8%). In multivariable analysis, cervical spine operation during the first ICU hospitalization (odds ratio, 6.56; 95% CI, 3.62-11.91; P<0.001), renal replacement therapy (RRT; 3.52, 2.06-5.99, P<0.001), and massive blood transfusion protocol (MTP; 1.74, 1.08-2.81, P=0.023) were most highly related with UIR. Conclusions: Because UIR patients had poor outcomes, trauma patients who underwent cervical spine operation, RRT, or MTP require monitoring in the general ward, especially for respiratory problems.
