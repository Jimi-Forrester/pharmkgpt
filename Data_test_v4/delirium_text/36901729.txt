36901729|t|Using Optogenetics to Model Cellular Effects of Alzheimer's Disease.
36901729|a|Across the world a dementia case is diagnosed every three seconds. Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes 50-60% of these cases. The most prominent theory for AD correlates the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) with the onset of dementia. Whether Abeta is causative remains unclear due to findings such as the recently approved drug Aducanumab showing effective clearance of Abeta, but not improving cognition. New approaches for understanding Abeta function, are therefore necessary. Here we discuss the application of optogenetic techniques to gain insight into AD. Optogenetics, or genetically encoded, light-dependent on/off switches, provides precise spatiotemporal control to regulate cellular dynamics. This precise control over protein expression and oligomerization or aggregation could provide a better understanding of the etiology of AD.
