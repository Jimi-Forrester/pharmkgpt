23543021|t|In-home air filtration for improving cardiovascular health: lessons from a CBPR study in public housing.
23543021|a|BACKGROUND: Particulate air pollution, including from motor vehicles, is associated with cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe lessons learned from installing air filtration units in public housing apartments next to a major highway. METHODS: We reviewed experience with recruitment, retention, and acceptance of the air filtration units. RESULTS: Recruitment and retention have been challenging, but similar to other studies in public housing. Equipment noise and overheated apartments during hot weather have been notable complaints from participants. In addition, we found that families with members with Alzheimer's or mental disability were less able to tolerate the equipment. CONCLUSIONS: For this research, the primary lesson is that working closely with each participant is important. A future public health program would need to address issues of noise and heat to make the intervention more acceptable to residents.
