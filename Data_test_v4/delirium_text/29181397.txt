29181397|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a very common complication in operative disciplines, especially in those elderly patients after cardiac surgery. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and POD in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colon carcinoma. METHODS: 160 elderly patients scheduled to undergo selective laparoscopic surgery for colon carcinoma were prospectively recruited in this present study. The preoperative demographic and medical characteristics, intraoperative variables, and postoperative complications were all recorded in detail. POD assessment was performed once a day for the first 3 days and at 7th day after surgery, respectively. CRP concentrations preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 were measured by using human enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Of all the 160 enrolled patients, 39 had suffered POD with a POD incidence of 24.4% within the first week after the operation. The univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis suggested preoperative CRP concentrations as the only independent predicator for POD in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colon carcinoma (OR: 5.87; 95% CI: 2.22-11.4; P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: This present study highlighted the predictive role of preoperative CRP concentrations for POD in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colon carcinoma.
