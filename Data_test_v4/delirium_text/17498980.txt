17498980|a|UNLABELLED: Delirium is common in many surgical settings. Patients undergoing elective vascular surgery may be at particular risk of developing delirium, and may have modifiable aetiological factors that can be addressed by pre-operative interventions. We decided to review the literature regarding the incidence and aetiology of delirium in elective vascular surgical patients. METHODS: We searched medical databases, journals and bibliographies to identify relevant studies. We used predetermined quality criteria for appraisal of the quality of incidence and aetiological studies. RESULTS: Four studies were identified as relevant to the review. The incidence of delirium ranged from 29.1% to 39.2%. The significant aetiological factors identified were age, pre-operative cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, inter-operative blood transfusion and previous amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is common in people undergoing elective vascular surgery. Further research is required to examine the effect on outcome of delirium, and the effect of psychiatric and geriatric medicine interventions in this setting.
