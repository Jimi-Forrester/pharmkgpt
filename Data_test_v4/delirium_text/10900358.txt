10900358|a|Inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report the presence of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and its ligand, IP-10, in normal and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. CXCR3 was detected constitutively on neurons and neuronal processes in various cortical and subcortical regions; IP-10 was observed in a subpopulation of astrocytes in normal brain, and was markedly elevated in astrocytes in AD brains. Many IP-10(+) astrocytes were associated with senile plaques and had an apparently coordinated upregulation of MIP-1beta. Moreover, we showed that CXCR3 ligands, IP-10 and Mig, were able to activate ERK1/2 pathway in mouse cortical neurons, suggesting a novel mechanism of neuronal-glial interaction.
