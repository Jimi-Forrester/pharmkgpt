34682830|t|Comparison of the Effects of Normocapnia and Mild Hypercapnia on the Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter and Regional Cerebral Oxygen Saturation in Patients Undergoing Gynecological Laparoscopy with Total Intravenous Anesthesia.
34682830|a|Cerebral hemodynamics may be altered by hypercapnia during a lung-protective ventilation (LPV), CO2 pneumoperitoneum, and Trendelenburg position during general anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of normocapnia and mild hypercapnia on the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), and intraoperative respiratory mechanics in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Sixty patients (aged between 19 and 65 years) scheduled for laparoscopic gynecological surgery in the Trendelenburg position. Patients under propofol/remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the normocapnia group (target PaCO2 = 35 mmHg, n = 30) or the hypercapnia group (target PaCO2 = 50 mmHg, n = 30). The ONSD, rSO2, and respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were measured at 5 min after anesthetic induction (Tind) in the supine position, and at 10 min and 40 min after pneumoperitoneum (Tpp10 and Tpp40, respectively) in the Trendelenburg position. There was no significant intergroup difference in change over time in the ONSD (p = 0.318). The ONSD increased significantly at Tpp40 when compared to Tind in both normocapnia and hypercapnia groups (p = 0.02 and 0.002, respectively). There was a significant intergroup difference in changes over time in the rSO2 (p < 0.001). The rSO2 decreased significantly in the normocapnia group (p = 0.01), whereas it increased significantly in the hypercapnia group at Tpp40 compared with Tind (p = 0.002). Alveolar dead space was significantly higher in the normocapnia group than in the hypercapnia group at Tpp40 (p = 0.001). In conclusion, mild hypercapnia during the LPV might not aggravate the increase in the ONSD during CO2 pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position and could improve rSO2 compared to normocapnia in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy with TIVA.
