37417545|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are frequently colonized by colibactin-producing Escherichia coli (CoPEC) (>40%), which enhances tumorigenesis in mouse models of CRC. We observed that 50% of CoPEC also contains the cnf1 gene, which encodes cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF1), an enhancer of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The impact of its co-occurrence with colibactin (Clb) has not yet been investigated. We evaluated the impact of CNF1 on colorectal tumorigenesis using human colonic epithelial HT-29 cells and CRC-susceptible ApcMin/+ mice inoculated with the CoPEC 21F8 clinical strain (Clb+Cnf+) or 21F8 isogenic mutants (Clb+Cnf-, Clb-Cnf+ and Clb-Cnf-). Infection with the Clb+Cnf- strain induced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and senescence markers both in vitro and in vivo compared to those induced by infection with the Clb+Cnf+ strain. In contrast, the Clb+Cnf- and Clb+Cnf+ strains generated similar levels of DNA damage in HT-29 cells and in colonic murine tissues. Furthermore, the ApcMin/+ mice inoculated with the Clb+Cnf- strain developed significantly more tumors than the mice inoculated with the Clb+Cnf+ strain or the isogenic mutants, and the composition of their microbiota was changed. Finally, rectal administration of the CNF1 protein in ApcMin/+ mice inoculated with the Clb+Cnf- strain significantly decreased tumorigenesis and inflammation. Overall, this study provides evidence that CNF1 decreases the carcinogenic effects of CoPEC in ApcMin/+ mice by decreasing CoPEC-induced cellular senescence and inflammation.
