38582521|a|Understanding the environmental health and safety of nanomaterials (NanoEHS) is essential for the sustained development of nanotechnology. Although extensive research over the past two decades has elucidated the phenomena, mechanisms, and implications of nanomaterials in cellular and organismal models, the active remediation of the adverse biological and environmental effects of nanomaterials remains largely unexplored. Inspired by recent developments in functional amyloids for biomedical and environmental engineering, this work shows their new utility as metallothionein mimics in the strategically important area of NanoEHS. Specifically, metal ions released from CuO and ZnO nanoparticles are sequestered through cysteine coordination and electrostatic interactions with beta-lactoglobulin (bLg) amyloid, as revealed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations. The toxicity of the metal oxide nanoparticles is subsequently mitigated by functional amyloids, as validated by cell viability and apoptosis assays in vitro and murine survival and biomarker assays in vivo. As bLg amyloid fibrils can be readily produced from whey in large quantities at a low cost, the study offers a crucial strategy for remediating the biological and environmental footprints of transition metal oxide nanomaterials.
