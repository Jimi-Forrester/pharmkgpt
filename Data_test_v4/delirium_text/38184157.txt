38184157|t|Direct comparison between 18F-Flortaucipir tau PET and quantitative susceptibility mapping in progressive supranuclear palsy.
38184157|a|PURPOSE: The pattern of flortaucipir tau PET uptake is topographically similar to the pattern of magnetic susceptibility in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); both with increased signal in subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia and midbrain, suggesting that they may be closely related. However, their relationship remains unknown since no studies have directly compared these two modalities in the same PSP cohort. We hypothesized that some flortaucipir uptake in PSP is associated with magnetic susceptibility, and hence iron deposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regional relationship between flortaucipir uptake and magnetic susceptibility and to examine the effects of susceptibility on flortaucipir uptake in PSP. METHODS: Fifty PSP patients and 67 cognitively normal controls were prospectively recruited and underwent three Tesla MRI and flortaucipir tau PET scans. Quantitative susceptibility maps were reconstructed from multi-echo gradient-echo MRI images. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed to obtain flortaucipir and susceptibility values in the subcortical regions. Relationships between flortaucipir and susceptibility signals were evaluated using partial correlation analysis in the subcortical ROIs and voxel-based analysis in the whole brain. The effects of susceptibility on flortaucipir uptake were examined by using the framework of mediation analysis. RESULTS: Both flortaucipir and susceptibility were greater in PSP compared to controls in the putamen, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, red nucleus, and cerebellar dentate (p<0.05). The ROI-based and voxel-based analyses showed that these two signals were positively correlated in these five regions (r = 0.36-0.59, p<0.05). Mediation analysis showed that greater flortaucipir uptake was partially explained by susceptibility in the putamen, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus, and fully explained in the cerebellar dentate. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that some of the flortaucipir uptake in subcortical regions in PSP is related to iron deposition. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying flortaucipir tau PET findings in PSP and other neurodegenerative diseases.
