30460110|t|Betaine enhances the cellular survival via mitochondrial fusion and fission factors, MFN2 and DRP1.
30460110|a|Betaine is a key metabolite of the methionine cycle and known for attenuating alcoholic steatosis in the liver. Recent studies have focused on the protection effect of betaine in mitochondrial regulation through the enhanced oxidative phosphorylation system. However, the mechanisms of its beneficial effects have not been clearly identified yet. Mitochondrial dynamics is important for the maintenance of functional mitochondria and cell homeostasis. A defective mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative phosphorylation system have been closely linked to several pathologies, raising the possibility that novel drugs targeting mitochondrial dynamics may present a therapeutic potential to restore the cellular homeostasis. In this study, we investigated betaine's effect on mitochondrial morphology and physiology and demonstrated that betaine enhances mitochondrial function by increasing mitochondrial fusion and improves cell survival. Furthermore, it rescued the unbalance of the mitochondrial dynamics from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction induced by oligomycin and rotenone. The elongation properties by betaine were accompanied by lowering DRP1 and increasing MFN2 expression. These data suggest that betaine could play an important role in remodeling mitochondrial dynamics to enhance mitochondrial function and cell viability.
