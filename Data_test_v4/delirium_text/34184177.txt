34184177|t|COVID-19 and the Pediatric Nervous System: Global Collaboration to Meet a Global Need.
34184177|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected mortality and morbidity across all ages, including children. It is now known that neurological manifestations of COVID-19, ranging from headaches to stroke, may involve the central and/or peripheral nervous system at any age. Neurologic involvement is also noted in the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a pediatric condition that occurs weeks after infection with the causative virus of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Knowledge about mechanisms of neurologic disease is scarce but rapidly growing. COVID-19 neurologic manifestations may have particularly adverse impacts on the developing brain. Emerging data suggest a cohort of patients with COVID-19 will have longitudinal illness affecting their cognitive, physical, and emotional health, but little is known about the long-term impact on affected children and their families. Pediatric collaboratives have begun to provide important initial information on neuroimaging manifestations and the incidence of ischemic stroke in children with COVID 19. The Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19-Pediatrics, a multinational collaborative, is working to improve understanding of the epidemiology, mechanisms of neurological manifestations, and the long-term implications of COVID-19 in children and their families.
