21368865|a|Although familial Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated autosomal dominant mutants have been extensively studied, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration induced by these mutants in AD. Wild-type, Swedish or London amyloid precursor protein (APP) transfection in primary human neurons induced neuritic beading, in which several co-expressed proteins, such as enhanced green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tau and RFP-ubiquitin, accumulated. APP-induced neuritic beading was dependent on caspase-6 (Casp6), because it was inhibited with 5 muM z-VEID-fmk or with dominant-negative Casp6. Neuritic beading was independent from APP-mediated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) production, because the APPM596V (APP(MV)) mutant, which cannot generate Abeta, still induced Casp6-dependent neuritic beading. However, the beaded neurons underwent Casp6- and Abeta-dependent cell death. These results indicate that overexpression of wild-type or mutant APP causes Casp6-dependent but Abeta-independent neuritic degeneration in human neurons. Because Casp6 is activated early in AD and is involved in axonal degeneration, these results suggest that the inhibition of Casp6 may represent an efficient early intervention against familial forms of AD. Furthermore, these results indicate that removing Abeta without inhibiting Casp6 may have little effect in preventing the progressive dementia associated with sporadic or familial AD.
