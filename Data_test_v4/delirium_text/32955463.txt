OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the imbalance between 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' information flow (IF) and processing in PD in relation with visual hallucination symptoms. METHODS: Here, we looked at bottom-up and top-down IF markers using resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) data from PD patients analyzed through three different IF measures (direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF), full frequency Directed Transfer Function (ff-DTF), and renormalized Partial Directed Coherence (rPDC). RESULTS: We observed an increased gamma band IF and a reduced beta band IF in PD patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we noticed a reduced theta band IF in PD patients using dDTF as a measure of IF. By source localizing the EEG activity of the PD patients and healthy controls, we looked at the alterations of IF in the prefrontal cortex of PD patients as well. CONCLUSION: In line with previous studies, our results suggest that the delicate balance between bottom-up and top-down IF is disrupted in Parkinson's disease potentially contributing to the cognitive symptoms of PD patients.
