33437591|a|BACKGROUND: Neighborhood walking connotes physical activity and opportunities for social and cognitive engagement and improved mental health, factors previously associated with outcomes including mortality, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. Few studies have examined correlates of neighborhood-specific walking in older adults. PURPOSE: We investigated the individual and neighborhood/regional correlates of neighborhood-based walking among US older adults. METHODS: We obtained cross-sectional data on >= 65 year olds from the population-based 2017 National Household Travel Survey (n = 73,523). Respondents completed diaries detailing trips during an assigned travel day. Adjusted logistic regression (using survey weights) tested associations between individual, neighborhood, and regional characteristics and >= 1 versus no neighborhood walk trips/day (from travel diary). RESULTS: Twelve percent had >= 1 neighborhood walk trip/day and 54% of the neighborhood walkers achieved >= 30 min of walking/day. African Americans/Blacks (versus non-Hispanic Whites) and working individuals (versus retired) had lower odds of neighborhood walking. Individuals without cars, bus/train users, and those with higher neighborhood housing density had greater odds of neighborhood walking. Utilitarian walking was less likely among African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics but more likely among Asians (versus non-Hispanic Whites). Social/recreational neighborhood walking was more likely for those without cars, bus/train users, and those with greater neighborhood housing density. CONCLUSION: Few US older adults walked in their neighborhoods, suggesting a potentially fruitful target for health promotion efforts and community interventions to improve health and quality of life in older adults. Future work is needed to determine other neighborhood factors associated with greater neighborhood walking.
