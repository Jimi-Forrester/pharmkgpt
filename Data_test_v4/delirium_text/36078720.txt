36078720|t|Low Sleep Satisfaction Is Related to High Disease Burden in Tinnitus.
36078720|a|Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of sleep disturbances in tinnitus patients. However, no study has yet evaluated subjective sleep satisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate associations of self-reported sleep satisfaction with sociodemographic factors, tinnitus-related distress, depression, and self-reported quality of life. This is a retrospective analysis of 2344 outpatients with tinnitus presenting at a tertiary German tinnitus clinic from 2010 to 2020. Patients who filled in five questionnaires (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), Major Depression Inventory (MDI), Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire (TSCHQ), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-Bref)) were included. Based on the question about sleep satisfaction in the WHOQOL-Bref, group classification into (I) sleep-satisfied, (II) neither satisfied or dissatisfied, and (III) sleep-dissatisfied patients was performed. Associations between sleep satisfaction and quality of life, depression, tinnitus distress, and tinnitus characteristics were analyzed by group differences and a multinomial regression model with elastic net penalization. A total of 42.38% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with sleep, whereas 40.91% of patients were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with sleep. The remaining patients reported being neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with sleep. Sleep-dissatisfied patients were significantly more burdened in questionnaires on depressive symptoms (MDI), tinnitus distress (TQ, THI), and quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref). In addition, they suffered significantly more often from comorbidities such as headache, neck pain, or temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). The elastic net regression based on sum scores of THI, TQ, MDI, the four domains of WHOQOL-Bref, as well as all individual questions from the TSCHQ was able to classify patients satisfied with their sleep with an accuracy of 79%, 87.8% sensitivity, and 70.4% specificity. The model could not identify patients indifferent with the quality of their sleep (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) (sensitivity: 0%; specificity: 100%). The accuracy of the model to predict patients dissatisfied with their sleep was 80.7%, with 83% sensitivity and 78.4% specificity. Poor physical and mental health (Domain I/II WHOQOL-Bref) as well as tinnitus distress were the strongest predictors of sleep dissatisfaction. Conversely, for sleep satisfaction, good physical and mental health as well as low tinnitus distress were the strongest predictors. The division into sleep-satisfied and sleep-dissatisfied tinnitus patients allows a very good discrimination regarding disease burden as indicated by depression, tinnitus distress, quality of life, and pain-related comorbidities. Physical and mental health as well as tinnitus distress seem to be strongly related to sleep satisfaction underscoring the concept of "tinnitus" versus "tinnitus disorder", but also the importance of sleep satisfaction as a global health indicator. Moreover, these data indicate the relevance of addressing sleep disorders in the therapeutic management of chronic tinnitus patients.
