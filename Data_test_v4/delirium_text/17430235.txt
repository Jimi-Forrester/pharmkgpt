17430235|a|The objective of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive review of the relation between adiposity and Alzheimer's disease (AD), its potential mechanisms, and issues in its study. Adiposity represents the body fat tissue content. When the degree of adiposity increases it can be defined as being overweight or obese by measures such as the body mass index. Being overweight or obese is a cause of hyperinsulinemia and diabetes, both of which are risk factors for AD. However, the epidemiologic evidence linking the degree of adiposity and AD is conflicting. Traditional adiposity measures such as body mass index have decreased validity in the elderly. Increased adiposity in early or middle adult life leads to hyperinsulinemia which may lead to diabetes later in life. Thus, the timing of ascertainment of adiposity and its related factors is critical in understanding how it might fit into the pathogenesis of AD. We believe that the most plausible mechanism relating adiposity to AD is hyperinsulinemia, but it is unclear whether specific products of adipose tissue also have a role. Being overweight or obese is increasing in children and adults, thus understanding the association between adiposity and AD has important public health implications.
