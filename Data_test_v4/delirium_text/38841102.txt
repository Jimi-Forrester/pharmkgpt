38841102|t|Association between physical frailty and cortical structure in middle-aged and elderly people: a Mendelian randomization study.
38841102|a|Introduction: Physical weakness is associated with cortical structures, but the exact causes remain to be investigated. Therefore, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to uncover the underlying connection between frailty and cortical structures. Methods: The Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on frailty pooled data from publicly available sources such as the UK Biobank and included five indicators of frailty: weakness, walking speed, weight loss, physical activity, and exhaustion. GWAS data on cerebral cortical structure were obtained from the ENIGMA consortium, and we assessed the causal relationship between hereditary frailty and cortical surface area (SA) or cortical thickness (TH). Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary estimate, and heterogeneity and multidimensionality were monitored by MR-PRESSO to detect outliers. Additionally, MR-Egger, Cochran's Q test, and weighted median were employed. Results: At the aggregate level, there was no causal relationship between frailty and cortical thickness or surface area. At the regional level, frailty was associated with the thickness of the middle temporal lobe, parahippocampus, rostral middle frontal lobe, lower parietal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus, upper temporal lobe, lateral orbital frontal cortex, pericardial surface area, rostral middle frontal lobe, upper temporal lobe, rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, lower parietal lobe, and upper parietal lobe. These results were nominally significant, and sensitivity analyses did not detect any multidirectionality or heterogeneity, suggesting that the results of our analyses are reliable. Discussion: The results of our analyses suggest a potential causal relationship between somatic weakness and multiple regions of cortical structure. However, the specific mechanisms of influence remain to be investigated. Preliminary results from our analysis suggest that the effects of physical frailty on cortical structures are influenced by various factors related to frailty exposure. This relationship has been documented, and it is therefore both feasible and meaningful to build on existing research to explore the clinical significance of the relationship.
