37072794|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol cessation in youth with daily drinking poses a risk of severe and life-threatening alcohol withdrawal. If unsupervised, alcohol withdrawal in heavy users can cause severe complications, such as seizures, delirium tremens, and death. We present the case of a teenager admitted at our pediatric center for the prevention of alcohol withdrawal using an innovative protocol, including a fixed-dosage benzodiazepine regimen. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old Caucasian male, known to have anxiety and an attention deficit disorder, was electively admitted for medical stabilization and surveillance of alcohol withdrawal. He had been previously diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and had a past history of withdrawal symptoms. He was prescribed a course of thiamine, folic acid, as well as a fixed-dosage benzodiazepine taper over 5 days. His withdrawal symptoms were evaluated using a standardized Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale. During his stay, he reported minimal symptoms, as well as a score on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale consistently lower than 5. His mood, motivation, eating habits and sleeping patterns significantly improved during his stay. He developed no medical complications and demonstrated pride in his successes. He was successfully transferred to a long-term rehabilitation center. CONCLUSIONS: A withdrawal prevention protocol was developed on the basis of existing literature. It included a soothing environment, basic laboratory work evaluating the medical complications of alcohol use, as well as medication aiming to prevent and reduce potential withdrawal symptoms. The patient responded well to the fixed-dosage taper with minimal symptoms and discomfort. Although alcohol use in adolescents is frequent, alcohol withdrawal in this population is rarely seen in a pediatric hospital setting. Nonetheless, given the lack of existing guidelines regarding alcohol withdrawal in adolescents, standardized protocols could be greatly beneficial for the prevention of this condition in this population.
