11281823|t|The status of ongoing trials for mild cognitive impairment.
11281823|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a term used to describe memory decline or other specific cognitive impairment in individuals who do not have dementia or significant impairment of other cognitive functions beyond that expected for their age or education. It has been suggested that as much as 38% of the elderly population would meet criteria for MCI and although the associated memory deficits are mild, the fact that up to 15% of MCI patients, particularly those with a particular type of memory impairment, convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) annually has prompted serious attention. Despite the high conversion rate, MCI cannot be used synonymously with early or mild AD, as patients with AD are impaired not only in memory performance but in other cognitive domains as well; they meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. However, since there is a high conversion rate from MCI to AD, it is likely many with MCI have the underlying neuropathology of AD, though they do not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria. Therefore, treatment strategies developed for AD, specifically acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Cox-2 inhibitors, have been among the first employed to treat MCI. It is hoped that by impeding the progression of MCI in this manner, fewer patients will convert to AD. This article will give a brief overview of the condition of mild cognitive impairment and an account of trial methodology and current treatment strategies being employed for MCI.
