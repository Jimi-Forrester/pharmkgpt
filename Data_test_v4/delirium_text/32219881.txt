32219881|t|D-ribose-L-cysteine enhances memory task, attenuates oxidative stress and acetyl-cholinesterase activity in scopolamine amnesic mice.
32219881|a|d-Ribose-l-cysteine (DRLC) is an analogue of cysteine that has been shown to boost cellular antioxidant capacity by enhancing intracellular biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH). Deficiency of GSH has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with loss of memory. Thus, the use of antioxidants to prevent or retard the progression of memory deteriorations in persons with AD has been the focus of intense investigations. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of DRLC on memory and scopolamine-induced amnesia, acetyl-cholinesterase activity, and oxidative stress in mice. Male Swiss mice were given oral administration of saline (10 ml/kg), DRLC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) or donepezil (1 mg/kg) 30 min before testing for memory performance using Y-maze and object recognition models. Another set of mice were also pretreated orally with saline, DRLC (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) or donepezil (1 mg/kg) but in combination with scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 7 days. Thirty minutes after treatment on Day 7, memory function was then evaluated. The brain levels of acetyl-cholinesterase and oxidative stress parameters were assayed. DRLC significantly (p < .05) enhanced memory performance and attenuated scopolamine-induced amnesia. Increased acetyl-cholinesterase activity and oxidative stress, as shown by decreased antioxidant substrates (glutathione and catalase) and elevated malondialdehyde contents in mice with scopolamine amnesia were also attenuated by DRLC. Our findings suggest that inhibition of oxidative stress and acetyl-cholinesterase activity might contribute to the potential benefit of DRLC in persons with amnesia.
