31923381|t|Interaction between tissue transglutaminase and amyloid-beta: Protein-protein binding versus enzymatic crosslinking.
31923381|a|Self-interaction, chaperone binding and posttranslational modification of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is essential in the initiation and propagation of Abeta aggregation. Aggregation results in insoluble Abeta deposits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain lesions, i.e. senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a calcium-dependent enzyme that catalyzes posttranslational modifications including the formation of covalent epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds (molecular crosslinks), and colocalizes with Abeta deposits in AD. Two independent groups recently found that apart from the induction of Abeta oligomerization, the blood-derived transglutaminase member FXIIIa forms stable protein-protein complexes with Abeta independent of the transamidation reaction. Here, we investigated whether also tTG forms rigid protein complexes with Abeta in the absence of catalytic activation. We found that both Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 are substrates for tTG-catalyzed crosslinking. In addition, in the absence of calcium or the presence of a peptidergic inhibitor of tTG, stable tTG-Abeta1-40 complexes were found. Interestingly, the stable complexes between tTG and Abeta1-40, were only found at 'physiological' concentrations of Abeta1-40. Together, our data suggest that depending on the Abeta species at hand, and on the concentration of Abeta, rigid protein-complexes are formed between tTG and Abeta1-40 without the involvement of the crosslinking reaction.
