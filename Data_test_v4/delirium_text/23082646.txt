23082646|t|[Intensive therapy in patients with severe traumatic brain injury complicated by delirium].
23082646|a|Delirium can greatly complicate progressing of TBI. Early diagnosis and intensive therapy optimization can improve the outcome. Retrospective-prospective study was performed in patients with severe TBI and delirium. 27 patients (mean age--40.8 +/- 3.3 years) were involved in experimental group and 25 patients (mean age 49.0 +/- 4.5 years)--in control group. The ISS and the APA CHE II scores were similar in both groups. Reamberin ("Polisan", Russia) infusion (800 ml/day for 7 days after injury) was included in the therapy plan for the experimental group. Modified RASS score was equal in both groups on the first day (1.67 +/- 0.37 in experimental and 1.88 +/- 0.28 in control group), but later RASS score was lower in experimental group (0.7 +/- 0.30 and 1.41 +/- 0.26 (p = 0.042) on the third day; 0.45 +/- 0.20 and 1.09 +/- 0.36 (p = 0.012) on the 5th day; 0.2. +/- 0.14 and 1.00 +/- 0.39 (p = 0.008) on the 7th day). The correlation of the modified Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score with the ISS score and with the length of stay in ICU was noted Reamberin improves mental status in patients with severe TBI complicated by delirium, especially, with alcohol intoxication.
