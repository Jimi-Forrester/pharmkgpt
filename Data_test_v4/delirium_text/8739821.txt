8739821|a|OBJECTIVES: To quantify the protein binding of velnacrine in healthy individuals and investigate potential sources of variability. SETTING: Medical School Unit, Southmead Hospital, Bristol. SUBJECTS: Plasma samples were obtained from the following groups: a) 11 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 30 years; b) 10 healthy volunteers aged 73 to 87 years; c) 10 patients aged 65 to 85 years hospitalised for a variety of acute illnesses. METHODS: Aliquots of plasma from the above subjects were incubated with various concentrations of velnacrine, in the presence and absence of tacrine hydrochloride. Standard solutions of human serum albumin and alpha 1 acid glycoprotein were incubated with velnacrine. The degree of protein binding was determined using the Amicon centrifree micropartition system. RESULTS: 1) Over the range of concentrations from 10 to 320 ng.ml-1, there was a decrease in protein binding from 59.1 to 46.7%. 2) At 40 ng.ml-1 the plasma protein binding of velnacrine was 54.8% in the group a subjects, 51.9% in the group b subjects and 53.0% in the group c subjects (NS). 3) The mean total plasma protein concentration was significantly lower in the samples from elderly subjects. The mean albumin and alpha 1 acid glycoprotein concentrations were lower and higher respectively in patients with acute disease. 4) Velnacrine was shown to bind to both albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, but together they did not account for total binding. 5) The binding of velnacrine was significantly decreased from 59.3 to 43.9% in the presence of a therapeutic concentration (25 ng.ml-1) of THA. There was no evidence that velnacrine displaced THA. CONCLUSION: Protein binding can be discounted as a major source of variation in the relationship between drug concentration and effect.
