36561497|a|Early brain injury is a series of pathophysiological changes and direct damage of brain tissue within 72 h after subarachnoid hemorrhage before cerebral vasospasm occurs. Early brain injury is a key factor affecting the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and its possible pathological mechanisms include oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and immune inflammation. Microglia are important immune cells of the central nervous system. Microglia play a dual role in protection and injury. Microglia are involved in the occurrence of brain edema, the processes of neuronal apoptosis, and the blood-brain barrier disruption after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) through the signaling pathways mediated by receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1), which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Conversely, they exert their anti-inflammatory and protective effects by expressing substances such as neuroglobin and heme oxygenase-1. This article reviews the latest developments in single-cell transcriptomics for microglia in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage and its inflammatory role.
