METHODS: Plasma biomarkers were analysed using ultrasensitive technology, and compared in patients with CSF Alzheimer disease profiles (A+T+) to other CSF profiles (Other). RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were included, median age 60.8 years: 16 A+T+, 63 Other. Ptau217, ptau181, GFAP were significantly elevated in A+T+ compared to Other (3.67 vs 1.12 pg/mL, 3.87 vs 1.79 pg/mL, 189 vs 80 pg/mL, respectively). ptau217 distinguished AD from Other with 90% accuracy (88% specificity, 100% sensitivity). ptau217 also demonstrated strong diagnostic performance for clinically diagnosed AD. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma ptau217 has strong diagnostic performance in distinguishing CSF biomarker-defined AD in a clinically relevant, younger cohort of people with symptoms, adding further weight for a simple diagnostic blood test for AD as a cause of a patient's symptoms.
