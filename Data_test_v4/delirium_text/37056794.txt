37056794|t|Logistic random forest boosting technique for Alzheimer's diagnosis.
37056794|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and well-known neurodegenerative condition that causes cognitive impairment. In the field of medicine, it is the "nervous system" disorder that has received the most attention. Despite this extensive research, there is no treatment or strategy to slow or stop its spread. Nevertheless, there are a variety of options (medication and non-medication alternatives) that may aid in the treatment of AD symptoms at their various phases, thereby enhancing the patient's quality of life. As AD advances over time, it is necessary to treat patients at their various stages appropriately. As a result, detecting and classifying AD phases prior to symptom treatment can be beneficial. Approximately twenty years ago, the rate of progress in the field of machine learning (ML) accelerated dramatically. Using ML methods, this study focuses on early AD identification. The "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative" (ADNI) dataset was subjected to exhaustive testing for AD identification. The purpose was to classify the dataset into three groups: AD, "Cognitive Normal" (CN), and "Late Mild Cognitive Impairment" (LMCI). In this paper, we present the ensemble model Logistic Random Forest Boosting (LRFB), representing the ensemble of "Logistic Regression" (LR), "Random Forest" (RF), and "Gradient Boost" (GB). The proposed LRFB outperformed LR, RF, GB, "k-Nearest Neighbour" (k-NN), "Multi-Layer Perceptron" (MLP), "Support Vector Machine" (SVM), "AdaBoost" (AB), "Naive Bayes" (NB), "XGBoost" (XGB), "Decision Tree" (DT), and other ensemble ML models with respect to the performance metrics "Accuracy" (Acc), "Recall" (Rec), "Precision" (Prec), and "F1-Score" (FS).
