35247505|t|Jatamansinol from Nardostachys jatamansi (D.Don) DC. Protects Abeta42-Induced Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Drosophila Model.
35247505|a|Nardostachys jatamansi (D. Don) DC. is an essential plant used in Indian Ayurveda to treat neurological disorders, and it enhances memory. Its active phytochemical(s) responsible for neuroprotection is not yet studied. One of the neurological disorders, namely Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes dementia, is not having pharmacological strategies to effectively prevent the onset of AD, cure or reverse AD progression, and treat cognitive symptoms. Here is an attempt to analyze the neuroprotective effect of jatamansinol isolated from N. jatamansi against Abeta42 protein-induced neurotoxicity using the Abeta42 protein expressed Drosophila Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. Oregon-K (OK) and AD flies were reared on regular or jatamansinol supplemented food and analyzed for their lifespan, locomotor activity, learning and memory, eye degeneration, oxidative stress levels, antioxidant activities, cholinesterase activities, Abeta42 protein, and Abeta42 gene expression. Jatamansinol extends the lifespan, improves locomotor activity, enhances learning and memory, and reduces Abeta42 protein levels in AD flies. Jatamansinol boosts the antioxidant enzyme activities, prevents Abeta42 protein-induced oxidative stress, ameliorates eye degeneration, and inhibits cholinesterase activities in the AD model. This study evidences the protective effect of jatamansinol against the Abeta42 protein-induced neurotoxicity in the AD Drosophila model, suggesting its possible therapeutic potential against AD.
