33580666|a|PURPOSE: Obtaining an accurate medication history from patients on hospital admission is a priority in pharmacy practice. Timely and accurate histories are imperative as they may help determine the etiology of illness and prevent medication errors. We conducted a quality improvement project to assess the accuracy of alternate-source medication histories obtained for critically ill patients who were delirious or mechanically ventilated at the time of intensive care unit admission. METHODS: Included patients were 18 years of age or older, admitted to the medical intensive care unit from August 2017 through January 2018, and had a medication history obtained from a family member or outpatient pharmacy due to active delirium or mechanical ventilation. Patients were directly interviewed after resolution of delirium or extubation. Discrepancies between the initial and follow-up histories were documented and categorized using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index for Categorizing Medication Errors. RESULTS: Forty patients were included. One hundred four discrepancies were documented, with a median of 2 discrepancies per patient. The most common types of discrepancies were addition (51.9%), followed by omission (24.0%). NCC MERP index category A (51%) was the most common error classification identified. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between initial and follow-up medication histories occurred at a frequent rate in delirious or mechanically ventilated patients; however, these discrepancies tended to be of low risk severity.
