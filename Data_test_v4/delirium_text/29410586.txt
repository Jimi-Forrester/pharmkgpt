29410586|a|[Purpose] The purpose is to verify the effectiveness of the 2-step test in predicting cognitive decline in elderly individuals. [Subjects and Methods] One hundred eighty-two participants aged over 65 years underwent the 2-step test, cognitive function tests and higher level competence testing. Participants were classified as Robust, <1.3, and <1.1 using criteria regarding the locomotive syndrome risk stage for the 2-step test, variables were compared between groups. In addition, ordered logistic analysis was used to analyze cognitive functions as independent variables in the three groups, using the 2-step test results as the dependent variable, with age, gender, etc. as adjustment factors. [Results] In the crude data, the <1.3 and <1.1 groups were older and displayed lower motor and cognitive functions than did the Robust group. Furthermore, the <1.3 group exhibited significantly lower memory retention than did the Robust group. The 2-step test was related to the Stroop test (beta: 0.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.12). [Conclusion] The finding is that the risk stage of the 2-step test is related to cognitive functions, even at an initial risk stage. The 2-step test may help with earlier detection and implementation of prevention measures for locomotive syndrome and mild cognitive impairment.
