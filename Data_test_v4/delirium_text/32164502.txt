32164502|t|Repurposing Antihypertensive Drugs for the Management of Alzheimer's Disease.
32164502|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has affected millions of people worldwide. However, currently, there is no treatment to cure the disease. The AD drugs available in the market only manage the disease symptomatically and the effects are usually short-term. Thus, there is a need to look at alternatives AD therapies. This literature review aims to shed some light on the potential of repurposing antihypertensives to treat AD. Mid-life hypertension has not only been recognised as a risk factor for AD, but its relation with AD has also been well established. Hence, antihypertensives were postulated to be beneficial in managing AD. Four classes of antihypertensives, as well as their potential limitations and prospects in being utilised as AD therapeutics, were discussed in this review.
