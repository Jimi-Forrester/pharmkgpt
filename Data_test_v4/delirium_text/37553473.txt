The gut microbiota are increasingly being recognized for its impact on a range of human diseases, including cancer, it may play a key role in the occurrence, progression, treatment, and prognosis of many types of cancer. Understanding the functional role of the gut microbiota in cancer is crucial for the development of the era of personalized medicine. Here, we review recent advances in research and summarize the important associations and clear experimental evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in a variety of human cancers, focus on the application and possible challenges associated with the gut microbiota in antitumor therapy. In conclusion, our research demonstrated the multifaceted mechanisms of gut microbiota affecting human cancer and provides directions and ideas for future clinical research.
