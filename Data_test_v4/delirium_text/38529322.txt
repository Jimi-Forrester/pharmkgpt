38529322|a|The association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular diseases has been studied for many years. Research has shown a link between high uric acid levels and increased risk of including coronary artery disease hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Urate-lowering therapy, particularly with xanthine oxidase inhibitors like allopurinol, has shown promising results in reducing blood pressure in individuals with hyperuricemia and hypertension. Clinical trials and studies have demonstrated significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with urate-lowering treatment. Urate-lowering treatment has shown a favorable effect on reducing systolic blood pressure and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with previous cardiovascular disease. In terms of cardiovascular safety, clinical trials have indicated that xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as febuxostat are non-inferior to allopurinol and do not increase the risk of death or serious adverse events. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of managing hyperuricemia and utilizing urate-lowering therapy to mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with elevated uric acid levels.
