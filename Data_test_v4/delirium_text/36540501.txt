36540501|t|Medical and Surgical Care of Critical Burn Patients: A Comprehensive Review of Current Evidence and Practice.
36540501|a|Critically ill burn patients pose several unique challenges to care providers. The concepts of fluid resuscitation, nutritional management, organ support and wound care are rapidly evolving. There is a pressing need to review emerging evidence and incorporate these into practice for the effective management of burn patients. We have searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases to review the current evidence on the acute care management of adult as well as paediatric burn patients. The rationales for current practices have been integrated into the review. The management of critically ill burn patients requires an in-depth knowledge of the pathophysiology of burn injury, a tailored approach for timely resuscitation, timely diagnosis of organ specific problems, and comprehensive wound care. This review will help the doctors and healthcare providers involved in the management of critical burn patients in their day-to-day practice.
