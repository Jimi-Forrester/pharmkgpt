35087565|t|Causal Association Between Heart Failure and Alzheimer's Disease: A Two-Sample Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study.
35087565|a|Background: Traditional observational studies have demonstrated an association between heart failure and Alzheimer's disease. The strengths of observational studies lie in their speed of implementation, cost, and applicability to rare diseases. However, observational studies have several limitations, such as uncontrollable confounders. Therefore, we employed Mendelian randomization of genetic variants to evaluate the causal relationships existing between AD and HF, which can avoid these limitations. Materials and Methods: A two-sample bidirectional MR analysis was employed. All datasets were results from the UK's Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit genome-wide association study database, and we conducted a series of control steps to select the most suitable single-nucleotide polymorphisms for MR analysis, for which five primary methods are offered. We reversed the functions of exposure and outcomes to explore the causal direction of HF and AD. Sensitivity analysis was used to conduct several tests to avoid heterogeneity and pleiotropic bias in the MR results. Results: Our MR studies did not support a meaningful causal relationship between AD on HF (MR-Egger, p = 0.634 > 0.05; weighted median (WM), p = 0.337 > 0.05; inverse variance weighted (IVW), p = 0.471 > 0.05; simple mode, p = 0.454 > 0.05; weighted mode, p = 0.401 > 0.05). At the same time, we did not find a significant causal relationship between HF and AD with four of the methods (MR-Egger, p = 0.195 > 0.05; IVW, p = 0.0879 > 0.05; simple mode, p = 0.170 > 0.05; weighted mode, p = 0.110 > 0.05), but the WM method indicated a significant effect of HF on AD (p = 0.025 < 0.05). Because the statistical powers of IVW and MR-Egger are more than that of WM, we think that there is no causal effect of HF on AD. Sensitivity analysis and horizontal pleiotropy were not detected in the MR analysis. Conclusion: Our results did not provide significant evidence indicating any causal relationships between HF and AD in the European population. Therefore, more large-scale datasets or datasets related to similar factors are expected for further MR analysis.
