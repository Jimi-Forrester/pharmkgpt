32692766|a|Epigenetic age acceleration-the difference between an individual's DNA methylation age and chronological age-is associated with many diseases including cancer. This study aims to evaluate epigenetic age acceleration as a prognostic biomarker for gliomas. DNA methylation data of gliomas patients (516 low-grade and intermediate-grade gliomas and 140 glioblastoma) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and patient epigenetic ages were computed using Horvath's age prediction model. We used multivariate linear regression to assess the association of epigenetic age acceleration with tumor molecular subtypes, including Codel, Classic-like, G-CIMP-high, G-CIMP-low, Mesenchymal-like and PA-like. Compared with Codel subtype, epigenetic ages in other molecular subtypes show deceleration after controlling age and race. Age deceleration for Classic-like, G-CIMP-high, G-CIMP-low, Mesenchymal-like and PA-like were 15.42 years (CI: 7.98-22.86, p = 5.38E-05), 25.00 years (CI: 20.79-29.22, p = 4.06E-28), 28.56 years (CI: 14.37-42.74, p = 8.75E-05), 45.34 years (CI: 38.80-51.88, p = 2.15E-36), and 53.58 years (CI: 44.90-62.26, p = 4.81E-30), respectively. Then, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of epigenetic age acceleration with patient overall survival. Our results show epigenetic age acceleration is positively associated with patient overall survival (per 10-year age acceleration, HR = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82-0.97; p = 9.04E-03) in multivariate analysis. When stratified by molecular subtypes, epigenetic age acceleration remains positively associated with patient survival after adjusting age and tumor grade. In conclusion, epigenetic age acceleration is significantly associated with molecular subtypes and patient overall survival in gliomas, indication that epigenetic age acceleration has potential as a quantitative prognostic biomarker for gliomas.
