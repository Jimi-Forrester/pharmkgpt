34829685|a|There are numerous publications demonstrating that plant polyphenols can reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory processes in the brain. In the present study we have investigated the neuroprotective effect of plant extract isolated from the roots of L. gmelinii since it contains a rich source of polyphenols and other biologically active compounds. We have applied an oxidative and inflammatory model induced by NMDA, H2O2, and TNF-alpha in human primary neurons and astrocytes, and mouse cerebral endothelial cell (CECs) line in vitro. The levels of ROS generation, NADPH oxidase activation, P-selectin expression, and activity of ERK1/2 were evaluated by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis, confocal microscopy, and MAPK assay. In vivo, sensorimotor functions in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were assessed. In neurons NMDA induced overproduction of ROS, in astrocytes TNF-alpha initiated ROS generation, NADPH oxidase activation, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In CECs, the exposure by TNF-alpha induced oxidative stress and triggered the accumulation of P-selectin on the surface of the cells. In turn, pre-treatment of the cells with the extract of L. gmelinii suppressed oxidative stress in all cell types and pro-inflammatory responses in astrocytes and CECs. In vivo, the treatment with L. gmelinii extract improved motor activity in rats with MCAO.
