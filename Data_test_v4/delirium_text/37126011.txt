37126011|t|Individuals Who Developed Delirium While Enrolled in the Hospital Elder Life Program: An Exploratory Study.
37126011|a|Delirium prevention in hospitalized older adults is important due to delirium's high prevalence and negative impact on outcomes. Today, there are evidence-based programs with well-documented effectiveness aimed at preventing delirium, such as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP); however, approximately 4% to 5% of patients develop delirium regardless of implemented prevention interventions. It remains unknown why some patients develop delirium. The current retrospective exploratory chart review analyzed 98 records for clinical risk factors and outcomes of patients who developed delirium while enrolled in the HELP. On admission, immobility (86.7%) was the most common risk factor. Patients developed delirium approximately 70 hours after admission. Average length of stay was 8 days. Approximately one half (44.9%) of patients died within 1 year. Immobility (97.7% vs. 77.8%, p = 0.005) and renal disease (52.3% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.008) were more often found in patients who died. This study identifies risk factors that seem to require heightened attention during hospitalization to prevent the negative outcomes associated with delirium in older adults.
