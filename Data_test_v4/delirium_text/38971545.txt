38971545|t|IGF1R and FLT1 in female endothelial cells and CHD2 in male microglia play important roles in Alzheimer's disease based on gender difference analysis.
38971545|a|OBJECTIVE: This study investigated sex-specific pathogenesis mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data. METHODS: Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were searched using terms "Alzheimer's Disease", "single cell", and "Homo sapiens". Studies excluding APOE E4 and including comprehensive gender information with 10x sequencing methods were selected, resulting in GSE157827 and GSE174367 datasets from human prefrontal cortex samples. Sex-stratified analyses were conducted on these datasets, and the outcomes of the analysis for GSE157827 were compared with those of GSE174367. The findings were validated using expression profiling from the mouse dataset GSE85162. Furthermore, real-time PCR experiments in mice further confirmed these findings. The Seurat R package was used to identify cell types, and batch effects were mitigated using the Harmony R package. Cell proportions by sex were compared using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, and gene expression variability was displayed with an empirical cumulative distribution plot. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the FindMarkers function with the MAST test. Transcription factors were analyzed using the RcisTarget R package. RESULTS: Seven cell types were identified: astrocytes, endothelial cells, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Additionally, five distinct subpopulations of both endothelial and microglial cells were also identified, respectively. Key findings included: (1) In endothelial cells, genes involved in synapse organization, such as Insulin Like Growth Factor 1 Receptor (IGF1R) and Fms Related Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1(FLT1), showed higher expression in females with AD. (2) In microglial cells, genes in the ribosome pathway exhibited higher expression in males without AD compared to females (with or without AD) and males with AD. (3) Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 2 (CHD2) negatively regulated gene expression in the ribosome pathway in male microglia, suppressing AD, this finding was further validated in mice. (4) Differences between Asians and Caucasians were observed based on sex and disease status stratification. CONCLUSIONS: IGF1R and FLT1 in endothelial cells contribute to AD in females, while CHD2 negatively regulates ribosome pathway gene expression in male microglia, suppressing AD in humans and mice.
