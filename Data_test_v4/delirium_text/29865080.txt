29865080|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Ginsenoside Rf on Amyloid-beta-Induced Neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
29865080|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Abeta accumulation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, axonal injury, synapse loss, and neuronal apoptosis. Thus, reducing Abeta levels should exert a neuroprotective effect against AD. Ginsenoside Rf, an extract from Panax notoginseng, has potent anti-fatigue, anti-nociception, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammation properties. However, it is unclear whether ginsenoside Rf is effective in the treatment of AD. Here, we reported that ginsenoside Rf could significantly attenuate Abeta-induced apoptosis in N2A cells, as reflected by a dramatic increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and decrease in Ca2 + concentration, reactive oxygen species, and active caspase-3 expression. Meanwhile, ginsenoside Rf could alleviate the Abeta-induced inflammation reaction, such as the decrease of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and active caspase-1 expression and the increase of interleukin-13. Furthermore, we also found that Rf is able to accelerate Abeta clearance and subsequently reduces Abeta level in N2A cells stably transfected with human Swedish mutant APP695 (N2A-APP). More importantly, daily Rf treatment (20 mg/kg, i.p.) throughout the experiment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory in Abeta42-induced mouse model of AD. Taken together, these results indicate that ginsenoside Rf may decrease Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and memory decline via anti-inflammatory response during AD development, suggesting that Rf may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating AD.
