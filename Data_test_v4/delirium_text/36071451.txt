36071451|a|BACKGROUND: Little is known about the gender characteristics and the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact on psychiatric department outpatients in general hospitals in China. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 225,947 outpatient clinic records before and during COVID-19 pandemic from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in the psychiatric clinic of 3 general hospitals, gender composition of patients was analyzed in different five age groups and nine diagnostic categories at three levels: total patient visits, number of patients and number of first-visit patients. RESULTS: The total male-to-female ratio of psychiatric outpatient records in 3 general hospitals from 2019 to 2020 was 1:1.69. Women were more common in all age groups. Overall, the proportion of women was further increased in 2020 compared to that in 2019, especially in age group below 34 years and anxiety disorders category. Most mental disorders showed higher demands for females than that for males except mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use with the male-to-female ratio was 1:0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The demand for female psychiatric outpatient services is obviously higher than that for males. It is necessary to pay more attention to explore targeted mechanism or psychosocial service strategy for female patients with mental disorders.
