38004640|t|Integrated Macrogenomics and Metabolomics Explore Alterations and Correlation between Gut Microbiota and Serum Metabolites in Adult Epileptic Patients: A Pilot Study.
38004640|a|Epilepsy (EP) is a complex brain disorder showing a lot of unknows reasons. Recent studies showed that gut microbiota can influence epilepsy via the brain-gut axis. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which gut microbiota affects adult epilepsy still remains unclear. In this study, fecal and serum samples were obtained from patients with epilepsy and normal controls. Using an integrated analysis, sequencing was performed by macrogenomics and high-throughput targeted metabolomics with various bioinformatics approaches. The macrogenomic sequencing revealed significant changes in microbial structure in patients suffering from epilepsy. For example, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria showed an increase in the patients with epilepsy, whereas that of Firmicutes decreased. In addition, the patients with epilepsy had significantly differential metabolite profiles compared to normal controls, and five clusters with 21 metabolites, mainly containing the upregulation of some fatty acids and downregulation of some amino acids. Tryptophan (AUC = 91.81, p < 0.0001), kynurenine (AUC = 79.09, p < 0.01) and 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-Docosatetraenoic acid (AUC = 80.95, p < 0.01) may be used as potential diagnostic markers for epilepsy. Differential serum metabolites have effects on tryptophan metabolism, iron death and other pathways. Furthermore, a multiomic joint analysis observed a statistically significant correlation between the differential flora and the differential serum metabolites. In our findings, a macrogenomic analysis revealed the presence of dysregulated intestinal flora species and function in adult epileptic patients. Deeper metabolomic analyses revealed differences in serum metabolites between patients with epilepsy and healthy populations. Meanwhile, the multiomic combination showed connection between the gut microbes and circulating metabolites in the EP patients, which may be potential therapeutic targets.
