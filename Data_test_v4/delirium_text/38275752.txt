38275752|t|The Potential of a Stratified Approach to Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer's Disease.
38275752|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While multiple theories explaining the aetiology of the disease have been suggested, the underlying cause of the disease is still unknown. Despite this, several modifiable and non-modifiable factors that increase the risk of developing AD have been identified. To date, only eight AD drugs have ever gained regulatory approval, including six symptomatic and two disease-modifying drugs. However, not all are available in all countries and high costs associated with new disease-modifying biologics prevent large proportions of the patient population from accessing them. With the current patient population expected to triple by 2050, it is imperative that new, effective, and affordable drugs become available to patients. Traditional drug development strategies have a 99% failure rate in AD, which is far higher than in other disease areas. Even when a drug does reach the market, additional barriers such as high cost and lack of accessibility prevent patients from benefiting from them. In this review, we discuss how a stratified medicine drug repurposing approach may address some of the limitations and barriers that traditional strategies face in relation to drug development in AD. We believe that novel, stratified drug repurposing studies may expedite the discovery of alternative, effective, and more affordable treatment options for a rapidly expanding patient population in comparison with traditional drug development methods.
