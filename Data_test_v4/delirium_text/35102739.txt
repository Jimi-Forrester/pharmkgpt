35102739|t|A Dual-Pronged Approach: A Ruthenium(III) Complex That Modulates Amyloid-beta Aggregation and Disrupts Its Formed Aggregates.
35102739|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder for which soluble oligomers of the peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta) are now recognized as the neurotoxic species. Metal-based therapeutics are uniquely suited to target Abeta, with ruthenium-based (Ru) complexes emerging as propitious candidates. Recently, azole-based Ru(III) complexes were observed to modulate the aggregation of Abeta in solution, where the inclusion of a primary amine proximal to the ligand coordination site improved the activity of the complexes. To advance these structure-activity relationships, a series of oxazole-based Ru complexes were prepared and evaluated for their ability to modulate Abeta aggregation. From these studies, a lead candidate, Oc, emerged that had superior activity relative to its azole predecessors in modulating the aggregation of soluble Abeta and diminishing its cytotoxicity. Further evaluation of Oc demonstrated its ability to disrupt formed Abeta aggregates, resulting in smaller amorphous species. Because altering both sides of the aggregation equilibrium for Abeta has not been previously suggested for metal-based complexes for AD, this work represents an exciting new avenue for improved therapeutic success.
