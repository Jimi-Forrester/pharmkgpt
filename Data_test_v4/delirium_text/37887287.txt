37887287|t|Assessment of Inner Blood-Retinal Barrier: Animal Models and Methods.
37887287|a|Proper functioning of the neural retina relies on the unique retinal environment regulated by the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), which restricts the passage of solutes, fluids, and toxic substances. BRB impairment occurs in many retinal vascular diseases and the breakdown of BRB significantly contributes to disease pathology. Understanding the different molecular constituents and signaling pathways involved in BRB development and maintenance is therefore crucial in developing treatment modalities. This review summarizes the major molecular signaling pathways involved in inner BRB (iBRB) formation and maintenance, and representative animal models of eye diseases with retinal vascular leakage. Studies on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are highlighted, which is critical for retinal and brain vascular angiogenesis and barriergenesis. Moreover, multiple in vivo and in vitro methods for the detection and analysis of vascular leakage are described, along with their advantages and limitations. These pre-clinical animal models and methods for assessing iBRB provide valuable experimental tools in delineating the molecular mechanisms of retinal vascular diseases and evaluating therapeutic drugs.
