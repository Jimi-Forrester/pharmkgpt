23521739|t|Management of delirium in medicine: experience of a Close Observation Unit.
23521739|a|AIM: A new model of care for the management of patients with delirium was developed and evaluated. METHOD: A four-bedded Close Observation Unit (COU) was introduced. The model comprised education for assistants in nursing (AINs), environmental adaptations and AIN-to-patient ratio of 1:4. Outcomes in all patients with delirium before and after introduction of the new model of care were compared. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients were admitted to COU, of whom 100 (95%) were diagnosed with delirium. In-hospital mortality improved after introduction of the unit (15% vs 5%; P = 0.002) without significant change in length of stay, discharge destination or falls frequency. CONCLUSION: A dedicated unit for delirium management within medicine achieved a reduction in mortality.
