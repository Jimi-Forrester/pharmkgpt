37109044|t|Association Study of BDNF, SLC6A4, and FTO Genetic Variants with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders.
37109044|a|Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders: F20-F29 according to International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10)) are considered highly heritable heterogeneous psychiatric conditions. Their pathophysiology is multifactorial with involved dysregulated serotonergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR), FTO (rs9939609), and BDNF (rs6265, rs962369) polymorphisms with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in Slovak patients. We analyzed the genotypes of 150 patients with schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders and compared them with genotypes from 178 healthy volunteers. We have found a marginally protective effect of LS + SS genotypes of 5-HTTLPR variant of the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 gene against the development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, but the result failed to remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Similarly, we have not proven any significant association between other selected genetic variants and schizophrenia and related disorders. Studies including a higher number of subjects are warranted to reliably confirm the presence or absence of the studied associations.
