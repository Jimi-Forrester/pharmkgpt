8895946|t|Hepatotoxic side-effect of clomethiazole.
8895946|a|We report on a patient with a history of alcoholism who developed hyperbilirubinemia induced by treatment with clomethiazole during two hospitalizations. After discontinuation of clomethiazole symptoms of cholestasis improved. Clomethiazole is a thiazole analogon and is chemically related to thiamine (vitamin B1). It can be administered as tablets, capsules, mixtures, and a 0.8% solution. Because of its sedative, hypnotic, and anti-convulsive effects it is used in the treatment of alcoholic delirium.
