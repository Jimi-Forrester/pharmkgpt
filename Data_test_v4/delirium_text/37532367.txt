37532367|t|Bringing Health Care Equity to Diverse and Underserved Populations in Sleep Medicine and Research Through a Digital Health Equity Framework.
37532367|a|Individuals from minoritized groups are less likely to receive sleep medicine care and be the focus of sleep research. Several barriers may explain under-representation and low participation. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted a digital divide that exacerbated disproportionate sleep health outcomes and access to sleep medicine and research opportunities among minoritized groups. The authors' team developed a digital health equity and inclusion model and revamped its culturally-tailored community outreach program to advance sleep health equity among minoritized groups. This article describes how the authors implemented their digital sleep health equity and inclusion model during the COVID-19 pandemic.
