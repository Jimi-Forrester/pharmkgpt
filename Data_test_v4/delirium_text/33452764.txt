33452764|a|Much progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of bladder cancer (BC) progression. Protein kinase C-alpha (PKCalpha) is overexpressed in many kinds of cancers. Additionally, PKCalpha is considered an oncogene that regulates proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle in multiple cancers. However, the mechanism underlying how these cellular processes are regulated by PKCalpha remains unknown. In the present study, we used PKCalpha siRNA to knock down PKCalpha gene expression and found that down-regulation of PKCalpha could significantly inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induce apoptosis and G1/S cell cycle arrest in vitro. Overexpression of PKCalpha promotes tumour growth in vivo. We applied cDNA microarray technology to detect the differential gene expression in J82 cells with PKCalpha knockdown and found that five key genes (BIRC2, BIRC3, CDK4, TRAF1 and BMP4) were involved in proliferation and apoptosis according to GO analysis and pathway analyses. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between PKCalpha expression and the expression of five downstream genes. BIRC2 and BIRC3 inhibit apoptosis, whereas CDK4, TRAF1 and BMP4 promote proliferation. Essentially, all five of these target genes participated in proliferation, and apoptosis was regulated by PKCalpha via the NF-kB signalling pathway.
