34657903|a|PURPOSE: Peripheral retinal leakage (PRL) of contrast medium from the ora serrata (i.e., the peripheral part of the retina) was recently reported in normal eyes using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography. We occasionally see PRL of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in the vitreous from the temporal and inferior sides of the ora serrata on MR images of subjects without ophthalmic disease. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated these MR images to determine if PRL was associated with aging. We also evaluated whether the initial leakage appeared in the temporal and inferior sides, and whether there was uniform distribution within the vitreous after 24 hours. METHODS: In 127 subjects (9 volunteers, 85 patients with sudden deafness, and 33 patients with a suspicion of endolymphatic hydrops), pre- and post-contrast-enhanced heavily T2-weighted 3D-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were obtained. The presence or absence of PRL was subjectively evaluated. For patients with a suspicion of endolymphatic hydrops, 3D-real inversion recovery (IR) images were also obtained at pre-, 10 mins, 4 hours, and 24 hours after intravenous administration (IV) of GBCA. Four circular ROIs were placed in the vitreous humor and the signal intensity was measured. RESULTS: In the cases with PRL (n = 88) and without PRL (n = 47), the median age was 59 and 47 years, respectively (P = 0.001). At 4 hours after IV-GBCA, the mean signal increase in the inferior temporal ROI was greater than all the other ROIs. At 24 hours after IV-GBCA, no significant difference in signal intensity was observed for the four ROIs. CONCLUSION: PRL of GBCA is age-dependent and occurs mainly from the inferior temporal side of the ora serrata. The contrast effect was uniformly distributed at 24 hours after IV-GBCA. Future observations in a variety of diseases will determine the clinical significance of these findings.
