29605385|a|INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, the dose-dependent impact of this allele on brain morphology of healthy individuals remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed gray matter volumes (GMvs) in a sample of 533 healthy middle-aged individuals with a substantial representation of epsilon4-carriers (207 heterozygotes and 65 homozygotes). RESULTS: We found APOE-epsilon4 additive GMv reductions in the right hippocampus, caudate, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar crus. In these regions, the APOE genotype interacted with age, with homozygotes displaying lower GMv after the fifth decade of life. APOE-epsilon4 was also associated to greater GMv in the right thalamus, left occipital gyrus, and right frontal cortex. DISCUSSION: Our data indicate that APOE-epsilon4 exerts additive effects on GMv in regions relevant for Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology already in healthy individuals. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased Alzheimer's disease risk in epsilon4-carriers, suggesting a dose-dependent disease vulnerability on the brain structure level.
