17022464|t|[Neurobiological studies of gamma-band bioelectrical activity in humans].
17022464|a|The modem literature data were observed, which dedicated to the study of neurobiological studies of gamma-rhythm mechanisms, providing the cognitive functions in hymans: state of readiness and attention, providing of sensory indentification, perception and memorizations, decision-making, management of psychomotor response, emotional and semantic processing of an information. It was shown that synchronous gamma-activity is at integrative activity, which in deteriorated in pathology of thinking. Literature data were analysed concerning ot the changes of gamma-activity (spontaneous, evoked, provoked by photostimulation etc.) in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders: epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, stroke etc. as compared with norm. The data observed testify to high significance of gamma-activity in the brain functioning.
