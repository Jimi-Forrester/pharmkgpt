32143342|t|Association between Pulse Pressure and Onset of Dementia in an Elderly Korean Population: A Cohort Study.
32143342|a|Objective: There is paucity of studies on the association between pulse pressure and the development of dementia, although this association has already been established. This study aimed at investigating the association between pulse pressure and the onset of dementia. Methods: We used the South Korean National Health Insurance Service claims cohort data to select 149,663 patients without dementia aged >=60 years. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia using Cox proportional hazard models according to a pulse pressure classification (<50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, or 90+). Results: Compared to women with pulse pressure <50, those with pulse pressures of 50-59, 60-69, and 90+ had higher HRs for dementia (1.14, 1.22, and 1.03, respectively). These associations were particularly strong in those on Medicaid insurance and from rural regions. However, there were no statistically significant results among men. Conclusions: A higher pulse pressure was associated with an elevated risk of dementia in women aged >60 years, particularly those on Medicaid and from rural regions, possibly due to their inability to access hypertension and other medical treatment. The establishment of dementia indicators will help to guide future health policies for the prevention of dementia.
