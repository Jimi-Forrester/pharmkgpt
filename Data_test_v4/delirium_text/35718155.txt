35718155|t|sfGFP throws light on the early stages of beta-barrel amyloidogenesis.
35718155|a|The accumulation of beta-sheet-rich protein aggregates, amyloid fibrils, accompanies severe pathologies (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, ALS, etc.). The high amyloidogenicity of proteins with a native beta-barrel structure, and the amyloidogenic peptides ability to form a universal cylindrin-like oligomeric state were proven. The mechanisms for the proteins' transformation from this state to a fibrillar one are still not fully understood. We defined the structural rearrangements of the amyloidogenic beta-barrel superfolder GFP (sfGFP) prior to fibrillogenesis using its tryptophan and chromophore fluorescence. We characterized the early intermediate "native-like" state preserving the integrity of the sfGFP beta-barrel scaffold despite the partial distortion of the three beta-strands closing it. The interaction between the "melted" regions of the protein leads to the assembly of high molecular weight complexes, which are not dynamic structures but are less stable and less cytotoxic than mature amyloids. Additional contacts of sfGFP monomers facilitate the global reorganization of its structure and stabilization of the second intermediate state in which the beta-barrel opens and some of the native alpha-helices and disordered regions refold into non-native beta-strands, which, along with native beta-strands, form an amyloid fiber. Reported sfGFP structural transformations may occur during the fibrillogenesis of other beta-barrel proteins, and the identified intermediate states are likely universal. Thus sfGFP can be used as a sensing platform to develop therapeutic agents inhibiting amyloidogenesis through interaction with protein intermediates and destroying low-stable aggregates formed at the early stages of fibrillogenesis.
