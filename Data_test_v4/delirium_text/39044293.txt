39044293|a|BACKGROUND: Altered thyroid hormone levels have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and related cognitive decline. However, the neuropathological substrates underlying the link between thyroid hormones and AD dementia are not yet fully understood. We first investigated the association between serum thyroid hormone levels and in vivo AD pathologies including both beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau deposition measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Given the well-known relationship between Abeta and tau pathology in AD, we additionally examined the moderating effects of thyroid hormone levels on the association between Abeta and tau deposition. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of the Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (KBASE) cohort. This study included a total of 291 cognitively normal adults aged 55 to 90. All participants received comprehensive clinical assessments, measurements for serum total triiodothyronine (T3), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and brain imaging evaluations including [11C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)- PET and [18F] AV-1451 PET. RESULTS: No associations were found between either thyroid hormones or TSH and Abeta and tau deposition on PET. However, fT4 (p = 0.002) and fT3 (p = 0.001) exhibited significant interactions with Abeta on tau deposition: The sensitivity analyses conducted after the removal of an outlier showed that the interaction effect between fT4 and Abeta deposition was not significant, whereas the interaction between fT3 and Abeta deposition remained significant. However, further subgroup analyses demonstrated a more pronounced positive relationship between Abeta and tau in both the higher fT4 and fT3 groups compared to the lower group, irrespective of outlier removal. Meanwhile, neither T3 nor TSH had any interaction with Abeta on tau deposition. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that serum thyroid hormones may moderate the relationship between cerebral Abeta and tau pathology. Higher levels of serum thyroid hormones could potentially accelerate the Abeta-dependent tau deposition in the brain. Further replication studies in independent samples are needed to verify the current results.
