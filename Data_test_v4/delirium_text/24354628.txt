24354628|a|Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating cause of morbidity and mortality. Intraparenchymal hematomas are often surgically evacuated. This generates fragments of perihematoma brain tissue that may elucidate their etiology. The goal of this study is to analyze the value of these specimens in providing a possible etiology for spontaneous ICH as well as the utility of using immunohistochemical markers to identify amyloid angiopathy. Surgically resected hematomas from 20 individuals with spontaneous ICH were examined with light microscopy. Hemorrhage locations included 11 lobar and nine basal ganglia hemorrhages. Abeta immunohistochemistry and Congo red stains were used to confirm the presence of amyloid angiopathy, when this was suspected. Evidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was observed in eight of the 20 specimens, each of which came from lobar locations. Immunohistochemistry confirmed CAA in the brain fragments from these eight individuals. Patients with immunohistochemically confirmed CAA were older than patients without CAA, and more likely to have lobar hemorrhages (OR 3.0 and 3.7, respectively). Evidence of CAA was not found in any of the basal ganglia specimens. One specimen showed evidence of CAA-associated angiitis, with formation of a microaneurysm in an inflamed segment of a CAA-affected arteriole, surrounded by acute hemorrhage. In another specimen, Abeta immunohistochemistry showed the presence of senile plaques suggesting concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) changes. Surgically evacuated hematomas from patients with spontaneous ICH should be carefully examined, paying special attention to any fragments of included brain parenchyma. These fragments can provide evidence of the etiology of the hemorrhage. Markers such as Abeta 1-40 can help to identify underlying CAA, and should be utilized when microangiopathy is suspected. Given the association of (Abeta) CAA with AD, careful examination of entrapped brain fragments may also provide evidence of AD in a given patient.
