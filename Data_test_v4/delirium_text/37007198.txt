37007198|t|A model of working memory for encoding multiple items and ordered sequences exploiting the theta-gamma code.
37007198|a|Recent experimental evidence suggests that oscillatory activity plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of information in working memory, both in rodents and humans. In particular, cross-frequency coupling between theta and gamma oscillations has been suggested as a core mechanism for multi-item memory. The aim of this work is to present an original neural network model, based on oscillating neural masses, to investigate mechanisms at the basis of working memory in different conditions. We show that this model, with different synapse values, can be used to address different problems, such as the reconstruction of an item from partial information, the maintenance of multiple items simultaneously in memory, without any sequential order, and the reconstruction of an ordered sequence starting from an initial cue. The model consists of four interconnected layers; synapses are trained using Hebbian and anti-Hebbian mechanisms, in order to synchronize features in the same items, and desynchronize features in different items. Simulations show that the trained network is able to desynchronize up to nine items without a fixed order using the gamma rhythm. Moreover, the network can replicate a sequence of items using a gamma rhythm nested inside a theta rhythm. The reduction in some parameters, mainly concerning the strength of GABAergic synapses, induce memory alterations which mimic neurological deficits. Finally, the network, isolated from the external environment ("imagination phase") and stimulated with high uniform noise, can randomly recover sequences previously learned, and link them together by exploiting the similarity among items.
