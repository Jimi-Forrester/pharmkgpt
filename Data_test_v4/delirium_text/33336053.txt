In this study, we explored the effect of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on the course of BMSC differentiation. METHODS: BMSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and induced by GDNF. The effects of GDNF on BMSC viability and proliferation were verified by cell counting kit-8, MTT, bromodeoxyuridine, and flow cytometry assays. Neuronal differentiation from BMSCs was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence via measuring the expression of several neural specific markers. RESULTS: Compared to untreated BMSCs, GDNF induced the differentiation of BMSCs into neuron-like cells and enhanced the expression levels of neuronal markers including nestin and NCAM. Moreover, the expression of SCF was suppressed by GDNF stimulation. CONCLUSION: GDNF could elevate the differentiation of BMSCs into neuron-like cells and could be considered as an effective candidate cell for future neuroscience research.
