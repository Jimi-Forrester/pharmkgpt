37507781|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common neurological complication following anesthesia and surgery. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that neuroinflammation caused by systemic inflammatory responses during the perioperative period is a key factor in the occurrence of POCD. In addition, SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) has been confirmed to play vital roles in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, whether Smad7 participates in the regulatory process of neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the development of POCD is still unknown. METHODS: In this study, a POCD mouse model was constructed by unilateral nephrectomy under anesthesia, and cognitive function was assessed using the fear conditioning test and open field test. The expression of Smad7 at the mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus 3 days after surgery was examined by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Furthermore, to identify whether the elevation of Smad7 in the hippocampus after unilateral nephrectomy contributes to cognitive impairment, the expression of Smad7 in the hippocampal CA1 region was downregulated by crossing Smad7fl/fl conditional mutant mice and CaMKIIalpha-Cre line T29-1 transgenic mice or stereotaxic injection of shRNA-Smad7. Inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus were assessed by measuring the mRNA levels of typical inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL2, and the protein levels of apoptotic proteins, including Bax and Bcl2. In addition, apoptosis in the hippocampus postoperation was investigated by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining assay. Finally, western blotting was used to explore how Smad7 mediates inflammation and apoptosis postoperation. RESULTS: The results unequivocally revealed that elevated Smad7 in the hippocampal CA1 region significantly inhibited TGF-beta signal transduction by blocking Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which enhanced neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus and further led to learning and memory impairment after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that Smad7 contributes to cognitive impairment after surgery by enhancing neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus and might serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of memory impairment after anesthesia surgery.
