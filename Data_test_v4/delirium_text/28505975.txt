28505975|a|Previous studies have suggested that cardiovascular functions might play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the relationship among heart function, blood flow of cerebral vessels, and AD remains unclear. In the present study, AD patients (n = 34) and age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls (n = 34) were recruited. Demographic and comorbidity information was collected. The ejection fraction was measured using echocardiography, and the mean velocity, pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI) of the basilar artery (BA), left terminal internal carotid artery (LTICA), and right terminal internal carotid artery (RTICA) were measured using transcranial Doppler. The data of lacunae, white matter changes, and plaques in the aortic arch and carotid arteries were collected from brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography images. Compared with normal controls, AD patients had lower ejection fractions and cerebral blood flow velocities and higher RI and PI in the BA, LTICA, and RTICA, as well as more plaques in the aortic and carotid arteries. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the ejection fraction and the mean velocity of the BA and LTICA were independently associated with AD after adjusting for age, gender, education, vascular risk factors, arterial plaques, and brain ischemic lesions detected in the brain images. These findings suggest that heart function and vascular condition may play important roles in AD pathogenesis. Improving cardiovascular functions could be a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of AD.
