6495945|a|A study of 63 schizophrenic females with jealousy delirium has shown that the disease differs from that in males by the type of its course, premorbid characteristics, the time of the development of jealousy delusion, and its duration. The patients who have broken the law also differ from control patients with regard to personality changes, the acuteness of psychological symptomatology and specific features of delirious behaviour.
