39430920|a|Key Clinical Message: A thorough evaluation is necessary for seizures caused by hypocalcemia, both during the patient's presentation and following their recovery from the postictal seizure episode. This is because the underlying cause of hypocalcemia must be ruled out in order to ensure the best possible clinical outcome from calcium and vitamin D therapy. Abstract: Patients with multiple systemic issues, including neurological involvement and seizure development, are not uncommon among nephrologists. Both the central and peripheral neural systems can be impacted by kidney disease. The main symptoms are myopathy, cranial or peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and seizures. A 22-year-old female with an unusual medical history who had been known to have end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) for a year and regularly had CAPD (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) suffered from two episodes of tonic-colonic seizures 2 weeks apart. On physical examination, symptoms of tongue biting, decreased vision in the left eye, and mild bilateral pulmonary air entry were notable. Upon examination, there was evidence of severe hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, a high renal profile (urea and creatinine), anemia, and a severe vitamin D deficiency. Her peritoneal dialysis (PD) prescription was reviewed, her seizures ceased, and she was released from the hospital after the hypocalcemia was treated with intravenous calcium and high doses of vitamin D. The issue of hypocalcemic seizures should be carefully evaluated both at the presentation and after the patient recovers from the postictal stage. By following this, seizure episodes can be prevented with good success if patients strictly adhere to the medication for which they are responsible.
