37235776|t|Total Chemical Synthesis of Glycosylated TREM2 Ectodomain.
37235776|a|Mutations in a microglia-associated gene TREM2 increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, structural and functional studies of TREM2 mainly rely on recombinant TREM2 proteins expressed from mammalian cells. However, using this method, it is difficult to achieve site-specific labeling. Here, we present the total chemical synthesis of the 116 amino acid TREM2 ectodomain. Rigorous structural analysis ensured correct structural fold after refolding. Treating microglial cells with refolded synthetic TREM2 enhanced microglial phagocytosis, proliferation, and survival. We also prepared TREM2 constructs with defined glycosylation patterns and found that glycosylation at N79 is critical to the thermal stability of TREM2. This method will provide access to TREM2 constructs with site-specific labeling, such as fluorescent labeling, reactive chemical handles, and enrichment handles, to further advance our understanding of TREM2 in Alzheimer's disease.
