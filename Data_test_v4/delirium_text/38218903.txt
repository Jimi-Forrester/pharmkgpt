38218903|a|BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, present significant challenges for therapeutic development due to drug delivery restrictions and toxicity concerns. Prevailing strategies often employ adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to deliver neuroprotective survival genes directly into the central nervous system (CNS). However, these methods have been limited by triggering immunogenic responses and risk of tumorigenicity, resulting from overexpression of survival genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), thereby increasing the risk of tumorigenicity in specific immune cells. Thus, by coding selectively suppressive microRNA (miRNA) target sequences in AAV genome, we designed CNS-targeted neuroprotective gene expression vector system without leakage to blood cells. METHODS: To minimize the potential for transgene contamination in the blood, we designed a CNS-specific AAV system. Our system utilized a self-complementary AAV (scAAV), encoding a quadruple repeated target sequence of the hematopoietic cell-specific miR142-3p at the 3' untranslated region (UTR). As a representative therapeutic survival gene for Parkinson's disease treatment, we integrated DX2, an antagonistic splice variant of the apoptotic gene AIMP2, known to be implicated in Parkinson's disease, into the vector. RESULTS: This configuration ensured that transgene expression was stringently localized to the CNS, even if the vector found its way into the blood cells. A single injection of scAAV-DX2 demonstrated marked improvement in behavior and motor activity in animal models of Parkinson's disease induced by either Rotenone or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Importantly, comprehensive preclinical data adhering to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards revealed no adverse effects in the treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our CNS-specific vector system, which encodes a survival transgene DX2, signifies a promising avenue for safe gene therapy, avoiding unintended expression of survival gene in blood cells, applicable to various neurodegenerative diseases.
