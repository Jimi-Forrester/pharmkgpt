37599439|t|The Azalea Hypothesis of Alzheimer Disease: A Functional Iron Deficiency Promotes Neurodegeneration.
37599439|a|Chlorosis in azaleas is characterized by an interveinal yellowing of leaves that is typically caused by a deficiency of iron. This condition is usually due to the inability of cells to properly acquire iron as a consequence of unfavorable conditions, such as an elevated pH, rather than insufficient iron levels. The causes and effects of chlorosis were found to have similarities with those pertaining to a recently presented hypothesis that describes a pathogenic process in Alzheimer disease. This hypothesis states that iron becomes sequestered (e.g., by amyloid beta and tau), causing a functional deficiency of iron that disrupts biochemical processes leading to neurodegeneration. Additional mechanisms that contribute to iron becoming unavailable include iron-containing structures not undergoing proper recycling (e.g., disrupted mitophagy and altered ferritinophagy) and failure to successfully translocate iron from one compartment to another (e.g., due to impaired lysosomal acidification). Other contributors to a functional deficiency of iron in patients with Alzheimer disease include altered metabolism of heme or altered production of iron-containing proteins and their partners (e.g., subunits, upstream proteins). A review of the evidence supporting this hypothesis is presented. Also, parallels between the mechanisms underlying a functional iron-deficient state in Alzheimer disease and those occurring for chlorosis in plants are discussed. Finally, a model describing the generation of a functional iron deficiency in Alzheimer disease is put forward.
