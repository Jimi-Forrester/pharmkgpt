30946773|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify trends of patients' urinary and sexual dysfunctions from a clinical and psychological perspective and understand whether sociodemographic and medical predictors could differentiate among patients following different one-year longitudinal trajectories. METHODS: An Italian sample of 478 prostate cancer patients undergone Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy completed the EPIC-26 survey between July 2015 and July 2016 at the pre-hospitalization (T0), 45 days (T1) and 3 (T2), 6 (T3), 9 (T4), and 12 months (T5) after surgery. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (age, BMI, diabetes, nerve-sparing procedure) were also collected. Latent Class Growth Analysis was conducted separately for sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence EPIC-26 subscales. The association between membership in the two longitudinal trajectories of urinary and sexual dysfunctions was assessed by considering Chi-square test and its related contingency table. RESULTS: People who have a high level of urinary incontinence at T1 are likely to have a worse recovery. Age, BMI and pre-surgical continence may affect the level of incontinence at T1 and the recovery trajectories. Patients with low and moderate sexual problems at T1 can face a moderate linear recovery, while people with high level of impotence immediately after surgery may take a longer period to solve sexual dysfunctions. Age and the pre-surgical sexual condition may impact the recovery. Finally, a great proportion of patients reported both steady problems in sexual function and constant high levels of urinary incontinence over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights different categories of patients at risk who may be important to know in order to develop personalized medical pathways and predictive models in a value-based healthcare.
