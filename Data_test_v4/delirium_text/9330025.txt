9330025|t|Confusional State Evaluation (CSE): an instrument for measuring severity of delirium in the elderly.
9330025|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium or confusional state is a common mental disorder in the elderly. To follow changes in symptoms over time and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment of delirium, a reliable and valid instrument for measuring degrees of delirium is essential. METHOD: An observer's rating scale with 22 items, the Confusional State Evaluation (CSE), was developed. Scores on 12 of the items were summarised to a "confusion score". Based on ratings of 71 demented and non-demented elderly patients with delirium, the interrater reliability and validity of the scale was studied. RESULTS: Agreement between two independent raters was fair to excellent (weighted kappa 0.38-0.93). The correlation between the "confusion score" of the scale and the global rating by a psychogeriatrician was good (r = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The CSE seems to be a reliable and valid measuring instrument which can be useful in following the course of confusion in elderly patients.
