39873689|t|Clinical Practice Guideline: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in the Hospital.
39873689|a|BACKGROUND: An increasing number of older people are being treated in German hospitals. In 2022, more than 35.7 million hospitalized patients in Germany were of age 65 or older. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can help to structure and improve the diagnosis and treatment of these patients, many of whom suffer from multimorbidity. METHODS: The guideline group developed this guideline in accordance with the AWMF recommendations. Answers to questions were either evidence-based or consensus-based; the latter were established with a Delphi procedure followed by a consensus conference. The guideline was issued in May 2024. RESULTS: The guideline contains twelve evidence-based and eight consensus-based recommendations and statements. The strongest evidence for the effectiveness of CGA was found in the wards for acute geriatric medicine, oncology, and orthopedics/trauma surgery, with weaker evidence from emergency departments and general surgery wards. Core elements of the guideline are the specification of a minimum duration of CGA (15 minutes), the definition of minimum requirements (six core dimensions: self-help ability, mobility, cognitive function/delirium, affect, nutrition, social situation), and setting-specific process recommendations. Specific screening instruments to identify patients who stand to benefit from CGA are recommended mainly in the oncological setting (G8 questionnaire). CONCLUSION: The German clinical practice guideline on CGA can serve as a guide to personalized geriatric medicine in the hospital. Further complex interventional studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of CGA in other settings.
