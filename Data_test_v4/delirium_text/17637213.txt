17637213|t|Domperidone is effective in the prevention of rivastigmine-related gastrointestinal disturbances.
17637213|a|Nausea and/or vomiting are frequent dose-limiting class effects of cholinesterase inhibitors, occurring mostly during the dose-escalation phase. These untoward effects make it difficult to increase rivastigmine dosage above 6 mg daily in most patients. The antiemetic domperidone was given to 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease (9 men, 13 women; mean age 74.5+/-4.6 years; mean age at diagnosis: 73.1+/-5.0 years) in 15-day prophylactic cycles, starting 15 days before each dose escalation of rivastigmine above 6 mg daily. Only four patients (18.2%) experienced nausea, which was so mild that all patients reached >or=9 mg rivastigmine daily and 16 (72.7%) reached and maintained the top dosage (12 mg daily). An improvement or stabilization of Mini Mental State Examination scores was achieved in 54.5% of the patients. The treatment regimen was well tolerated; no patients stopped treatment because of adverse events. Further investigations assessing the role of domperidone in the prevention of rivastigmine-related gastrointestinal disturbances are warranted.
