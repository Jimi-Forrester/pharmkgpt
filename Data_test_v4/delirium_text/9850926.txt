9850926|t|Therapeutic strategies based on immunological hypotheses of Alzheimer's disease.
9850926|a|There are several findings demonstrating the importance of inflammatory or immunological processes in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) give evidence for a therapeutic effect of these drugs in AD, among other the prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study on indomethacin, strongly support the therapeutic effect of these agents. Possibly also the therapeutic effects of propentofylline might be interpreted in the light of this theory.
