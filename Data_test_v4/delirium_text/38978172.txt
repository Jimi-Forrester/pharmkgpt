38978172|t|Delirium diagnostic tools in the postoperative setting: A scoping review protocol.
38978172|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute and fluctuating disturbance in attention, awareness, and cognition, commonly observed in hospital settings, particularly among older adults, critically ill and surgical patients. Delirium poses significant challenges in patient care, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and functional decline. AIM: The aim of this review is to map existing evidence on delirium diagnostic tools suitable for use in patients treated surgically due to hip fracture, to inform clinical practice and enhance patient care protocols in the postoperative setting. METHOD: We will conduct a scoping review on delirium diagnostic tools used for adult patients in the postoperative setting according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Eligibility criteria encompass all languages, publications dates, and study designs, with exception of case-reports. We will systematically search multiple databases and include unpublished trials, ensuring a comprehensive review based on a predefined protocol. RESULTS: Results will be presented descriptively, with supplementary tables and graphs. Studies will be grouped by design, surgical specialties, and diagnostic tools to identify potential variations. CONCLUSION: This scoping review will provide an overview of existing delirium diagnostic tools used in the postoperative setting and highlight knowledge-gaps to support future research. Due to the large number of patients affected by postoperative delirium, evidence mapping is much needed to facilitate evidence-based practice.
