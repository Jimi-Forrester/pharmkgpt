2532018|a|Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured in anterior and posterior grey matter of the lumbar spinal cord and in temporal and frontal cortex from six cases of Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD), one case of Down's syndrome, three cases of schizophrenia (SZ) and six controls. Compared with control and SZ values, ChAT and AChE were reduced in ATD cerebral cortex. ChAT was reduced, and AChE unaltered, in ATD spinal cord. Decreased cord ChAT may be related to electrophysiological abnormalities which have been reported in motor nerves of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
