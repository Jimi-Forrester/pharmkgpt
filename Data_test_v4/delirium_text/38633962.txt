38633962|t|Permissive Weight Bearing in Patients With Surgically Treated Periprosthetic Femoral Fractures Around Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Scoping Review.
38633962|a|Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PPFF) around total hip arthroplasty (THA) are one of the leading causes of hip revision. High mortality rates are observed after revision in case of PPFF around THA. To modify risk factors, early postoperative mobilization is necessary. Permissive weight bearing (PWB) is designed to optimize clinical recovery in aftercare. This study aimed to perform a scoping review to summarize the current available evidence on postoperative weight bearing in late PPFF around THA and the implementation of PWB in aftercare. A systematic search was performed on the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases on January 26th, 2023. Articles were screened in two stages by two independent reviewers. Studies describing adult patients with a history of primary THA who were surgically treated for late PPFF and mentioning prescribed postoperative weight-bearing protocols with relevant outcome measures were included. Seven studies were included, reporting data on 22 patients (age range 47-97 years, BMI range 19-32 kg/m2, ASA classification range 2-3). No studies used PWB in aftercare. The non-weight-bearing group showed no complications. The restricted weight-bearing group had one death and one implant failure. The full weight-bearing group experienced one deep infection and one plate removal because of impingement. The main finding was that, after an extensive systematic search, no articles could be included focusing on PWB in patients with a late PPFF after THA. Addressing this gap in the literature is essential to advancing the understanding of postoperative weight-bearing protocols and PWB for late PPFF around THA.
