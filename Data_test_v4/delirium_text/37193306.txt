37193306|a|Purpose: Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) is an acute severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction characterized by life-threatening respiratory and circulatory collapse. In our previous study, we reported the epidemiology of suspected POA in China. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the management and outcomes of these cases and further verify the risk factors for near-fatal and fatal outcomes. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 447 cases of suspected life-threatening POA encountered at 112 tertiary hospitals in mainland China between September 2018 and August 2019. Patient characteristics, symptoms, duration of hypotension, treatments, and clinical outcomes were documented. Bivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for near-fatal and fatal outcomes. Results: Most cases of suspected POA (89.9%) were recognized and treated within 5 min. Epinephrine was administered as the initial treatment in 232 (51.9%) cases. Corticosteroids (26.6%), other vasoactive drugs (18.3%), and bronchodilators (1.6%) were also administered as the initial treatment instead of epinephrine. The initial dosage of epinephrine (median, 35 microg) was insufficient according to the anaphylaxis guidelines. On multivariable analysis, age >=65 years (odds ratio [OR] 7.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-41.87, P=0.022), ASA physical status IV (OR 17.68; 95% CI: 4.53-68.94; P<0.001), and hypotension duration >=15 min (OR 3.63; 95% CI: 1.11-11.87; P=0.033) were risk factors for fatal and near-fatal outcomes. Conclusion: Most cases in this study were managed in a timely manner, but the epinephrine application should be optimized according to the guidelines. Age >=65 years, ASA physical status IV, and long-term hypotension were risk factors for near-fatal and fatal outcomes.
