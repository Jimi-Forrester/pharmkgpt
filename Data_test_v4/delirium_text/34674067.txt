34674067|t|Cerebral hemorrhagic infarction was diagnosed subsequently after high-amplitude slow waves detected on processed electroencephalogram during sedation: a case report.
34674067|a|BACKGROUND: Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is useful for assessing the level of sedation and detecting non-convulsive epileptic seizures and cerebral ischemia in the intensive care unit. This report describes a case of cerebral hemorrhagic infarction diagnosed after the detection of high-amplitude slow waves on processed EEG during sedation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man who underwent cardiac surgery was sedated in the intensive care unit following an invasive procedure. High-amplitude slow waves appeared on processed EEG monitoring before the detection of anisocoria. Computed tomography revealed a cerebral hemorrhagic infarction. CONCLUSIONS: In the management of critically ill patients, continuous EEG monitoring with forehead electrodes may be useful in the early detection of brain lesions.
