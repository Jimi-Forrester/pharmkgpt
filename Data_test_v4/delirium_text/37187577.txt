37187577|t|Should artificial intelligence be used in conjunction with Neuroimaging in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease?
37187577|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, behavior, and other cognitive functions. Although there is no cure, detecting AD early is important for the development of a therapeutic plan and a care plan that may preserve cognitive function and prevent irreversible damage. Neuroimaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET), has served as a critical tool in establishing diagnostic indicators of AD during the preclinical stage. However, as neuroimaging technology quickly advances, there is a challenge in analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of brain imaging data. Given these limitations, there is great interest in using artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist in this process. AI introduces limitless possibilities in the future diagnosis of AD, yet there is still resistance from the healthcare community to incorporate AI in the clinical setting. The goal of this review is to answer the question of whether AI should be used in conjunction with neuroimaging in the diagnosis of AD. To answer the question, the possible benefits and disadvantages of AI are discussed. The main advantages of AI are its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, improve the efficiency in analyzing radiographic data, reduce physician burnout, and advance precision medicine. The disadvantages include generalization and data shortage, lack of in vivo gold standard, skepticism in the medical community, potential for physician bias, and concerns over patient information, privacy, and safety. Although the challenges present fundamental concerns and must be addressed when the time comes, it would be unethical not to use AI if it can improve patient health and outcome.
