26140607|t|Prospects of beta-Secretase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
26140607|a|beta-Secretase continues to be an attractive drug discovery target for the therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This enzyme plays a critical role in the production of neurotoxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the brain. Over the years, extensive research efforts have led to the development of many promising classes of inhibitors against this protease. Many small-molecule, peptidomimetic, and nonpeptide beta-secretase inhibitors have now overcome the key challenging development hurdles such as selectivity and brain penetration. A number of inhibitors have also shown further promise in reducing brain Abeta and rescuing cognitive decline in animal models. Recently, several beta-secretase inhibitors have entered into preclinical and phase I studies, and at least one of these inhibitors has advanced to phase II/III human trials. The outlook on beta-secretase inhibitor drugs for the treatment of AD patients is discussed herein.
