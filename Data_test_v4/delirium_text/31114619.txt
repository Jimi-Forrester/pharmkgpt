31114619|a|Objective: Bipolar disorder is a severe, disabling, and recurring disorder. Some studies have shown that the frequency of bipolar disorder in patients with medical diseases is higher than healthy controls. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of bipolar disorders in medically ill patients hospitalized in Iranian general hospitals. Method : In this cross sectional study, 697 inpatients (342 men, 49.1%) from different wards of 3 general hospitals, with the mean age of 39.3+-10, were enrolled in the study using nonprobability sampling. Demographic questionnaire, Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale (BSDS) were used. Inclusion criteria were as follow: informed consent, age 18-65 years, ability to speak Persian, and having at least middle school education. Results: The frequency of bipolar disorder was 12.1% and 20.8% based on BSDS and MDQ, respectively. The results of both tests were positive in 7.9% of hospitalized patients. The frequency of bipolar mood disorder was significantly higher in single patients and in those with comorbidity of alcohol and substance use disorders. Conclusion: Considering the high frequency of bipolar mood disorders in hospitalized medically ill patients and its probable effects on compliance and prognosis, early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of bipolar mood disorders is important in these patients.
