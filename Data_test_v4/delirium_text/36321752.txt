36321752|a|BACKGROUND: Purpose of the present study is an evaluation of postoperative incidence for delirium after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Study addressed whether application of Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) solution (Bretschneider) or blood cardioplegia (Calafiore) is associated with increased of postoperative delirium cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective, single center evaluation a total number of 273 patients were enrolled in the study from January 2017 to October 2021. There were 124 patients assigned to the Calafiore group blood cardioplegic solution (BCC) and 149 patients were included in the Bretschneider group (HTK). The primary endpoint was the postoperative delirium rate in its frequency of occurrence. Definition of the dilirium status was performed using the Confusion Assessment Method in the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) score during the first three postoperative days. Secondary endpoints were the time intervals of intensive care duration of stay, mechanical ventilation, total extracorporeal circulation, ischemia and reperfusion. Serum levels of the electrolytes Sodium, Potassium, ionized Calcium, and Chloride were monitored. RESULTS: Although no significant difference in delirium status between the groups were noticed, on third postoperative day, delirium rate dependent on cardioplegia solution used (HTK 12.0%; BCC 3.0%; p = .024) and duration of intensive care stay differed (HTK 4.5 vs. BCC 3.0 days; p = .001). Although Ischemic time (HTK 73.0 vs. BCC 83.0 min; p < .001) and reperfusion time (HTK 35.0 vs. Calafiore 24.0 min; p < .001) were extended in the BCC group less cases of delirium were diagnosed. Serum sodium levels after HTK cardioplegic infusion were decreased (HTK 129.68 vs. BCC 138.96 mmol/l; p < .001). The significant difference persists up to the hundredth extracorporeal circulation circuit min (p = .005). CONCLUSION: The present data suggest an impact of the cardioplegic solution used upon postoperative delirium rates. Optimization of cardiac arrest protocols is needed. Present data encourage further prospective studies regarding the impact of cardioplegic solutions on electrolyte imbalance for postoperative delirium rates in CABG surgery.
