33658488|a|Sodium iodate (SI) is a widely used oxidant for generating retinal degeneration models by inducing the death of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. However, the mechanism of RPE cell death induced by SI remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the necrotic features of cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19) cells treated with SI and found that apoptosis or necroptosis was not the major death pathway. Instead, the death process was accompanied by significant elevation of intracellular labile iron level, ROS, and lipid peroxides which recapitulated the key features of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis inhibitors deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) and ferrostatin-1(Fer-1) partially prevented SI-induced cell death. Further studies revealed that SI treatment did not alter GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4) expression, but led to the depletion of reduced thiol groups, mainly intracellular GSH (reduced glutathione) and cysteine. The study on iron trafficking demonstrated that iron influx was not altered by SI treatment but iron efflux increased, indicating that the increase in labile iron was likely due to the release of sequestered iron. This hypothesis was verified by showing that SI directly promoted the release of labile iron from a cell-free lysate. We propose that SI depletes GSH, increases ROS, releases labile iron, and boosts lipid damage, which in turn results in ferroptosis in ARPE-19 cells.
