34316672|a|INTRODUCTION: Frailty and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common conditions that increase with age. Independently, frailty and PD lead to increased morbidity and mortality for patients. Few studies report on frailty in patients with PD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence, associations and outcomes of frailty in persons with PD. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases and grey literature from inception to May 19, 2020, for articles which reported the prevalence, associations and outcomes of frailty in persons with PD. RESULTS: One-thousand and sixty-three citations were identified, of which 127 articles were reviewed. Thirty studies were included. Twenty-eight studies were observational and the settings varied including 25 community and 5 inpatient studies.The most common frailty screening measures were the frailty phenotype and clinical frailty scale. The prevalence of frailty in PD using the FP was 0.38 (0.24-0.55) with I2 = 92.6% (p < 0.01). Frailty was associated with recurrent falls, cognitive impairment, dementia, orthostatic hypotension, fatigue, hallucinations, nursing home placement, dependency in activities of daily living and in-patient mortality. PD disease duration, motor impairment, non-tremor dominant PD (postural instability/gait difficulty dominant phenotype) and total daily levodopa dose were associated with frailty. CONCLUSION: Frailty is common in PD. There is no agreed upon tool for identifying frailty, however, the importance of its identification is apparent given the high prevalence and the association between frailty and adverse outcomes in persons with PD. Future studies are required to guide clinicians in how best to identify and manage frail patients with PD.
