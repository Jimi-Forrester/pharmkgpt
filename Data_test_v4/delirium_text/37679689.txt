37679689|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia. Serum complement factor 5a (C5a) is exceedingly implicated in AD. We explored the role of C5a levels in AD patients of different severity. METHODS: Mild, moderate, and severe AD patients, and healthy controls were included. C5a and pro-inflammatory factor (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, CRP) levels were assessed by ELISA, and cognitive function was evaluated by Mini-Mental state examination (MMSE) score. The correlations between C5a, inflammatory factor levels, MMSE score, and plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio were analyzed by Pearson tests. Independent risk factors for AD aggravation were assessed by logistic multivariate regression analysis. According to the cut-off value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of C5a level, AD patients were assigned into low/high expression groups, and severe AD incidence was compared. Severe AD cumulative incidence was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curve. RESULTS: Serum C5a, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and CRP levels were raised, and MMSE score was lowered in AD. Serum C5a, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and CRP levels in severe AD patients were higher than those in mild/moderate AD patients, but there were no significant differences in these cytokines between moderate and mild AD groups. The MMSE score of severe AD patients was lower than that of mild/moderate AD patients. Serum C5a level was positively correlated with serum TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and CRP levels, and negatively correlated with MMSE score, with no obvious correlation with plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Serum C5a level was one of the independent risk factors for AD aggravation. The occurrence of severe AD might be related to an increase in serum C5a level. CONCLUSION: Serum C5a level increased with AD severity, and its expression was positively correlated with serum pro-inflammatory factor levels, and negatively correlated with cognitive function.
