11382871|a|Changes in sleep structure, and especially REM sleep, and in EEG activation were studied in relation to the cholinergic deficit found in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). With respect to sleep architecture, only REM sleep percent was reduced in AD patients compared to controls as a result of a decrease in mean REM episode duration. Different results were obtained in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These results are discussed with respect to the role of brainstem and forebrain cholinergic populations in REM sleep generation in humans. More importantly, it was shown by means of spectral analyses that EEG slowing is much more prominent in REM sleep than in wakefulness in AD. Furthermore, there is a distinct topographical pattern of REM sleep EEG slowing in AD patients which is in agreement with findings from neuroradiological and neuropathological studies. Using the ratio of slow over fast frequencies from the temporal regions, a correct classification of 90.4% of subjects was obtained for the REM sleep EEG. This discrimination rate is the best marker of AD so far using a single measure. Quantitative REM sleep EEG was also used to evaluate patients' biological response to cholinergic treatments. Finally, we present here preliminary data on the progression of EEG slowing in wakefulness and in REM sleep. After six months on a placebo, there was only a decrease in alpha activity in wakefulness over all regions studied. No changes were observed for REM sleep.
