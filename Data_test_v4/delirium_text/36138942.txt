36138942|a|Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a common complication of chronic dopamine replacement therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), and a noble cause of disability in advanced PD patients. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of non-coding RNA with a covalently closed-loop structure, which can regulate gene expression and participate in many biological processes. However, the biological roles of circRNAs in LID are not completely known. In the present study, we established typical LID rat models by unilateral lesions of the medial forebrain bundle and repeated levodopa therapy. High-throughput next-generation sequencing was used to screen circRNAs differentially expressed in the brain of LID and non-LID (NLID) rats, and key circRNAs were selected according to bioinformatics analyses. Regarding fold change >=2 and p < 0.05 as the cutoff value, there were a total of 99 differential circRNAs, including 39 up-regulated and 60 down-regulated circRNAs between the NLID and LID groups. The expression of rno-Rsf1_0012 was significantly increased in the striatum of LID rats and competitively bound rno-mir-298-5p. The high expression of target genes PCP and TBP in LID rats also supports the conclusion that rno-Rsf1_0012 may be related to the occurrence of LID.
