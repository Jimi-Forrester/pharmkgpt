32155491|a|Multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are considered a growing public health problem due the rising incidence and low effectiveness of current treatments [6]. Since pharmacotherapy based on a single target has been insufficient for drug development in complex diseases, the emerging multi-target approach is a promising strategy for the search of new anti-AD drug candidates. Herein described natural isoquinoline alkaloids were investigated for multi-target activity on key mechanisms associated with the AD's pathogenesis, i.e. cholinergic depletion, beta amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and oxidative stress. Alkaloid isolation from root extract of Zanthoxylum rigidum was carried out using multi-step chromatography and TLC-bioautography against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) giving eight purified isoquinoline alkaloids. Isolated compounds were tested for inhibitory activity against cholinesterase (AChE and BChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and B) and Abeta aggregation. Our study revealed two benzophenanthridine alkaloids, nitidine (5) and avicine (7), as the most potent multi-target candidates. Both showed dual cholinesterase inhibition, being more active against AChE over BChE, with IC50 values in sub-micromolar range in AChE. Kinetic analysis with cholinesterase showed, that both compounds are reversible-mixed inhibitors, where avicine (7) presented highest potency with Ki values of 0.063 microM (EeAChE), 0.511 microM (HrAChE) and 0.123 microM (EqBChE). In addition, these alkaloids presented moderate Abeta1-42 anti-aggregation activity and MAO-A inhibition with IC50 values between 0.5 and 2 microM. Our findings suggest that avicine (7) is a promising natural compound and multifunctional candidate representing a suitable starting point for the development of new therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.
