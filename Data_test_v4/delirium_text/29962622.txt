29962622|t|The Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Midazolam, Ketamine, and Midazolam Combined with Ketamine Administered Nasally for Premedication in Children.
29962622|a|BACKGROUND: In this prospective, randomized study, we evaluated the intranasal administration of Midazolam ketamine combination, midazolam, and ketamine in premedication for children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 60 American Society of Anesthesiology physical status Classes I and II children aged between 1 and 10 years undergoing ear nose throat operations. All cases were premedicated 15 min before operation with intranasal administration of 0.2 mg/kg midazolam in Group M, 5 mg/kg Ketamine in Group K, and 0.1 mg/kg Midazolam + 3 mg/kg ketamine in Group MK. Patients were evaluated for sedation, anxiety scores, respiratory, and hemodynamic effects before premedication, 5 min interval between induction and postoperative period. RESULTS: There was no difference with respect to age, sex, weight, the duration of the operation, and for mask tolerance. Sedation scores were significantly higher in Group MK. There was no statistically difference between the groups for heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. CONCLUSION: We concluded that intranasal MK combination provides sufficient sedation, comfortable anesthesia induction with postoperative recovery for pediatric premedication.
