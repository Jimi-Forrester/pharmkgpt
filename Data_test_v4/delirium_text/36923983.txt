36923983|t|Semiquantitative Approach to Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography Interpretation in Clinical Practice.
36923983|a|Objective  Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) plays a vital role in the in vivo detection of beta-amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. Increasingly, trainees and infrequent readers are relying on semiquantitative analyses to support clinical diagnostic efforts. Our objective was to determine if the visual assessment of amyloid PET may be facilitated by relying on semiquantitative analysis. Methods  We conducted a retrospective review of [ 18 F]-florbetaben PET/computed tomographies (CTs) from 2016 to 2018. Visual interpretation to determine Abeta+ status was conducted by two readers blinded to each other's interpretation. Scans were then post-processed utilizing the MIMneuro software, which generated regional-based semiquantitative Z-scores indicating cortical Abeta-burden. Results  Of 167 [ 18 F]-florbetaben PET/CTs, 92/167 (reader-1) and 101/167 (reader-2) were positive for amyloid deposition (agreement = 92.2%, kappa = 0.84). Additional nine scans were identified as possible Abeta-positive based solely on semiquantitative analyses. Largest semiquantitative differences were identified in the left frontal lobe (Z = 7.74 in Abeta + ; 0.50 in Abeta - ). All unilateral regions showed large statistically significant differences in Abeta-burden ( P <= 2.08E-28). Semiquantitative scores were highly sensitive to Abeta+ status and accurate in their ability to identify amyloid positivity, defined as a positive scan by both readers (AUC >= 0.90 [0.79-1.00]). Spread analyses suggested that amyloid deposition was most severe in the left posterior cingulate gyrus. The largest differences between Abeta +/Abeta- were in the left frontal lobe. Analyses using region-specific cutoffs indicated that the presence of amyloid in the temporal and anterior cingulate cortex, while exhibiting relatively low Z-scores, was most common. Conclusion  Visual assessment and semiquantitative analysis provide highly congruent results, thereby enhancing reader confidence and improving scan interpretation. This is particularly relevant, given recent advances in amyloid-targeting disease-modifying therapeutics.
