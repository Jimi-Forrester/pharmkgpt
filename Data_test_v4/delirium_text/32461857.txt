32461857|t|Correlation of Homocysteine Level and Age in Patients with Ischemic Stroke.
32461857|a|Introduction Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with atherosclerosis, as it can be seen in inborn errors of methionine metabolism. Likewise, many studies have also reported more modest increases in serum homocysteine levels in other atherosclerotic disorders like cardiovascular disease and all types of stroke with a positive correlation with age. But overall literature is controversial. Therefore, this study is being conducted to further investigate the relationship between homocysteine levels and age in patients, especially those with ischemic stroke. Material and methods This cross-sectional study is conducted at a major hospital in Karachi in which all patients with ischemic stroke, diagnosed within 24 hours on CT, and age 40-75 years of both genders were enrolled for six months. Other demographics were also noted like gender, smoking status, and comorbidities (diabetes mellitus [DM], hypertension [HTN]). The homocysteine level was also checked by collecting non-fasting blood. Vitamin B12 level was not checked. The age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and homocysteine level's means and standard deviations and the gender, DM, hypertension, and smoking status frequencies and percentages were calculated. The correlation coefficient of homocysteine level and age was also calculated. Stratification was done to see the effects of gender, BMI, DM, and HTN on homocysteine levels by applying the chi-square test. Results The mean age of the patients was 55.60 +- 11.45 years. Gender distribution showed that 111 (62.40%) patients were male, and 67 (37.60%) patients were female. Diabetic, hypertensive, and smoking status of the patients was 58 (32.60%), 96 (53.90%), and 53 (29.80%), respectively. The mean homocysteine level was 14.61, with a standard deviation of 1.47. Pearson's correlation test showed that there is no statistically significant correlation between homocysteine levels and age. But a significant linear relationship was found of homocysteine levels with DM and HTN.  Conclusion Further investigation of the relationship of homocysteine levels with age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, and the role of homocysteine as a risk factor for ischemic stroke should be carried out on a larger scale to prove its accuracy. The benefits of screening for homocysteine levels also need to be studied in the elderly, especially those with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which can lead to timely prevention of strokes and ischemic heart disease with vitamin B supplements, and other appropriate interventions.
