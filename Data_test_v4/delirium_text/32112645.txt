32112645|a|OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have provided robust evidence that cognitive impairment exists in patients with type 2 diabetes. The predictive role of S100B in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, has been shown to be closely related to cognitive function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between serum S100B levels and cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients. RESULTS: The type 2 diabetes group scored lower than the healthy control group in all domains of cognitive function except language and attention, and the former group also had lower serum levels of S100B. Besides, serum S100B levels were lower in the type 2 diabetes patients with impaired cognition than in those with normal cognition. In addition, the moderate to severe cognitive impairment group had significantly lower levels than that in mild cognitive impairment group. After adjusting for confounding factors, serum S100B levels were positively correlated with cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S100B levels were positively correlated with cognitive function in type 2 diabetes patients with cognitive impairment. It is suggested that S100B may be involved in the occurrence and development of cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes patients and play a protective role. METHODS: The clinical data and biochemical indexes of ninety-six patients with type 2 diabetes and sixty-eight healthy subjects were collected. The levels of serum S100B were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ninety-six type 2 diabetes patients were divided into a cognitive dysfunction group and a normal cognition group according to Mini-mental State Examination scores. To better understand the differences in various aspects of cognition, we used the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scale for further evaluation. To study the relationship between serum S100B levels and cognitive impairment, the cognitive dysfunction group was divided into a mild cognitive impairment group and a moderate to severe cognitive impairment group for further study.
