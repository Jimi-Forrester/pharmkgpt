36110544|a|Prostate cancer (PRAD) is a common and fatal malignancy. It is difficult to manage clinically due to drug resistance and poor prognosis, thus creating an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. Although G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been most attractive for drug development, there have been lack of an exhaustive assessment on GPCRs in PRAD like their molecular features, prognostic and therapeutic values. To close this gap, we herein systematically investigate multi-omics profiling for GPCRs in the primary PRAD by analyzing somatic mutations, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylation and mRNA expression. GPCRs exhibit low expression levels and mutation frequencies while SCNAs are more prevalent. 46 and 255 disease-related GPCRs are identified by the mRNA expression and DNA methylation analysis, respectively, complementing information lack in the genome analysis. In addition, the genomic alterations do not exhibit an observable correlation with the GPCR expression, reflecting the complex regulatory processes from DNA to RNA. Conversely, a tight association is observed between the DNA methylation and mRNA expression. The virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation further identify four potential drugs in repositioning to PRAD. The combination of 3 clinical characteristics and 26 GPCR molecular features revealed by the transcriptome and genome exhibit good performance in predicting progression-free survival in patients with the primary PRAD, providing candidates as new biomarkers. These observations from the multi-omics analysis on GPCRs provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of primary PRAD and potential of GPCRs in developing therapeutic strategies on PRAD.
