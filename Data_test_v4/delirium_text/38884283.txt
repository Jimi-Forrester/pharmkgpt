38884283|t|A small-molecule microtubule-stabilizing agent safely reduces Abeta plaque and tau pathology in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
38884283|a|INTRODUCTION: Intraneuronal inclusions composed of tau protein are found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Tau normally binds microtubules (MTs), and its disengagement from MTs and misfolding in AD is thought to result in MT abnormalities. We previously identified triazolopyrimidine-containing MT-stabilizing compounds that provided benefit in AD mouse models and herein describe the characterization and efficacy testing of an optimized candidate, CNDR-51997. METHODS: CNDR-51997 underwent pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety pharmacology, and mouse tolerability testing. In addition, the compound was examined for efficacy in 5XFAD amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque mice and PS19 tauopathy mice. RESULTS: CNDR-51997 significantly reduced Abeta plaques in 5XFAD mice and tau pathology in PS19 mice, with the latter also showing attenuated axonal dystrophy and gliosis. CNDR-51997 was well tolerated at doses that exceeded efficacy doses, with a good safety pharmacology profile. DISCUSSION: CNDR-51997 may be a candidate for advancement as a potential therapeutic agent for AD and/or other tauopathies. Highlights There is evidence of microtubule alterations (MT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and in mouse models of AD pathology. Intermittent dosing with an optimized, brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing small-molecule, CNDR-51997, reduced both Abeta plaque and tau inclusion pathology in established mouse models of AD. CNDR-51997 attenuated axonal dystrophy and gliosis in a tauopathy mouse model, with a strong trend toward reduced hippocampal neuron loss. CNDR-51997 is well tolerated in mice at doses that are meaningfully greater than required for efficacy in AD mouse models, and the compound has a good safety pharmacology profile.
