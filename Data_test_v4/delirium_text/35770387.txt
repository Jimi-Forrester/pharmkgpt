35770387|t|Effect of acute depression associated with COVID-19 infection on health-seeking behaviour: a psychiatrist's personal account and case report.
35770387|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the abundant research on COVID-19-related mental health problems, little attention has been paid to acute depression occurring concurrently with the infection as a neuropsychiatric manifestation. This is important because depression is known to adversely affect help-seeking. Decreased help-seeking is likely to be aggravated by the isolation measures demanded as part of fighting the pandemic, given the disruption of social support networks. AIMS: To study the effects of acute depression associated with COVID-19 infection on help-seeking behaviour. METHOD: We present a case report and personal account of a patient psychiatrist who developed a first onset of acute depression as part of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Despite being a mental health expert the patient lacked insight into his mood change and its negative effect on help-seeking behaviour, resulting in reliance on a family caregiver to raise the alarm. CONCLUSIONS: For those experiencing this complex interaction between COVID-19 infection and the brain, social support will be needed to ensure timely presentation to the healthcare system. Greater attention to behavioural change as part of COVID-19 infection is needed to optimise treatment outcome.
