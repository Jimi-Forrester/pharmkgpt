32875460|a|Validated screening tools for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are lacking for the newly emergent ageing population of people living with HIV (PLWH) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We aimed to validate and compare diagnostic accuracy of two cognitive screening tools, the International HIV dementia scale (IHDS), and the Identification and Interventions for Dementia in Elderly Africans (IDEA) screen, for identification of HAND in older PLWH in Tanzania. A systematic sample of 253 PLWH aged >= 50 attending a Government clinic in Tanzania were screened with the IHDS and IDEA. HAND were diagnosed by consensus American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria based on detailed clinical neuropsychological assessment. Strict blinding was maintained between screening and clinical evaluation. Both tools had limited diagnostic accuracy for HAND (area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve 0.639-0.667 IHDS, 0.647-0.713 IDEA), which was highly-prevalent (47.0%). Accurate HAND screening tools for older PLWH in SSA are needed.
