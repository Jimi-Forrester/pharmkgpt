35092980|a|Patients with dementia with Lewy body(DLB), Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTP), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and healthy controls in the Department of Neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from August 2019 to March 2021 were recruited, with 3 in each group. Phosphorylated alpha-synuclein from the skin of DLB patients was detected by skin micro-biopsy and compared with patients with AD, FTP, PSP and health controls. Phosphorylated alpha-synuclein was found in the skin nerves of the DLB patients, while no alpha-synuclein were detected in the skin samples of others. Skin phosphorylated alpha-synuclein may potentially become a diagnostic biomarker of DLB, however further studies are warranted to assess its sensitivity and specificity.
