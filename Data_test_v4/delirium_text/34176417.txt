34176417|a|Introduction: O-GlcNAcylation is a highly abundant post-translational modification of multiple proteins, including the microtubule-binding protein tau, governed by just two enzymes' concerted action O-GlcNAc transferase OGT and the hydrolase OGA. It is an approach to reduce abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies based on the ability of O-GlcNAcylation competing with tau phosphorylation, thus minimizing aggregation. The preclinical validation confirmed OGA inhibitors' efficacy in different transgenic tau mice models. Only three other OGA inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials thus far.Areas covered: 2008-2020 patent literature on OGA inhibitors.Expert opinion: Neurodegenerative disorders and AD specifically represent an enormous challenge since no effective treatments are available. Promising preclinical data has prompted considerable interest in searching for OGA inhibitors as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative disorders. Efforts from different companies have yielded a diverse set of chemotypes. OGA is a highly ubiquitous enzyme with many client proteins, generated data confirms a promising benign profile for OGA inhibition in healthy volunteers. Additionally, OGA PET tracers' existence will be critical for proper dose selection for future PoC Phase II studies, which will proof the true potential of OGA inhibition for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies.
