38113756|a|INTRODUCTION: Population aging longevity and advances in robotic surgery suggest that increasing numbers of older women having gynaeoncological surgery is likely. Postoperative morbidity and mortality are more common in older than younger women with the age-associated characteristics of multimorbidity and frailty being generally predictive of worse outcome. Priorities that inform treatment decisions change during the life course: older patients often place greater' value on quality-of-life-years gained than on life expectancy following cancer treatments. However, data on post-operative cognition, frailty, or functional independence is sparse and not routinely collected. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and trajectory of functional change of older women in the 12 months following gynaeoncological surgery and to explore the associations between them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective observational cohort study recruited consecutive women aged 65 or over scheduled for major gynaeoncologic surgery between July 2017 and April 2019. Baseline data on cancer stage, multimorbidity, and geriatric syndromes including cognition, frailty, and functional abilities were collected using standardised tools. Delirium and post-operative morbidity were recorded. Post hospital assessments were collected at 3-, 6-, and 12-months. RESULTS: Overall, of 103 eligible participants assessed pre-operatively, most (77, 70%) remained independent in personal care at all assessments from discharge to 12 months. Functional trajectories varied widely over the 12 months but overall there was no significant decline or improvement for the 85 survivors. Eleven experienced a clinically significant decline in function at six months. This was associated with baseline low mood (P < 0.05), albeit with small numbers (6 of 11). Cognitive impairment and frailty were associated with lower baseline function but not with subsequent functional decline. DISCUSSION: There was no clear clinical profile to identify the minority of older adults who experienced a clinically significant decline six months after surgery and for most, the decline was transient. This may be helpful in enabling informed patient consent. Assessment for geriatric syndromes and frailty may improve individual care but our findings do not indicate criteria for segmenting the patient population for selective attention. Future work should focus on causal pathways to potentially avoidable decline in those patients where this is not determined by the cancer itself.
