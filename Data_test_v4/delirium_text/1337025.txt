1337025|t|[A case of citrullinemia associated with isolated ACTH deficiency, rapidly developing coma].
1337025|a|We report a 41-year-old male of citrullinemia associated with argininosuccinate acid synthetase deficiency. He was admitted to the Hitachi General Hospital because of finger tremor, restlessness and urinary incontinence. He had short stature and a poor appetite. Laboratory evaluation was summarized as follows: mild hypoglycemia, low plasma cortisol levels, delayed response of 17-OHCS and 17-KS to ACTH administration in urine, and delayed response of plasma ACTH level to insulin administration. In this case, ACTH deficiency is estimated to be a dysfunction of the hypothalamus. Replacement therapy of hydrocortisone improved his symptoms. He was readmitted to the hospital because of delirium and confusion, two weeks after the hydrocortisone administration. At that time, he had flapping tremor. Laboratory examination revealed hyperammonemia (NH3: 231 micrograms/dl) and mild elevation of GOT and GPT. Serum and urinary amino acid determination showed marked elevation of citrulline (478.1 nmol/ml in serum, 4681.2 mumol/day in urine). Lactulose administration, low protein diet and plasmapheresis were started, but he went into a coma. Without any improvement, he died on the 29th hospital day. Autopsy examination of the liver disclosed fatty change. Adrenal cortex depicted severe atrophy. Biochemical analysis of urea cycle enzymes of the liver and kidney showed decreased activity of argininosuccinate synthetase (liver: 0.0022 U/mg protein, 5% of that normal liver, kidney: 0.003 IU/mg protein, 20% of that in normal kidney). Citrullinemia associated with ACTH deficiency have not reported in the literature. It may be presumed that ACTH deficiency is concerned with the delayed onset of hyperammonemia. The relation between citrullinemia and endocrinological abnormalities is also discussed.
