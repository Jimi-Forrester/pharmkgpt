35634224|t|Comprehensive evaluation of chemical composition and health-promoting effects with chemometrics analysis of plant derived edible oils.
35634224|a|In the last decade, with a growing emphasis on healthy diets, functional edible oils with high nutritional quality are becoming increasingly popular around the world. This study systematically compared the chemical composition and protective effect of 22 vegetable oils using multivariate chemometric tools. The results showed that the fatty acid composition and minor compounds were extremely variable among tested oils. Hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis discriminated these oils according to the tocopherol and phytosterol contents. The Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that in vitro radical scavenging capacity was significantly correlated to polyphenol, tocopherol, and squalene. Additionally, the ameliorate effects on the heat and oxidative stress, ROS contents, and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in Caenorhabditis elegans. The results showed that the antioxidant activity and stress resistance were positively correlated to polyphenol, tocopherol, phytosterol, MUFA, and PUFA, respectively. This study may offer an insight into oil discrimination and functional oil exploitation.
