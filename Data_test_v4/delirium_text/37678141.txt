37678141|a|A series of novel benzofuran-based compounds 7a-s were designed, synthesized, and investigated in vitro as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Compounds 7c and 7e displayed promising inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.058 and 0.086 muM in comparison to donepezil with an IC50 value of 0.049 muM. The new molecules' antioxidant evaluation revealed that 7c, 7e, 7j, 7n, and 7q produced the strongest DPPH scavenging activity when compared to vitamin C. As it was the most promising AChEI, compound 7c was selected for further biological evaluation. Acute and chronic toxicity studies exhibited that 7c showed no signs of toxicity or adverse events, no significant differences in the blood profile, and an insignificant difference in hepatic enzymes, glucose, urea, creatinine, and albumin levels in the experimental rat group. Furthermore, 7c did not produce histopathological damage to normal liver, kidney, heart, and brain tissues, ameliorated tissue malonaldehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels and reduced the expression levels of the APP and Tau genes in AD rats. Molecular docking results of compounds 7c and 7e showed good binding modes in the active site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which are similar to the native ligand donepezil. 3D-QSAR analysis revealed the importance of the alkyl group in positions 2 and 3 of the phenyl moiety for the activity. Overall, these findings suggested that compound 7c could be deemed a promising candidate for the management of Alzheimer's disease.
