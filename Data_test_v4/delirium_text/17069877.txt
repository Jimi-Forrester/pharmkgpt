17069877|t|Estrogen-BDNF interactions: implications for neurodegenerative diseases.
17069877|a|Since its' discovery over 20 years ago, BDNF has been shown to play a key role in neuronal survival, in promoting neuronal regeneration following injury, regulating transmitter systems and attenuating neural-immune responses. Estrogen's actions in the young and mature brain, and its role in neurodegenerative diseases in many cases overlaps with those observed for BDNF. Reduced estrogen and BDNF are observed in patients with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, while high estrogen levels are a risk factor for development of multiple sclerosis. Estrogen receptors, which transduce the actions of estrogen, colocalize to cells that express BDNF and its receptor trkB, and estrogen further regulates the expression of this neurotrophin system. This review describes the distribution of BDNF and trkB expressing cells in the forebrain, and the roles of estrogen and the BDNF-trkB neurotrophin system in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.
