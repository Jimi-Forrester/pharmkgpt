36814702|t|Diagnostic Tools for Alzheimer's Disease: A Narrative Review Based on Our Own Research Experience.
36814702|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most representative neurodegenerative diseases, has diverse neurobiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. Treatment strategies targeting a single mechanism have repeated faced failures because the mechanism of neuronal cell death is very complex that is not fully understood yet. Since complex mechanisms exist to explain AD, a variety of diagnostic biomarkers for diagnosing AD are required. Moreover, standardized evaluations for comprehensive diagnosis using neuropsychological, imaging, and laboratory tools are needed. In this review, we summarize the latest clinical, neuropsychological, imaging, and laboratory evaluations to diagnose patients with AD based on our own experience in conducting a prospective study.
