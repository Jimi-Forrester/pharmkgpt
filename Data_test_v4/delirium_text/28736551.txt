28736551|t|Differential Phenotypes of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor and T Regulatory Cells and Cytokine Levels in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Subjects Compared to Mild Alzheimer Diseased Patients.
28736551|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia although the underlying cause(s) remains unknown at this time. However, neuroinflammation is believed to play an important role and suspected contributing immune parameters can be revealed in studies comparing patients at the stage of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to healthy age-matched individuals. A network of immune regulatory cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) maintains immune homeostasis but there are very few data on the role of these cells in AD. Here, we investigated the presence of these cells in the blood of subjects with aMCI and mild AD (mAD) in comparison with healthy age-matched controls. We also quantitated several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in sera which can influence the development and activation of these cells. We found significantly higher levels of MDSCs and Tregs in aMCI but not in mAD patients, as well as higher serum IL-1beta levels. Stratifying the subjects based on CMV serostatus that is known to influence multiple immune parameters showed an absence of differences between aMCI subjects compared to mAD patients and healthy controls. We suggest that the increase in MDSCs and Tregs number in aMCI subjects may have a beneficial role in modulating inflammatory processes. However, this protective mechanism may have failed in mAD patients, allowing progression of the disease. This working hypothesis obviously requires testing in future studies.
