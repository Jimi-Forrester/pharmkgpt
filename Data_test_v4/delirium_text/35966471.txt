35966471|a|There are many complex concepts to consider during end-of-life discussions and advance care planning, especially when vulnerable populations such as older individuals with serious mental illness are involved. This article aims to summarize some of these important concepts, such as the effects of ageism, preservation of human rights and dignity, supported or shared decision making and palliative approaches. It emerged from a study that found two thirds of 100 participants 60 years of age and older with serious mental illness had end-of-life decision-making capacity. This finding highlighted the individual and contextual nature of decision-making capacity, the importance of consideration of individual values and protection of human dignity during end-of-life care. Healthcare providers have a duty to initiate end-of-life and advance care discussions, to optimize decision-making capacity, and to protect autonomous decision-making. Chronological age or diagnostic categories should never be used as reasons for discrimination and all patients should receive end-of-life care in keeping with their preferences and values.
