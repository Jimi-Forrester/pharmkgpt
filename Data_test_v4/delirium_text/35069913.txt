35069913|a|Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), a secretory protein of neuronal pentraxins, was first identified in the nervous system. Several studies have shown that expression levels of NPTX2 are associated with the development of various cancers. However, whether NPTX2 is involved in prostate cancer progression is unclear. Herein, we found that NPTX2 is significantly reduced in prostate cancer tissues and cancer cell lines compared to control prostate tissues and control prostatic epithelial cell lines. Furthermore, the NPTX2 promoter is highly methylated in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, NPTX2 could be restored by treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine, 5-AZA-dC). Overexpression of NPTX2 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that NPTX2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer.
