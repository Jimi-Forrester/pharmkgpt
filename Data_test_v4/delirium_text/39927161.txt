39927161|a|Purpose: Emergence agitation (EA) after (adeno)tonsillectomy (AT) surgery impairs recovery in children. Adequate analgesia plays a crucial role in reducing EA incidence. This study investigated whether hydromorphone infusion (30 mug/kg) during anesthesia induction could reduce EA following AT surgery for obstructive sleep apnea in children. Patients and methods: A total of 186 ASA I-III children aged 3-7 years undergoing AT surgery were enrolled in a blinded randomized trial comparing hydromorphone (30 mug/kg) to fentanyl (4 mug/kg). The primary outcome was EA incidence within 30 min post-extubation. Secondary outcomes included pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED), face, legs, activity, crying, consolability (FLACC), Ramsay sedation scores, extubation time, rescue analgesia incidence, and adverse events. Results: The incidence of EA was significantly lower in the hydromorphone group [48.4% (45/93) vs 64.5% (60/93); absolute difference: 16.1%; 95% CI: 18.9-29.5%; P = 0.027]. Hydromorphone improved PAED, FLACC, and Ramsay scores and reduced moderate-to-severe pain and rescue analgesia. No postoperative complications occurred in either group. Conclusion: Hydromorphone at 30 mug/kg effectively reduces the incidence of EA within 30 min post-extubation in children after AT surgery compared to fentanyl. It shows superior analgesia and has a low incidence of adverse effects.
