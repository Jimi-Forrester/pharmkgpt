33400086|t|COVID-19: inflammatory responses, structure-based drug design and potential therapeutics.
33400086|a|The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global health emergency. Here, we explore the diverse mechanisms of SARS-CoV-induced inflammation. We presume that SARS-CoV-2 likely contributes analogous inflammatory responses. Possible therapeutic mechanisms for reducing SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses comprise FcR inactivation. Currently, there is no specific remedy available against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, recognizing efficacious antiviral leads to combat the virus is crucially desired. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (Mpro also called 3CLpro), which plays an indispensable role in viral replication and transcription, is an interesting target for drug design. This review compiles the latest advances in biological and structural research, along with development of inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros. It is anticipated that inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros could be advanced into wide-spectrum antiviral drugs in case of COVID-19 and other CoV-related diseases. The crystal structural and docking results have shown that Ebselen, N3, TDZD-8 and alpha-ketoamide (13b) inhibitors can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. alpha-ketoamide-based inhibitor 13b inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu3 lung cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the treatment with Ebselen, TDZD-8 and N3 reduced the amounts of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, 20.3-, 10.19- and 8.4-fold compared to the treatment in the absence of inhibitor. Moreover, repurposing of already present drugs to treat COVID-19 serves as one of the competent and economic therapeutic strategies. Several anti-malarial, anti-HIV and anti-inflammatory drugs as mentioned in Table 2 were found effective for the COVID-19 treatment. Further, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was found more potent than chloroquine (CQ) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Furthermore, convalescent plasma from patients who have recuperated from viral infections can be employed as a therapy without the appearance of severe adverse events. Hence, it might be valuable to examine the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
