34660010|t|Negative Impact of COVID-19 Upon Primary Brain Tumor Care.
34660010|a|Meningiomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors, as they can account for up to one-third of all primary brain tumors. Most meningiomas are benign, although up to one-fourth of such tumors are classified as atypical or malignant. Atypical and malignant meningiomas are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence and decreased overall survival. Our patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of recurrent malignant meningioma, with metastasis to the liver. He underwent multiple surgical interventions, radiation treatments, and systemic therapies for a malignant meningioma, ultimately requiring transfer to hospice care. Not only did a positive novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection delay his ability to receive radiation therapy, the infection in itself may have had an impact on the course of care for this patient. Treatment targeting the patient's COVID-19 infection may have suppressed the immune system, and as a result, caused the progression of metastatic disease. Palliative care was needed in the setting of losing all functional goals for quality of life due to malignant neoplasm.
