28615779|t|Multimodal Hallucinations in a Visually Impaired Elderly Female: Is it a Variant of Charles Bonnet Syndrome?
28615779|a|Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a common cause of visual hallucinations seen in elderly people with visual impairment. Well-formed visual hallucinations in clear consciousness with preserved insight are commonly reported in literature. We report a case of CBS having multisensory hallucinations. An elderly patient with visual impairment fulfilling the criteria of CBS presents with various modalities of hallucinations viz. visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations improved completely with low dose of antipsychotics. Atypical features are common in CBS and thus often make it difficult to diagnose this condition.
