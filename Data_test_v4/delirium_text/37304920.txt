37304920|t|In-Hospital and One-Year Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients Requiring Supplemental Home Oxygen Use.
37304920|a|Background: There have been limited reports with inconsistent results on the impact of long-term use of oxygen therapry (LTOT) in patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods: We compared in-hospital and intermediate TAVR outcomes in 150 patients requiring LTOT (home O2 cohort) with 2,313 non-home O2 patients. Results: Home O2 patients were younger, and had more comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, carotid artery disease, lower forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (50.3+-21.1% vs. 75.0+-24.7%, P < 0.001), and lower diffusion capacity (DLCO, 48.6+-19.2% vs. 74.6+-22.4%, P < 0.001). These differences represented higher baseline Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score (15.5+-10.2% vs. 9.3+-7.0%, P < 0.001) and lower pre-procedure Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) scores (32.5 +- 22.2 vs. 49.1 +- 25.4, P < 0.001). The home O2 cohort required higher use of alternative TAVR vascular access (24.0% vs. 12.8%, P = 0.002) and general anesthesia (51.3% vs. 36.0%, P < 0.001). Compared to non-home O2 patients, home O2 patients showed increased in-hospital mortality (5.3% vs. 1.6%, P = 0.001), procedural cardiac arrest (4.7% vs. 1.0%, P < 0.001), and postoperative atrial fibrillation (4.0% vs. 1.5%, P = 0.013). At 1-year follow-up, the home O2 cohort had a higher all-cause mortality (17.3% vs. 7.5%, P < 0.001) and lower KCCQ-12 scores (69.5 +- 23.8 vs. 82.1 +- 19.4, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meir analysis revealed a lower survival rate in the home O2 cohort with an overall mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) survival time of 6.2 (5.9 - 6.5) years (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Home O2 patients represent a high-risk TAVR cohort with increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality, less improvement in 1-year KCCQ-12, and increased mortality at intermediate follow-up.
