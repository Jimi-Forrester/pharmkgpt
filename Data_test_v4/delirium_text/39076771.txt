39076771|t|A realist evaluation protocol: assessing the effectiveness of a rapid response team model for mental state deterioration in acute hospitals.
39076771|a|Background: Mental state deterioration poses significant challenges in healthcare, impacting patients and providers. Symptoms like confusion and agitation can lead to prolonged hospital stays, increased costs, and the use of restrictive interventions. Despite its prevalence, there's a lack of consensus on effective practices for managing mental state deterioration in acute hospital settings. To address this gap, a rapid response team model has been proposed as a potential intervention, aiming to provide early identification and targeted interventions. Methods: Based on realist evaluation steps, first, initial program theories are formulated to understand the logic behind the intervention. Second, literature synthesis identifies empirical evidence on contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes elements, refining initial theories. During the third step, data will be collected using qualitative methods such as field observations and interviews, as well as quantitative methods such as surveys of the staff, audits of electronic medical records, and analysis of incident records of mental state deterioration. Analysing this data informs configurations of contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes. In the fifth step, the configurations are synthesised, presenting refined, evidence-informed program theories. Conclusion: This study addresses the knowledge gap by evaluating the rapid response model's effectiveness in managing mental state deterioration in acute hospital settings. Realist principles guide the exploration of causal mechanisms and their interaction with specific implementation contexts. The objective is to identify what works, for whom, and under what circumstances, aiming to manage deterioration, reduce restrictive interventions, and enhance the experience for patients and staff by implementing a proactive model of care. The findings contribute to evidence-based approaches for managing mental state deterioration in hospital settings, informing policy and practice in this crucial area of healthcare.
