35434971|t|Family-centred care interventions to reduce the delirium prevalence in critically ill patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
35434971|a|AIM: This study aimed to determine whether family-centred care (FCC) intervention reduces the ICU delirium prevalence. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc), WANFANG Data and VIP Information, were systematically searched up to 30 November 2021. The search term includes keywords related to intensive care units, delirium and family-centred care. Meta-analyses were performed and presented by risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The meta-analysis results showed that compared with the usual care, FCC intervention has positive effects on reducing ICU delirium prevalence [RR = 0.54, 95% CIs (0.36, 0.81), p < .05]. However, no effect was observed on ICU stays, mechanical ventilation duration and ICU-acquired infection between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Family-centred care is an effective intervention to reduce the ICU delirium prevalence. But the result should be treated cautiously as the high levels of heterogeneity, further high-quality studies are required to determine the effectiveness of FCC intervention in the ICU setting.
