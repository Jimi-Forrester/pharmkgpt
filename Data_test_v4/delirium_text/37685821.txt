37685821|t|One Patient, Three Providers: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Managing Common Neuropsychiatric Cases.
37685821|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric cases require a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. This paper presented case-based discussions on migraine, dementia, epilepsy, mood disorders, neuralgia, and psychosis from the perspectives of a family physician, neurologist, and psychiatrist. The goal was to highlight the importance of collaboration between healthcare providers in managing these complex cases. METHODS: The paper was based on the proceedings of the Mediterranean Neuropsychiatry Symposium, where experts from family medicine, neurology, and psychiatry came together for comprehensive case-based discussions. The CARE framework (Case Report, Appraisal, Research, and Education) was developed to guide reporting and evaluation of case reports in clinical practice. RESULTS: Six cases were presented and discussed, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing neuropsychiatric cases. The cases included chronic migraine with medication overuse, memory dysfunction with language and behavioral problems, refractory epileptic seizures with subjective sensory symptoms, bipolar affective disorder with normal pressure hydrocephalus, postherpetic neuralgia in a case with bipolar affective disorder, and psychosis with recurrent attacks with the abuse of several substances. CONCLUSION: A biopsychosocial multidisciplinary approach is essential for managing neuropsychiatric cases effectively on behalf of the patients and public health of the country. The CARE framework can guide the reporting and evaluation of case reports in clinical practice, ensuring that patients receive comprehensive and effective care. Healthcare providers should collaborate to provide the best possible care for patients with complex and multifaceted needs.
