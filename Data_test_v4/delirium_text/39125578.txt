39125578|t|Fractalkine in Health and Disease.
39125578|a|CX3CL1 is one of the 50 up-to-date identified and characterized chemokines. While other chemokines are produced as small, secreted proteins, CX3CL1 (fractalkine) is synthetized as a transmembrane protein which also leads to a soluble form produced as a result of proteolytic cleavage. The membrane-bound protein and the soluble forms exhibit different biological functions. While the role of the fractalkine/CX3CR1 signaling axis was described in the nervous system and was also related to the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, its actions are controversial in cancer progression and anti-tumor immunity. In the present review, we first describe the known biology of fractalkine concerning its action through its cognate receptor, but also its role in the activation of different integrins. The second part of this review is dedicated to its role in cancer where we discuss its role in anti-cancer or procarcinogenic activities.
