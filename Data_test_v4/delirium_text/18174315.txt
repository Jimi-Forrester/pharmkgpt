18174315|t|A lifestyle physical activity intervention for caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease.
18174315|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of lifestyle physical activity in caregivers (CGs) of persons with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Fifteen CGs engaged in lifestyle physical activity during a 6-month, home-based health promotion program. Mean changes in self-reported physical activity were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Fifty percent of CGs increased total self-reported minutes and 42% increased total moderate minutes of physical activity from preintervention to postintervention; however, no CG engaged in vigorous physical activity and there were no significant improvements in self-reported physical activity for the total group. Hot summer weather, heavy non-caregiving responsibilities, heavy caregiving responsibilities, and feelings of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue were the most frequently identified physical activity barriers. CONCLUSION: Incorporating an individualized, home-based program of lifestyle physical activity appears feasible; however, attention needs to be given in the future to physical activity barriers identified by this select group of CGs.
