12893490|t|Beta-carbolines in chronic alcoholics following trauma.
12893490|a|In our society every second polytraumatized patient is a chronic alcoholic. A patient's alcohol-related history is often unavailable and laboratory markers are not sensitive or specific enough to detect alcohol-dependent patients who are at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) during their post-traumatic intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Previously, it has been found that plasma levels of norharman are elevated in chronic alcoholics. We investigated whether beta-carbolines, i.e. harman and norharman levels, could identify chronic alcoholics following trauma and whether possible changes during ICU stay could serve as a predictor of deterioration of clinical status. Sixty polytraumatized patients were transferred to the ICU following admission to the emergency room and subsequent surgery. Chronic alcoholics were included only if they met the DSM-III-R and ICD-10 criteria for alcohol dependence or chronic alcohol abuse/harmful use and their daily ethanol intake was > or =60 g. Harman and norharman levels were assayed on admission and on days 2, 4, 7 and 14 in the ICU. Harman and norharman levels were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Elevated norharman levels were found in chronic alcoholics (n = 35) on admission to the hospital and remained significantly elevated during their ICU stay. The area under the curves (AUC) showed that norharman was comparable to carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) and superior to conventional laboratory markers in detecting chronic alcoholics. Seventeen chronic alcoholics developed AWS; 16 of these patients experienced hallucinations or delirium. Norharman levels were significantly increased on days 2 and 4 in the ICU in patients who developed AWS compared with those who did not. An increase in norharman levels preceded hallucinations or delirium with a median period of approximately 3 days. The findings that elevated norharman levels are found in chronic alcoholics, that the AUC was in the range of CDT on admission and that norharman levels remained elevated during the ICU stay, support the view that norharman is a specific marker for alcoholism in traumatized patients. Since norharman levels increased prior to the onset of hallucinations and delirium it seems reasonable to investigate further the potential role of norharman as a possible substance which triggers AWS.
