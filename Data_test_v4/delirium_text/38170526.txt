38170526|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of scaling advanced care at home (ACAH) (otherwise known as hospital at home) within an integrated health care delivery system. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients qualified for hospital-level care who were admitted to either ACAH or a traditional hospital. METHODS: From April 29, 2020, to November 14, 2021, patients requiring hospital-level care received Kaiser Permanente at Home or traditional hospital care. In a subgroup of patients, we compared outcomes for Kaiser Permanente at Home vs traditional hospital care using regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1005 patients were admitted to Kaiser Permanente at Home. Average daily census (ADC) was intentionally increased over time in stages, from 7.2 to 8.8, then to 12.7. The maximum daily census was 22, with a peak ADC of 16, representing 9% of the total hospital inpatient medicine service census. During this time, there were numeric decreases in Kaiser Permanente at Home escalation rates (17.5% to 10.8%), median length of stay (7.43 days to 5.46 days), and readmission rates (9.79% to 9.24%). A subgroup of Kaiser Permanente at Home patients contributed to the comparative analyses, which showed that patients admitted to Kaiser Permanente at Home were 64% less likely to experience delirium than patients admitted for traditional hospital care (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.88; P = .026). Comparisons of quality metrics across stages of implementation (readmissions, escalations, length of stay) were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: In an integrated delivery system, ACAH care can be scaled and can create hospital capacity. However, our data were inconclusive regarding quality throughout scaling due to the small effective sample size, necessitating replication in a larger prospective study with adequate power/precision.
