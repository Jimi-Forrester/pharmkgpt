38931409|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant challenge in the field of neurodegenerative disorders, even nearly a century after its discovery, due to the elusive nature of its causes. The development of drugs that target multiple aspects of the disease has emerged as a promising strategy to address the complexities of AD and related conditions. The immune system's role, particularly in AD, has gained considerable interest, with nanobodies representing a new frontier in biomedical research. Advances in targeting antibodies against amyloid-beta (Abeta) and using messenger RNA for genetic translation have revolutionized the production of antibodies and drug development, opening new possibilities for treatment. Despite these advancements, conventional therapies for AD, such as Cognex, Exelon, Razadyne, and Aricept, often have limited long-term effectiveness, underscoring the need for innovative solutions. This necessity has led to the incorporation advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning into the drug discovery process for neurodegenerative diseases. These technologies help identify therapeutic targets and optimize lead compounds, offering a more effective approach to addressing the challenges of AD and similar conditions.
