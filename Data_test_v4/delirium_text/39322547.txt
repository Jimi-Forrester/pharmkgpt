39322547|a|We evaluated the utility of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) as a predictor of adverse events post-hospitalization in a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This historical cohort study analyzed the data of patients hospitalized with aneurysmal SAH (n = 1,343) between April 2014 and August 2020 who were registered in the JMDC database. We used HFRS to classify the patients into the low-frailty risk group (HFRS < 5) and high-frailty risk group (HFRS >= 5). The primary outcome was a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 points at discharge. Of 1,343 patients, 1,001 (74.5%) and 342 (25.5%) were in the low- and high-frailty risk groups, respectively. A high-frailty risk was negatively associated with a mRS score of 0-2 at discharge (high-frailty risk group: odds ratio 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-0.6) and home discharge (high-frailty risk group: odds ratio 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4-0.7). A high-frailty risk was negatively associated with Barthel Index gain (high-frailty risk group: coefficient -10.4, 95% CI: -14.7 to -6.2) and had a longer length of stay (high-frailty risk group: coefficient 8.4, 95% CI: 5.1-11.7). HFRS could predict adverse outcomes during hospitalization of aneurysmal SAH patients.
