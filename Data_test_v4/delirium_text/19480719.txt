19480719|t|Bioluminescence imaging reveals inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by Alzheimer's amyloid beta protein.
19480719|a|BACKGROUND: Cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two seemingly distinct diseases and rarely occur simultaneously in patients. To explore molecular determinants differentiating pathogenic routes towards AD or cancer, we investigate the role of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) on multiple tumor cell lines that are stably expressing luciferase (human glioblastoma U87; human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB231; and mouse melanoma B16F). RESULTS: Quantification of the photons emitted from the MDA-MB231 or B16F cells revealed a significant inhibition of cell proliferation by the conditioning media (CM) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) over-expressing cells. The inhibition of U87 cells was observed only after the media was conditioned for longer than 2 days with APP over-expressing cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Abeta plays an inhibitory role in tumor cell proliferation; this effect could depend on the type of tumor cells and amount of Abeta.
