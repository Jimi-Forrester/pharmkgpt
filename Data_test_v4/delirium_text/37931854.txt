37931854|t|A GCC repeat in RAB26 undergoes natural selection in human and harbors divergent genotypes in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
37931854|a|Although mainly located in genic regions and being mutation hotspots, intact blocks of CG-rich trinucleotide short tandem repeats (STRs) are largely overlooked with respect to their link with natural selection. The human RAB26 (member RAS oncogene family) directs synaptic and secretory vesicles into preautophagosomal structures, inhibition of which specifically disrupts axonal transport of degradative organelles and leads to an axonal dystrophy, resembling Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human RAB26 contains a GCC repeat in the top 1st percent in respect of length. Here we sequenced this STR in 441 Iranian individuals, consisting of late-onset neurocognitive disorder (NCD) (N=216) and controls (N=225). In both groups, the 12-repeat allele and the 12/12 genotype were predominantly abundant. We found excess of homozygosity for non-12 alleles in the NCD group (Mid-P exact=0.027). Furthermore, divergent genotypes were detected that were specific to the NCD group (2.8% of genotypes) (Mid-P exact=0.006) or controls (3.1% of genotypes) (Mid-P exact=0.004). The patients harboring divergent genotypes received the diagnosis of AD. Based on the predominant abundance of the 12-repeat and 12/12 genotype in both groups, excess of non-12 homozygosity in the NCD group, and divergent genotypes across the NCD and control groups, we propose natural selection at this locus and link with late-onset AD. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that a collection of rare genotypes unambiguously contribute to the pathogenesis of late-onset NCDs, such as AD.
