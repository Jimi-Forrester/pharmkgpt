25058565|t|Haptoglobin interacts with apolipoprotein E and beta-amyloid and influences their crosstalk.
25058565|a|Beta-amyloid accumulation in brain is a driving force for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) represents a critical player in beta-amyloid homeostasis, but its role in disease progression is controversial. We previously reported that the acute-phase protein haptoglobin binds ApoE and impairs its function in cholesterol homeostasis. The major aims of this study were to characterize the binding of haptoglobin to beta-amyloid, and to evaluate whether haptoglobin affects ApoE binding to beta-amyloid. Haptoglobin is here reported to form a complex with beta-amyloid as shown by immunoblotting experiments with purified proteins, or by its immunoprecipitation in brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease. The interaction between ApoE and beta-amyloid was previously shown to be crucial for limiting beta-amyloid neurotoxicity and for promoting its clearance. We demonstrate that haptoglobin, rather than impairing ApoE binding to beta-amyloid, promotes to a different extent the formation of the complex between beta-amyloid and ApoE2 or ApoE3 or ApoE4. Our data suggest that haptoglobin and ApoE functions in brain should be evaluated taking into account their mutual interaction with beta-amyloid. Hence, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease might not only be linked to the different ApoE isoforms, but also rely on the level of critical ligands, such as haptoglobin.
