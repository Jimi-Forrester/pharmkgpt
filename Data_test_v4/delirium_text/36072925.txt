36072925|a|Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a protein, and is the most abundant and diverse biopolymer in nature. Glycans are involved in multiple biological processes of cancer initiation and progression, including cell-cell interactions, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, tumor invasion and metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and immune regulation. As an important biomarker, tumor-associated glycosylation changes have been extensively studied. This article reviews recent advances in glycosylation-based biomarker research, which is useful for cancer diagnosis and prognostic assessment. Truncated O-glycans, sialylation, fucosylation, and complex branched structures have been found to be the most common structural patterns in malignant tumors. In recent years, immunochemical methods, lectin recognition-based methods, mass spectrometry (MS)-related methods, and fluorescence imaging-based in situ methods have greatly promoted the discovery and application potentials of glycomic and glycoprotein biomarkers in various cancers. In particular, MS-based proteomics has significantly facilitated the comprehensive research of extracellular glycoproteins, increasing our understanding of their critical roles in regulating cellular activities. Predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM; 3P medicine) is an effective approach of early prediction, prevention and personalized treatment for different patients, and it is known as the new direction of medical development in the 21st century and represents the ultimate goal and highest stage of medical development. Glycosylation has been revealed to have new diagnostic, prognostic, and even therapeutic potentials. The purpose of glycosylation analysis and utilization of biology is to make a fundamental change in health care and medical practice, so as to lead medical research and practice into a new era of 3P medicine.
