26898943|a|Conformational changes of Abeta peptide result in its transformation from native monomeric state to the toxic soluble dimers, oligomers and insoluble aggregates that are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interactions of zinc ions with Abeta are mediated by the N-terminal Abeta(1-16) domain and appear to play a key role in AD progression. There is a range of results indicating that these interactions trigger the Abeta plaque formation. We have determined structure and functional characteristics of the metal binding domains derived from several Abeta variants and found that their zinc-induced oligomerization is governed by conformational changes in the minimal zinc binding site 6HDSGYEVHH14. The residue H6 and segment 11EVHH14, which are part of this site are crucial for formation of the two zinc-mediated interaction interfaces in Abeta. These structural determinants can be considered as promising targets for rational design of the AD-modifying drugs aimed at blocking pathological Abeta aggregation.
