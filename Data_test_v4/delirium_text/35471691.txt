35471691|t|APOE epsilon4 and late-life cognition: mediation by structural brain imaging markers.
35471691|a|The apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE-epsilon4) is established as a major genetic risk factor for cognitive decline and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence has linked epsilon4 carriership to abnormal structural brain changes across the adult lifespan. To better understand the underlying causal mechanisms, we investigated the extent to which the effect of the epsilon4 allele on cognition is mediated by structural brain imaging markers in the population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik). This study included 4527 participants (aged 76.3 +- 5.4 at baseline) who underwent the brain magnetic resonance imaging assessment (of brain tissue volumes, white matter lesion volume, subcortical and cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds) and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline. Causal mediation analysis was used to quantify the mediation of the epsilon4 effect on cognition by these MRI markers, both individually and jointly. We observed that about 9% of the total effect of epsilon4 carriership on cognition was mediated by white matter lesion volume. This proportion increased to 25% when total brain tissue volume was jointly considered with white matter lesion volume. In analyses separating epsilon4 homozygotes from epsilon4 heterozygotes, the effect on global cognition of specifically epsilon4 homozygosity appeared to be partially mediated by cerebral microbleeds, particularly lobar microbleeds. There was no evidence of mediation of the epsilon4 effect by cortical or subcortical infarcts. This study shows that the epsilon4 effect on cognition is partly mediated by white matter lesion volume and total brain tissue volume. These findings suggest the joint role of cerebral small vessel disease and neurodegeneration in the epsilon4-cognition relationship.
