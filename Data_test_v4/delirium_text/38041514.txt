To improve early diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder (NCD) in Switzerland, the tablet-based UCSF brain health assessment (BHA) and brain health survey (BHS) were validated. METHODS: The German BHA, BHS, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to 67 patients with mild/major NCD and 50 controls. BHA includes subtests of memory, executive, visuospatial, and language functioning, and informant-based BHS asks about behavior and motor functioning. RESULTS: The complete instrument (BHA + BHS) was most accurate at detecting mild NCD (AUC = 0.95) and NCD without amyloid pathology (AUC = 0.96), followed by the BHA. All measures were accurate (all AUCs > 0.95) at distinguishing major NCD and NCD with amyloid pathology (Alzheimer's disease [AD]) from controls. DISCUSSION: The German BHA and BHS are more sensitive to mild NCD and non-AD presentations than the MoCA and thus have a high potential to identify patients with NCD in primary care earlier than currently used screens.
