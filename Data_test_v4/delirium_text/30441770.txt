30441770|t|Transport of Apolipoprotein B-Containing Lipoproteins through Endothelial Cells Is Associated with Apolipoprotein E-Carrying HDL-Like Particle Formation.
30441770|a|Passage of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (apoB-LPs), i.e., triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), through the endothelial monolayer occurs in normal and atherosclerotic arteries. Among these lipoproteins, TRLs and IDLs are apoE-rich apoB-LPs (E/B-LPs). Recycling of TRL-associated apoE has been shown to form apoE-carrying high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like (HDLE) particles in many types of cells. The current report studied the formation of HDLE particles by transcytosis of apoB-LPs through mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs). Our data indicated that passage of radiolabeled apoB-LPs, rich or poor in apoE, through the MAEC monolayer is inhibited by filipin and unlabeled competitor lipoproteins, suggesting that MAECs transport apoB-LPs via a caveolae-mediated pathway. The cholesterol and apoE in the cell-untreated E/B-LPs, TRLs, IDLs, and LDLs distributed primarily in the low-density (LD) fractions (d <= 1.063). A substantial portion of the cholesterol and apoE that passed through the MAEC monolayer was allotted into the high-density (HD) (d > 1.063) fractions. In contrast, apoB was detectable only in the LD fractions before or after apoB-LPs were incubated with the MAEC monolayer, suggesting that apoB-LPs pass through the MAEC monolayer in the forms of apoB-containing LD particles and apoE-containing HD particles.
