2508410|t|[Epileptic psychosis--ictal psychosis?].
2508410|a|A 54-year-old female patient presented acute hallucinatory psychotic episodes with irritative EEG for seven years before an initial state of complex partial mal. A single convulsive episode occurred 14 years after the beginning of the psychiatric symptoms. The intercritical EEG showed independent temporal lobe foci predominating on the right. It varied little during delirious phases but these occurred three times during weaning from antiepileptic drugs. The delirium improved when the treatment was restored, whereas neuroleptics proved ineffective. Psychiatric signs frequently described in epilepsy and particularly temporal epilepsy are reviewed. Usually, these symptoms are not concomitant. The literature mentions only a very few cases where psychosis appears to be ictal as in the reported case.
