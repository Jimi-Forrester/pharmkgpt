38615089|t|Grey matter networks in women and men with dementia with Lewy bodies.
38615089|a|Sex differences permeate many aspects of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), yet sex differences in patterns of neurodegeneration in DLB remain largely unexplored. Here, we test whether grey matter networks differ between sexes in DLB and compare these findings to sex differences in healthy controls. In this cross-sectional study, we analysed clinical and neuroimaging data of patients with DLB and cognitively healthy controls matched for age and sex. Grey matter networks were constructed by pairwise correlations between 58 regional volumes after correction for age, intracranial volume, and centre. Network properties were compared between sexes and diagnostic groups. Additional analyses were conducted on w-scored data to identify DLB-specific sex differences. Data from 119 (68.7 +- 8.4 years) men and 45 women (69.9 +- 9.1 years) with DLB, and 164 healthy controls were included in this study. Networks of men had a lower nodal strength compared to women. In comparison to healthy women, the grey matter networks of healthy men showed a higher global efficiency, modularity, and fewer modules. None of the network measures showed significant sex differences in DLB. Comparing DLB patients with healthy controls revealed global differences in women and more local differences in men. Modular analyses showed a more distinct demarcation between cortical and subcortical regions in men compared with women. While topologies of grey matter networks differed between sexes in healthy controls, those sex differences were diluted in DLB patients. These findings suggest a disease-driven convergence of neurodegenerative patterns in women and men with DLB, which may inform precision medicine in DLB.
