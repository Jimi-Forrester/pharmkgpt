36901797|a|In June 2021, the world was informed about a new drug for Alzheimer's disease approved by the FDA. Aducanumab (BIIB037, ADU), being a monoclonal antibody IgG1, is the newest AD treatment. The activity of the drug is targeted towards amyloid beta, which is considered one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials have revealed time- and dose-dependent activity towards Abeta reduction, as well as cognition improvement. Biogen, the company responsible for conducting research and introducing the drug to the market, presents the drug as a solution to cognitive impairment, but its limitations, costs, and side effects are controversial. The framework of the paper focuses on the mechanism of aducanumab's action along with the positive and negative sides of the therapy. The review presents the basis of the amyloid hypothesis that is the cornerstone of therapy, as well as the latest information about aducanumab, its mechanism of action, and the possibility of the use of the drug.
