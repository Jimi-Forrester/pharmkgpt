36235113|t|Synthesis and Characterization of Newly Designed and Highly Solvatochromic Double Squaraine Dye for Sensitive and Selective Recognition towards Cu2.
36235113|a|Synthesis and characterization of a novel and zwitterionic double squaraine dye (DSQ) with a unique D-A-A-D structure is being reported. Contrary to the conventional mono and bis-squaraine dyes with D-A-D and D-A-D-A molecular frameworks reported so far, DSQ dye demonstrated strong solvatochromism allowing for the multiple ion sensing using a single probe by judicious selection of the suitable solvent system. The DSQ dye exhibited a large solvatochromic shift of about 200 nm with color changes from the visible to NIR region with metal ion sensitivity. Utilization of a binary solvent consisted of dimethylformamide and acetonitrile (1:99, v/v), highly selective detection of Cu2+ ions with the linearity range from 50 muM to 1 nM and a detection limit of 6.5 x 10-10 M has been successfully demonstrated. Results of the Benesi-Hildebrand and Jobs plot analysis revealed that DSQ and Cu2+ ions interact in the 2:1 molecular stoichiometry with appreciably good association constant of 2.32 x 104 M-1. Considering the allowed limit of Cu2+ ions intake by human body as recommended by WHO to be 30 muM, the proposed dye can be conveniently used for the simple and naked eye colorimetric monitoring of the drinking water quality.
