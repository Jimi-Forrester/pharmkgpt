37638263|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant therapeutic challenges in addressing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This serious illness has caused numerous fatalities worldwide and has had profound health and economic impacts. Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can suppress ARDS. In this case series, we report on the treatment of nine patients with a single intravenous dose of 100 million hypoxic cultured umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs). Following the intravenous administration of UC-MSCs, obtained from the lining of the umbilical cord, longitudinal laboratory analysis revealed a sustained decrease in inflammatory markers and stabilized pulmonary function in eight out of nine patients. UC-MSCs possess immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, enabling them to attenuate the cytokine storm and potentially aid in lung repair. Importantly, no adverse events associated with the treatment were observed. These findings collectively suggest that a cell-based approach significantly enhances the survival rate of ARDS induced by SARS-CoV-2 and offers a promising treatment option in both preclinical and clinical settings.
