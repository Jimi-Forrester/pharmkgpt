33749028|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the efficacy and safety of intranasal midazolam for sedation during essential dental treatment of geriatric patients with major neurocognitive disorder (MND) and care-resistant behaviour (CRB). BACKGROUND: Dental treatment is often impossible in geriatric MND patients with CRB. Intranasal midazolam may provide a non-invasive sedation method, but there is currently no information on its use in geriatric patients. METHODS: In this observational study, we included geriatric patients with severe MND and CRB needing urgent dental treatment. Each patient received 5 mg midazolam intranasally. Agitation/sedation levels, heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation were recorded at 5-minute intervals. RESULTS: Thirty two patients were included. Mean age was 84 (+-7) years. Mean (SD) time to treatment start was 13 (+-5) minutes, and mean time to maximum sedation 17 (+-11) minutes. Sedation was sufficient to enable dental treatment to be completed in 31 (97%) patients. Anxiolysis/light sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients, and moderate to deep sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients. No patients suffered from apnoea, although 3 patients required a chin-lift manoeuvre. Hypoxaemia occurred in 1 of these patients and in 2 other patients without airway obstruction. All patients recovered uneventfully. In a regression model, age, weight and other sedative medication use were found not to be associated with maximum sedation depth. CONCLUSIONS: Of 5 mg intranasal midazolam facilitates treatment of geriatric patients with MND in the comfort of their own environment. More information is needed to guide titration to balance the desired sedation level and patient safety.
