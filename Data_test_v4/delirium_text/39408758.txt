39408758|t|The Activation of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors Protects against Neuroinflammation in a Mouse Model through Attenuating Microglial Inflammation.
39408758|a|Neuroinflammation is a critical factor that contributes to neurological impairment and is closely associated with the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammation through various signaling pathways. Therefore, mitigating microglial inflammation is considered a promising strategy for restraining neuroinflammation. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are widely expressed in the CNS and exhibit clear neuroprotective effects in various disease models. However, whether the activation of mAChRs can harness benefits in neuroinflammation remains largely unexplored. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of mAChRs were found in a neuroinflammation mouse model. The expression of various cytokines and chemokines was regulated in the brains and spinal cords after the administration of mAChR agonists. Microglia were the primary target cells through which mAChRs exerted their anti-inflammatory effects. The results showed that the activation of mAChRs decreased the pro-inflammatory phenotypes of microglia, including the expression of inflammatory cytokines, morphological characteristics, and distribution density. Such anti-inflammatory modulation further exerted neuroprotection, which was found to be even more significant by the direct activation of neuronal mAChRs. This study elucidates the dual mechanisms through which mAChRs exert neuroprotective effects in central inflammatory responses, providing evidence for their application in inflammation-related neurological disorders.
