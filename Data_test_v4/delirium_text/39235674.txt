39235674|t|Comparison of the ability of different quantitative indices in 123I-FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography to differentiate dopaminergic neurodegenerative disease.
39235674|a|PURPOSE: By imaging dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake in the striatum, 123I-FP-CIT SPECT can differentiate dopaminergic neurodegenerative disease (dNDD) and non-dNDD, which differ in pathophysiology and clinical management. Our aim was to compare and validate the diagnostic abilities of various 123I-FP-CIT SPECT quantitative indices for dNDD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Distribution volume ratio (DVR) and binding ratio (BR), measures of DAT uptake capacity, were measured by analyzing clinical 123I-FP-CIT SPECT images of 29 patients with dNDD, including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease, and 18 patients with non-dNDD, using Montreal Neurological Institute space-based anatomical standardization and an atlas template, which utilizes statistical parametric mapping. Additionally, we computed the specific binding ratio (SBR) based on Bolt's method and the maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively). RESULTS: The caudate-to-occipital lobe, putamen-to-occipital lobe, and striatum-to-occipital lobe ratios (COR, POR, and SOR, respectively) on DVR and POR and SOR on BR were significantly lower in dNDD than in non-dNDD, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.941-0.960, showing high diagnostic accuracy for dNDD. However, the AUC of COR on BR was 0.839, indicating lower diagnostic performance. SBR had an AUC of 0.921, while SUVmax and SUVmean had AUCs of 0.906 and 0.900, respectively. Although striatal asymmetry on both DVR and BR exhibited AUCs of 0.728 and 0.734 and asymmetry on SBR showed an AUC of 0.757, the ratio-based DAT quantitative indices were superior. There were strong positive correlations of DVR with BR, DVR with SBR or SUVmax, BR with SBR or SUVmax, and SBR with SUVmax. CONCLUSION: COR, POR, and SOR on DVR and POR and SOR on BR were the most useful DAT quantitative indices. These indices can be compared with SBR and SUV, suggesting that comprehensive evaluation improves the diagnostic accuracy of dNDD.
