33396266|t|The Role of CDK5 in Tumours and Tumour Microenvironments.
33396266|a|Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which belongs to the protein kinase family, regulates neuronal function but is also associated with cancer development and has been proposed as a target for cancer treatment. Indeed, CDK5 has roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune response. Aberrant CDK5 activation triggers tumour progression in numerous types of cancer. In this review, we summarise the role of CDK5 in cancer and neurons and CDK5 inhibitors. We expect that our review helps researchers to develop CDK5 inhibitors as treatments for refractory cancer.
