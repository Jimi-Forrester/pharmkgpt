30173646|t|Missing Uniform Costs Classification for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment and Care.
30173646|a|BACKGROUND: The importance of the issue of the economic burden of treatment and care for people with dementia is crucial in the developed countries. The European Union and other developed countries are trying to improve the course of aging population which leads to rising costs. Their uniform registration is also one of the objectives of the developed countries' strategic plans to fight dementia. The individual steps of the plans in practical terms so far are mainly directed to the early diagnosis of diseases, records of the associated data are so far in the background. AIM: The aim of this paper is to specify a set of costs that should be constantly monitored at the national level within dementia. METHODS: The main method is a literature review focused on Alzheimer's disease. The searched keywords were "Alzheimer's disease" and "costs" incurred after 2010. The studies will specify the monitored costs and determine their minimal penetration, which will then form the basis for recommendations for the monitored group of costs on a national level. RESULTS: Results of the analysis indicate that the following main cost groups are monitored: medical direct costs (inpatient care, outpatient treatment, medication), non-medical direct costs (day care centres, community health services, respite care, accommodation costs for patients) and indirect costs (time that the carers dedicate to the patient). The issue of different naming and groups of costs calls for a common strategy in this area and defining the minimum items that should be monitored.
