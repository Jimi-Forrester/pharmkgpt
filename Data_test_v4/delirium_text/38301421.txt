38301421|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two critical pathogenic factors: amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau. Abeta and tau become neurotoxic aggregates via self-assembly, and these aggregates contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, there has been growing interest in therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target Abeta and tau aggregates. Although neferine has attracted attention as a suitable candidate agent for alleviating AD pathology, there has been no study investigating whether neferine affects the modulation of Abeta or tau aggregation/dissociation. Herein, we investigated the dual regulatory effects of neferine on Abeta and tau aggregation/dissociation. We predicted the binding characteristics of neferine to Abeta and tau using molecular docking simulations. Next, thioflavin T and atomic force microscope analyses were used to evaluate the effects of neferine on the aggregation or dissociation of Abeta42 and tau K18. We verified the effect of neferine on Abeta fibril degradation using a microfluidic device. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation was used to predict a conformational change in the Abeta42-neferine complex. Moreover, we examined the neuroprotective effect of neferine against neurotoxicity induced by Abeta and tau and their fibrils in HT22 cells. Finally, we foresaw the pharmacokinetic properties of neferine. These results demonstrated that neferine, which has attracted attention as a potential treatment for AD, can directly affect Abeta and tau pathology.
