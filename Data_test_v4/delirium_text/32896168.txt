32896168|t|Neuropsychiatric profiles in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies.
32896168|a|OBJECTIVES: To compare the neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of patients with mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) with those with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD). METHOD: Subjects with probable MCI-LB (n = 53), MCI-AD (n = 60), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 97) and AD (n = 202) were recruited. All were older than 60 years. Neuropsychiatric profiles were evaluated by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The Lewy Body Neuropsychiatric Supportive Symptom Count (LBNSSC) was used to assess give supportive clinical features of DLB (systematized delusions, hallucinations in non-visual modalities, apathy, anxiety, and depression). RESULTS: Compared with MCI-AD, those with MCI-LB had higher total NPI scores on prevalence and severity, as were prevalence and severity in visual hallucinations and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). The MCI-LB group had a higher LBNSSC than did the MCI-AD group. Compared with 20% of those with MCI-AD, 41.5% of those with MCI-LB had two or more supportive NPS, (likelihood ratio = 2.08, p = 0.013). MCI-LB subjects showed a high prevalence in apathy, depression, and appetite/eating disorders items. CONCLUSION: The NPI is a useful tool to detect NPS in those with MCI-LB. The MCI-LB group had a higher prevalence of core features (visual hallucinations and RBD) and a higher LBNSSC than the MCI-AD group. These features could help to differentiate MCI-LB and MCI-AD.
