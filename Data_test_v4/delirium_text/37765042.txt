37765042|t|Neuroprotective Properties of Oleanolic Acid-Computational-Driven Molecular Research Combined with In Vitro and In Vivo Experiments.
37765042|a|Oleanolic acid (OA), as a ubiquitous compound in the plant kingdom, is studied for both its neuroprotective and neurotoxic properties. The mechanism of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory potential of OA is investigated using molecular dynamic simulations (MD) and docking as well as biomimetic tests. Moreover, the in vitro SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and the in vivo zebrafish model were used. The inhibitory potential towards the AChE enzyme is examined using the TLC-bioautography assay (the IC50 value is 9.22 muM). The CH-pi interactions between the central fragment of the ligand molecule and the aromatic cluster created by the His440, Phe288, Phe290, Phe330, Phe331, Tyr121, Tyr334, Trp84, and Trp279 side chains are observed. The results of the in vitro tests using the SH-SY5Y cells indicate that the viability rate is reduced to 71.5%, 61%, and 43% at the concentrations of 100 microg/mL, 300 microg/mL, and 1000 microg/mL, respectively, after 48 h of incubation, whereas cytotoxicity against the tested cell line with the IC50 value is 714.32 +- 32.40 microg/mL. The in vivo tests on the zebrafish prove that there is no difference between the control and experimental groups regarding the mortality rate and morphology (p > 0.05).
