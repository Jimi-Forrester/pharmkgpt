37960985|t|A phase 2 and pharmacological study of sapanisertib in patients with relapsed and/or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
37960985|a|BACKGROUND: Despite recent approval of several new agents, relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains challenging to treat. Sapanisertib (MLN0128/TAK-228) is an oral TORC1/2 inhibitor that exhibited preclinical activity against ALL. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm multi-center Phase II study of sapanisertib monotherapy (3 mg orally daily of the milled formulation for 21 days every 28 days) in patients with ALL through the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (NCI-9775). RESULTS: Sixteen patients, 15 of whom were previously treated (median 3 prior lines of therapy), were enrolled. Major grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicities included mucositis (3 patients) and hyperglycemia (2 patients) as well as hepatic failure, seizures, confusion, pneumonitis, and anorexia (1 patient each). Grade >2 hematological toxicity included leukopenia (3), lymphopenia (2), thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (1). The best response was stable disease in 2 patients (12.5%), while only 3 patients (19%) were able to proceed to Cycle 2. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated drug exposures similar to those observed in solid tumor patients. Immunoblotting in serially collected samples indicated limited impact of treatment on phosphorylation of mTOR pathway substrates such as 4EBP1, S6, and AKT. CONCLUSION: In summary, single-agent sapanisertib had a good safety profile but limited target inhibition or efficacy in ALL as a single agent. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02484430.
