30182550|a|INTRODUCTION: According to figures from INEGI 2009, indicate that one in 12 Mexican women and one in 20 men over 65 will suffer a hip fracture. Is expected to reach 110,055 patients in the year 2050. Femoral neck stress fractures are more common in women and consist of 5 to 10%. There is a high number of patients with hip fracture complications, secondary to multiple factors which have been little studied and this limits its prevention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational and transversal study in senior citizens between January and December 2016 with hip fracture was conducted. Through collection of demographic data: age, sex, address, as well as type of fracture, type of management, primary diagnosis: ICD 10 S72 fracture of hip, hospital stay, surgery carried out and place of destination subsequent to discharge from the unit. RESULTS: The most affected gender was female. Within the main complications it correlates with delirium considering the average hospital stay of one day thrown outcomes, says that hospital stays are relatively short compared to other types of fractures. As in the international literature, the Transtrochanteric fracture is the main type of fracture; However in terms of surgical management of higher prevalence was hemiarthroplasty type Thompson followed by closed reduction internal fixation with DHS system placement.
