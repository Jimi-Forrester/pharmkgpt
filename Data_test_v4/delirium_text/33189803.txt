33189803|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that volatile anaesthetics are safe, efficient, and reliable alternatives to the use of intravenous anaesthetics for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We hypothesised that volatile anaesthetics may reduce the incidence of delirium rather than intravenous sedatives. This retrospective study aimed to investigate whether sevoflurane combined with higher targeted temperature management could decrease the incidence of delirium when compared with intravenous anaesthetics with lower targeted temperature management. METHODS: Using a propensity score-matched analysis, we retrospectively compared a target temperature management (32-34  C) method along with intravenous sedation (TTM-33/IV) and a modified target temperature management (34-36  C) method along with sevoflurane sedation (mTTM-36/sevo). We used the confusion assessment method for the ICU to measure the incidence of delirium. We calculated the time-dependent risk on delirium using the multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was significantly lower (p = 0.001) in OHCA patients of the mTTM-36/sevo group (9/56, 16.1%) than in those of the TTM-33/IV group (25/67, 37.3%). Mechanical ventilation and lengths of stay in the ICU (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p = 0.04) were shorter in the mTTM-36/sevo group. Patients in the TTM-33/IV group required more midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl. We observed no significant difference in mortality. CONCLUSION: A multimodal sevoflurane-based sedation regimen together with targeted temperature management resulted in a lower incidence of delirium and a shorter duration for mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay than did the treatment with intravenous sedation combined with the classical cooling protocol.
