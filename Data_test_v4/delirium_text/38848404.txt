38848404|a|BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections reported in older adults, across all settings. Although a diagnosis of a UTI requires specific clinical and microbiological criteria, many older adults are diagnosed with a UTI without meeting the diagnostic criteria, resulting in unnecessary antibiotic treatment and their potential side effects, and a failure to find the true cause of their presentation to hospital. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of UTI diagnoses amongst hospitalized older adults based on clinical and microbiological findings, and their corresponding antibiotic treatment (including complications), in addition to identifying possible factors associated with a confirmed UTI diagnosis. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cross-sectional study of older adult patients (n = 238) hospitalized at the University of Alberta Hospital with an admission diagnosis of UTI over a one-year period was performed. RESULTS: 44.6% (n = 106) of patients had a diagnosis of UTI which was supported by documents clinical and microbiological findings while 43.3% (n = 103) of patients had bacteriuria without documented symptoms. 54.2% (n = 129) of all patients were treated with antibiotics, despite not having evidence to support a diagnosis of a UTI, with 15.9% (n = 37) of those patients experiencing complications including diarrhea, Clostridioides difficile infection, and thrush. History of major neurocognitive disorder was significantly associated with diagnosis of UTI (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: UTIs are commonly misdiagnosed in hospitalized older adults by healthcare providers, resulting in the majority of such patients receiving unnecessary antibiotics, increasing the risk of complications. These findings will allow for initiatives to educate clinicians on the importance of UTI diagnosis in an older adult population and appropriately prescribing antibiotics to prevent unwanted complications.
