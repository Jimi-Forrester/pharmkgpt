38802590|a|Communication between glial cells has a profound impact on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reveal here that reactive astrocytes control cell distancing in peri-plaque glial nets, which restricts microglial access to amyloid deposits. This process is governed by guidance receptor Plexin-B1 (PLXNB1), a network hub gene in individuals with late-onset AD that is upregulated in plaque-associated astrocytes. Plexin-B1 deletion in a mouse AD model led to reduced number of reactive astrocytes and microglia in peri-plaque glial nets, but higher coverage of plaques by glial processes, along with transcriptional changes signifying reduced neuroinflammation. Additionally, a reduced footprint of glial nets was associated with overall lower plaque burden, a shift toward dense-core-type plaques and reduced neuritic dystrophy. Altogether, our study demonstrates that Plexin-B1 regulates peri-plaque glial net activation in AD. Relaxing glial spacing by targeting guidance receptors may present an alternative strategy to increase plaque compaction and reduce neuroinflammation in AD.
