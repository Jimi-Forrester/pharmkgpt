31823283|t|Whole-Transcriptome Analysis of Dermal Fibroblasts, Derived from Three Pairs of Monozygotic Twins, Discordant for Parkinson's Disease.
31823283|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.
