35633395|a|Preliminary methodologically limited studies suggested that taste and smell known as chemosensory impairments and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated in post-COVID-19. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether chemosensory dysfunction and neuropsychiatric impairments in a well-characterized post-COVID-19 sample. This is a cohort study assessing adult patients hospitalized due to moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 between March and August 2020. Baseline information includes several clinical and hospitalization data. Further evaluations were made using several different reliable instruments designed to assess taste and smell functions, parosmia, and neuropsychiatric disorders (using standardized psychiatric and cognitive measures). Out of 1800 eligible individuals, 701 volunteers were assessed on this study. After multivariate analysis, patients reporting parosmia had a worse perception of memory performance (p < 0.001). Moderate/severe hypogeusia was significantly associated with a worse performance on the word list memory task (p = 0.012); Concomitant moderate/severe olfactory and gustatory loss during the acute phase of COVID-19 was also significantly associated with episodic memory impairment (p = 0.006). We found a positive association between reported chemosensory (taste and olfaction) abnormalities and cognition dysfunction in post-COVID-19 patients. These findings may help us identify potential mechanisms linking these two neurobiological functions, and also support the speculation on a possible route through which SARS-CoV-2 may reach the central nervous system.
