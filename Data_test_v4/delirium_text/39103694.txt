39103694|a|Research into the anticancer activity of quantum-sized carbon dots (CDs) has emerged as a promising avenue in cancer research. This CDs delves into the opportunities and challenges associated with harnessing the potential of these nanostructures for combating cancer. Quantum-sized carbon dots, owing to their unique physicochemical properties, exhibit distinct advantages as potential therapeutic agents. Opportunities lie in their tunable size, surface functionalization capabilities, and biocompatibility, enabling targeted drug delivery and imaging in cancer cells. However, we include challenges, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, potential toxicity concerns, and the optimization of synthesis methods for enhanced therapeutic efficacy. A succinct summary of the state of the research in this area is given in this review, emphasizing the exciting possibilities and ongoing challenges in utilizing quantum-sized carbon dots as a novel strategy for cancer treatment.
