38056052|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the time to emergence from general anesthesia with remimazolam versus propofol in patients undergoing cerebral endovascular procedures. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial. SETTING: An academic hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients scheduled for cerebral endovascular procedures. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to undergo surgery under general anesthesia with remimazolam (0.1 mg kg-1 for induction and 0.3-0.7 mg kg-1 h-1 for maintenance) or propofol (1-1.5 mg kg-1 for induction and 4-10 mg kg-1 h-1 for maintenance). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the time to emergence from anesthesia. The non-inferiority margin was -2.55 min in group difference. Major secondary outcomes included hypotension during induction, incidence of postoperative delirium and Modified Rankin Scale (mRs) at 30 days and 90 days after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 142 randomized patients, 129 completed the trial. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, the mean time to emergence from anesthesia was 16.1 [10.4] min in the remimazolam group vs. 19.0 [11.2] min in the propofol group. The group difference was -2.9 min [95% CI -6.5, 0.7] (P = 0.003 for non-inferiority). The remimazolam group had lower rate of hypotension during induction (11.3% vs 25.4%, P = 0.03) and use of vasopressors during surgery (29.6% vs 62.0%, P < 0.001). The two groups did not differ in postoperative delirium and mRs at 30 and 90 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing cerebral endovascular procedures, remimazolam did not increase the time from anesthesia vs propofol.
