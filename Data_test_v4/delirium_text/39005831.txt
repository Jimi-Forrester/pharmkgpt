39005831|t|Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Camellia longii Orel & Luu Leaf Extracts for Memory Loss in Alzheimer's Disease: Novel Findings and Functional Food Applications.
39005831|a|Novel research on the chemical compositions and biochemical activities of Camellia longii Orel and Luu leaf extracts revealed valuable resources with potential applications in Alzheimer's disease treatment. Qualitative phytochemicals detected various compound groups, including polyphenols, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, amino acids, coumarins, and polysaccharides. HPLC-MS identified 23 compounds in C. longii leaves with compounds found at significant levels, including epicatechin gallate (17.12%), tryptophan (13.73%), isovitexin (12.91%), gallic acid (3.06%), and quercetin (3.06%). Interestingly, the ethanol extract (CLL-Ew) exhibited the highest extraction yield (26.6%) and potent antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory effects in vitro. In the Drosophila melanogaster model, CLL-Ew improved longevity, movement, and memory by reducing malondialdehyde and increasing glutathione levels. Docking simulations suggested that the above compounds bind tightly to AChE's active site, potentially contributing to memory enhancement. Interestingly, observations of male and female mice after administration of a dose of 5000 mg/kg C. longii leaf extract were recorded normally throughout the 14 day experiment. These findings highlight the potential of C. longii leaf extracts in functional foods and therapeutic interventions for memory impairment prevention and treatment.
