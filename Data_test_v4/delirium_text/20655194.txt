20655194|t|Lipid function at synapses.
20655194|a|Chemical neurotransmission between neurons is a major point for modulation of neuronal activity. The neuronal synapse is the site of continuous cycles of rapid vesicle fusion (exocytosis) followed by their retrieval (endocytosis). Ongoing research efforts are largely focused on synaptic proteins involved in membrane fusion-and-fission, but it is now becoming clear that the dynamic lipid environment, where these proteins operate, also plays a key role in the modulation of chemical transmission. Growing evidence suggests that lipid metabolites regulate both vesicle fusion and retrieval highlighting the fact that membrane lipids have functions beyond the structural role. Furthermore, direct involvement of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, necessitates rigorous investigation of the effects of lipids on synaptic mechanisms. Recent findings and possible lines of further investigation will be discussed in this review.
