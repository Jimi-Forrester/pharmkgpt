39877656|a|Background: Programmed cell death plays an important role in neuronal injury and death after ischemic stroke (IS), leading to cellular glucose deficiency. Glucose deficiency can cause abnormal accumulation of cytotoxic disulfides, resulting in disulfidptosis. Ferroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy inhibitors cannot inhibit this novel programmed cell death mechanism. Nevertheless, the potential mechanisms of disulfidptosis in IS remain unclear. Methods: The GSE16561 dataset was used to screen for differentially expressed disulfidptosis-related biomarkers (DE-DRBs). A correlation between the DE-DRBs was detected. The optimal machine-learning (ML) model and predictor molecules were determined. The GSE58294 dataset was used to verify the accuracy of the optimal ML model. The DE-DRB expression was detected in the blood of patients with IS. Based on IS models, experimental analyses were performed to verify DE-DRB expression and the correlation between DE-DRBs. Results: Leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (LRPPRC) and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 11 (NDUFA11) were identified as DE-DRBs. The NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1 (NDUFS1) interacted with NDUFA11 and LRPPRC. The support vector machine (SVM) model was identified as the optimal ML model. The NDUFA11 expression level in the blood of patients with IS was 20.9% compared to that in normal controls. NDUFA11 expression was downregulated in the in vitro/in vivo models of IS. The number of formed complexes of NDUFS1 and NDUFA11 decreased in the in vitro/in vivo models of IS. Conclusion: This research suggests that NDUFA11 is a specific DRB for IS and demonstrates alterations in the disulfidptosis-related protein complexes NDUFS1-NDUFA11.
