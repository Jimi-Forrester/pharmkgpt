29863693|t|[Perioperative stroke in heart valve surgery: pathogenesis, clinical findings, diagnosis, prevention, treatment].
29863693|a|AIM: To study risk factors, characteristics of clinical symptoms and diagnosis, and possibilities of prevention of perioperative stroke and other clinical types of cerebral dysfunction in main types of heart valve surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 83 patients, aged 63 (54; 70) years, undergoing heart valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: Postoperative cerebral dysfunction was diagnosed in 37.3% of cases, including perioperative stroke in 3.6% of cases. In cases of aortic stenosis, the frequency of perioperative stroke was 9.5%. The cardioembolic subtype of perioperative ischemic stroke in cardiac valve surgery was most likely. The risk factors of the symptomatic delirium of the early postoperative period are: age over 75 years, preoperative frontal dysfunction, duration of artificial respiratory care more than 20 hours after the surgery. CONCLUSION: The results suggest the efficacy of preventive use of cytoflavin for reducing the frequency and severity of perioperative stroke and symptomatic delirium of the early postoperative period in heart valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
