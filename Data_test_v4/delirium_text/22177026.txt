22177026|t|Delirium secondary to pregabalin.
22177026|a|Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling disease, and treatment can be challenging. More recently, pregabalin has been approved to treat pain associated with fibromyalgia. However, it can have serious neuropsychiatric sequelae. Several case reports have documented delirium secondary to pregabalin, usually in older patients with multiple medical comorbidities and concurrent medications. We describe a case of delirium in a young patient without significant medical problems and in the absence of other potentially causal medications. In this case, pregabalin appears to be the single causal etiology for delirium. We recommend clinicians to consider the causal role it may play in any patient who presents with delirium.
