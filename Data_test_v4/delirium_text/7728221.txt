7728221|t|Cell-cycle-dependent abnormal calcium response in fibroblasts from patients with familial Alzheimer's disease.
7728221|a|Change in calcium response was studied to clarify the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cultured fibroblasts from patients with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD; n = 6), sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD; n = 4), and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 4) were studied with an ACAS Interactive Laser Cytometer (ACAS-470). Fibroblasts from two independent families with FAD (OS-1, and OS-2 families) showed a suppressed calcium response after stimulation by 100 nM bradykinin (BK) 100 nM vasopressin (VP) or 10% FCS in Ca(2+)-free condition compared with control fibroblasts at 48 h after plating. However, on the 7th day after plating, the abnormal calcium response was no longer observed. The height of the calcium peak showed periodic variation, indicating a relationship of calcium response with the cell cycle. When fibroblasts from OS-1 and OS-2 families were arrested in S phase, they showed a significantly suppressed calcium peak after BK stimulation. However, when those fibroblasts were arrested in other phases, they showed the same calcium peak as the other cells. The suppression of calcium response in S phase was indistinguishable from the calcium suppression induced by A23187 administration. Since Hardy type mutation on amyloid precursor protein gene is found in the OS-1 family, the observed abnormalities in calcium response might be related with pathological processing of amyloid precursor protein in AD. The reported abnormal calcium response, which is observed most obviously in fibroblasts in S phase, may indicate participation of the cell-cycle-dependent process in the pathology of AD.
