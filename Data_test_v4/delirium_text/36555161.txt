36555161|t|Sensory Involvement in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
36555161|a|Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is pre-eminently a motor disease, the existence of non-motor manifestations, including sensory involvement, has been described in the last few years. Although from a clinical perspective, sensory symptoms are overshadowed by their motor manifestations, this does not mean that their pathological significance is not relevant. In this review, we have made an extensive description of the involvement of sensory and autonomic systems described to date in ALS, from clinical, neurophysiological, neuroimaging, neuropathological, functional, and molecular perspectives.
