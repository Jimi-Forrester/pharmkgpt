37852556|t|Association between Catheter Ablation and Dementia among patients with Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
37852556|a|BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of Dementia. However, the association between catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation (CA) patients and risk of dementia is not well established with conflicting results to date. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the association between CA patients and the risk of Dementia. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane libraries for relevant articles from inception until 10th May 2023. Hazard ratios (HR) were pooled using a random-effect model, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies with 125649 patients (30192 in the CA group and 95457 in the non-CA group) were included. The mean age of patients among CA and non-CA groups was comparable (58.7 vs. 58.18). The most common comorbidity among CA and non-CA groups was hypertension (18.49% vs. 81.51%) respectively. Pooled analysis of primary outcome showed that CA was associated with significant reduction in the risk of Dementia (HR, 0.63(95%CI: 0.52-0.77), P<0.001). Similarly, pooled analysis of secondary outcomes showed that the patients with CA had a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.78(95%CI: 0.66-0.92), P<0.001) compared with the non-CA group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of vascular dementia (HR, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.38-1.06), P=0.08) between both groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that catheter ablation reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared to the non-ablation group of patients.
