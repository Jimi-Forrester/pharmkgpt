38938826|t|Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Innovative Management Strategies.
38938826|a|Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) complicate 13% to 15% of pregnancies in the United States. Historically marginalized communities are at increased risk, with preeclampsia and eclampsia being the leading cause of death in this population. Pregnant individuals with HDP require more frequent and intensive monitoring throughout the antepartum period outside of routine standard of care prenatal visits. Additionally, acute rises in blood pressure often occur 3 to 6 days postpartum and are challenging to identify and treat, as most postpartum individuals are usually scheduled for their first visit 6 weeks after delivery. Thus, a multifaceted approach is necessary to improve recognition and treatment of HDP throughout the peripartum course. There are limited studies investigating interventions for the management of HDP, especially within the United States, where maternal mortality is rising, and in higher-risk groups. We review the state of current management of HDP and innovative strategies such as blood pressure self-monitoring, telemedicine, and community health worker intervention.
