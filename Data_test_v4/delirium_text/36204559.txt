36204559|a|Aims: This research aimed to explore alterations in the local gyrification index (GI) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: In this study, 126 T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI), 154 T2DM patients with normal cognition (T2DM-NC), and 167 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. All subjects underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests. A multimodal approach combining surface-based morphometry (SBM) and seed-based RSFC was used to determine the structural and functional alterations in patients with T2DM-MCI. The relationships among the GI, RSFC, cognitive ability, and clinical variables were characterized. Results: Compared with the T2DM-NC group and HC group, T2DM-MCI patients showed significantly reduced GI in the bilateral insular cortex. Decreased RSFC was found between the left insula and right precuneus, and the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG). The altered GI was correlated with T2DM duration, global cognition, and episodic memory. The mediation effects of RSFC on the association between GI and cognition were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our results suggest that GI may serve as a novel neuroimaging biomarker to predict T2DM-related MCI and help us to improve the understanding of the neuropathological effects of T2DM-related MCI.
