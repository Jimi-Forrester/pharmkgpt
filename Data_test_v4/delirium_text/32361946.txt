32361946|t|Dynamic network connectivity predicts subjective cognitive decline: the Sino-Longitudinal Cognitive impairment and dementia study.
32361946|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. We collected resting-state functional MRI data and applied novel graph-theoretical analyses to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal cerebral connectivities in 63 individuals with SCD and 67 normal controls (NC). Temporal flexibility and spatiotemporal diversity were mapped to reflect dynamic time-varying functional interactions among the brain regions within and outside communities. Temporal flexibility indicates how frequently a brain region interacts with regions of other communities across time; spatiotemporal diversity describes how evenly a brain region interacts with regions belonging to other communities. SCD and NC differed in large-scale brain dynamics characterized by the two measures, which, with support vector machine, demonstrated higher classification accuracies than conventional static parameters and structural metrics. The findings characterize dynamic network dysfunction that may serve as a biomarker of the preclinical stage of AD.
