39075602|a|BACKGROUND: The mutually beneficial coevolutionary relationships between rodents and plant seeds have been a theme of research in plant-animal relationships. Seed tannins are important secondary metabolites of plants that regulate the food-hoarding behavior of rodents; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet clear. In this study, we investigated whether and how seed tannins improve spatial memory and regulate the hoarding behavior of Tamias sibiricus by altering their gut microbiota. RESULTS: We showed that acorn tannins not only improved spatial memory but also enhanced scatter-hoarding in T. sibiricus. Changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota in response to tannins from acorns are closely related to these improvements. Metabonomic analyses revealed the role of gut isovaleric acid and isobutyric acid as well as serum L-tryptophan in mediating the spatial memory of T. sibiricus via the gut microbiota. The hippocampal proteome provides further evidence that the microbiota-gut-brain axis regulates spatial memory and scatter-hoarding in animals. Our study is likely the first to report that plant secondary metabolites improve hippocampal function and spatial memory and ultimately modulate food-hoarding behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. CONCLUSION: Our findings may have resolved the long-standing puzzle about the hidden role of plant secondary metabolites in manipulating food-hoarding behavior in rodents via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our study is important for better understanding the mutualistic coevolution between plants and animals. Video Abstract.
