33015377|a|Prolonged neuroinflammation is a driving force for neurodegenerative disease, and agents against inflammatory responses are regarded as potential treatment strategies. Here we aimed to evaluate the prevention effects on gliosis by dexamethasone (DEX), an anti-inflammation drug. We used DEX to treat the nicastrin conditional knockout (cKO) mouse, a neurodegenerative mouse model. DEX (10 mg/kg) was given to 2.5-month-old nicastrin cKO mice, which have not started to display neurodegeneration and gliosis, for 2 months. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting techniques were used to detect changes in neuroinflammatory responses. We found that activation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive or ionized calcium binding adapter molecule1 (Iba1) positive cells was not inhibited in nicastrin cKO mice treated with DEX as compared to those treated with saline. These data suggest that DEX does not prevent or ameliorate gliosis in a neurodegenerative mouse model when given prior to neuronal or synaptic loss.
