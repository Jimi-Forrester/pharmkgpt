37477796|a|Recent studies have shown that, coupled with other environmental factors, aluminium exposure may lead to neurodegeneration resulting in cognitive impairment resembling Alzheimer's disease. Menaquinone, a form of vitamin K2, aids in maintaining healthy bones and avoids coronary calcification. It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Here, we study the neuroprotective effects of vitamin K2 (MK-7) using the animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aluminium chloride (AlCl3; 100 mg/kg for 3 weeks orally) was administered to Swiss albino mice to induce neurodegeneration and Vitamin K2 (100 g/kg for 3 weeks orally) was applied as treatment. This was followed by behavioural studies to determine memory changes. The behavioural observations correlated with proinflammatory, oxidative, and brain histopathological changes in AlCl3-treated animals with or without vitamin K2 treatment. AlCl3 administration led to memory decline which was partially restored in Vitamin K2 treated animals. Myeloperoxidase levels in the brain increased due to AlCl3-mediated inflammation, which Vitamin K2 prevented. The acetylcholine esterase and oxidative stress markers induced by AlCl3 were reversed by Vitamin K2. Also, Vitamin K2 helps to restore hippocampal BDNF levels and reduced the amyloid beta accumulation in AlCl3-administered animals. Additionally, Vitamin K2 protected the hippocampal neurons against AlCl3-mediated damage as observed in histopathological studies. We conclude that Vitamin K2 could partially reverse AlCl3-mediated cognitive decline. It increases acetylcholine and BDNF levels while reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and beta-amyloid deposition, thus protecting the hippocampal neurons from AlCl3-mediated damage.
