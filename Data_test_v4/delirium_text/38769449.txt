38769449|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of several haematological malignancies and is being investigated in patients with various solid tumours. Characteristic CAR T cell-associated toxicities such as cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are now well-recognized, and improved supportive care and management with immunosuppressive agents has made CAR T cell therapy safer and more feasible than it was when the first regulatory approvals of such treatments were granted in 2017. The increasing clinical experience with these therapies has also improved recognition of previously less well-defined toxicities, including movement disorders, immune effector cell-associated haematotoxicity (ICAHT) and immune effector cell-associated haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome (IEC-HS), as well as the substantial risk of infection in patients with persistent CAR T cell-induced B cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinaemia. A more diverse selection of immunosuppressive and supportive-care pharmacotherapies is now being utilized for toxicity management, yet no universal algorithm for their application exists. As CAR T cell products targeting new antigens are developed, additional toxicities involving damage to non-malignant tissues expressing the target antigen are a potential hurdle. Continued prospective evaluation of toxicity management strategies and the design of less-toxic CAR T cell products are both crucial for ongoing success in this field. In this Review, we discuss the evolving understanding and clinical management of CAR T cell-associated toxicities.
