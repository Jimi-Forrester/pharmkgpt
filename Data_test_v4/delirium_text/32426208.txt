32426208|t|Genetic Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Associated with RANBP2: Clinical and Therapeutic Implications in Pediatrics.
32426208|a|Genetic (also known as familial) acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE1) is a rare disease presenting with encephalopathy often following preceding viral febrile illness in patients with a genetic predisposition resulting from a missense mutation in the gene encoding RAN Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2). The acute episode is characterized by deterioration in consciousness, often with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Additionally, symmetric multifocal brain lesions are seen in the bilateral thalami as well as other characteristic regions, involving both gray and white matter. Prognosis is variable, with a high mortality rate and most surviving patients having persistent neurologic deficits. Early treatment with high dose steroids is associated with a more favorable outcome, however the diagnosis is often overlooked resulting in delayed treatment. The RANBP2 mutation associated with ANE1 causes an incompletely penetrant predisposition to encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness through a mechanism that remains elusive. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses suggesting possible etiologies for this phenotype based on the many functions of RANBP2 within the cell. These include dysfunctions in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and intracellular metabolic regulation, as well as cytokine storm, and abnormal distribution of mitochondria. This narrative review explores these key concepts of the RANBP2 mutation and its clinical and therapeutic implications in pediatric populations.
