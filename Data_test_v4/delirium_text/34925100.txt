34925100|t|Determining Appropriate Screening Tools and Cutoffs for Cognitive Impairment in the Chinese Elderly.
34925100|a|Background: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are the most commonly used tools for cognitive impairment screening. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of the MOCA and MMSE to differentiate between cognitively normal elderly individuals, MCI patients and dementia patients at different ages and education levels and to establish the optimal cutoff scores of the MoCA and MMSE for MCI and dementia in the Chinese elderly. Methods: A total of 2,954 Chinese elderly individuals, including 1,746 normal controls, 599 MCI patients and 249 dementia patients, were consecutively recruited in the study. The optimal cutoffs for MoCA and MMSE were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis among the different age and education levels in the three groups. Furthermore, comparison of ROC curves were made to evaluate the performances of the two tests. Results: The area under the curve(AUC) of the MoCA (0.82) for detecting MCI was significantly higher than that of the MMSE (0.75) (P < 0.001). When the sample was divided according to age and education level, the AUC of the MoCA (0.84) was higher than those of the MMSE (0.71) for MCI (P < 0.001) in the younger and more highly-educated groups. The optimal cutoff scores of the MoCA for the groups aged <= 75 years old and education <= 6 years, aged > 75 years old and education <= 6 years, aged <= 75 years old and education > 6 years, aged > 75 years old and education > 6 years in screening for MCI were identified as 19.5, 15.5, 24.5 and 24.5, respectively, and the optimal cutoff scores for dementia were 18.5, 10.5, 18.5 and 20.5, respectively. For MMSE in the above four groups, the cutoff scores to detect MCI were 26.5, 22.5, 28.5 and 26.5, respectively, and the optimal cutoff scores for dementia were 23.5, 19.5, 23.5 and 23.5, respectively. Conclusion: Compared to MMSE, the MoCA is more suitable for discriminating MCI in younger and more highly educated elderly Chinese individuals. However, the MMSE has advantage over MoCA in screening MCI in individuals with lower education levels and the older groups of Chinese elderly.
