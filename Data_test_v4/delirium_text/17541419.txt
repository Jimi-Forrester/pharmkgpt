17541419|t|Untangling tau hyperphosphorylation in drug design for neurodegenerative diseases.
17541419|a|Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau is one of the characteristic neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Pharmacological modulation of tau hyperphosphorylation might represent a valid and feasible therapeutic strategy for such disorders. Here, we consider recent evidence supporting the validity of the three most relevant kinases affecting tau hyperphosphorylation - GSK3beta, CDK5 and ERK2 - as drug targets and describe progress in the design of inhibitors for these kinases.
