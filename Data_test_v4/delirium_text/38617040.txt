38617040|t|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in chronic pain research: A decade of bibliometric analysis and network visualization.
38617040|a|Chronic pain research, with a specific focus on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), has made impressive progress in the past decade, as evident in the improved research quality and increased publications. To better understand this evolving landscape, a quantitative approach is needed. The main aim of this study is to identify the hotspots and trends of BDNF in chronic pain research. We screened relevant publications from 2013 to 2022 in the Scopus database using specific search subject terms. A total of 401 documents were selected for further analysis. We utilized several tools, including Microsoft Excel, Harzing's Publish or Perish, and VOSViewer, to perform a frequency analysis, citation metrics, and visualization, respectively. Key indicators that were examined included publication growth, keyword analyses, topmost influential articles and journals, networking by countries and co-citation of cited references. Notably, there was a persistent publication growth between 2015 and 2021. "Neuropathic pain" emerged as a prominent keyword in 2018, alongside "microglia" and "depression". The journal Pain  was the most impactful journal that published BDNF and chronic pain research, while the most influential publications came from open-access reviews and original articles. China was the leading contributor, followed by the United States (US), and maintained a leadership position in the total number of publications and collaborations. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive list of the most influential publications on BDNF in chronic pain research, thereby aiding in the understanding of academic concerns, research hotspots, and global trends in this specialized field.
