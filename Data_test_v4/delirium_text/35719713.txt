35719713|t|EEG Abnormalities During Delirium as a Prodromal Feature of Dementia with Lewy Bodies: A Case Report.
35719713|a|Background: A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the Neurology Clinic of the University of Chieti-Pescara for a syncope. At admission, the occurrence of an acute stroke was ruled out. Her cognitive status was unimpaired. After three days from the hospitalization, the patient experienced an episode of mixed delirium. Objective: The present case report shows a case of delirium-onset dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with a specific electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern from its prodromal stage. Methods: Delirium was assessed by 4AT test. During the hospitalization, the patient underwent a quantitative EEG (QEEG) with spectral analysis. At six months from the episode of delirium, she was tested by neuropsychological evaluation, QEEG, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT to assess the onset of a possible cognitive decline. Results: At baseline, the QEEG exam showed a dominant frequency (DF) in the pre-alpha band (7.5 Hz) with a dominant frequency variability (DFV) of 2 Hz. This pattern is typical of DLB at early stage. After six months, she reported attention deficits in association with cognitive fluctuation and REM sleep behavior disorder. The neurological examination revealed signs of parkinsonism. Cognitive status resulted to be impaired (MoCA = 15/30). QEEG recording confirmed the presence of a DLB-typical pattern (DF = 7.5 Hz, DFV = 2.5 Hz). The 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed a moderate bilateral posterior hypometabolism (occipital and temporal cortex), with relative sparing of the posterior cingulate cortex compared to cuneus/precuneus (Cingulate Island sign), and mild bilateral hypometabolism in frontal regions (suggestive of a DLB diagnosis). Conclusion: EEGs may represent supportive and validated biomarkers for delirium-onset prodromal DLB.
