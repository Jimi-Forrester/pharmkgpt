27288678|a|INTRODUCTION.: Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by progressive behavioural changes and executive function impairment. It is the second most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia after Alzheimer's type dementia. Atypical course of the disease, including cases with other symptoms relevantly interfering with the clinical picture, provides a challenge in the diagnostic process. AIM AND MATERIAL.: The aim of this paper is to present a case of patient with BvFTD and gait disturbance as a main reported symptom masking behavioural changes and cognitive function impairment. Gait disturbance commonly occurs at the late stage of dementia disorders. It results from gait apraxia, extrapyramidal syndrome or motor neuron dysfunction. However, it is not a predominant symptom of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia excluding terminal stage of the disease. RESULTS: Presented case emphasises the significance of accurately gathered anamnesis with patient and his family. Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia should be considered in cases of unexplained gait abnormalities.
