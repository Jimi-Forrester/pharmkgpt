39889799|t|Ambulation Protocol for Adult Patients Receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Quality Improvement Initiative.
39889799|a|BACKGROUND: For patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, early mobility decreases mechanical ventilation time, delirium incidence, and length of intensive care unit stay and improves physical functioning. Individual centers use institutional guidelines to develop ambulation protocols. Local Problem A quality improvement initiative was used to evaluate an ambulation protocol for adult intensive care unit patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. METHODS: Adult patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation who walked according to the protocol were compared with a historical control group of patients who walked without the protocol. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and independent t tests. Outcomes included adverse safety events, number of patients and ambulation sessions, standing and ambulation time, and distance. RESULTS: From January to March 2021, 13 of 46 patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (28%) walked according to the protocol. In the control group, 14 of 147 patients (10%) walked in 2019; 21 of 144 patients (15%) walked in 2020. Some characteristics of the control group (hospitalized before the COVID-19 pandemic) differed from those of the protocol group (hospitalized during the pandemic). Mean number of ambulation sessions was not significantly different between groups (protocol group, 10; control group, 9). Differences in mean standing time (protocol group, 121.23 minutes; control group, 210.80 minutes), ambulation time (protocol group, 11.77 minutes; control group, 198.70 minutes), and ambulation distance were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Standing time, ambulation time, and distance were not significantly different between the groups. The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ambulation protocol demonstrated clinical significance by increasing the number of patients walking.
