35241013|a|BACKGROUND: Ever since the administration of early doses of COVID-19 vaccines, instances of adverse effects have been reported. Viral infections, specifically herpes simplex reinfection and coinfections, have been reported following administration of different types of vaccines. To our knowledge, there have not been any reports of herpes simplex encephalitis following administration of any type of COVID-19 vaccine to date. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article intends to report a case of herpes simplex encephalitis in a 27-year-old male patient who was vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a possible but very rare side effect of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which requires immediate medical attention and can lead to devastating consequences if left undiagnosed and untreated.
