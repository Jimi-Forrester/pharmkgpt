38905040|t|Cognitive Impairment and Associated Factors Among Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Bahir Dar City Referral Hospitals, 2021: Cross-Sectional Study.
38905040|a|Background: Neurocognitive impairment, characterized by reduced performance in various cognitive domains, has been significantly linked with glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Poorly controlled diabetes often results in decreased cognitive abilities, and a longer duration of the disease is associated with lower cognitive levels. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive impairment in adults with T2DM and identify related factors. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 421 adults with T2DM. A systematic random sampling was used to select study participants in two referral hospitals in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination tool was used. Binary logistic regression was used. Significance was declared at p value<=0.05 with 95% confidence interval. Results: Over a quarter (27.6%) of participants were identified as cognitively impaired. Factors associated with lower cognitive status included older age, being single, lower education level, farming occupation, presence of comorbidity, and engagement in moderate physical activity. Conclusions: In conclusion, the prevalence of cognitive impairment among T2DM patients is a growing concern. Several risk factors have been identified like age group, marital status, education level, occupation, presence of comorbidity, and moderate physical activities. The impact of cognitive impairment on the quality of life and functional abilities of T2DM patients should not be underestimated.
