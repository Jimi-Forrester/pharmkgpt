30577576|t|Perspective: Mitochondria-ER Contacts in Metabolic Cellular Stress Assessed by Microscopy.
30577576|a|The interplay of mitochondria with the endoplasmic reticulum and their connections, called mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) or mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), are crucial hubs in cellular stress. These sites are essential for the passage of calcium ions, reactive oxygen species delivery, the sorting of lipids in whole-body metabolism. In this perspective article, we focus on microscopic evidences of the pivotal role of MERCs/MAMs and their changes in metabolic diseases, like obesity, diabetes, and neurodegeneration.
