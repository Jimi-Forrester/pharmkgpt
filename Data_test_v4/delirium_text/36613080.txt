36613080|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia. However, research dealing with the experience of adult children of a parent diagnosed with AD, regardless of whether the offspring is a caregiver, is not well developed. OBJECTIVE: The current research is a cross-sectional study that examines the associations between filial maturity, offspring's coming to terms with their parent's AD, and the well-being of the offspring. METHOD: one hundred and forty Israeli adult children of parents with AD participated in the study and completed self-report questionnaires assessing their filial maturity, resolution of their parent's diagnosis with AD, the adult children's well-being, and the severity of the parent's AD according neurologist's report. RESULTS: Results showed that higher resolution of the parent's disease was positively associated with well-being. In addition, filial maturity was negatively associated with resolution of the parent's disease, and resolution of the parent's disease mediated the association between filial maturity and well-being. CONCLUSION: Resolution of a parent's AD is highly challenging for offspring with high filial maturity, and the lack of resolution affects their well-being. Offering prolonged emotional support for offspring of parents diagnosed with AD may improve their ability to integrate the new reality into their lives and foster their well-being.
