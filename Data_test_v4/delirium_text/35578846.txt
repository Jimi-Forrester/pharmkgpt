35578846|t|Irregular Baseline Brain Activity in Coronary Artery Disease Patients with Cognitive Impairment: A Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
35578846|a|OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment has been suggested to be associated with coronary artery disease [CAD]; however, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Our current study aimed to explore the brain activity in CAD patients compared to healthy controls [HCs]. METHODS: Twenty-two CAD patients and 23 HCs were enrolled in our study. A low-frequency oscillation at the voxel level in all participants based on the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations [ALFF] was measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. All participants underwent neuropsychological examinations [Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA] and visual acuity examination. RESULTS: CAD patients showed significantly lower ALFF values [P < 0.05] in the right precuneus gyrus [Precuneus_R], left supramarginal gyrus [Supramarginal_L], left angular gyrus [Angular_L], and left middle cingulum gyrus [Cingulum_Mid_L] than healthy controls. Lower MoCA scores in CAD patients significantly correlated with lower Supramarginal_L [P = 0.001] and Cingulate_ Mid_L [P = 0.004] ALFF values. Reduced visual acuity significantly correlated with lower Precuneus_R [P = 0.019] and Cingulate_Mid_L [P = 0.011] ALFF values in CAD patients. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide further insight into the underlying neuropathophysiology of CAD with cognitive impairment.
