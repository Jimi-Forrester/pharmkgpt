32369921|t|Impact of Weight Loss on the Total Antioxidant/Oxidant Potential in Patients with Morbid Obesity-A Longitudinal Study.
32369921|a|The assessment of total antioxidant activity seems to have a higher diagnostic value than the evaluation of individual antioxidants separately. Therefore, this is the first study to assess the total antioxidant/oxidant status in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The study involved 60 patients with Class 3 obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2) divided into two equal subgroups: morbidly obese patients without and with metabolic syndrome. The analyses were performed in plasma samples collected before surgery as well as 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH (2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical assay, and total oxidant status (TOS) were significantly higher before surgery (as compared to the healthy controls, n = 60) and generally decreased after bariatric treatment. Interestingly, all assessed biomarkers correlated positively with uric acid content. However, the total antioxidant/oxidant potential did not differ between obese patients without metabolic syndrome and those with both obesity and metabolic syndrome. Only DPPH differentiated the two subgroups (p < 0.0001; AUC 0.8) with 73% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Plasma TAC correlated positively with body mass index, waist-hip ratio, serum insulin, and uric acid. Therefore, TAC seems to be the best biomarker to assess the antioxidant status of obese patients.
