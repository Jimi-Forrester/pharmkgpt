35056745|t|An Electrochemiluminescence Biosensor for the Detection of Alzheimer's Tau Protein Based on Gold Nanostar Decorated Carbon Nitride Nanosheets.
35056745|a|Human Tau protein is the most reliable biomarker for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the assay to detect low concentrations of tau protein in serum is a great challenge for the early diagnosis of AD. This paper reports an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for Tau protein in serum samples. Gold nanostars (AuNSs) decorated on carbon nitride nanosheets (AuNS@g-CN nanostructure) show highly strong and stable ECL activity compared to pristine CN nanosheets due to the electrocatalytic and surface plasmon effects of AuNSs. As a result of the strong electromagnetic field at branches, AuNSs showed a better ECL enhancement effect than their spherical counterpart. For the fabrication of a specific immunosensor, immobilized AuNSs were functionalized with a monoclonal antibody specific for Tau protein. In the presence of Tau protein, the ECL intensity of the immunosensor decreased considerably. Under the optimal conditions, this ECL based immunosensor exhibits a dynamic linear range from 0.1 to 100 ng mL-1 with a low limit of detection of 0.034 ng mL-1. The LOD is less than the Tau level in human serum; thus, this study provides a useful method for the determination of Tau. The fabricated ECL immunosensor was successfully applied to the detection of Tau, the biomarker in serum samples. Therefore, the present approach is very promising for application in diagnosing AD within the early stages of the disease.
