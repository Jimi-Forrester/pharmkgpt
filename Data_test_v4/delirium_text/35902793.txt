35902793|a|During neurodegenerative diseases, the brain undergoes morphological and pathological changes; Iron deposits are one of the causes of pathological changes in the brain. The Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, a type of magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction, is one of the newest diagnostic methods for iron deposits to detect changes in magnetic susceptibility. Numerous research projects have been conducted in this field. The purpose of writing this review article is to identify the first deep brain nuclei that undergo magnetic susceptibility changes during neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this article is to identify the brain nuclei that are prone to iron deposition in any specific disorder. In addition to the mentioned purpose, this paper proposes the optimal scan parameters and appropriate algorithms of each QSM reconstruction step by reviewing the results of different articles. As a result, The QSM technique can identify nuclei exposed to iron deposition in various neurodegenerative diseases. Also, the selection of scan parameters is different based on the sequence and purpose; an example of the parameters is placed in the tables. The BET toolbox in FSL, Laplacian-based phase-unwrapping process, the V_SHARP algorithm, and morphology-enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) method are the most widely used algorithms in various stages of QSM reconstruction.
