22987042|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are potent synaptotoxins thought to mediate AD-related phenotypes. Cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) has been identified as a high-affinity receptor for Abeta oligomers. Herein, we review the functional consequences of Abeta oligomer binding to PrP(C) on the neuronal surface. We highlight recent evidence that Fyn kinase mediates signal transduction downstream of the PrP(C)-Abeta oligomer complex. These studies suggest that PrP(C) has a central role in AD pathogenesis and may provide a target for therapeutic intervention in AD.
