24456901|t|Synthesis of 5alpha-cholestan-6-one derivatives and their inhibitory activities of NO production in activated microglia: discovery of a novel neuroinflammation inhibitor.
24456901|a|Glial activation-mediated neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the process of several neuroinflammatory diseases including stroke, Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis and ischemia. Inhibition of microglial activation may ameliorate neuronal degeneration under the inflammatory conditions. In the present study, a number of 5alpha-cholestan-6-one derivatives were prepared and the anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds were evaluated in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells. Those derivatives were synthesized from readily available hyodeoxycholic acid (1). Among the tested compounds, several analogs (16-18, 25, 35, 38) exhibited potent inhibitory activities on nitric oxide production with no or weak cell toxicity. Compound 16 also significantly suppressed the expression of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, cyclooxygenase (COX-2) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia cells. In addition, compound 16 markedly reduced infarction volume in a focal ischemic mice model.
