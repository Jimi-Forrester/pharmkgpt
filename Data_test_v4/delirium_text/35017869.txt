35017869|t|Yoga for Caregiving Dyads Experiencing Chronic Pain: Protocol Development for Merging Yoga and Self-Management to Develop Skills Intervention.
35017869|a|CONTEXT: Caregivers often provide unpaid care for family members and friends with physical disabilities, often to the detriment of their health and well-being. Caregivers often experience pain, and individuals with physical disabilities also are likely to experience pain. Merging yoga and self-management to Develop Skills Study (MY-Skills) is an intervention that merges self-management education with yoga for dyads experiencing chronic pain. AIM: This article presents the yoga protocol for the MY-Skills intervention. METHODS: The yoga protocol was revised based on feedback from six caregiving dyads. The protocol focuses on reducing pain interference and supporting the caregiving dyad. RESULTS: The final yoga protocol incorporated the following elements: Centering and mantra, prana vidya and pranayama, asanas, mudra, and guided savasana/dhyana. CONCLUSION: The MY-Skills yoga protocol was modified by a yoga therapist with feedback from study participants. Revisions focused on the caregiving dyad, with specific attention to reducing pain interference.
