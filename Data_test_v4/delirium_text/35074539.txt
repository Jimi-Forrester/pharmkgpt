35074539|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a preoperative mobilization program for preventing perioperative complications and improving function in older adults with femoral neck fracture who delayed surgery. METHODS: In this controlled, quasi-experimental study, a total of 150 older patients with femoral neck fracture who waited more than 2 days before surgery were assigned to the Intervention group or control group. Perioperative complications were recorded. The change of physical function was assessed using the modified Barthel index (MBI). RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate (52.2% vs. 73.5%), pulmonary infection (6.0% vs. 16.9%), delirium (9.0% vs. 24.1%) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group. The intervention group had significantly better improvement in MBI score preoperatively and postoperatively. CONCLUSION: A preoperative mobilization program was shown to have advantages in preventing perioperative complications and promoting early functional recovery in older adults with delayed surgery of femoral neck fracture.
