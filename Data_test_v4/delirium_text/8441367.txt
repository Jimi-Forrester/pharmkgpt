8441367|t|Seizure benefit: grand mal or grand bene?
8441367|a|The adverse stresses and injuries associated with epileptic seizures are prevented routinely when programmed, controlled grand mal seizures are administered. According to the described concepts of clinical benefit, symptoms of brain illnesses that are without substantial neuronal deterioration, but that have a sense of neurotransmitter dysregulation, are candidates for mitigation by administration of programmed seizures. Such symptoms include delirium, dementia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, movement disorder, psychosis, and depression. Prior to recommending cortical excision for management of offtial complex epilepsy, a course of programmed seizures should be considered routinely.
