39422945|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurocognitive disorder. There is no cure for AD. Maintenance on intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has been reported to be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. NAD+ precursors that represent candidate targets include nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). Objective: This systematic review provides insights into the potential therapeutic value of NAD+ precursors including NMN and NR, for the treatment of AD using preclinical and clinical studies published in the last 5 years. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol was followed to systematically search the literature using two databases. Results: We found 3 studies that used NMN to treat AD in preclinical murine models. However, human clinical trials using NMN as a therapeutic intervention in AD was not available in the current literature. We also found 4 studies that investigated the potential benefits of NR for the treatment of AD in preclinical models. We also found 2 human clinical trials that showed marked improvements in plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers, and cognitive measures following supplementation with NR. Conclusions: Results of preclinical and clinical studies confirm the potential benefits of NAD+ precursors for the treatment of AD. However, further clinical studies are required to confirm the increasingly important value of NAD+ precursors as effective pharmacological interventions in the clinic.
