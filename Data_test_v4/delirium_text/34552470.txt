34552470|t|Glypican 4 Regulates Abeta Internalization in Neural Stem Cells Partly via Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1.
34552470|a|Neural stem cell (NSC) damage has been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Intracellular Abeta plays a vital role in NSC damage. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are potent mediators of Abeta enrichment in the brain. We hypothesized the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican 4 (Gpc4) regulates Abeta internalization by NSCs. We evaluated Gpc4 expression in NSCs from P0-P2 generations using immunofluorescence. Adenovirus and lentivirus were used to regulate Gpc4 expression in NSCs and APP/PS1 mice, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine the relationship between Gpc4, Abeta, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Intracellular Abeta concentrations were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. The role of Gpc4/LRP1 on toxic/physical Abeta-induced effects was evaluated using the JC-1 kit, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUPT nick end labeling, and western blotting. Gpc4 was stably expressed in NSCs, neurons, and astrocytes. Gpc4 was upregulated by Abeta in NSCs and regulated Abeta internalization. Gpc4 attenuation reduced Abeta uptake; Gpc4 overexpression increased Abeta uptake. Gpc4 regulated Abeta internalization through LRP1 and contributed to Abeta internalization and toxic/physical concentrations of Abeta-induced mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptosis, partly via LRP1. Therefore, Gpc4 is a key regulator of Abeta enrichment in NSCs. Inhibiting Gpc4 rescued the Abeta-induced toxic effect and attenuated the nontoxic Abeta enrichment into intracellular toxic concentrations. Gpc4 contributed to Abeta internalization and toxic/physical concentrations of Abeta-induced mitochondrial membrane potential damage and cell apoptosis, partly via LRP1. These findings suggest a potential role of Gpc4 in treating Alzheimer's disease at an early stage, by targeting NSCs.
