29614665|t|Blood Inflammatory Mediators and Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease: A Two Years Longitudinal Study.
29614665|a|Peripheral inflammatory processes are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to determine whether plasma inflammatory mediator levels at diagnosis are associated with cognitive decline through a 2-year follow-up in AD patients. Patients (n = 109, mean age 79.44 (6.82) years) were included at diagnosis with MMSE scores between 16 and 25, with C-reactive protein <10 mg/L, and without any acute or chronic inflammation status. Plasma IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CCL5 were measured using Luminex X-MAP technology at baseline, and after one year and two years of follow-up. The mean values of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CCL5 at diagnosis were 0.3, 1.94, 6.57, and 69,615.81 pg/mL, respectively. Mean cognitive decline in MMSE was 3.35 points. No correlation between plasmatic value of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, or CCL5 at diagnosis and cognitive decline during the two years of follow-up was found. Cognitive decline in AD does not appear to be predictable by the tested inflammatory mediators.
