17108687|a|The age distribution of the epsilon4 allelic form of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) was investigated in 630 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with onset age ranging from 35 to 90 years. Overall, mean age at onset in APOE epsilon4 allele bearers was significantly later than that in nonbearers. However, when stratified into early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset (LOAD) groups, mean age at onset in EOAD cases bearing APOE epsilon4 allele was later than that in those EOAD cases without epsilon4 allele, whereas in LOAD mean age at onset in cases bearing APOE epsilon4 allele was earlier than in those without epsilon4 allele. When analysed by decade, it was observed that 37% of the total number of APOE epsilon4 allele bearers, and 43% of total number of cases with APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype fell into the 60-69 years age class. Hence, APOE epsilon4 allele frequency, at 0.44, was highest in the 60-69 years age class, progressively decreasing either side of this age group. APOE epsilon4 allele therefore has its maximum impact between onset ages of between 60 and 70 years.
