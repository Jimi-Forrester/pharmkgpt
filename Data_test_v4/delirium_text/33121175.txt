33121175|t|Development of a Curcumin-Loaded Polymeric Microparticulate Oral Drug Delivery System for Colon Targeting by Quality-by-Design Approach.
33121175|a|The purpose of this study was to apply the quality-by-design (QbD) approach for the development of colon-targeted curcumin-loaded polymeric microparticles (Col-CUR-MPs). The proportion of the enterosoluble polymer (Eudragit  FS) in the polymeric matrix, curcumin concentration, and the concentration of the polymer mixture (Eudragit  FS-polycaprolactone) were identified as potential risk factors for the quality of the final product following risk assessment. The influence of these variables on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of Col-CUR-MPs was investigated. Therefore, a central composite face experimental design was used in order to determine the functional relationships between variables and product CQAs. The obtained regression model and contour plots were used to establish the design space. Finally, the model was validated by preparing two microparticulate formulations, one corresponding to the robust setpoint from within the design space and one outside the established design space, and calculating the percentage bias between the experimental and predicted values. The in vivo study, which was conducted on a fluorescein-loaded formulation that corresponded to the robust setpoint determined by QbD and that contained a mixture of polycaprolactone and Eudragit  FS (60:40, w/w), confirmed the colon-targeting qualities of this formulation.
