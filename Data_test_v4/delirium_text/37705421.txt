37705421|t|Design of aggregation-induced emission-active fluorogen-based nanoparticles for imaging and scavenging Alzheimer's beta-amyloid by photo-oxygenation.
37705421|a|Photo-oxygenation has emerged as an effective modality for scavenging Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. However, limitations of the current photo-oxidants, such as low Abeta-targeting and single functionality, hinder the scavenging of Abeta plaques via photo-oxygenation. Herein, based on an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active fluorogen (named TPMD), we designed AIE photo-oxidant nanoparticles (T-LD NPs) for Abeta imaging, inhibition, and disaggregation. The T-LD NPs were prepared by the assembly of hydrophobic TPMD with an Abeta-targeting peptide (LPPFD, L) conjugated amphiphilic polymer (DSPE-PEG). Such T-LD NPs could specifically label Abeta plaques for image-guided therapy. Under laser irradiation, T-LD NPs generated a plethora of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including 1O2,  OH, and O2 -, to oxygenate Abeta species, leading to the potent inhibition of Abeta fibrillization, and significant alleviation of Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity (36% to 10% at 20 mug mL-1). Notably, T-LD NPs could rapidly disaggregate mature Abeta fibrils into fractured beta-sheet rich aggregates via photo-oxygenation, resulting in alleviated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies revealed that the photo-activated T-LD NPs scavenged amyloid plaques in the transgenic C. elegans strain CL2006 and extended the lifespan by 4 days. Taken together, this multifunctional T-LD NP integrated Abeta-targeting, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and photo-oxygenation, provides a new strategy for the development of multifunctional AIE photo-oxidants for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
