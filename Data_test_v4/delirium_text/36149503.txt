36149503|a|The pollution of aquatic ecosystems due to the elevated concentration of a variety of contaminants, such as metal ions, poses a threat to humankind, as these ecosystems are in high relevance with human activities and survivability. The exposure in heavy metal ions is responsible for many severe chronic and pathogenic diseases and some types of cancer as well. Metal ions of the groups 11 (Cu, Ag, Au), 12 (Zn, Cd, Hg), 14 (Sn, Pb) and 15 (Sb, Bi) highly interfere with proteins leading to DNA damage and oxidative stress. While, the detection of these contaminants is mainly based on physicochemical analysis, the chemical determination, however, is deemed ineffective in some cases because of their complex nature. The development of biological models for the evaluation of the presence of metal ions is an attractive solution, which provides more insights regarding their effects. The present work critically reviews the reports published regarding the toxicity assessment of heavy metal ions through Allium cepa and Artemia salina assays. The in vivo toxicity of the agents is not only dose depended, but it is also strongly affected by their ligand type. However, there is no comprehensive study which compares the biological effect of chemical agents against Allium cepa and Artemia salina. Reports that include metal ions and complexes interaction with either Allium cepa or Artemia salina bio-indicators are included in the review.
