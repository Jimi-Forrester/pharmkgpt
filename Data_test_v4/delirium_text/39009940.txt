39009940|a|OBJECTIVE: In intensive care, delirium is frequent, prolongs the stay, increases health care costs, and worsens patient outcome. Several substances and medications as well as stress can impact the risk of delirium; however, assessment of previous exposure to psychotropic agents and stress by self-reports or third-party information is not always reliable. Hair analysis can be used to objectively assess medication and substance use (including chronic alcohol consumption), and allows for the determination of stress-related long-term changes in steroid hormones and endocannabinoids. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with acute brain injury admitted to the neurocritical care unit were included. Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to investigate psychoactive substances and medications, ethyl glucuronide, steroid hormones, and endocannabinoids in hair samples. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to reveal any associations with the occurrence of delirium. RESULTS: Of 50 consecutive patients, 21 (42%) were diagnosed with delirium. Detection of antipsychotics or antidepressants in hair was more frequent in patients with delirium (antidepressants: 43% vs. 14%, p = 0.040; antipsychotics: 29% vs. 0%, p = 0.021). These patients also displayed higher ethyl glucuronide levels (p = 0.049). Anandamide (AEA) concentrations were higher in patients with delirium (p = 0.005), whereas oleoylethanolamide (p = 0.045) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (p = 0.017) concentrations were lower in patients with delirium. Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed antidepressants and AEA/PEA to be independent relevant predictors of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Hair analysis provides crucial and otherwise unattainable information regarding chronic stress and the use of psychotropic substances and medications. Undisclosed antidepressant/antipsychotic use or intense chronic alcohol consumption is susceptible to treatment (continuation of medication or provision of low-dose benzodiazepines in case of alcohol). Chronic stress can be evaluated using stress markers and endocannabinoids in hair, potentially allowing for personalized delirium risk stratification and preventive measures.
