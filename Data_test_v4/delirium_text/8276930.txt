8276930|t|Accelerated forgetting in Alzheimer-type dementia.
8276930|a|Accelerated forgetting of name-face associations and grocery list items within the first hour postpresentation is demonstrated in 80 persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to 80 control subjects matched on age, education, and gender. Differences in forgetting which exceeded statistical regression effects remained, even when AD and control subjects were matched on rate of acquisition during the learning trials of name-face associations. Results are discussed in relation to the neuropathology of AD, organic amnestic disorders, and methodological factors concerning previous research on forgetting in persons with AD.
