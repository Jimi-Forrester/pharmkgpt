35997945|t|Alcohol and Psoriasis for the Dermatologist: Know, Screen, Intervene.
35997945|a|Psoriasis patients are at increased risk of harmful alcohol use and alcohol dependency with many deleterious effects. Increasing alcohol use is associated with worsening psoriasis severity, is a risk factor for poor response to systemic treatments and may impact on comorbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, cancer and liver disease. Harmful alcohol use and alcohol dependency can be defined by the updated ICD-11 coding system and screening can be completed using many tools including the Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-Opener (CAGE), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) questionnaires. Dermatologists may be able to complete brief interventions encouraging alcohol reduction in psoriasis patients. Psoriasis patients may respond to messages of gain with reduced psoriasis severity and loss with reduced cardiovascular risk. It is important for dermatologists to discuss alcohol with all psoriasis patients, to be aware of the impact of alcohol in psoriasis and to familiarise themselves with screening tools, brief intervention and local services available to patients who require specialist input for harmful alcohol use or alcohol dependency.
