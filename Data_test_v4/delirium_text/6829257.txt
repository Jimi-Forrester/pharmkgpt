6829257|t|[Problem of reactive delusion formation in slowly progressive schizophrenia].
6829257|a|Reactive delirious psychoses in 38 patients with slow-progressive schizophrenia (SPS) were studied. Three clinical variants of SPS were singled out while studying the course and psychopathological features of endogenic process with delirious reactions. Delirious reactions are known to form only in those patients with SPS whose endogenic process had favoured their manifestation in the presence of additional psychogenic factors. Personality traits connected with endogenic process (psychopathlike manifestations with hypoparanoic features, higher affective reactivity acquired) as well as readiness to acute delirium conditioned by endogenic process itself underlie the delirium appearance. The type, development, and outcome of psychogenic disorders are predetermined by schizophrenic process itself.
