38972731|a|BackgroundDementia is the leading cause of disability and imposes a significant burden on society. Previous studies have suggested an association between metabolites and cognitive decline. Although the metabolite composition differs between Western and Asian populations, studies targeting Asian populations remain scarce.MethodsThis cross-sectional study used data from a cohort survey of community-dwelling older adults aged >= 60 years living in Miyagi, Japan, conducted by Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization between 2013 and 2016. Forty-three metabolite variables quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used as explanatory variables. Dependent variable was the presence of cognitive decline (<= 23 points), assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Principal component (PC) analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of metabolite variables, followed by logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cognitive decline.ResultsA total of 2,940 participants were included (men: 49.0%, mean age: 67.6 years). Among them, 1.9% showed cognitive decline. The first 12 PC components (PC1-PC12) accounted for 71.7% of the total variance. Multivariate analysis showed that PC1, which mainly represented essential amino acids, was associated with lower odds of cognitive decline (OR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98). PC2, which mainly included ketone bodies, was associated with cognitive decline (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.11-1.51). PC3, which included amino acids, was associated with lower odds of cognitive decline (OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99).ConclusionAmino acids are protectively associated with cognitive decline, whereas ketone metabolites are associated with higher odds of cognitive decline.
