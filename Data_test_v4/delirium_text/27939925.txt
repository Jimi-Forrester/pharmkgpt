27939925|t|A candidate regulatory variant at the TREM gene cluster associates with decreased Alzheimer's disease risk and increased TREML1 and TREM2 brain gene expression.
27939925|a|INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that common Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated variants within the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid (TREM) gene cluster influence disease through gene expression. METHODS: Expression microarrays on temporal cortex and cerebellum from ~400 neuropathologically diagnosed subjects and two independent RNAseq replication cohorts were used for expression quantitative trait locus analysis. RESULTS: A variant within a DNase hypersensitive site 5' of TREM2, rs9357347-C, associates with reduced AD risk and increased TREML1 and TREM2 levels (uncorrected P = 6.3 x 10-3 and 4.6 x 10-2, respectively). Meta-analysis on expression quantitative trait locus results from three independent data sets (n = 1006) confirmed these associations (uncorrected P = 3.4 x 10-2 and 3.5 x 10-3, Bonferroni-corrected P = 6.7 x 10-2 and 7.1 x 10-3, respectively). DISCUSSION: Our findings point to rs9357347 as a functional regulatory variant that contributes to a protective effect observed at the TREM locus in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project genome-wide association study meta-analysis and suggest concomitant increase in TREML1 and TREM2 brain levels as a potential mechanism for protection from AD.
