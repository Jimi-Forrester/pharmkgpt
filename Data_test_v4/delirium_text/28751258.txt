28751258|a|The deposition of misfolded beta-sheet enriched amyloid protein is a shared feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies demonstrated the existence of conformationally diverse strains as a common property for multiple amyloidogenic proteins including alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn). alpha-Syn is misfolded and aggregated in a group of neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as alpha-Synucleinopathies, which include Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy body, multiple system atrophy and also a subset of Alzheimer's disease patients with concomitant PD-like Lewy bodies and neurites. While sharing the same pathological protein, different alpha-Synucleinopathies demonstrate distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes, which could result from the existence of diverse pathological alpha-Syn strains in patients. In this review, we summarized the characteristics of different alpha-Synucleinopathies and alpha-Syn strains generated with recombinant alpha-Syn monomers. We also make predictions of alpha-Syn strains that could potentially exist in patients based on the knowledge from other amyloid proteins and the clinical and pathological features of different alpha-Synucleinopathies.
