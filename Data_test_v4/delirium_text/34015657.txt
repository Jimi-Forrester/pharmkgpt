34015657|a|BACKGROUND: The number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing worldwide. This offers ample opportunities for mobile health (mHealth) apps, for example to support them in performing daily activities or monitoring their health status. However, how to design these apps taking into consideration ADRD related barriers remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: To provide a synthesis of mHealth usability barriers of older adults with ADRD and design suggestions to enhance user-friendliness of mHealth apps. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of mHealth studies focused on older adults with ADRD and: (1) usability barriers experienced, and/or (2) implementation or design suggestions. PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched. Clinical and grey literature on ADRD diminishments was explored to identify potential barriers to using mHealth. Detected usability barriers caused by ADRD impairments were mapped onto the MOLD-US framework through validation, calibration, and adaption. MOLD-US was initially developed to provide an overview of barriers influencing mHealth usability for the general aging population. RESULTS: Title and abstract of 792 unique citations were scanned of which 69 were included for full text review. Fifteen studies matched inclusion criteria. In total 42 barriers were identified to influence mobile health use for older adults with ADRD. Twenty design suggestions were extracted from the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The identified usability barriers were classified in five categories: cognition, perception, physical ability, frame of mind, and speech- and language. In addition, the design suggestions were categorized as evidence- or expert-based. Evidence-based design suggestions include showing limited information, repeating instructions multiple times and breaking instructions into simple steps given one at a time. This research provides a first step for further collaboration between ADRD experts and designers to support the development of effective mHealth apps with high user-friendliness.
