38014595|t|Proteome and immune responses of extracellular vesicles derived from macrophages infected with the periodontal pathogen Tannerella forsythia.
38014595|a|Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque and is associated with systemic inflammatory diseases. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from host cells and pathogens carry a variety of biological molecules and are of interest for their role in disease progression and as diagnostic markers. In the present study, we analysed the proteome and inflammatory response of EVs derived from macrophages infected with Tannerella forsythia, a periodontal pathogen. The EVs isolated from the cell conditioned medium of T. forsythia-infected macrophages were divided into two distinct vesicles, macrophage-derived EVs and T. forsythia-derived OMVs, by size exclusion chromatography combined with density gradient ultracentrifugation. Proteome analysis showed that in T. forsythia infection, macrophage-derived EVs were enriched with pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators associated with periodontitis progression. T. forsythia-derived OMVs harboured several known virulence factors, including BspA, sialidase, GroEL and various bacterial lipoproteins. T. forsythia-derived OMVs induced pro-inflammatory responses via TLR2 activation. In addition, we demonstrated that T. forsythia actively released OMVs when T. forsythia encountered macrophage-derived soluble molecules. Taken together, our results provide insight into the characterisation of EVs derived from cells infected with a periodontal pathogen.
