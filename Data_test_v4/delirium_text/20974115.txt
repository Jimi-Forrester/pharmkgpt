20974115|a|Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin (ULMWH) are heparin's derivatives, having various pharmacological effects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of ULMWH on amyloid beta peptide (Abeta25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat cortical neurons, and LMWH was employed as a positive control agent. The neurons were incubated with Abeta25-35 (35muM), Abeta25-35 plus ULMWH (2, 10, 50 mug/ml) or LMWH (10 mug/ml) for 24h. The cell viability was assessed by MTT and LDH release. FITC-Annexin V/PI double staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, TUNEL and Western blotting for bcl-2 and caspase-3 were employed to measure the neuron apoptosis. Furthermore, the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was measured by a fluorescent dye, Fura-2/AM. The results showed that ULMWH significantly increased cell viability and the protein expression levels of bcl-2 and decreased the LDH release, the number of apoptotic cells, the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) and the protein expression levels of caspase-3 in cortical neurons, suggesting that ULMWH can obviously reduce Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxic effects and might act as a potential agent for Alzheimer's disease.
