36838977|t|Chemical Profiling, Bioactive Properties, and Anticancer and Antimicrobial Potential of Juglans regia L. Leaves.
36838977|a|The aim of this study was to assess the biological potential of the polyphenolic fraction isolated from J. regia leaves, collected in the Subcarpathian region (Poland). The phenolic profile was determined using the UPLC-PDA-MS/MS method. Biological activity was determined by evaluating the antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Prior to this study, the purified polyphenolic fraction was not been tested in this regard. A total of 40 phenolic compounds (104.28 mg/g dw) were identified, with quercetin 3-O-glucoside and quercetin pentosides dominating. The preparation was characterized by a high ability to chelate iron ions and capture O2 - and OH  radicals (reaching IC50 values of 388.61, 67.78 and 193.29 microg/mL, respectively). As for the anticancer activity, among the six tested cell lines, the preparation reduced the viability of the DLD-1, Caco-2, and MCF-7 lines the most, while in the antibacterial activity, among the seven tested strains, the highest susceptibility has been demonstrated against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus. Depending on the needs, such a preparation can be widely used in the design of functional food and/or the cosmetics industry.
