1556394|t|Alzheimer's disease. Special care units in long-term care facilities.
1556394|a|Special units in long-term care facilities have been developed to respond to the needs of residents with Alzheimer's disease. The underlying assumption is that specific environmental and programmatic modifications will enhance the quality of life for Alzheimer's patient's. Descriptive accounts of special care units for Alzheimer's disease reveal wide variations in philosophies, therapeutic approaches, protocols for behavioral management, staff education, and environmental design. Facilities with special care units used fewer chemical and physical restraints, reported a decrease in the number of problem behaviors, and indicated that environmental changes provided a personal sense of freedom and dignity. Nurses should be aware of the potential benefits of special units and advocate for their use if behavioral problems are severe enough to require the use of chemical or physical restraints.
