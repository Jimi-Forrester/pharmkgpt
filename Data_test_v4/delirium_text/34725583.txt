34725583|a|Different polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene affect the COMT enzyme activity. The COMT enzyme plays a major role in the pathophysiology of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review article aims to discuss what recent research has discovered about the association of COMT genotype polymorphism with neurological and psychiatric disorders and the scope for the knowledge to be applied for advancement in therapeutics. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases and found 1656 articles. We included observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses in the English language published between 2019 and 2021. We screened the articles based on the title and the abstract and found 26 relevant articles. Diseases or conditions studied primarily were schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, substance use, and depression. This article highlights how genetics influences the susceptibility of an individual to neurological and psychiatric diseases and the variations in the specific symptoms of those diseases. The review showed that the variability in individual response to therapeutic interventions stems from the gene level. This knowledge can contribute towards the dawn of a new era of personalized medicine.
