35130623|a|The DeltaN6 truncation is the main posttranslational modification of beta-microglobulin (betaM) found in dialysis-related amyloid. Investigation of the interaction of wild-type (WT) betaM with N-terminally truncated variants is therefore of medical relevance. However, it is unclear which residues among the six residues at the N-terminus are crucial to the interactions and the modulation of amyloid fibril propagation of betaM. We herein analyzed homo- and heterotypic seeding of amyloid fibrils of WT human betaM and its N-terminally-truncated variants DeltaN1 to DeltaN6, lacking up to six residues at the N-terminus. At acidic pH 2.5, we produced amyloid fibrils from recombinant, WT betaM and its six truncated variants, and found that DeltaN6 betaM fibrils exhibit a significantly lower conformational stability than WT betaM fibrils. Importantly, under more physiological conditions (pH 6.2), we assembled amyloid fibrils only from recombinant, DeltaN4, DeltaN5, and DeltaN6 betaM but not from WT betaM and its three truncated variants DeltaN1 to DeltaN3. Notably, the removal of the six, five or four residues at the N-terminus leads to enhanced fibril formation, and homo- and heterotypic seeding of DeltaN6 fibrils strongly promotes amyloid fibril formation of WT betaM and its six truncated variants, including at more physiological pH 6.2. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the residues 4 to 6 at the N-terminus particularly modulate amyloid fibril propagation of betaM and the interactions of WT betaM with N-terminally truncated variants, potentially indicating the direct relevance to the involvement of the protein's aggregation in dialysis-related amyloidosis.
