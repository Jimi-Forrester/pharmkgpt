39796211|t|Resting-State EEG Alpha Rhythms Are Related to CSF Tau Biomarkers in Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.
39796211|a|Patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (ADMCI) typically show abnormally high delta (<4 Hz) and low alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms measured from resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) activity. Here, we hypothesized that the abnormalities in rsEEG activity may be greater in ADMCI patients than in those with MCI not due to AD (noADMCI). Furthermore, they may be associated with the diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-tau biomarkers in ADMCI patients. An international database provided clinical-demographic-rsEEG datasets for cognitively unimpaired older (Healthy; N = 45), ADMCI (N = 70), and noADMCI (N = 45) participants. The rsEEG rhythms spanned individual delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. The eLORETA freeware estimated cortical rsEEG sources. Posterior rsEEG alpha source activities were reduced in the ADMCI group compared not only to the Healthy group but also to the noADMCI group (p < 0.001). Negative associations between the CSF phospho-tau and total tau levels and posterior rsEEG alpha source activities were observed in the ADMCI group (p < 0.001), whereas those with CSF amyloid beta 42 levels were marginal. These results suggest that neurophysiological brain neural oscillatory synchronization mechanisms regulating cortical arousal and vigilance through rsEEG alpha rhythms are mainly affected by brain tauopathy in ADMCI patients.
