30131658|a|A major issue in organ transplantation is the development of a protocol that can preserve organs under optimal conditions. Damage to organs is commonly a consequence of flow deprivation and oxygen starvation following the restoration of blood flow and reoxygenation. This is known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI): a complex multifactorial process that causes cell damage. While the oxygen deprivation due to ischemia depletes cell energy, subsequent tissue oxygenation due to reperfusion induces many cascades, from reactive oxygen species production to apoptosis initiation. Autophagy has also been identified in the pathogenesis of IRI, although such alterations and their subsequent functional significance are controversial. Moreover, proteasome activation may be a relevant pathophysiological mechanism. Different strategies have been adopted to limit IRI damage, including the supplementation of commercial preservation media with pharmacological agents or additives. In this review, we focus on novel strategies related to the ubiquitin proteasome system and oxidative stress inhibition, which have been used to minimize damage in liver transplantation.
