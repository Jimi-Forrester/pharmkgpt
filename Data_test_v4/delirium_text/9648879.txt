9648879|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) forms the second most common pathological subgroup of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The present study compares the levels of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA bases in cortical brain areas from patients with DLB with levels in matched control tissues. Overall, there was a trend for protein carbonyl levels to be increased in all areas, but a significant difference was found only in the parietal and temporal lobes. No differences were observed in the levels of lipid peroxidation. Measurement of products of damage to DNA bases showed increased levels of thymine glycol, 8-hydroxyguanine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, and xanthine. Xanthine levels were increased in the DLB group in the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, indicating that peroxynitrite or other deaminating species may be involved. The finding of increased protein carbonyls and increased DNA base products in cortical regions from DLB patients indicates that oxidative stress may play a role in DLB.
