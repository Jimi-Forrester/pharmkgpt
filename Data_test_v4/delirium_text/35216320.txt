35216320|t|Modified Industrial Three-Dimensional Polylactic Acid Scaffold Cell Chip Promotes the Proliferation and Differentiation of Human Neural Stem Cells.
35216320|a|In this study, we fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold using industrial polylactic acid (PLA), which promoted the proliferation and differentiation of human neural stem cells. An industrial PLA 3D scaffold (IPTS) cell chip with a square-shaped pattern was fabricated via computer-aided design and printed using a fused deposition modeling technique. To improve cell adhesion and cell differentiation, we coated the IPTS cell chip with gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs), nerve growth factor (NGF) protein, an NGF peptide fragment, and sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein. The proliferation of F3.Olig2 neural stem cells was increased in the IPTS cell chips coated with Au-NPs and NGF peptide fragments when compared with that of the cells cultured on non-coated IPTS cell chips. Cells cultured on the IPTS-SHH cell chip also showed high expression of motor neuron cell-specific markers, such as HB9 and TUJ-1. Therefore, we suggest that the newly engineered industrial PLA scaffold is an innovative tool for cell proliferation and motor neuron differentiation.
