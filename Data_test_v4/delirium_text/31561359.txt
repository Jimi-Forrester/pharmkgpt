31561359|t|Regular Exercise Enhances Cognitive Function and Intracephalic GLUT Expression in Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice.
31561359|a|Brain energy metabolic impairment is one of the main features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is considered an underlying factor involved in cognitive impairment. Therefore, brain energy metabolism may represent a new therapeutic target for AD medical interventions. Among nutrients providing energy, glucose, the primary energy source, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier freely without specific glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are essential for the maintenance of cerebral energy metabolism homeostasis. Several converging lines of evidence suggest that GLUT1 deficiency in mice leads to synapse reduction and dysregulation coupled with mitochondrial morphological changes. In this study, the results revealed that regular exercise (RE) decreased the expression of amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau by western blot, and enhanced the spatial learning and exploration ability of AD model mice as assessed by Morris water maze test. Mitochondrial cristae and edges were clear and intact, ATP production in the brain raised, the number of synapses increased, and GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression levels improved in the central nervous system (CNS) in AD model mice after RE. Changes in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression at the protein level after RE are an important part of energy metabolic adaptation in AD model mice. Learning and memory improvement are highly associated with mitochondrial integrity and sufficient synapses in the CNS. This research suggests that increased brain energy metabolism attributed to RE exhibits promising therapeutic potential for AD.
