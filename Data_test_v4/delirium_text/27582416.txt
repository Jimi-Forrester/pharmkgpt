27582416|a|AIM: The present study investigated the efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in combination with galantamine hydrobromide-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (GH-SLNs) in intracerebroventricular (ICV)-isoproterenol-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS & METHODS: BM-MSCs were harvested by dissecting femur and tibia of 8-10-week-old Wistar rats. 1 x 10(6) cells were administered intravenously once in ICV-isoproterenol-induced rats followed by GH-SLNs (5 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: ICV-isoproterenol resulted in significant memory deficit. The results demonstrated rapid regain of memory in isoproterenol-induced amnesic rats, following single intravenous administration of BM-MSCs and oral administration of GH-SLNs for 21 days. The combination of BM-MSCs and GH-SLNs produced a more pronounced protective effect, therefore, could be explored for the management of Alzheimer's disease.
