21777674|a|In this review focus is on structural imaging in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pre-states, particularly cognitively normal (CN) persons at future dementia risk. Findings in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are described here only for comparison with CN. Cited literature evidence and commentary address issues of structural imaging alterations in CN that precede MCI and AD, regional patterns of such alterations, and the time relationship between structural imaging alterations and the appearance of symptoms of AD, issues relevant to the conduct of future AD prevention trials. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Imaging Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative disease.
