32281305|a|INTRODUCTION: Prospective studies on a potential association of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha ) levels, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, with dementia are limited. METHODS: Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess potential associations of urinary 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels with all-cause, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) incidence in 5853 older adults from a German, population-based cohort. RESULTS: Over 14 years of follow-up, 365 all-cause dementia cases including 127 VD and 109 AD cases were diagnosed. Participants in the top compared to the bottom 8-iso-PGF2alpha tertile had a 45% increased risk of all-cause dementia incidence (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.45 [1.12 to 1.88]). Interaction with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) z4/z4 genotype was detected (P = .02). Furthermore, continuously modeled, logarithmized 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels were statistically significantly associated with all-cause dementia and AD incidence. DISCUSSION: Oxidative stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of dementia. Individuals with increased 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels and the APOE z4/z4 genotype showed a considerably increased dementia risk.
