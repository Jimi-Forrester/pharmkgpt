33241681|t|A Glycosylated Prodrug to Attenuate Neuroinflammation and Improve Cognitive Deficits in Alzheimer's Disease Transgenic Mice.
33241681|a|We report a prodrug, Glu-DAPPD, to overcome the shortcomings of an anti-neuroinflammatory molecule, N,N'-diacetyl-p-phenylenediamine (DAPPD), in biological applicability for potential therapeutic applications. We suspect that Glu-DAPPD can release DAPPD through endogenous enzymatic bioconversion. Consequently, Glu-DAPPD exhibits in vivo efficacies in alleviating neuroinflammation, reducing amyloid-beta aggregate accumulation, and improving cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice. Our studies demonstrate that the prodrug approach is suitable and effective toward developing drug candidates against neurodegeneration.
