38397800|t|A Combinational Therapy for Preventing and Delaying the Onset of Alzheimer's Disease: A Focus on Probiotic and Vitamin Co-Supplementation.
38397800|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a complex etiology, and effective interventions to prevent or delay its onset remain a global health challenge. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the potential role of probiotic and vitamin supplementation as complementary strategies for Alzheimer's disease prevention. This review paper explores the current scientific literature on the use of probiotics and vitamins, particularly vitamin A, D, E, K, and B-complex vitamins, in the context of Alzheimer's disease prevention and management. We delve into the mechanisms through which probiotics may modulate gut-brain interactions and neuroinflammation while vitamins play crucial roles in neuronal health and cognitive function. The paper also examines the collective impact of this combinational therapy on reducing the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut dysbiosis. By providing a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence and potential mechanisms, this review aims to shed light on the promise of probiotic and vitamin co-supplementation as a multifaceted approach to combat Alzheimer's disease, offering insights into possible avenues for future research and clinical application.
