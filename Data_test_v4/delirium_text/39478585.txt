39478585|a|BACKGROUND: Microglia, a type of resident immune cells within the central nervous system, have been implicated in ethanol-activated neuronal death of the stress regulatory proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-producing beta-endorphin peptides in the hypothalamus in a postnatal rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. We determined if microglial extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are involved in the ethanol-induced neuronal death of the beta-endorphin neuron via secreting elevated levels of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), a key regulator of neuroinflammation. METHODS: We employed an in vitro model, consisting of primary culture of hypothalamic microglia prepared from postnatal day 2 (PND2) rat hypothalami and treated with or without 50 mM ethanol for 24 h, and an in vivo animal model in which microglia were obtained from hypothalami of PND6 rats fed daily with 2.5 mg/kg ethanol or control milk formula for five days prior to use. Exosomes were extracted and characterized with nanosight tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy and western blot. Chemokine multiplex immunoassay and ELISA were used for quantitative estimation of MCP1 level. Neurotoxic ability of exosome was tested using primary cultures of beta-endorphin neurons and employing nucleosome assay and immunocytochemistry. Elevated plus maze, open field and restraint tests were used to assess anxiety-related behaviors. RESULTS: Ethanol elevated MCP1 levels in microglial exosomes both in vitro and in vivo models. Ethanol-activated microglial exosomes when introduced into primary cultures of beta-endorphin neurons, increased cellular levels of MCP1 and the chemokine receptor CCR2 related signaling molecules including inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic genes as well as apoptotic death of beta-endorphin neurons. These effects of microglial exosomes on beta-endorphin neurons were suppressed by a CCR2 antagonist RS504393. Furthermore, RS504393 when injected in postnatal rats prior to feeding with ethanol it reduced alcohol-induced beta-endorphin neuronal death in the hypothalamus. RS504393 also suppressed corticosterone response to stress and anxiety-like behaviors in postnatally alcohol-fed rats during adult period. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that alcohol exposures during the developmental period elevates MCP1 levels in microglial exosomes that promote MCP1/CCR2 signaling to increase the apoptosis of beta-endorphin neurons and resulting in hormonal and behavioral stress responses.
