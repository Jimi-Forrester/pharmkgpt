37931808|a|Patients with chronic pain often have cognitive impairment; this is especially true in elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. This was addressed in the present study by investigating the effect of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice subjected to spared-nerve injury (SNI). The Von Frey test was performed to determine the mechanical threshold of mouse hind limbs after SNI. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory. Doublecortin-positive (DCX+), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/neuronal nuclei (NeuN)+, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)+ neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. CCL2 and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) protein levels in the mouse hippocampus were analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that APP/PS1 mice with chronic neuropathic pain induced by SNI had significant learning and memory impairment. This was accompanied by increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression and decreases in the number of DCX+, BrdU+, and BrdU+/NeuN+ neurons. These results suggest that chronic neuropathic pain is associated with cognitive impairment, which may be caused by CCL2/CCR2 signaling-mediated inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, therapeutic strategies that alleviate neuropathic pain can potentially slow cognitive decline in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
