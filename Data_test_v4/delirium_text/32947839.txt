32947839|a|Anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) may be associated with detrimental effects on mobility and physical independence in older adults. We evaluated the incidence of major mobility disability (MMD), persistent major mobility disability (PMMD), and injurious falls among participants within the Lifestyle Interventions for Elders (LIFE) trial according to varied anticholinergic burden levels. Participants aged 70-89 years were randomized to a physical activity (PA) or successful aging (SA) intervention and evaluated by ACB medication use as a summed score of a previously developed ACB scale. Confounders included demographic characteristics, physical function, cognitive function, and fall history. Average participant follow-up was 2.6 years and included outcome assessment for MMD, PMMD, and injurious falls every six months. Adjusted proportional hazards models evaluated the independent effects of ACB scores as well as interaction effects with the intervention. Of the 1635 participants, 986 (60%) used >=1 anticholinergic medication. Compared to those with no burden, participants with an ACB score of 1 demonstrated increased MMD (HR = 1.42 [1.13-1.78]), PMMD (HR = 1.53 [1.12-2.09]), and injurious falls (HR = 1.60 [1.10-2.32]). Results similar in magnitude were observed for all other ACB levels versus the no burden group. Stepwise dose-response comparisons between ACB groupings did not demonstrate significant differences in outcomes. Stratification by PA or SA interventions demonstrated few differences from the combined overall trial results. Compared to those not taking anticholinergic medications, participants taking anticholinergic medications generally demonstrated increased risk of MMD, PMMD, and injurious falls. Total anticholinergic burden was not associated with a stepwise dose-response relationship in mobility disability and may lack sensitivity to capture varied responses.
