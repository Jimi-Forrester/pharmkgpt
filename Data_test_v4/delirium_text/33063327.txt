33063327|t|A Genetic Code Expansion-Derived Molecular Beacon for the Detection of Intracellular Amyloid-beta Peptide Generation.
33063327|a|Polypeptides generated from proteolytic processing of protein precursors, or proteolytic proteoforms, play an important role in diverse biological functions and diseases. However, their often-small size and intricate post-translational biogenesis preclude the use of simple genetic tagging in their cellular studies. Herein, we develop a labeling strategy for this class of proteoforms, based on residue-specific genetic code expansion labeling with a molecular beacon design. We demonstrate the utility of such a design by creating a molecular beacon reporter to detect amyloid-beta peptides, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as they are produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) along the endocytic pathway of living cells.
