36102595|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) disparities exist in the rapidly growing and extremely heterogeneous Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NH/PI) ageing populations in the United States. Limited community-clinical resources supporting culturally competent and timely diagnosis exacerbate barriers to existing care services in these populations. Community-based participatory research or community-engaged research are proven community-academic research approaches that can support the development and implementation of community-focused programmes to maximise community benefit. The NYU Center for the Study of Asian American Health engaged our national and local community partners to gain a deeper understanding of AD/ADRD in this diverse and growing population, to develop a strategic community-engaged research agenda to understand, address and reduce AD/ADRD disparities among Asian American and NH/PI communities. Findings from an initial scoping review identified significant research gaps. We conducted a series of key informant interviews (n = 11) and a modified Delphi survey (n = 14) with Asian American and NH/PI community leaders and older adult service providers followed by a facilitated group discussion of survey findings to gain consensus on key priority research areas identified in the literature and to determine culturally and contextually appropriate approaches to support AD/ADRD prevention, early identification and treatment in Asian American and NH/PI communities. Future research and health education should focus on raising Asian American and NH/PI basic individual- and community-level awareness about AD/ADRD and leveraging existing community assets to integrate effective engagement strategies to access AD/ADRD services within the healthcare system.
