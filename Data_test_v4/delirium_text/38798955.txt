38798955|t|Advancing stroke therapy: the potential of MOF-based nanozymes in biomedical applications.
38798955|a|In this study, we explored the growing use of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based Nanozymes in biomedical research, with a specific emphasis on their applications in stroke therapy. We have discussed the complex nature of stroke pathophysiology, highlighting the crucial role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and acknowledging the limitations of natural enzymes in addressing these challenges. We have also discussed the role of nanozymes, particularly those based on MOFs, their structural similarities to natural enzymes, and their potential to improve reactivity in various biomedical applications. The categorization of MOF nanozymes based on enzyme-mimicking activities is discussed, and their applications in stroke therapy are explored. We have reported the potential of MOF in treating stroke by regulating ROS levels, alleviation inflammation, and reducing neuron apoptosis. Additionally, we have addressed the challenges in developing efficient antioxidant nanozyme systems for stroke treatment. The review concludes with the promise of addressing these challenges and highlights the promising future of MOF nanozymes in diverse medical applications, particularly in the field of stroke treatment.
