30072874|a|The impairment of cerebral glucose utilization is an early and predictive biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is likely to contribute to memory and cognition disorders during the progression of the pathology. Yet, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these metabolic alterations remain poorly understood. Here we studied the glucose metabolism of supragranular pyramidal cells at an early presymptomatic developmental stage in non-transgenic (non-Tg) and 3xTg-AD mice, a mouse model of AD replicating numerous hallmarks of the disease. We performed both intracellular glucose imaging with a genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based glucose biosensor and transcriptomic profiling of key molecular elements of glucose metabolism with single-cell multiplex RT-PCR (scRT-mPCR). We found that juvenile pyramidal cells exhibit active glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway at rest that are respectively enhanced and impaired in 3xTg-AD mice without alteration of neuronal glucose uptake or transcriptional modification. Given the importance of glucose metabolism for neuronal survival, these early alterations could initiate or at least contribute to the later neuronal dysfunction of pyramidal cells in AD.
