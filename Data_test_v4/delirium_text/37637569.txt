37637569|t|A Decade of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Following Orthopedic Wrist Surgery: A Case Report and a Literature Review.
37637569|a|Every day, people of all ages in the United States break bones, with traumatic injury being the most common way, and wrist injury being in the top five most common areas in which bones break. Traumatic fractures are managed with either surgical or nonsurgical approaches. The surgical approach utilizes ortho procedures such as internal fixation and reduction, while the nonsurgical approach consists of procedures like RICE, ace bandage, and so on. However, in rare cases, patients are left with a peculiar constellation of symptoms, which cause edema, pain, skin changes, and loss of function at the trauma site. This occurrence is termed complex regional pain syndrome. Here, we present the case of a 55-year-old female patient who suffered a traumatic wrist injury. The trauma was fixed by pinning ORIF orthopedic surgery, and the patient developed manifestations of complex regional pain syndrome around 10 days postoperatively. In this case report, we describe the variation and complexity of symptoms in the patient over the course of a decade after the original injury. The case report explains the pain management therapies that reduced the patient's symptoms and highlights the ones that were ineffective. We have included some less frequently used yet effective treatments and shed light on how this disease affected the patient's overall well-being.
