28673761|t|Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention As Treatment for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in a Centenarian: Choosing Carefully.
28673761|a|We report on a 105-year-old woman presenting with inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She was managed with primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery with a single bare-metal stent. There were no acute complications, although she experienced delirium and functional decline requiring prolonged hospital admission. She was discharged home and celebrated her 106th birthday. This report describes the oldest centenarian with STEMI found in the literature and managed with PCI. No data exist on how best to manage centenarians with STEMI. Patient comorbidities, functional status, and values should be considered in managing such patients.
