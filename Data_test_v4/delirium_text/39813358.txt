39813358|t|Transient interactions between the fuzzy coat and the cross-beta core of brain-derived Abeta42 filaments.
39813358|a|Several human disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by the aberrant formation of amyloid fibrils. In many cases, the amyloid core is flanked by disordered regions, known as fuzzy coat. The structural properties of fuzzy coats, and their interactions with their environments, however, have not been fully described to date. Here, we generate conformational ensembles of two brain-derived amyloid filaments of Abeta42, corresponding respectively to the familial and sporadic forms of AD. Our approach, called metadynamic electron microscopy metainference (MEMMI), provides a characterization of the transient interactions between the fuzzy coat and the cross-beta core of the filaments. These calculations indicate that the familial AD filaments are less soluble than the sporadic AD filaments, and that the fuzzy coat contributes to solubilizing both types of filament. These results illustrate how the metainference approach can help analyze cryo-EM maps for the characterization of the properties of amyloid fibrils.
