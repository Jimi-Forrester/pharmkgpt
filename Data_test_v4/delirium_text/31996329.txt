31996329|a|Since the discovery of L-dopa in the middle of the 20th century (1960s), there is not any neuroprotective therapy available although significant development has been made in the treatment of symptomatic Parkinson's disease (PD). Neurological disorders like PD can be modelled in animals so as to recapitulates most of the symptoms seen in PD patients. In aging population, PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, even though significant outcomes have been achieved in PD research yet it still is a mystery to solve the treatments for PD. In the last two decades, PD models have provided enhanced precision into the understanding of the process of PD disease, its etiology, pathology, and molecular mechanisms behind it. Furthermore, at the same time as cellular models have helped to recognize specific events, animal models, both toxic and genetic, have replicated almost all of the hallmarks of PD and are very helpful for testing and finding new strategies for neuroprotection. Recently, in both classical and newer models, major advances have been done in the modelling of supplementary PD features have come into the light. In this review, we have try to provide an updated summary of the characteristics of these models related to in vitro and in vivo models, animal models for PD, stem cell model for PD, newer 3D model as well as the strengths and limitations of these most popular PD models.
