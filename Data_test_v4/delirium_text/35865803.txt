35865803|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged as one of the most acute public health diseases of the present time, which increases with the population ageing. This study aimed to evaluate the hypoglycaemic activity of Ulva lactuca oligosaccharide (ULO) under ageing-related diabetes conditions in an animal model. The results demonstrated that ULO can promote hypoglycaemia and delay senescence as mediated via GLP-1/GLP-1R pathway to mobilize the intercommunication between the brain and gut. In addition, twenty-six different metabolites and eight different bacteria were screened in the brain and the gut, respectively. A network relationship displayed that all-trans-retinoic acid has positive relationships with Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, suggesting that plays a potential key role in maintaining the hypoglycaemic and anti-ageing activities of ULO. Based on these findings, ULO might be an efficient therapy for restoring blood glucose metabolism and delaying brain senescence in elderly T2D patients.
