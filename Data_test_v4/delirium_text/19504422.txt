19504422|a|Until today the pharmacological therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still limited to symptomatic temporary improvement or stabilization of cognitive performance and activities of daily living, and the reduction of neuropsychiatric symptoms of the disease. Available symptomatic treatment options are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACh-I) donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and the partial N-Methyl-D-Aspartat-(NMDA)-antagonist memantine. Further substances with symptomatic targets, especially selective acetylcholine and histamine receptors, are currently under development. Numerous of disease-modifying substances mainly targeting components of the amyloidogenic pathway of AD are presently studied in different phases of preclinical and clinical trials. Against earlier expectations which derived from promising preclinical immunization studies the breakthrough of disease-modification in AD is not in sight yet. Aim of this review is to summarize established pharmacological treatment options and the stage of development of upcoming symptomatic and disease-modifying substances of AD.
