12067591|t|Apolipoproteins and aging: emerging mechanisms.
12067591|a|One of the goals of modern medicine is to foster successful aging. In order to age successfully, one must accomplish two things: first, survive; and second, survive with good health and a sharp mind. In this discussion of apolipoproteins and aging, the focus will be on apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein with three common isoforms, which has a large impact on longevity and successful aging. One variant of apoE (E4) is associated with increased risk for heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, some of the potential mechanisms for the observed effects of apoE on aging will be discussed.
