37395391|a|OBJECTIVE: The interaction of ethnicity, progression of cognitive impairment, and neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease remains unclear. We investigated the stability in cognitive status classification (cognitively normal [CN] and mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) of 209 participants (124 Hispanics/Latinos and 85 European Americans). METHODS: Biomarkers (structural MRI and amyloid PET scans) were compared between Hispanic/Latino and European American individuals who presented a change in cognitive diagnosis during the second or third follow-up and those who remained stable over time. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in biomarkers between ethnic groups in any of the diagnostic categories. The frequency of CN and MCI participants who were progressors (progressed to a more severe cognitive diagnosis at follow-up) and non-progressors (either stable through follow-ups or unstable [progressed but later reverted to a diagnosis of CN]) did not significantly differ across ethnic groups. Progressors had greater atrophy in the hippocampus (HP) and entorhinal cortex (ERC) at baseline compared to unstable non-progressors (reverters) for both ethnic groups, and more significant ERC atrophy was observed among progressors of the Hispanic/Latino group. For European Americans diagnosed with MCI, there were 60% more progressors than reverters (reverted from MCI to CN), while among Hispanics/Latinos with MCI, there were 7% more reverters than progressors. Binomial logistic regressions predicting progression, including brain biomarkers, MMSE, and ethnicity, demonstrated that only MMSE was a predictor for CN participants at baseline. However, for MCI participants at baseline, HP atrophy, ERC atrophy, and MMSE predicted progression.
