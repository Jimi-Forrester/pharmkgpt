18216395|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are the major constituent of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease. Accurate and precise quantitation of these peptides in biological fluids is a critical component of Alzheimer's disease research. The current most established assay for analysis of Abeta peptides in preclinical research is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which, although sensitive and of proven utility, is a multistep, labor-intensive assay that is difficult to automate completely. To overcome these limitations, the authors have developed and optimized simple, sensitive, homogeneous 384-well assays for Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 using AlphaScreen technology. The assays are capable of detecting Abeta peptides at concentrations <2 pg/mL and, using a final assay volume of 20 microL, routinely generate Z' values >0.85. The AlphaScreen format has the following key advantages: substantially less hands-on time to run, easier to automate, higher throughput, and less expensive to run than the traditional ELISA. The results presented here show that AlphaScreen technology permits robust, efficient, and cost-effective quantitation of Abeta peptides.
