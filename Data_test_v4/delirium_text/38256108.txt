38256108|t|State-Dependent Blockade of Dorsal Root Ganglion Voltage-Gated Na+ Channels by Anethole.
38256108|a|Anethole is a phenolic compound synthesized by many aromatic plants. Anethole is a substance that humans can safely consume and has been studied for years as a biologically active molecule to treat a variety of conditions, including nerve damage, gastritis, inflammation, and nociception. Anethole is thought to carry out its biological activities through direct interaction with ion channels. Anethole is beneficial for neurodegenerative Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Nevertheless, nothing has been investigated regarding the effects of anethole on voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs), which are major players in neuronal function. We used cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from neonatal rats as a source of natively expressed VGSCs for electrophysiological studies using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Our data show that anethole interacts directly with VGSCs. Anethole quickly blocks and unblocks (when removed) voltage-activated Na+ currents in this preparation in a fully reversible manner. Anethole's binding affinity to these channels increases when the inactive states of these channels are populated, similar to lidocaine's effect on the same channels. Our data show that anethole inhibits neuronal activity by blocking VGSCs in a state-dependent manner. These findings relate to the putative anesthetic activity attributable to anethole, in addition to its potential benefit in neurodegenerative diseases.
