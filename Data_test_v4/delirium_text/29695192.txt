29695192|a|Acetylcholinesterase is a critical enzyme that regulates neurotransmission by catalyzing the breakdown of neurotransmitter acetylcholine in synapses of the nervous system. It is an important target for therapeutic drugs that treat Alzheimer's disease. Since, the degree of flexibility of the side chains of the residues in the active-site gorge of Acetylcholinesterase is diverse it results in different bound ligand conformations. The side-chain conformations of Ser293, Tyr341, Leu76, and Val73 are flexible, while the side-chain conformations of Tyr72, Tyr 124, Ser125, Phe295, and Arg296 appear to be fixed. In this study, multi-conformation dynamic pharmacophore models from the donepezyl-binding pocket based on highly populated structures chosen from molecular dynamics simulations were used for screening compounds that can properly bind acetylcholinesterase. Based on these structures, three pharmacophore models were generated. Consequently, 14 hits were retrieved as final candidates by utilizing virtual screening of ZINC database and molecular docking.
