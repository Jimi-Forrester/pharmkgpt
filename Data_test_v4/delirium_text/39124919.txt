39124919|a|The main feature of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, is the network of complex and not fully recognized neuronal pathways and targets involved in their onset and progression. The therapeutic treatment, at present mainly symptomatic, could benefit from a polypharmacological approach based on the development of a single molecular entity designed to simultaneously modulate different validated biological targets. This strategy is principally based on molecular hybridization, obtained by linking or merging different chemical moieties acting with synergistic and/or complementary mechanisms. The coumarin core, widely found in nature, endowed with a recognized broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, large synthetic accessibility and favourable pharmacokinetic properties, appears as a valuable, privileged scaffold to be properly modified in order to obtain compounds able to engage different selected targets. The scientific literature has long been interested in the multifaceted profiles of coumarin derivatives, and in this review, a survey of the most important results of the last four years, on both natural and synthetic coumarin-based compounds, regarding the development of anti-Alzheimer's compounds is reported.
