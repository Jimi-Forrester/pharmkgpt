35626328|t|An Ensemble of CNN Models for Parkinson's Disease Detection Using DaTscan Images.
35626328|a|Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive central nervous system disorder that is caused due to the neural degeneration mainly in the substantia nigra in the brain. It is responsible for the decline of various motor functions due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Tremors in hands is usually the initial symptom, followed by rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, and impaired balance. Proper diagnosis and preventive treatment can help patients improve their quality of life. We have proposed an ensemble of Deep Learning (DL) models to predict Parkinson's using DaTscan images. Initially, we have used four DL models, namely, VGG16, ResNet50, Inception-V3, and Xception, to classify Parkinson's disease. In the next stage, we have applied a Fuzzy Fusion logic-based ensemble approach to enhance the overall result of the classification model. The proposed model is assessed on a publicly available database provided by the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). The achieved recognition accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score from the proposed model are 98.45%, 98.84%, 98.84%, 97.67%, and 98.84%, respectively which are higher than the individual model. We have also developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based software tool for public use that instantly detects all classes using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with reasonable accuracy. The proposed method offers better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods in detecting PD. The developed GUI-based software tool can play a significant role in detecting the disease in real-time.
