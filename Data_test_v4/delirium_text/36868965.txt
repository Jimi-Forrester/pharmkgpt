36868965|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a concern after anaesthesia and surgery, but preoperative discussion of neurocognitive risks with older patients rarely occurs. Anecdotal experiences of POCD are common in the popular media and may inform patient perspectives. However, the degree of alignment between lay and scientific perspectives on POCD is not known. METHODS: We performed inductive qualitative thematic analysis on website user comments publicly submitted under an article entitled, 'The hidden long-term risks of surgery: "It gives people's brains a hard time"', published by the UK-based news source The Guardian in April 2022. RESULTS: We analysed 84 comments from 67 unique users. Themes that emerged from user comments included the importance of functional impact ('Couldn't work ... even reading was a struggle'), attribution to a range of causes but particularly the use of general, rather than consciousness-preserving, anaesthesia techniques ('side effects aren't fully understood'), and inadequate preparation and response by healthcare providers ('I would have benefited by being warned'). CONCLUSIONS: There is misalignment between professional and lay understandings of POCD. Lay people emphasise subjective and functional impact of symptoms, and express beliefs about the role of anaesthetics in causing POCD. Some patients and caregivers affected by POCD report feeling abandoned by medical providers. In 2018, new nomenclature for postoperative neurocognitive disorders was published, which better aligns with lay perspectives by including subjective complaints and functional decline. Further studies based on newer definitions and public messaging may improve concordance between different understandings of this postoperative syndrome.
