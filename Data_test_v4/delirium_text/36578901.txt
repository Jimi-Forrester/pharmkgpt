36578901|a|Background: Depression and elevated blood biomarkers of inflammation are common in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an indicator of peripheral inflammation and has been proved to be associated with both ACS and depression. Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate the possible association between NLR at admission and post-PCI depressive symptoms at 1 month. Patients and Methods: A total of 224 patients with ACS who underwent PCI for the first time were recruited and completed 1-month follow-up. The 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) was used to measure depressive symptoms at 1 month after PCI. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between different NLR levels and post-PCI depressive symptoms. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the value of NLR for predicting post-PCI depressive symptoms and to determine its critical value. Results: Of the 224 enrolled patients, 52 (23.2%) patients were diagnosed with depressive symptoms at 1 month after PCI. Patients with depressive symptoms showed significantly higher level of NLR at admission than patients without depressive symptoms (4.33 (3.26, 7.01) vs 2.57 (1.72, 3.91), P < 0.001). The proportion of depressive symptoms in post-PCI patients increases progressively along with NLR quartile. In the results of multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of post-PCI depressive symptoms was 12.028 (95% CI, 2.642-54.752) for the lowest quartile of NLR compared with the highest quartile. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting post-PCI depressive symptoms was 0.716 (95% CI, 0.641-0.791; P < 0.001), and the optimal cutoff of NLR levels was 3.235 (sensitivity: 76.9%, specificity: 66.9%). Conclusion: Higher NLR levels at admission were associated with post-PCI depressive symptoms at 1 month, suggesting that NLR might be useful inflammatory markers to predict post-PCI depressive symptoms at 1 month.
