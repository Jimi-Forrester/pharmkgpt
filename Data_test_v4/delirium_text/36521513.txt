36521513|a|Obstructive sleep apnea is highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, brainstem centers controlling respiration have received little attention in AD research, and mechanisms behind respiratory dysfunction in AD are not understood. The nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) is an important brainstem center for respiratory control and chemoreflex function. Alterations of nTS integrity, like those shown in AD patients, likely affect neuronal processing and adequate control of breathing. We used the streptozotocin-induced rat model of AD (STZ-AD) to analyze cellular changes in the nTS that corroborate previously documented respiratory dysfunction. We used 2 common dosages of STZ (2 and 3 mg/kg STZ) for model induction and evaluated the early impact on cell populations in the nTS. The hippocampus served as control region to identify site-specific effects of STZ. There was significant atrophy in the caudal nTS of the 3 mg/kg STZ-AD group only, an area known to integrate chemoafferent information. Also, the hippocampus had significant atrophy with the highest STZ dosage tested. Both STZ-AD groups showed respiratory dysfunction along with multiple indices for astroglial and microglial activation. These changes were primarily located in the caudal and intermediate nTS. While there was no change of astrocytes in the hippocampus, microglial activation was accompanied by a reduction in synaptic density. Together, our data demonstrate that STZ-AD induces site-specific effects on all major cell types, primarily in the caudal/intermediate nTS. Both STZ dosages used in this study produced a similar outcome and can be used for future studies examining the initial symptoms of STZ-AD.
