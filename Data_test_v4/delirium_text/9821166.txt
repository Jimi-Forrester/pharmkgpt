9821166|t|The presence of FAC1 protein in Hirano bodies.
9821166|a|We have previously reported that the FAC1 protein is contained in hippocampal structures that resemble Hirano bodies. Hirano bodies are cytoplasmic inclusions containing actin filaments that are numerous in the hippocampus of many Alzheimer's disease patients. FAC1 is a developmentally regulated protein that is localized to the cytoplasm of neurons during development and is predominately a nuclear protein in adult brain. In hippocampal sections from non-demented adults. Alzheimer's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies patients. Hirano bodies were immunolabelled with antibodies to the FAC1 protein. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated the presence of actin in FAC1 labelled Hirano bodies, and ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of a lattice structure within FAC1 labelled Hirano bodies. Numerous FAC1 immunoreactive swollen dendrites were also present in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies patients. Within any one case the total number of FAC1 positive swollen dendrites correlated with the total number of Hirano bodies, suggesting an association between the two structures. Thus, FAC1 protein is contained in Hirano bodies and swollen dendrites in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.
