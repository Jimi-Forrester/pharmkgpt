37302030|t|The Lipid Invasion Model: Growing Evidence for This New Explanation of Alzheimer's Disease.
37302030|a|The Lipid Invasion Model (LIM) is a new hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) which argues that AD is a result of external lipid invasion to the brain, following damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The LIM provides a comprehensive explanation of the observed neuropathologies associated with the disease, including the lipid irregularities first described by Alois Alzheimer himself, and accounts for the wide range of risk factors now identified with AD, all of which are also associated with damage to the BBB. This article summarizes the main arguments of the LIM, and new evidence and arguments in support of it. The LIM incorporates and extends the amyloid hypothesis, the current main explanation of the disease, but argues that the greatest cause of late-onset AD is not amyloid-beta (Abeta) but bad cholesterol and free fatty acids, let into the brain by a damaged BBB. It suggests that the focus on Abeta is the reason why we have made so little progress in treating the disease in the last 30 years. As well as offering new perspectives for further research into the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD, based on protecting and repairing the BBB, the LIM provides potential new insights into other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.
