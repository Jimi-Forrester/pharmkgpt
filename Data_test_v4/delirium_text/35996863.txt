35996863|a|If physical functions are impaired in patients with cancer owing to the progression of the disease and the treatment processes, their activities of daily living (ADLs) decline; thus, the quality of life is impacted. Elderly patients with cancer constitute a group with diverse basic physical, mental and social skill levels owing to aging. Given that there are potential risks of frailty and sarcopenia, their physical functions and ADL are prone to decline. Furthermore, there are many cases in which patients live alone, isolated from the society or face social problems. Therefore, in the treatment of elderly patients with cancer, geriatric assessment is used to comprehensively assess comorbidity, physical functions and psychophysiological/social/environmental situations and a system that provides supportive care is required. As part of this process, cancer rehabilitation plays an important role in prevention of complications, functional recovery and maintenance and improvement of physical functions and ADL until the time of palliative care. To provide rehabilitation, utmost attention must be paid to issues unique to elderly people, such as frailty, sarcopenia, dementia, delirium, pain management, depression and undernutrition/dysphagia.
