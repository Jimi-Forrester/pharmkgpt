39942477|t|The Legal and Ethical Dimensions of Hospital Visitation Bans in the COVID-19 Era.
39942477|a|Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic compelled countries worldwide to implement stringent visitation restrictions across hospitals, nursing homes, and long-term care facilities to mitigate viral transmission. While initially justified by the uncertainty surrounding the virus, these restrictions often lasted well beyond the acute stage of the pandemic, leading to substantial psychological and physical harm, particularly for older adults. This study assesses the effects of these controls and offers strategies to balance public health priorities with patients' rights and psychological well-being during public health crises. Methods: An integrative review and comparative analysis of legislative measures and the psychological effects of visitation restrictions was undertaken. International and national visitation regulations and case studies were reviewed, and ethical frameworks were considered. Results: Our findings indicate that prolonged isolation due to extended visitation restrictions led to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and delirium among patients, creating ethical dilemmas for healthcare providers. Legal responses to this challenge varied globally. International human rights organizations called for policies bridging public health priorities with patients' rights to family and caregiver support. Some U.S. states enacted proactive legislation to strengthen family visitation rights, while other jurisdictions lack these visitation protections. Conclusions: Prolonged visitation restrictions during the pandemic show the need for legislation integrating public health protections with in-person family and caregiver support. The ethical imperatives of limiting the psychological harm caused by healthcare isolation and the legislative solutions to protect public health and the psychological well-being of patients during health crises are discussed.
