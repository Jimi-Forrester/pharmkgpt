35462916|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and serious neurodegenerative disease in the elderly; however, the treatment of AD is still lacking of rational drugs. In this paper, the active constituents and targets of the self-developed Chinese medicine Formula 9002A in the treatment of AD were investigated from three aspects: pharmacodynamics based on cell and animal experiments, network pharmacology analysis, and pharmacokinetic analysis. A total of 124 compounds were screened in Formula 9002A, and four constituents including salidroside, gastrodin, niacinamide, and umbelliferone were screened as potential active components for the treatment of AD by network pharmacology. Among them, salidroside and gastrodin showed higher relevance with AD targets, such as ESR1 and AR. The pharmacokinetic study showed that they could be absorbed and identified in plasma; the half-life and mean residence times of salidroside and gastrodin in plasma were nearly increased 2-fold by the administration of Formula 9002A compared with those by the administration of a monomer, indicating the extended action time of active compounds in vivo. Formula 9002A exerted the efficacy in the treatment of AD mainly by regulating APP, GSK3beta, ESR1, and AR targets based on the anti-beta-amyloid protein deposition, anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis pathways. Two genes enriched in Alzheimer's disease pathway, APP and GSK3beta, were further validated. The experiments also demonstrated that Formula 9002A could downregulate APP and GSK3beta protein expression in the model mice brain and improved their cognitive ability. In summary, Formula 9002A has the characteristics of multiple targets and multiple pathways in the treatment of AD, and salidroside and gastrodin might be the main active constituents, which could provide a foundation for further research and application.
