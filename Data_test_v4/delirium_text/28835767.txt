28835767|a|Passiflora cincinnata Masters is a Brazilian native species of passionflower. This genus is known in the American continent folk medicine for its diuretic and analgesic properties. Nevertheless, few studies investigated possible biological effects of P. cincinnata extracts. Further, evidence of antioxidant actions encourages the investigation of possible neuroprotective effects in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates the effect of the P. cincinnata ethanolic extract (PAS) on mice submitted to a progressive model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by reserpine. Male (6-month-old) mice received reserpine (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), every other day, for 40 days, with or without a concomitant treatment with daily injections of PAS (25 mg/kg, i.p.). Catalepsy, open field, oral movements, and plus-maze discriminative avoidance evaluations were performed across treatment, and immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase was conducted at the end. The results showed that PAS treatment delayed the onset of motor impairments and prevented the occurrence of increased catalepsy behavior in the premotor phase. However, PAS administration did not modify reserpine-induced cognitive impairments. Moreover, PAS prevented the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) induced by reserpine. Taken together, our results suggested that PAS exerted a neuroprotective effect in a progressive model of PD.
