38651012|a|The glymphatic system, a macroscopic waste clearance system in the brain, is crucial for maintaining neural health. It facilitates the exchange of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid, aiding the clearance of soluble proteins and metabolites and distributing essential nutrients and signaling molecules. Emerging evidence suggests a link between glymphatic dysfunction and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation and propagation of misfolded or mutant proteins, a process in which the glymphatic system is likely involved. Impaired glymphatic clearance could lead to the buildup of these toxic proteins, contributing to neurodegeneration. Understanding the glymphatic system's role in these disorders could provide insights into their pathophysiology and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies. Pharmacological enhancement of glymphatic clearance could reduce the burden of toxic proteins and slow disease progression. Neuroimaging techniques, particularly MRI-based methods, have emerged as promising tools for studying the glymphatic system in vivo. These techniques allow for the visualization of glymphatic flow, providing insights into its function under healthy and pathological conditions. This narrative review highlights current MRI-based methodologies, such as motion-sensitizing pulsed field gradient (PFG) based methods, as well as dynamic gadolinium-based and glucose-enhanced methodologies currently used in the study of neurodegenerative disorders.
