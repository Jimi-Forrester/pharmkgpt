35129804|t|Protective Effects of Ginkgolide on a Cellular Model of Alzheimer's Disease via Suppression of the NF-kappaB Signaling Pathway.
35129804|a|SYNOPSIS: NF-kappaB signaling has been reported to play a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of ginkgolide on cell viability in an AD cellular model involving an APP/PS1 double gene-transfected HEK293 cell line (APP/PS1-HEK293) and further explore the mechanisms of action related to NF-kappaB signaling. The optimal time point and concentration of ginkgolide for cell proliferation were screened using a cell counting kit-8 assay. Based on the results, an in vitro study was performed by co-culture of APP/PS1-HEK293 with different dosages of ginkgolide, followed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the levels of supernatant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, as well as western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect intracellular protein and mRNA expression of NF-kappaB p65, IkappaBa, Bcl-2, and Bax. APP/PS1-HEK293 cells exhibited the highest cell viability at a concentration of 100 microg/ml after 48 h of treatment with ginkgolide. The supernatant levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in the high-dosage ginkgolide-treated groups were lower than those in the control group. Compared with the control group, there were decreased intracellular protein and mRNA expression of NF-kappaB p65 and Bax, but increased protein and mRNA expression of IkappaBa in both high-dosage and low-dosage groups. Ginkgolide may enhance cell viability, indicative of its neuroprotective effects on AD, at least partially via suppression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway involving anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation mechanisms. Therefore, ginkgolide might be a promising therapeutic agent against AD.
