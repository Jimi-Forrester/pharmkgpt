30274285|t|Visualization of Tau-Tubulin Interaction in a Living Cell Using Bifluorescence Complementation Technique.
30274285|a|Tau is a neuron-specific microtubule-binding protein that stabilizes microtubules. It is generally thought that highly phosphorylated tau dissociates from microtubules and becomes insoluble aggregates, leading to neuronal degeneration. Due to the implication of tau aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, great efforts have been made to identify the tau aggregation process. However, tau interaction with tubulin during the aggregation process remains largely unknown. To scrutinize the tau-tubulin interaction, we generated a cell model that enables visualization of the tau-tubulin interaction in a living cell using the Bifluorescence Complementation (BiFC) Technique. Upon diverse chemical stimulation that induced tau pathology, tau-tubulin BiFC cells showed significantly increased levels of BiFC fluorescence, indicating that tau aggregates together with tubulin. Our results suggest that tubulin should be considered as a key component in the tau aggregation process.
