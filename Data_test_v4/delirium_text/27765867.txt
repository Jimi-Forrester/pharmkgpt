27765867|a|OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the risk of cognitive decline associated with paroxetine use in elderly nursing home patients with depression. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the 2007 to 2010 Medicare Part D claims and minimum data set (MDS) data involving new users of paroxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The primary outcome was MDS Cognition Scale. The repeated-measures mixed model was used to examine the effect of paroxetine on cognition after controlling for other factors. RESULTS: The baseline MDS Cognition Scale measures for paroxetine (n = 63) and other SSRI users (n =1018) were 2.02 (+-1.85) and 2.50 (+-2.39), respectively. The repeated-measures mixed model did not find statistically significant difference in cognition with the use of paroxetine (beta = 0.02, 95% CI: -0.16 to 0.21]) when compared to other SSRIs. CONCLUSIONS: There was no differential effect of paroxetine on cognition when compared to other SSRIs.
