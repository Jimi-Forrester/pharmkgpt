31053872|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic linked with diverse diseases of the nervous system, including depression. A few studies suggested a connection between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and reduced depressive symptoms, although underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we investigated the antidepressant effect and the mechanisms of action of the angiotensin receptor 1 blocker (ARB) losartan in an experiential model of diabetes-associated depression. METHODS: Experimental diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in adult male Wistar rats. After 5 weeks of diabetes, rats were treated for 2 weeks with a non-pressor oral dose of losartan (20 mg/kg). In protocol 1, cerebrovascular perfusion and glial activation were evaluated by single-photon emission computed tomography-MRI and immunohistochemistry. In protocol 2, behaviour studies were performed (forced swim test and open field test). Hippocampal proinflammatory response and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling were also assessed. RESULTS: Here, we show that diabetic rats exhibit depression-like behaviour, which can be therapeutically reversed by losartan. This action of losartan occurs via changes in diabetes-induced neuroinflammatory responses rather than altered cerebral perfusion. We also show that as a part of its protective effect losartan restores BDNF production in astrocytes and facilitates BDNF-tropomyosin receptor kinase B-cAMP response element-binding protein signalling in the diabetic brain. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We identified a novel effect of losartan in the nervous system that may be implemented to alleviate symptoms of diabetes-associated depression. These findings explore a new therapeutic horizon for ARBs as possible antidepressants and suggest that BDNF could be a target of future drug development in diabetes-induced complications.
