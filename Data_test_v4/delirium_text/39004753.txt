39004753|a|BACKGROUND: Episodes of recurrent or severe hypoglycemia can occur in patients with diabetes mellitus, insulinoma, neonatal hypoglycemia, and medication errors. However, little is known about the short-term and long-term effects of repeated episodes of acute severe hypoglycemia on the brain, particularly in relation to hippocampal damage and cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: Thirty-six wistar rats were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The rats were exposed to severe hypoglycemia, and assessments were conducted to evaluate oxidative stress in brain tissue, cognitive function using the Morris water maze test, as well as histopathology and immunohistochemistry studies. The clinical and histopathological evaluations were conducted in the short-term and long-term. RESULTS: The mortality rate attributed to hypoglycemia was 34%, occurring either during hypoglycemia or within 24 h after induction. Out of the 14 rats monitored for 7 to 90 days following severe/recurrent hypoglycemia, all exhibited clinical symptoms, which mostly resolved within three days after the last hypoglycemic episode, except for three rats. Despite the decrease in catalase activity in the brain, the total antioxidant capacity following severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased. The histopathology findings revealed that the severity of the hippocampal damage was higher compared to the brain cortex 90 days after hypoglycemia. Memory impairments with neuron loss particularly pronounced in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus were observed in the rats with severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, there was an increase in reactive astrocytes indicated by GFAP immunoreactivity in the brain cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia can lead to high mortality rates, memory impairments, and severe histopathological changes in the brain. While many histopathological and clinical changes improved after three months, it seems that the vulnerability of the hippocampus and the development of sustained changes in the hippocampus were greater and more severe compared to the brain cortex following severe and recurrent hypoglycemia. Furthermore, it does not appear that oxidative stress plays a central role in neuronal damage following severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Further research is necessary to assess the consequences of repeated hypoglycemic episodes on sustained damage across various brain regions.
