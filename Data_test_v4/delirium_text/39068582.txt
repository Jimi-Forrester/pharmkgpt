39068582|t|Changes in Psychological Condition during Cancer Chemotherapy.
39068582|a|BACKGROUND: Psychological disorders are prevalent in cancer patients and their psychological condition can change during cancer chemotherapy and influence their quality of life and adherence to treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The enrolled patients were assessed at the start of chemotherapy, after the first course of chemotherapy, and more than 2 months later by themselves and by medical staff using four different items. The cancer patients assessed themselves using the Numerical Rating Scale for Anxiety (NRS-A), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale for anxiety (HADS-A) and subscale for depression (HADS-D), and patient-reported outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). A pharmacist or nurse assessed them using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. RESULTS: This study enrolled 109 patients. The anxiety and depression scores were highest at the start of chemotherapy and declined thereafter. Patients with history of psychiatric disorders or taking psychotropic drugs had higher scores than those without such disorders or treatments (P < 0.05), and tended to maintain these high scores at the second and third HADS-A and -D assessments. The scores assessed by the patients themselves were higher than those assessed by the medical staff. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric distress scores were highest when commencing chemotherapy and declined thereafter. The patients with history of psychiatric disorders or taking psychotropic drugs kept higher scores of HADS-A and -D during whole chemotherapy courses.
