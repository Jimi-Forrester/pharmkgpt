38788524|t|Relationship between cortical brain atrophy, delirium, and long-term cognitive decline in older surgical patients.
38788524|a|In older patients, delirium after surgery is associated with long-term cognitive decline (LTCD). The neural substrates of this association are unclear. Neurodegenerative changes associated with dementia are possible contributors. We investigated the relationship between brain atrophy rates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive aging signature regions from magnetic resonance imaging before and one year after surgery, LTCD assessed by the general cognitive performance (GCP) score over 6 years post-operatively, and delirium in 117 elective surgery patients without dementia (mean age = 76). The annual change in cortical thickness was 0.2(1.7) % (AD-signature p = 0.09) and 0.4(1.7) % (aging-signature p = 0.01). Greater atrophy was associated with LTCD (AD-signature: beta(CI) = 0.24(0.06-0.42) points of GCP/mm of cortical thickness; p < 0.01, aging-signature: beta(CI) = 0.55(0.07-1.03); p = 0.03). Atrophy rates were not significantly different between participants with and without delirium. We found an interaction with delirium severity in the association between atrophy and LTCD (AD-signature: beta(CI) = 0.04(0.00-0.08), p = 0.04; aging-signature: beta(CI) = 0.08(0.03-0.12), p < 0.01). The rate of cortical atrophy and severity of delirium are independent, synergistic factors determining postoperative cognitive decline in the elderly.
