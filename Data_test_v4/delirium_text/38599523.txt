38599523|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very disabling long-term disease that requires continuous regular care. A cost-effective and sustainable means of such care may be physical activity or exercise delivered at home or through telerehabilitation. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of home-based or telerehabilitation exercise in people with AD. METHOD: PubMED, Embase, Web of Science (WoS), PEDro, and CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials until January 2024. The data extracted include the characteristics of the participants, the interventions used for both experimental and the control groups, the baseline, post-intervention and follow-up mean and standard deviation values on the outcomes assessed and the findings of the included studies. Cochrane risks of bias assessment tool and PEDro scale were used to assess the risks of bias and methodological quality of the studies. The results were analyzed using narrative and quantitative syntheses. RESULT: Eleven articles from nine studies (n=550) were included in the study. The results showed that, only global cognitive function (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.19 to 1.25, p=0.007), neuropsychiatric symptom (MD = -5.28, 95% CI =-6.22 to -4.34, p<0.0001) and ADL (SMD =3.12, 95% CI =0.11 to 6.13, p=0.04) improved significantly higher in the experimental group post-intervention. At follow-up, the significant difference was maintained only in neuropsychiatric symptoms (MD =-6.20, 95% CI =-7.17 to -5.23, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: There is a low evidence on the effects of home-based physical activity or exercise on global cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms and ADL.
