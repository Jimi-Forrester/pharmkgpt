39780754|t|Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake.
39780754|a|INTRODUCTION: This consensus statement gives practical advice for the safe management of patients with harmful alcohol intake undergoing elective and emergency surgery. The wide spectrum of alcohol-related organ dysfunction observed in this cohort of patients may have a profound impact on care, and the additional effects of alcohol withdrawal may further exacerbate postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A working party was assembled based on clinical and/or academic expertise in the area. Recommendations were formulated using a modified Delphi process. An initial list of recommendations was produced following targeted literature reviews for all relevant phases of patient care throughout the peri-operative pathway. These recommendations were distributed among the authors who rated each as 'include', 'exclude'; or 'revise'. Recommendations with >= 75% inclusion decision were included. RESULTS: The working party produced a list of 10 key peri-operative management recommendations. These include recommendations on how to screen effectively for excessive alcohol usage in the surgical population. To achieve this, a validated point-of-care tool is used with additional weighting provided by considering surgical urgency. This is combined with the use of scoring systems to facilitate decisions regarding peri-operative care including postoperative location. This document also provides clear explanation of the physiological and pharmacological issues relating to alcohol excess, highlighting the direct effects of alcohol and its secondary effects on organ systems. DISCUSSION: This consensus statement offers strategies and solutions to minimise the impact of harmful alcohol intake on the safe conduct of anaesthesia.
