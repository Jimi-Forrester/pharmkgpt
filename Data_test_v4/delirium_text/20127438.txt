20127438|t|[Development and implementation of the dementia guideline of the German Society of General Practice and Family Medicine].
20127438|a|The evidence-based guidelines of the German Society of General Practice and Family Medicine (DEGAM) are developed according to an established ten-stage plan. The twelfth guideline addresses the health care problem of dementia. The main focus is the sensitive handling of patients and their relatives, e.g., although the goal is an early diagnosis, patients should also be protected against overdiagnosis. The treatment of Alzheimer's disease consists of three components: optimal care and supervision, the use of nondrug therapy, and a critically weighed administration of medications. The successful implementation of the guideline should be achieved by a multimodal strategy. This includes not only the direct integration of general practitioners (GPs) in developing the guideline, but also a comprehensive publication offensive, a wide use in training sessions including new media, the testing of complex implementation approaches in trials, and the use of the guideline in the context of GP contracts.
