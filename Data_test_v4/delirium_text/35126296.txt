35126296|t|Trigeminal Nerve White Matter Fiber Abnormalities in Primary Trigeminal Neuralgia: A Diffusion Spectrum Imaging Study.
35126296|a|OBJECTIVE: Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) was used to quantitatively study the changes in the trigeminal cistern segment in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and to further explore the value of acquiring DSI data from patients with TN. METHODS: To achieve high-resolution fiber tracking, 60 patients with TN and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were scanned with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DSI. The patients and the members of the control group were compared within and between groups. The correlations between quantitative parameters of DSI and the visual analog scale (VAS), and symptom duration and responsible vessel types were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with unaffected side of patients in the TN group, the affected side showed significantly decreased quantitative anisotropy (QA) (p < 0.001), fractional anisotropy (FA) (p = 0.001), and general FA (GFA) (p < 0.001). The unaffected side exhibited significantly decreased QA (p + 0.001), FA (p = 0.001), and GFA (p < 0.001) and significantly increased axial diffusivity (AD) (p = 0.036) compared with the affected side of patients in the TN group and the average values of HCs. There were significantly decreased QA (p = 0.046) and FA (p = 0.008) between the unaffected side of patients and the average values of HCs. GFA can evidently distinguish arteries, veins, and features of unaffected side in TN patients. CONCLUSION: Using high-resolution fiber tracking technology, DSI can provide quantitative information that can be used to detect the integrity of trigeminal white matter in patients with TN and can improve the understanding of the disease mechanism.
