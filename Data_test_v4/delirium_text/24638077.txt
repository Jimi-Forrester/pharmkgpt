24638077|a|BACKGROUND: The significance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neuroinflammation in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of soluble APP (sAPP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) isoforms, proinflammatory cytokines, and biomarkers of neuronal damage in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in relation to brain biopsy Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau (HPtau) findings. METHODS: The study population comprised 102 patients with possible NPH with cortical brain biopsies, ventricular and lumbar CSF samples, and DNA available. The final clinical diagnoses were: 53 iNPH (91% shunt-responders), 26 AD (10 mixed iNPH+AD), and 23 others. Biopsy samples were immunostained against Abeta and HPtau. CSF levels of AD-related biomarkers (Abeta42, p-tau, total tau), non-AD-related Abeta isoforms (Abeta38, Abeta40), sAPP isoforms (sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta), proinflammatory cytokines (several interleukins (IL), interferon-gamma, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and biomarkers of neuronal damage (neurofilament light and myelin basic protein) were measured. All patients were genotyped for APOE. RESULTS: Lumbar CSF levels of sAPPalpha were lower (p<0.05) in patients with shunt-responsive iNPH compared to non-iNPH patients. sAPPbeta showed a similar trend (p = 0.06). CSF sAPP isoform levels showed no association to Abeta or HPtau in the brain biopsy. Quantified Abeta load in the brain biopsy showed a negative correlation with CSF levels of Abeta42 in ventricular (r = -0.295, p = 0.003) and lumbar (r = -0.356, p = 0.01) samples, while the levels of Abeta38 and Abeta40 showed no correlation. CSF levels of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of neuronal damage did not associate to the brain biopsy findings, diagnosis, or shunt response. Higher lumbar/ventricular CSF IL-8 ratios (p<0.001) were seen in lumbar samples collected after ventriculostomy compared to the samples collected before the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The role of sAPP isoforms in iNPH seems to be independent from the amyloid cascade. No neuroinflammatory background was observed in iNPH or AD.
