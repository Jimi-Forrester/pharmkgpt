1573291|t|Acute confusional states in patients with advanced cancer.
1573291|a|In 39 of 100 cancer patients admitted to the palliative care unit at Edmonton General Hospital, the presence of delirium during their last week of life required psychotropic drug treatment. In 10 of the 39 delirious patients, symptoms were only controllable by sedation; this was achieved in 9 patients by a continuous subcutaneous infusion of midazolam. Although haloperidol is considered to be the treatment of choice in agitated, delirious cancer patients, our data suggest that palliative care treatment strategies for these patients may be different.
