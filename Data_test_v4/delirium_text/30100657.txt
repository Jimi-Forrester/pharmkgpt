30100657|t|Clozapine-induced bicytopenia: An unusual side effect.
30100657|a|Agranulocytosis is a rare documented side effect of clozapine which can be associated with grave consequences. When it is associated with other blood dyscrasia, prognosis worsens further. In literature, there are very few cases of pancytopenia and bicytopenia caused by clozapine. We present a case of bicytopenia (reduced white and red blood cells' counts) caused by clozapine within a month of therapy and complicated by a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Patient improved in 3 weeks after stopping clozapine along with medical management in the Intensive Care Unit. Such side effects, though rare, can be life threatening and warrants intermittent complete blood monitoring besides regular assessment of granulocytes and neutrophils when any patient is prescribed clozapine.
