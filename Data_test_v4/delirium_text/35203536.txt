35203536|t|Asymmetric Interaction of Neuropeptidase Activities between Cortico-Limbic Structures, Plasma and Cardiovascular Function after Unilateral Dopamine Depletions of the Nigrostriatal System.
35203536|a|In emotional processing, dopamine (DA) plays an essential role, and its deterioration involves important consequences. Under physiological conditions, dopamine exhibits brain asymmetry and coexists with various neuropeptides that can coordinate the processing of brain functions. Brain asymmetry can extend into a broader concept of asymmetric neurovisceral integration, including behavior. The study of the activity of neuropeptide regulatory enzymes (neuropeptidases, NPs) is illustrative. We have observed that the left and right brain areas interact intra- and inter-hemispherically, as well as with peripheral tissues or with physiological parameters such as blood pressure or with behaviors such as turning preference. To obtain data that reflect this integrative behavior, we simultaneously analyzed the impact of left or right brain DA depletion on the activity of various NPs in corticolimbic regions of the left and right hemispheres, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, as well as on the plasma activity of the same aminopeptidase activities (APs) and on systolic blood pressure (SBP). Intra- and inter-hemispheric interactions as well as the interactions of NPs from the left or right hemispheres were analyzed with the same plasma APs and the SBP obtained from sham and from left or right lesioned rats. The results demonstrate a complex profile depending on the hemisphere considered. They definitively confirm an asymmetric neurovisceral integration and reveal a higher level of inter-hemispheric corticolimbic interactions including with SBP after left dopamine depletion.
