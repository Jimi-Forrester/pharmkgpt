33918659|t|IL-1beta Antibody Protects Brain from Neuropathology of Hypoperfusion.
33918659|a|Chronic brain hypoperfusion is the primary cause of vascular dementia and has been implicated in the development of white matter disease and lacunar infarcts. Cerebral hypoperfusion leads to a chronic state of brain inflammation with immune cell activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1beta. In the present study, we induced chronic, progressive brain hypoperfusion in mice using ameroid constrictor, arterial stenosis (ACAS) surgery and tested the efficacy of an IL-1beta antibody on the resulting brain damage. We observed that ACAS surgery causes a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) of about 30% and grey and white matter damage in and around the hippocampus. The IL-1beta antibody treatment did not significantly affect CBF but largely eliminated grey matter damage and reduced white matter damage caused by ACAS surgery. Over the course of hypoperfusion/injury, grip strength, coordination, and memory-related behavior were not significantly affected by ACAS surgery or antibody treatment. We conclude that antibody neutralization of IL-1beta is protective from the brain damage caused by chronic, progressive brain hypoperfusion.
