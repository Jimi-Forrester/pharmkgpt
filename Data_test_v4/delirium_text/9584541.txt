9584541|a|Of the first 675 persons admitted to a new acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) nursing home, 423 were seen in psychiatric consultation. They ranged in age from 22 to 70 years. Most were coping with multiple losses of health, fitness, homes, careers, loved ones, strength, and functional capacity. All had multiple and severe medical illnesses. Of the 423 persons evaluated, 422 (99.8%) had 1 or more psychiatric disorders. Three hundred fifty-one (83%) had a diagnosis of dementia, 349 (82.5%) substance abuse, 276 (65%) psychiatric diagnoses other than cognitive or substance abuse, and 61 (14.4%) delirium. The individuals admitted to the AIDS nursing home were younger, more medically and psychiatrically ill, on more complex medical regimens, and had a higher prevalence of both dementia and substance abuse than those in a separate study of geriatric nursing homes.
