34987350|a|BACKGROUND: The most common cognitive dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia are information processing, memory, and learning. Based on the hypothesis of rehabilitation and brain stimulation in memory and learning, adding a form of neuromodulation to conventional rehabilitation might increase the effectiveness of treatments. AIMS: To explore the effects of psychosocial occupational therapy combined with anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive performance in patients with Schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-four patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were randomized into the experimental and control groups. We used The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment battery (LOTCA) to assess spatial recognition, attention, visual memory, learning abilities, and high-level cognitive functions like problem-solving. All participants received customized psychosocial occupational therapy activities. Furthermore, the experimental group received 12 sessions of active anodal tDCS for 20 minutes with 2 mA intensity on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while the patients in the sham group received sham tDCS. RESULTS: Combining tDCS to conventional psychosocial occupational therapy resulted in a significant increase in spatial memory, visual learning, and attention. CONCLUSIONS: Anodal tDCS on the left DLPFC improved visual memory, attention, and learning abilities. Contrary to our expectations, we could not find any changes in complex and more demanding cognitive functions.
