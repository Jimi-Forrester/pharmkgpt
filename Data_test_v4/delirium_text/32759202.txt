32759202|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta) and florbetapir PET measurements in cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly adults in order to detect the earliest abnormalities and compare their predictive effect for cognitive decline. METHODS: A total of 259 CU individuals were categorized as abnormal (+) or normal (-) on CSF Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 analyzed with mass spectrometry and Abeta PET measured with 18F-florbetapir. Simultaneous longitudinal measurements of CSF and PET were compared for 39 individuals who were unambiguously Abeta-negative at baseline (CSF-/PET-). We also examined the relationship between baseline CSF/PET group membership and longitudinal changes in CSF Abeta, Abeta PET, and cognition. RESULTS: The proportions of individuals in each discordant group were similar (8.1% CSF+/PET- and 7.7% CSF-/PET+). Among baseline Abeta-negative (CSF-/PET-) individuals with longitudinal CSF and PET measurements, a larger proportion subsequently worsened on CSF Abeta (odds ratio 4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 22.1], p = 0.035) than Abeta PET over 3.5 +- 1.0 years. Compared to CSF-/PET- individuals, CSF+/PET- individuals had faster (estimate 0.009 [95% CI 0.005, 0.013], p < 0.001) rates of Abeta PET accumulation over 4.4 +- 1.7 years, while CSF-/PET+ individuals had faster (estimate -0.492 [95% CI -0.861, -0.123], p = 0.01) rates of cognitive decline over 4.5 +- 1.9 years. CONCLUSIONS: The proportions of discordant PET and CSF Abeta-positive individuals were similar cross-sectionally. However, unambiguously Abeta-negative (CSF-/PET-) individuals are more likely to show subsequent worsening on CSF than PET, supporting the idea that CSF detects the earliest Abeta changes. In discordant cases, only PET abnormality predicted cognitive decline, suggesting that abnormal Abeta PET changes are a later phenomenon in cognitively normal individuals.
