39062892|t|A Comparative Analysis of Two Automated Quantification Methods for Regional Cerebral Amyloid Retention: PET-Only and PET-and-MRI-Based Methods.
39062892|a|Accurate quantification of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for early detection of and intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but there is still a lack of studies comparing the performance of various automated methods. This study compared the PET-only method and PET-and-MRI-based method with a pre-trained deep learning segmentation model. A large sample of 1180 participants in the Catholic Aging Brain Imaging (CABI) database was analyzed to calculate the regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) using both methods. The logistic regression models were employed to assess the discriminability of amyloid-positive and negative groups through 10-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) metrics. The two methods showed a high correlation in calculating SUVRs but the PET-MRI method, incorporating MRI data for anatomical accuracy, demonstrated superior performance in predicting amyloid-positivity. The parietal, frontal, and cingulate importantly contributed to the prediction. The PET-MRI method with a pre-trained deep learning model approach provides an efficient and precise method for earlier diagnosis and intervention in the AD continuum.
