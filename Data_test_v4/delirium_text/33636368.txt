33636368|a|Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is upsetting the world and innovative therapeutic solutions are needed in an attempt to counter this new pandemic. Great hope lies in vaccines, but drugs to cure the infected patient are just as necessary. In the most severe forms of the disease, a cytokine storm with neuroinflammation occurs, putting the patient's life at serious risk, with sometimes long-lasting sequelae. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is known to possess anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, which make it an ideal candidate to be assumed in the earliest stage of the disease. Here, we provide a mini-review on the topic, pointing out phospholipids consumption in COVID-19, the possible development of an antiphospholipid syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and reporting our preliminary single-case experience concerning to a 45-year-old COVID-19 female patient recently treated with success by micronized / ultramicronized PEA.
