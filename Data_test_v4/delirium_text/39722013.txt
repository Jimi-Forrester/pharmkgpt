39722013|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is the main cause of death and disability. Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is one of the most severe complications of stroke, which lacks effective biomarkers for its early detection. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the significance of lncRNA SIX3OS1 in acute stroke and PSCI aiming to identify a novel biomarker. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 138 patients with acute stroke and 80 healthy individuals. By comparing the serum SIX3OS1 in acute stroke and healthy individuals, the significance of SIX3OS1 in diagnosing acute stroke, assessing disease severity, and predicting the risk of PSCI was revealed. RESULTS: Significant upregulation of SIX3OS1 in acute stroke was observed, which discriminated patients with acute stroke from healthy individuals and indicated severe disease conditions of patients. There were 72 acute stroke patients who had PSCI accounting for 52.17% that showed a higher serum SIX3OS1 level than post-stroke cognitive normal patients. The increasing serum SIX3OS1 level was also identified as a risk factor for PSCI and could distinguish PSCI patients. Additionally, SIX3OS1 showed a negative correlation with the MoCA score of PSCI patients. CONCLUSION: Serum SIX3OS1 level can be considered a biomarker for screening acute stroke and a predictor for PSCI.
