20429332|a|AIM: A survey evaluating incidence and risk factors of complications in persons underwent complete open lung resection because of primary or secondary lung malignancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 189 open surgery procedures in 128 males and 61 females, mean age males 61 years (range 21-78), females 64 years (range 33-80) during a five-years period (2003-2007). Data processing and analysis were performed with the statistical software system Statistica and compared by parametres odds ratio a chi2 test. RESULTS: Complications were divided into five groups. First group was defined as complications in perioperative period and was composed of three events 1.5%: endotracheal tube dysfunction (i.e. 0.5%), heavy cardiac arrhytmia 0.5% and serious haemorrhage, that occurred immediately after operation 0.5%. Second group includes complications within period of 7 days after surgery: prolonged air leak (PAL > 7 days) 7.4%, bronchopneumonia 6.9%, cardiac arrhythmia 6.9%, postoperative delirium 4.2%, atelectasis 2.6%, wound infection 1.1%, bleeding 1.1% and chylothorax 0.5%. Third group contains events between 8th and 30th postoperative days: thoracic empyema 2.1%, dysphonia 2.1%, painfull shoulder 1.1%, alimentary tract infection 0.5% and bronchial closure insufficiency 0.5%. Fourth group contains patients with severe complications, that led to death during 30 days after operation: ischemic stroke 0.5% and pulmonary embolism 0.5%. Patients without any complication formed the fifth group of 60.5%. CONCLUSION: Main risk factors for complications in postoperative period after lung resection due to primary or secondary lung malignancy in our group of patients are COPD, corticotherapy, time of operation over 3 hours, BMI over 25, left side tumor localization and bronchoplastic procedure. For cardiac arrhytmia seems to be risk factor pneumonectomy and previous neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.
