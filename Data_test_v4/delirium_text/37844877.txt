Recorded mother's voice, as a non-pharmacological measure, is increasingly used to prevent the emergence of delirium in pediatric patients, but sufficient evidence is still needed to prove its efficacy. METHODS: Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Sinomed databases were searched for randomized controlled trials exploring the efficacy of recorded mother's voice in preventing the emergence of delirium in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia. The original data were pooled for the meta-analysis with Review Manager 5.4.1. This study was conducted based on the Cochrane Review Methods. RESULTS: Eight studies with 724 children were included in the analysis. Recorded mother's voice reduced the incidence of emergence delirium when compared with either no voice (RR: 0.45; [95 % CI, 0.34 - 0.61]; p < 0.01; I2 = 7 %) or stranger's voice (RR: 0.51; [95 % CI, 0.28 - 0.91]; p = 0.02; I2 = 38 %) without increasing other untoward reactions. In addition, it shortened the post-anesthesia care unit stay time when compared with no voice (MD = -5.64; [95 % CI, -8.43 to -2.58]; p < 0.01, I2 = 0 %), but not stranger's voice (MD = -1.23; [95 % CI, -3.08 to 0.63]; p = 0.19, I2 = 0 %). It also shortened the extubation time and reduced the incidence of postoperative rescue analgesia. CONCLUSION: The current analysis indicated that recorded mother's voices could reduce the incidence of emergency delirium, shorten post-anesthesia care unit stay time and extubation time, and decrease the incidence of postoperative rescue analgesia in children.
