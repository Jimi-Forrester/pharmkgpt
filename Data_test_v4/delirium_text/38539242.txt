38539242|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in WDR45. The impairment of autophagy caused by WDR45 deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of BPAN; however, the pathomechanism of this disease is largely unknown. Lipid dyshomeostasis is involved in neurogenerative diseases, but whether lipid metabolism is affected by Wdr45 deficiency and whether lipid dyshomeostasis contributes to the progression of BPAN are unclear. METHODS: We generated Wdr45 knockout SN4741 cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, then lipid droplets (LDs) were stained using BODIPY 493/503. Chaperone-mediated autophagy was determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The expression of fatty acid synthase (Fasn) was detected by western blot in the presence or absence of the lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl and the CMA activator AR7. The interaction between Fasn and HSC70 was analyzed using coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Cell viability was measured by a CCK-8 kit after treatment with the Fasn inhibitor C75 or the CMA activator AR7. RESULTS: Deletion of Wdr45 impaired chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), thus leading to lipid droplet (LD) accumulation. Moreover, Fasn can be degraded via CMA, and that defective CMA leads to elevated Fasn, which promotes LD formation. LD accumulation is toxic to cells; however, cell viability was not rescued by Fasn inhibition or CMA activation. Inhibition of Fasn with a low concentration of C75 did not affect cell viability but decreases LD density. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that Fasn is essential for cell survival but that excessive Fasn leads to LD accumulation in Wdr45 knockout cells.
