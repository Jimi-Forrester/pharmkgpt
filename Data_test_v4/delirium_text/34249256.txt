34249256|a|Flaxseed is a plant that grows and is cultivated in more than 50 countries; the main flax producer countries are Canada, China, the United States, and India. The purpose of the present study was to overview the source, chemical compounds, and mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this valuable plant. For writing this manuscript, we made a list of relevant keywords and phrases, and then we started searching for studies in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The main constituents of flaxseed include lipids, proteins, lignans, fibers, and minerals. Flaxseed is full of antioxidants such as tocopherols, betacarotene, cysteine, and methionine which result in a decrease in blood pressure, heart disease, hepatic and neurological disorders, and increased insulin sensitivity. Flaxseed is commonly used for its antidiabetic and anticancer activities and also it is beneficial for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, urological, and reproductive disorders, and because of these beneficial effects, it is recognized as a medical plant.
