2311011|t|Association between Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?
2311011|a|We report two cases of Alzheimer disease (AD)--one of them familial--in which the patient also had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and one patient with familial AD who had a son with ALS. Three further cases of probable ALS were found in pedigrees of AD reported from the literature. It is proposed that this association is not coincidental, but may suggest an etiological factor in common.
