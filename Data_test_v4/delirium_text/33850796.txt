33850796|t|The Use of Electroencephalography in Patients with Sepsis: a Review of The Literature.
33850796|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is the term used to define brain dysfunction related to infections that are principally located outside the central nervous system (CNS). A number of published studies report that electroencephalography (EEG) has been used in the evaluation of patients with sepsis, alone or usually in combination, to evoked potentials and neuroimaging. This was in an effort to assess if EEG can be a tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of the neurological status in sepsis patients. Although there is no specific test for the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis related encephalopathy, our literature review suggests that EEG has a role in the assessment of this clinical entity. Due to its low cost and simplicity in its performance, EEG could be a potential aid in the assessment of sepsis neurological complications even in the early, subclinical stages of the syndrome. The aim of this review is to summarize the published literature regarding the application and utility of electroencephalography in adult patients with sepsis.
