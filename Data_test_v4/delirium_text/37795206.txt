37795206|t|Understanding Post-Sepsis Syndrome: How Can Clinicians Help?
37795206|a|Sepsis is a global health challenge, with over 49 million cases annually. Recent medical advancements have increased in-hospital survival rates to approximately 80%, but the escalating incidence of sepsis, owing to an ageing population, rise in chronic diseases, and antibiotic resistance, have also increased the number of sepsis survivors. Subsequently, there is a growing prevalence of "post-sepsis syndrome" (PSS). This syndrome includes long-term physical, medical, cognitive, and psychological issues after recovering from sepsis. PSS puts survivors at risk for hospital readmission and is associated with a reduction in health- and life span, both at short and long term, after hospital discharge. Comprehensive understanding of PSS symptoms and causative factors is vital for developing optimal care for sepsis survivors, a task of prime importance for clinicians. This review aims to elucidate our current knowledge of PSS and its relevance in enhancing post-sepsis care provided by clinicians.
