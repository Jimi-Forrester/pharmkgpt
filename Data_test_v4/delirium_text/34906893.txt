34906893|a|BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathogenesis, aggregation of Abeta42 fibrils strongly correlates with memory dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Till date, no promising cures for AD. Report shows that flavonoids contributed anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and neuroprotection activity by regulating the mitochondrial machinery. Here, we first report the identification of flavonoids from Ascophyllum nodosum as having the ability to dissolve Abeta42 fibrils in an AD model of Drosophila. FRAN could be superior anti-AD agents for neuroprotection, their underlying mechanism and how they collectively halted amyloidogenesis is currently being investigated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective role of FRAN in the Abeta42 expressing AD model of Drosophila. METHODS: Drosophila stocks: OregonR+, ey-GAL4/CyO, elavc155-GAL4, UAS-mitoGFP, UAS-mcherry.mito.OMM, UAS-Abeta42/CyO were used, cultured at 28+-1  C in a BOD incubator. Ascophyllum extract rich in flavonoids as revealed by LC-MS study and employed against the AD flies. The validation of Abeta42 expression was done by immunostaining and q-RT PCR. The eye roughness of AD flies was scored in a dose-dependent manner. Further, In vivo and in silico studies of FRAN extract was executed against Abeta42 induced neurotoxicity. RESULTS: In order to determine the most effective lethal dose of FRAN extract concentration 1, 2, 5, 10 mg/ml were screened using OregonR+flies. Extract 1 and 2 mg/ml did not show any lethality. Hence, extract 2 mg/ml was employed on AD flies and a >= 50% rescue in the eye phenotype was observed using SEM images. This dose had a strong effect on cell apoptosis, viability, longevity, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial dynamic markers in comparable to control. Extract also scavenging free radicals in order to maintain in situ cellular ROS and prevent Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity in vivo and in silico. Hence, we suggest its great potential as a future therapeutic agent for AD treatment. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, FRAN extract rich in flavonoids as having largest neuroprotective activity against Abeta42 aggregation in eye tissue of Drosophila. Extract shows strong effect against Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity by altering the various cellular and molecular events. So, it could be considered as strong anti-AD agents for neuroprotection.
