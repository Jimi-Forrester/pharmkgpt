38250857|t|Comparative Analysis of Primary and Monovalent Booster SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Coverage in Adults with and without HIV in Catalonia, Spain.
38250857|a|People with HIV (PWH) may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes. We investigated the disparity in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage between PWH and those without HIV (PWoH) in Catalonia, Spain, assessing primary and monovalent booster vaccination coverage from December 2021 to July 2022. The vaccines administered were BNT162, ChAdOx1-S, mRNA-127, and Ad26.COV2.S. Using a 1:10 ratio of PWH to PWoH based on sex, age, and socioeconomic deprivation, the analysis included 201,630 individuals (183,300 PWoH and 18,330 PWH). Despite a higher prevalence of comorbidities, PWH exhibited lower rates of complete primary vaccination (78.2% vs. 81.8%, p < 0.001) but surpassed PWoH in booster coverage (68.5% vs. 63.1%, p < 0.001). Notably, complete vaccination rates were lower among PWH with CD4 <200 cells/muL, detectable HIV viremia, and migrants compared to PWoH (p < 0.001, all). However, PWH with CD4 < 200 cells/muL received more boosters (p < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis of the overall population, a prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, HIV status, migrants, and mild-to-severe socioeconomic deprivation were associated with lower primary vaccination coverage, reflecting barriers to healthcare and vaccine access. However, booster vaccination was higher among PWH. Targeted interventions are needed to improve vaccine coverage and address hesitancy in vulnerable populations.
