28948494|a|The accumulation of the neurotoxin beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a major hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta homeostasis in the brain is governed by its production and various clearance mechanisms. Both pathways are influenced by the ubiquitously expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). In cerebral blood vessels, LRP1 is an important mediator for the rapid removal of Abeta from brain via transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we summarize recent findings on LRP1 function and discuss the targeting of LRP1 as a modulator for AD pathology and drug delivery into the brain.
