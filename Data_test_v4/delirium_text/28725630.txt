28725630|t|Curcumin: An age-old anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic agent.
28725630|a|Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for treating medical conditions for many years. Several experimental and pharmacologic trials have demonstrated its efficacy in the role as an anti-inflammatory agent. Curcumin has been shown to be effective in treating chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's and common malignancies like colon, stomach, lung, breast, and skin cancers. As treatments in medicine become more and more complex, the answer may be something simpler. This is a review article written with the objective to systematically analyze the wealth of information regarding the medical use of curcumin, the "curry spice", and to understand the existent gaps which have prevented its widespread application in the medical community.
