33729717|t|Motoric Subtypes of Delirium and Long-Term Functional and Mental Health Outcomes in Adults After Critical Illness.
33729717|a|OBJECTIVES: Adult ICU survivors that experience delirium are at high risk for developing new functional disabilities and mental health disorders. We sought to determine if individual motoric subtypes of delirium are associated with worse disability, depression, and/or post-traumatic stress disorder in ICU survivors. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Academic, community, and Veteran Affairs hospitals. PATIENTS: Adult ICU survivors of respiratory failure and/or shock. INTERVENTIONS: We assessed delirium and level of consciousness using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale daily during hospitalization. We classified delirium as hypoactive (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale <= 0) or hyperactive (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale > 0). At 3- and 12-month postdischarge, we assessed for dependence in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Adjusting for baseline and inhospital covariates, multivariable regression examined the association of exposure to delirium motoric subtype and long-term outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In our cohort of 556 adults with a median age of 62 years, hypoactive delirium was more common than hyperactive (68.9% vs 16.8%). Dependence on the activities of daily living was present in 37% at 3 months and 31% at 12 months, whereas dependence on instrumental activities of daily living was present in 63% at 3 months and 56% at 12 months. At both time points, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder rates were constant at 36% and 5%, respectively. Each additional day of hypoactive delirium was associated with higher instrumental activities of daily living dependence at 3 months only (0.24 points [95% CI, 0.07-0.41; p = 0.006]). There were no associations between the motoric delirium subtype and activities of daily living dependence, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of hypoactive delirium, but not hyperactive, was associated with a minimal increase in early instrumental activities of daily living dependence scores in adult survivors of critical illness. Motoric delirium subtype was neither associated with early or late activities of daily living functional dependence or mental health outcomes, nor late instrumental activities of daily living functional dependence.
