27858974|a|The American Geriatrics Society, with support from the National Institute on Aging and other funders, held its eighth Bedside-to-Bench research conference, entitled "Sleep, Circadian Rhythms, and Aging: New Avenues for Improving Brain Health, Physical Health and Functioning," October 4 to 6, 2015, in Bethesda, Maryland. Part of a conference series addressing three common geriatric syndromes-delirium, sleep and circadian rhythm (SCR) disturbance, and voiding dysfunction-the series highlighted relationships and pertinent clinical and pathophysiological commonalities between these three geriatric syndromes. The conference provided a forum for discussing current sleep, circadian rhythm, and aging research; identifying gaps in knowledge; and developing a research agenda to inform future investigative efforts. The conference also promoted networking among developing researchers, leaders in the field of SCR and aging, and National Institutes of Health program personnel.
