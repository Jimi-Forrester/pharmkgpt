34494815|t|Benzothiazolium Derivative-Capped Silica Nanocomposites for beta-Amyloid Imaging In Vivo.
34494815|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) is believed to be a causative factor in AD pathology. The abnormal deposition of Abeta is believed to be responsible for progression of AD. In order to facilitate the imaging of Abeta in vivo, suitable probe molecules with a near-infrared emission wavelength that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were utilized. The commercial fluorescent probe thioflavin-T (ThT) is used to image Abeta; however, because of its short emission wavelength and poor BBB penetration, ThT can only be used in vitro. With this research, based on ThT, we design three fluorescent probes (SZIs) having a longer emission wavelength in order to image Abeta aggregates. SZIs with different numbers of double bonds respond to Abeta aggregates. The SZIs have a structure similar to ThT, and as such, the SZIs are also unable to penetrate the BBB. To deal with the problem, we develop nanocomposites (MSN-Lf@SZIs) to deliver SZIs into the brain of AD mouse and image Abeta successfully. These new nanocomposites are able to deliver the dyes into the brain and facilitate Abeta imaging in vivo.
