36958342|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium tremens (DT) is a common complication of alcohol withdrawal. Pharmacological treatment of hospitalized patients with DT is important in addiction medicine but also in other medical disciplines where DT can occur as a complication of hospitalization. Patients suffering from DT require treatment with benzodiazepines (short-acting benzodiazepines for elderly patients to reduce accumulation), and in cases of psychotic symptoms, treatment with antipsychotics. Benzodiazepines are a first-line treatment for DT. A specific guideline for the use of antipsychotics has yet to be developed. This review discusses the current guidelines and literature on the antipsychotic treatment options in DT. AIM: Systematic presentation of relevant antipsychotics for the treatment of DT. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using Scopus and PubMed. The last search was conducted on May 22nd 2022. Original articles and reviews on antipsychotic treatment in alcohol withdrawal and DT were included in this review. Further, international guidelines were also considered. The review was registered using the PROSPERO database (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/); CRD42021264611. RESULTS: Haloperidol is mainly recommended for use in the intensive care unit. There is little literature on the use of atypical antipsychotics to treat DT. Treatment with antipsychotics always should be combined with benzodiazepines, and physicians should watch out for complications like neuroleptic malignant syndrome, QTc interval prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms and withdrawal seizures resulting from lowering the threshold for seizures. CONCLUSION: Antipsychotic treatment should depend on the experience of the physician. Beside haloperidol, no other clear recommendations are available.
