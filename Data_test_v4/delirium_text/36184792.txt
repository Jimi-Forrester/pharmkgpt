36184792|t|Diffusion along perivascular spaces provides evidence interlinking compromised glymphatic function with aging in Parkinson's disease.
36184792|a|AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the glymphatic function and its related factors in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and patients with PD of different ages using the diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) method. METHODS: Medical records and imaging data of 93 patients with idiopathic PD and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. The diffusivity along the perivascular spaces, projection fibers, and association fibers were calculated on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to acquire the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index. RESULTS: PD patients exhibited a reduced ALPS index compared with the HCs. Negative correlations between the ALPS index and clinical information including age, age at disease onset, Parkinson's disease sleep scale 2nd version (PDSS-2) scores, and history of diabetes mellitus were revealed in the PD group. Besides, a negative correlation between the ALPS index and the severity of motor symptoms was identified in the subgroup aged 65 and above, rather than in the younger ones. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that reduced ALPS index, a potential noninvasive measure of compromised glymphatic activity, is involved in the pathophysiology of PD, especially in the aged ones and those with sleep disorders.
