38060710|t|Multiple Clinical Indications of Mifepristone: A Systematic Review.
38060710|a|Mifepristone and misoprostol are globally used medications that have become disparaged through the stigmatization of reproductive healthcare. Patients are hindered from receiving prompt treatment in clinical scenarios where misoprostol and mifepristone are the drugs of choice. It is no exaggeration to emphasize that in cases where reproductive healthcare is concerned. The aim of this paper is to discuss the different indications of mifepristone and to delineate where the discrepancy in accessibility arises. For this systematic review, we included publications citing clinical trials involving the use and efficacy of mifepristone published in English within the date range of 2000 to 2023. Five databases were searched to identify relevant sources. These databases are Google Scholar, MEDLINE with full text through EBSCO, and three National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases (NCBI Bookshelf, PubMed, and PubMed Central). Twenty-three records were ultimately included in this review. Mifepristone has been shown to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder and psychotic depression. There was a significant decrease in depression and psychiatric rating symptoms for patients taking mifepristone versus placebo with no adverse events. Mifepristone has also been shown to improve treatment course in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) who failed or are unable to undergo surgical treatment. In addition, mifepristone has been shown to be a successful treatment option for adenomyosis and leiomyomas. Patients had a statistically significant decrease in uterine volumes following mifepristone treatment, which aided in the alleviation of other symptoms, such as blood loss and pelvic discomfort. Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid that has immense potential to provide symptomatic relief in patients suffering from a wide array of complicated diseases. Historically, mifepristone has been proven to have an incredible safety profile. While further research is certainly needed, the politicization of its medical use for only one of its many indications has unfortunately led to the willful ignorance of its potential despite its evidence-based safety profile and efficacy.
