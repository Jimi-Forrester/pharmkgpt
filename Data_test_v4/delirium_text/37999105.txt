37999105|t|Pneumonectomy for Primary Lung Tumors and Pulmonary Metastases: A Comprehensive Study of Postoperative Morbidity, Early Mortality, and Preoperative Clinical Prognostic Factors.
37999105|a|BACKGROUND: Pneumonectomy is a major surgical resection that still remains a high-risk operation. The current study aims to investigate perioperative risk factors for postoperative morbidity and early mortality after pneumonectomy for thoracic malignancies. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent pneumonectomy for thoracic malignancies at our institution between 2014 and 2022. Complications were assessed up to 30 days after the operation. Mortality for any reason was recorded after 30 days and 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 145 out of 169 patients undergoing pneumonectomy were included in this study. The postoperative 30-day complication rate was 41.4%. The 30-day-mortality was 8.3%, and 90-day-mortality 17.2%. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities was a risk factor for major cardiopulmonary complications (54.2% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.01). Postoperative bronchus stump insufficiency (OR: 11.883, 95% CI: 1.288-109.591, p = 0.029) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score 4 (OR: 3.023, 95% CI: 1.028-8.892, p = 0.044) were independent factors for early mortality. CONCLUSION: Pneumonectomy for thoracic malignancies remains a high-risk major lung resection with significant postoperative morbidity and mortality. Attention should be paid to the preoperative selection of patients.
