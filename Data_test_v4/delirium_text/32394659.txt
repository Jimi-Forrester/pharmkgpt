32394659|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of insulin phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/glycogen synthetase kinase-3alpha (PI3K/GSK3alpha) signal pathway related proteins in the hippocampus in mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to explore the regulatory mechanism of EA on improving the pathological characteristics of AD. METHODS: Twelve male APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided a model group and a treatment group, 6 mice in each group; another 6 wild-type male mice were taken as the control group. The mice in the treatment group were treated with EA (continuous wave, 2 Hz of frequency) at "Baihui" (GV 20) and bilateral "Shenshu" (BL 23), once a day; 7-day treatment was taken as a course of treatment, and 2 courses of treatment were given. The immunohistochemistry method and Western blot method were used to detect the distribution and expression level of hippocampal PI3K/GSK3alpha signal pathway related proteins P85alpha, P110alpha, GSK3alpha and pS21GSK3alpha, and the number of hippocampal senile plaques (SP) was observed. RESULTS: The proteins of P85alpha, P110alpha, GSK3alpha and pS21GSK3alpha were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons, and the GSK3alpha was also distributed in the axons of neurons in the model group and the treatment group. The immunohistochemistry results showed that the distribution level of GSK3alpha in the hippocampus in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.001), and the distribution level of pS21GSK3alpha, P85alpha and P110alpha was significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.001); compared with the model group, the distribution level of GSK3alpha in the hippocampus in the treatment group was significantly decreased (P<0.001), and the distribution level of pS21GSK3alpha, P85alpha and P110alpha in hippocampus was significantly increased (P<0.05, P<0.001). The Western blot results showed compared with the control group, the expression of pS21GSK3alpha, P85alpha and P110alpha as well as the ratio of pS21GSK3alpha/GSK3alpha in the hippocampus in the model group were significantly decreased (P<0.001), and the expression of GSK3alpha was increased (P<0.05); compared with the model group, the expression of pS21GSK3alpha, P85alpha, P110alpha and the ratio of pS21GSK3alpha/GSK3alpha in the hippocampus in the treatment group were significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.001), and the expression of GSK3alpha was decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the number of hippocampal SP in the model group was significantly increased (P<0.001); compared with the model group, the number of hippocampal SP in the treatment group was significantly decreased (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: EA could effectively regulate the expression of PI3K/GSK3alpha signal pathway related proteins in the hippocampus in mice with AD, so as to reduce the formation and deposition of SP.
