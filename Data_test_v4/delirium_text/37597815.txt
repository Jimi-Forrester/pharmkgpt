37597815|a|BACKGROUND: Impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered to be a common feature among neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases. In prion disease, increased BBB permeability was reported 40 years ago, yet the mechanisms behind the loss of BBB integrity have never been explored. Recently, we showed that reactive astrocytes associated with prion diseases are neurotoxic. The current work examines the potential link between astrocyte reactivity and BBB breakdown. RESULTS: In prion-infected mice, the loss of BBB integrity and aberrant localization of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a sign of retraction of astrocytic endfeet from blood vessels, were noticeable prior to disease onset. Gaps in cell-to-cell junctions along blood vessels, together with downregulation of Occludin, Claudin-5 and VE-cadherin, which constitute tight and adherens junctions, suggested that loss of BBB integrity is linked with degeneration of vascular endothelial cells. In contrast to cells isolated from non-infected adult mice, endothelial cells originating from prion-infected mice displayed disease-associated changes, including lower levels of Occludin, Claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression, impaired tight and adherens junctions, and reduced trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Endothelial cells isolated from non-infected mice, when co-cultured with reactive astrocytes isolated from prion-infected animals or treated with media conditioned by the reactive astrocytes, developed the disease-associated phenotype observed in the endothelial cells from prion-infected mice. Reactive astrocytes were found to produce high levels of secreted IL-6, and treatment of endothelial monolayers originating from non-infected animals with recombinant IL-6 alone reduced their TEER. Remarkably, treatment with extracellular vesicles produced by normal astrocytes partially reversed the disease phenotype of endothelial cells isolated from prion-infected animals. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the current work is the first to illustrate early BBB breakdown in prion disease and to document that reactive astrocytes associated with prion disease are detrimental to BBB integrity. Moreover, our findings suggest that the harmful effects are linked to proinflammatory factors secreted by reactive astrocytes.
