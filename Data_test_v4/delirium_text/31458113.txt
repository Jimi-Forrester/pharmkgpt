31458113|t|Arginine-Selective Chemical Labeling Approach for Identification and Enrichment of Reactive Arginine Residues in Proteins.
31458113|a|Modification of arginine residues using dicarbonyl compounds is a common method to identify functional or reactive arginine residues in proteins. Arginine undergoes several kinds of posttranslational modifications in these functional residues. Identifying these reactive residues confidently in a protein or large-scale samples is a very challenging task. Several dicarbonyl compounds have been utilized, and the most effective ones are phenylglyoxal and cyclohexanedione. However, tracking these reactive arginine residues in a protein or large-scale protein samples using a chemical labeling approach is very challenging. Thus, the enrichment of modified peptides will provide reduced sample complexity and confident mass-spectrometric data analysis. To pinpoint arginine-labeled peptide efficiently, we developed a novel arginine-selective enrichment reagent. For the first time, we conjugated an azide tag in a widely used dicarbonyl compound cyclohexanedione. This provided us the ability to enrich modified peptides using a bio-orthogonal click chemistry and the biotin-avidin affinity chromatography. We evaluated the reagent in several standard peptides and proteins. Three standard peptides, bradykinin, substance P, and neurotensin, were labeled with this cyclohexanedione-azide reagent. Click labeling of modified peptides was tested by spiking the peptides in a myoglobin protein digest. A protein, RNase A, was also labeled with the reagent, and after click chemistry and biotin-avidin affinity chromatography, we identified two selective arginine residues. We believe this strategy will be an efficient way for identifying functional and reactive arginine residues in a protein or protein mixtures.
