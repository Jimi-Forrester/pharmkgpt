32033776|a|INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of haloperidol in the prevention of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible randomized controlled trials up to July 2019. No publication type or language restrictions were applied. RESULTS: Compared to the placebo, haloperidol did not significantly reduce the incidence of delirium in all ICU patients (relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62-1.10, p = 0.20). However, haloperidol prophylaxis could reduce the incidence of delirium exclusively in postoperative patients admitted to an ICU (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.86, p = 0.004). We observed no significant differences between the haloperidol and placebo groups in terms of length of ICU stay, all-cause mortality, and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The use of prophylactic haloperidol might reduce the incidence of delirium in postoperative patients admitted to an ICU, but not in all ICU patients.
