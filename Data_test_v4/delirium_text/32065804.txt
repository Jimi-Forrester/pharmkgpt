32065804|t|Quantitative Electroencephalography Characteristics for Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.
32065804|a|BACKGROUND: Individualized treatment guided by biomarkers certainly will play a crucial role in the more effective treatment of various neurological diseases in the near future. Identifying the electroencephalographic biomarkers in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may help in the decision-making process of health professionals regarding the non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) protocols. OBJECTIVE: To summarize quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) characteristics of patients with PD with motor symptoms at rest or during movement to identify potential biomarker associated with motor impairment in PD. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS/BIREME, CINAHL/EBSCO, Web of Science, and CENTRAL, performed according to PRISMA-statement guidelines. Two independent authors searched for studies that reported qEEG data related to motor outcomes at rest or during movements in patients with PD and compared the data with control healthy group. The studies' methodological quality was examined using the Cochrane Handbook. Studies/sample characteristics, qEEG parameters/analyses, and the studies' results were summarized. Prospero-register: CRD42018085660. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (18 cross-sectional/one cross-over) with 312 PD patients and 277 controls, published between 1994-2018, were included for the qualitative analysis. In comparison to healthy controls, our findings suggest a slowing down of the cortical activity in patients with PD due to an increase of slower band waves activity and a decrease of fast band waves at resting and during complex movement execution mainly in the central and frontal cortex. CONCLUSION: Slowing down of cortical waves suggest excitatory NIBS for motor impairment in PD. However, qEEG biomarker for motor symptoms of PD cannot be established yet because the studies that related qEEG with motor outcomes presented methodological poor quality.
