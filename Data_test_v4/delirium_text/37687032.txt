37687032|t|Antiradical and Antioxidant Activity of Compounds Containing 1,3-Dicarbonyl Moiety: An Overview.
37687032|a|Free radicals and oxidants may cause various damages both to the lifeworld and different products. A typical solution for the prophylaxis of oxidation-caused conditions is the usage of various antioxidants. Among them, various classes are found-polyphenols, conjugated polyalkenes, and some sulfur and nitrogen derivatives. Regarding the active site in the molecules, a widely discussed group of compounds are 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds. Among them are natural (e.g., curcumin and pulvinic acids) and synthetic (e.g., 4-hydroxy coumarins, substituted Meldrum's acids) compounds. Herein, information about various compounds containing the 1,3-dicarbonyl moiety is covered, and their antiradical and antioxidant activity, depending on the structure, is discussed.
