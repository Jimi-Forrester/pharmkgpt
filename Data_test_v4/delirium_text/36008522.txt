36008522|t|Syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 expression level is increased in the blood samples of ischemic stroke patients.
36008522|a|The interest for the discovery of blood biomarkers for several neurological disorders, including Ischemic Stroke (IS), is growing and their identification in blood samples would be revolutionary allowing a fast and better pathology prediction or outcome and to collect information on patient recovery. The increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, following a brain infarct, allows the detection of brain proteins in the blood flow. In this work, we analyzed the expression levels of two synaptic proteins Syntaxin (STX)-1a and Synaptosomal Associated Protein, 25 kDa (SNAP-25), in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC), serum and in Neuronal Derived Extracellular vesicles (NDEs) of IS patients, age and sex matched healthy control (HC) and younger HC (Y-HC). Interestingly, we identified STX-1a protein in the cytoplasm of PBMC and both STX-1a and SNAP-25 expression levels were significantly augmented in all IS patient's blood fractions compared to control subjects. In addition, STX-1a blood levels correlated with the IS clinical scales National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIH-SS) and the modified Barthel Index (BI). These results prompted us to speculate that STX-1a and SNAP-25 hematic fluctuations depict the brain damage after an ischemic attack and that their hematic detection could represent a novel and accessible IS biomarkers.
