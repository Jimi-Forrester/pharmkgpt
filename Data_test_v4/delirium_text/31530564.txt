31530564|a|Older age is associated with increased mortality in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). Yet, data are scarce regarding iTTP occurring among older patients. To assess clinical features and long-term impact of iTTP on mortality in older patients (>60 years old), characteristics and prognoses of adult iTTP patients enrolled in the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies registry between 2000 and 2016 were described according to age (<60 years old or >=60 years old). Long-term mortality of iTTP older survivors was compared with that of non-iTTP geriatric subjects. Comparing, respectively, older iTTP patients (N = 71) with younger patients (N = 340), time from hospital admission to diagnosis was longer (P < .0001); at diagnosis, delirium (P = .034), behavior impairment (P = .045), renal involvement (P < .0001), and elevated troponin level (P = .025) were more important whereas cytopenias were less profound (platelet count, 22 x 103/mm3 [9-57] vs 13 x 103/mm3 [9-21], respectively [P = .002]; hemoglobin level, 9 g/dL [8-11] vs 8 g/dL [7-10], respectively [P = .0007]). Short- and mid-term mortalities were higher (P < .0001) and increased for every 10 years of age range. Age >=60 years, cardiac involvement, increased plasma creatinine level, and total plasma exchange volume were independently associated with 1-month mortality. Compared with a non-iTTP geriatric population, older survivors showed an increased long-term mortality (hazard ratio = 3.44; P < .001). In conclusion, older iTTP patients have atypical neurological presentation delaying the diagnosis. Age negatively impacts short-term but also long-term mortality.
