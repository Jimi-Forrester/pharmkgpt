37545104|a|OBJECTIVE: To develop an automated, physiologic metric of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome among patients undergoing chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study from 2016 to 2020 at two tertiary care centers among patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy with a CD19 or B-cell maturation antigen ligand. We determined the daily neurotoxicity grade for each patient during EEG monitoring via chart review and extracted clinical variables and outcomes from the electronic health records. Using quantitative EEG features, we developed a machine learning model to detect the presence and severity of neurotoxicity, known as the EEG immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome score. RESULTS: The EEG immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome score significantly correlated with the grade of neurotoxicity with a median Spearman's R2 of 0.69 (95% CI of 0.59-0.77). The mean area under receiving operator curve was greater than 0.85 for each binary discrimination level. The score also showed significant correlations with maximum ferritin (R2 0.24, p = 0.008), minimum platelets (R2 -0.29, p = 0.001), and dexamethasone usage (R2 0.42, p < 0.0001). The score significantly correlated with duration of neurotoxicity (R2 0.31, p < 0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The EEG immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome score possesses high criterion, construct, and predictive validity, which substantiates its use as a physiologic method to detect the presence and severity of neurotoxicity among patients undergoing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.
