26433375|t|The Potential Roles of Aquaporin 4 in Alzheimer's Disease.
26433375|a|Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the major water channel expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), and it is primarily expressed in astrocytes. It has been studied in various brain pathological conditions. However, the potential for AQP4 to influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unclear. Research regarding AQP4 functions related to AD can be traced back several years and has gradually progressed toward a better understanding of the potential mechanisms. Currently, it has been suggested that AQP4 influences synaptic plasticity, and AQP4 deficiency may impair learning and memory, in part, through glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). AQP4 may mediate the clearance of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta). In addition, AQP4 may influence potassium (K(+)) and calcium (Ca(2+)) ion transport, which could play decisive roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, AQP4 knockout is involved in neuroinflammation and interferes with AD. To date, no specific therapeutic agents have been developed to inhibit or enhance AQP4. However, experimental results strongly emphasize the importance of this topic for future investigations.
