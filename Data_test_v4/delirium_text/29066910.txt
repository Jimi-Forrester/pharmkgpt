29066910|t|CYP19A1 gene polymorphism and colorectal cancer etiology in Saudi population: case-control study.
29066910|a|BACKGROUND: Considerable interest is directed toward the enzyme aromatase (CYP19A1) and the development of cancer, due to CYP19A1's role in estrogen biosynthesis. Several cancers display excessive intra-tumor accumulation of estrogens, and aromatase inhibitors are used for treatment. The CYP19A1 gene exhibits polymorphism and mutations that can alter its expression or aromatase activity and influence estrogen production. We designed this study to investigate the link between CYP19A1 polymorphism and susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) development in Saudis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 CRC patients and 100 healthy controls were drawn for DNA extractions. Three polymorphic sites, rs4774585, rs936308, and rs4775936, were genotyped using Taqman genotyping by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Allelic and genotype frequencies were calculated and compared in the two groups. RESULTS: All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were polymorphic in Saudis, and comparison of allele frequencies showed several differences when compared to other populations. None of the SNPs were associated with the risk of CRC development in Saudis (P>0.05). Some gender and location (colon or rectal) differences were observed. DISCUSSION: The results of this study highlighted the genetic heterogeneity existing between populations in the prevalence of different SNPs and their relation to disease state. It showed that, although rs4774585, rs936308, and rs4775936 are involved in CRC development in several populations, their role is not significant in the etiology of CRC in Saudis; however, some SNPs do increase susceptibility or resistance to CRC development as judged from the odds ratio. Further large-scale studies are warranted to clarify the role of the CYP19A1 development in CRC.
