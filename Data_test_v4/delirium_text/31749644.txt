31749644|t|Experience Of Resident Presentations In Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Grand Rounds: Increase Value For Clinical Education.
31749644|a|BACKGROUND: Grand rounds is a formal meeting at which physicians and trainees discuss excellence in medical care. Residents should participate in scholarly activity per Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Consultation-Liaison (CL) psychiatry focuses on caring for patients presenting with psychiatric complications in general hospital. Post-residency subspecialty CL fellowship training plays a big role in creating future leaders in CL. Our program decided to conduct annual CL grand rounds fully allotted to discuss complex CL psychiatry cases in medical setting. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of resident's interest in pursuing CL fellowship. We compared the number of residents pursuing CL fellowship after the CL grand rounds to the previous years starting 2005 when CL was recognized as an ACGME approved subspecialty. We also compared our program residents pursuing CL psychiatry fellowship to national trend obtained from National Residency Matching Program (NRMP). RESULTS: From 2013 to 2018, CL grand rounds n=8, Number of residents graduated from 2013 to 2018 n=26. Number of residents pursued CL fellowship from 2013 to 2018 n=3 (11.5%) compared to no residents pursuing CL fellowship before 2013. Fisher's exact test to compare and examine the data from the residents pursuing CL fellowship after implementation of the CL grand rounds is 0.0668 (p value < 0.10). When combining all the available NRMP match results for CL from 2015 to 2019, a total of 531 positions were offered and 359 positions were filled (fill rate of 67.6%). In our program, after we implemented the annual CL grand rounds, 11.5% of the residents from 2013 to 2018 pursued CL fellowship, which is higher than the likely national average of 5.7%. CONCLUSION: Our residency program grand rounds educational module appears to nurture and sustain interest in CL subspecialty compared to previous years. Prospective studies are required.
