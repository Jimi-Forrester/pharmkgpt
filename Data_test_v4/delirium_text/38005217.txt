38005217|a|The number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise and, despite the efforts of researchers, there are still no effective treatments for this multifaceted disease. The main objective of this work was the search for multifunctional and more effective anti-Alzheimer agents. Herein, we report the evaluation of a library of quercetin-1,2,3-triazole hybrids (I-IV) in antioxidant, hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress protection, and cholinesterases (AChE and BuChE) inhibitory activities. Hybrids IIf and IVa-d showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity on eqBuChE (IC50 values between 11.2 and 65.7 muM). Hybrid IIf, the best inhibitor, was stronger than galantamine, displaying an IC50 value of 11.2 muM for eqBuChE, and is also a competitive inhibitor. Moreover, toxicity evaluation for the most promising hybrids was performed using the Artemia salina toxicity assay, showing low toxicity. Hybrids IIf, IVb, and IVd did not affect viability at 12.5 muM and also displayed a protective effect against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide in cell damage in MCF-7 cells. Hybrids IIf, IVb, and IVd act as multifunctional ligands in AD pathologies.
