34638388|t|Remodeling the Tumor Myeloid Landscape to Enhance Antitumor Antibody Immunotherapies.
34638388|a|Among the diverse tumor resident immune cell types, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are often the most abundant, possess an anti-inflammatory phenotype, orchestrate tumor immune evasion and are frequently associated with poor prognosis. However, TAMs can also be harnessed to destroy antibody-opsonized tumor cells through the process of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Clinically important tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as Rituximab, Herceptin and Cetuximab, function, at least in part, by inducing macrophages to eliminate tumor cells via ADCP. For IgG mAb, this is mediated by antibody-binding activating Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaR), with resultant phagocytic activity impacted by the level of co-engagement with the single inhibitory FcgammaRIIb. Approaches to enhance ADCP in the tumor microenvironment include the repolarization of TAMs to proinflammatory phenotypes or the direct augmentation of ADCP by targeting so-called 'phagocytosis checkpoints'. Here we review the most promising new strategies targeting the cell surface molecules present on TAMs, which include the inhibition of 'don't eat me signals' or targeting immunostimulatory pathways with agonistic mAb and small molecules to augment tumor-targeting mAb immunotherapies and overcome therapeutic resistance.
