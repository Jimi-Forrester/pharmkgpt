37373475|a|Recent studies show that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves cognitive and motor functions in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Gamma rhythm low-field magnetic stimulation (LFMS) is a new non-invasive rTMS technique that generates diffused and low-intensity magnetic stimulation to the deep cortical and subcortical areas. To investigate the potential therapeutic effects of LFMS in PD, we subjected an experimental mouse model to LFMS (as an early treatment). We examined the LFMS effect on motor functions as well as neuronal and glial activities in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated male C57BL/6J mice. Mice received MPTP injection (30 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 5 days) followed by LFMS treatment, 20 min each day for 7 days. LFMS treatment improved motor functions compared with the sham-treated MPTP mice. Further, LFMS significantly improved tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and non-significantly in striatal (ST) regions. LFMS treatment improved neuronal nuclei (NeuN) levels in SNpc. Our findings suggest that early LFMS treatment improves neuronal survival and, in turn, motor functions in MPTP-treated mice. Further investigation is required to clearly define the molecular mechanisms by which LFMS improves motor and cognitive function in PD patients.
