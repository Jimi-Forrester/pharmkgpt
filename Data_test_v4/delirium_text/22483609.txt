22483609|t|Lead optimization of 4,4-biaryl piperidine amides as gamma-secretase inhibitors.
22483609|a|Alzheimer's disease is a major unmet medical need with pathology characterized by extracellular proteinaceous plaques comprised primarily of beta-amyloid. gamma-Secretase is a critical enzyme in the cellular pathway responsible for the formation of a range of beta-amyloid peptides; one of which, Abeta42, is believed to be responsible for the neuropathological features of the disease. Herein, we report 4,4 disubstituted piperidine gamma-secretase inhibitors that were optimized for in vitro cellular potency and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Key agents were further characterized for their ability to lower cerebral Abeta42 production in an APP-YAC mouse model. This structural series generally suffered from sub-optimal pharmacokinetics but hypothesis driven lead optimization enabled the discovery of gamma-secretase inhibitors capable of lowering cerebral Abeta42 production in mice.
