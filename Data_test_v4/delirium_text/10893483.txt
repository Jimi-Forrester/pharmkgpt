10893483|t|Genetic association study between alpha 1-antichymotrypsin polymorphism and Alzheimer disease in Chinese Han population.
10893483|a|We investigated a common signal peptide polymorphism in the alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) gene in 125 sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and 141 healthy control subjects in Chinese Han population. We found no significant difference in the distribution of ACT polymorphism between AD cases and controls, and failed to detect any effects of ACT genotypes associated with AD. Thus, our data do not support the involvement of ACT polymorphism in the risk of AD in Chinese Han population. Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 96:133-135, 2000.
