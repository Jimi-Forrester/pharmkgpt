38910046|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a severe complication of flap transplantation surgery, adversely affecting surgical prognoses. The intricate pathophysiology of postoperative delirium renders the elucidation of its risk factors challenging. This research aims to delineate the prevalence and the specific risk factors of postoperative delirium in patients with cancer undergoing free flap reconstruction through a systematic review and meta-analysis to enlighten proactive prevention measures. METHODS: The researchers systematically queried both the international and Chinese databases. Searches were performed for publications from inception until September 14, 2023, using the terms "free tissue flaps," "delirium," "neoplasms," and "risk factors." Data synthesis and statistical analysis were conducted using Stata SE (version 15.0) to calculate the combined effect size for identified risk factors. Reported outcomes included weighted mean differences or odds ratios with their respective 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Twelve case-control studies were included (ntotal = 3,256). Among them, 515 patients developed postoperative delirium after free flap surgery, compared with 2,741 patients who did not. The outcomes suggest that the risk factors include but are not limited to age, male, late neoplasm staging, use of hypnotic or antipsychotic, history of background diseases, psychiatric review, tracheotomy, and impaired wound healing. In contrast, early neoplasm staging and others are the protective factors with statistical significance. Multivariate analysis further identified significant correlations between preoperative albumin, perioperative blood transfusion, sleep disturbance, postoperative visual analog scale, postoperative albumin, smoking, and the appearance of postoperative delirium. CONCLUSION: The determined risk factors were grouped into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative categories substantiated by current data to present instructions for postoperative delirium prevention.
