36229634|a|Blood pressure variability is an emerging risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in older adults, independent of average blood pressure levels. Growing evidence suggests increased blood pressure variability is linked to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology indexed by cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography markers, but relationships with plasma Alzheimer's disease markers have not been investigated. In this cross-sectional study of 54 community-dwelling older adults (aged 55-88, mean age 69.9 [8.2 SD]), elevated blood pressure variability over 5 min was associated with lower levels of plasma Abeta1-42 (standardized ss =  - 0.36 [95% CI - 0.61, - 0.12]; p = 0.005; adjusted R2 = 0.28) and Abeta1-42: Abeta1-40 ratio (ss =  - 0.49 [95% CI - 0.71, - 0.22]; p < 0.001; adjusted R2 = 0.28), and higher levels of total tau (ss = 0.27 [95% CI 0.01, 0.54]; p = 0.04; adjusted R2 = 0.19) and Ptau181:Abeta1-42 ratio (ss = 0.26 [95% CI 0.02, 0.51]; p = 0.04; adjusted R2 = 0.22). Findings suggest higher blood pressure variability is linked to plasma biomarkers of increased Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
