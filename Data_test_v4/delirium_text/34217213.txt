34217213|a|Developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1) is a secretory, multifunctional domain protein. It can bind to integrins and phosphatidylserine. As a local tissue signal, it plays a regulatory role in the cancer microenvironment and inflammation. Del-1 has destructive effects in most cancers and is associated with the progression and invasion of some cancers. In contrast, Del-1 also plays a protective role in inflammation. Del-1 regulates inflammation by regulating the generation of neutrophils in bone marrow, inhibiting the recruitment and migration of neutrophils and accelerating the clearance of neutrophils by macrophages. Del-1 and IL-17 are reciprocally regulated, and their balance maintains immune system homeostasis. Del-1 is expected to become a new therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis.
