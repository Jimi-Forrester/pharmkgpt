30234712|a|Many studies have reported the recovery ability of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) for neural diseases. In this study, the authors explored the roles of UC-MSCs to treat the traumatic brain injury. Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from healthy neonatal rat umbilical cord immediately after delivery. The traumatic brain injury (TBI) model was formed by the classical gravity method. The authors detected the behavior changes and measured the levels of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-lbeta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks after transplantation between TBI treated and untreated with UC-MSCs. Simultaneously, the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA.The authors found that the group of transplantation UC-MSCs has a significant improvement than other group treated by phosphate buffered saline. In the behavioral test, the Neurological Severity Scores of UC-MSCs + TBI group were lower than TBI group (P < 0.05), but not obviously higher than control group at 2, 3, and 4week, respectively. The inflammatory factors are significantly reduced comparison with TBI group (P < 0.05), but both GDNF and BDNF were higher than TBI group (P < 0.05). The results indicated that UC-MSCs might play an important role in TBI recovery through inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors and increasing the expression of GDNF and BDNF.
