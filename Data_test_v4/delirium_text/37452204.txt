37452204|a|PURPOSE: Acute epididymo-orchitis (AEO) is a common urological condition characterised by pain and swelling of the epididymis which can affect men of any age. The aetiology and to some extent the management of the patient differ between paediatric and young and older adult groups. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed at the University Hospital Limerick from 2012 to 2016. Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) data were obtained for all patients diagnosed with orchitis, epididymitis, epididymo-orchitis or testicular abscess over this 5-year period. RESULTS: 140 patients were identified, the age range was 0-89, median age 35.6. These were then split into 3 clinical groups, pre-pubertal (Group 1, 0-15-year-olds), sexually active young men (Group 2a, 16-35-year-olds) and men over 35 (Group 2b). Nine patients had an abscess on ultrasound investigation. There was a significant correlation between the presence of an abscess and the need for an orchidectomy (2 patients, P = 0.035). Two patients were reported as having an atrophic testis following AEO and both were in Group 2b. CONCLUSION: Overall, 7/131 (5%) patients had loss or atrophy of a testicle following an episode of AEO. Nineteen patients had further readmissions with AEO (14%).
