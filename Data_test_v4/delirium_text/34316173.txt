34316173|a|BACKGROUND: This study was pointed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valerian and lemon balm additional to the quetiapine in critically ill patients with delirium and agitation. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Fifty-three adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients (according to ICU Confusion Assessment Method scores) who were treated for delirium received quetiapine and Neurogol syrup (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) or placebo 5 mL every 12 hours for five consecutive days. Improvement in agitation according to the Richmond Sedation and Restlessness Scale was considered the main outcome. RESULTS: The trial was completed for 53 patients (27 in the treatment group and 26 in the placebo group). The baseline characteristics between the groups were similar. In the treatment group, the number of agitated patients was significantly reduced and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Compared with the placebo group, the length of ICU stay in the treatment group was significantly reduced (p = 0.001). The Glasgow Coma Scale improved significantly at the end of day 5 (p = 0.04). There was no statistical difference in the improvement of delirium between the study groups (p = 0.14). Neurogol syrup was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The addition of Neurogol to quetiapine (a combination of valerian and lemon balm) can reduce agitation and shorten the length of stay in the ICU without adverse effects. Clearly, more research is still needed to investigate the role of herbal medicines in ICUs and their efficacy and safety. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Alikiaie B, Shahmoradi E, Yekdaneh A, Mousavi S.
