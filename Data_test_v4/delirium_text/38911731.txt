38911731|t|Coprisin/Compound K Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles Induced Cell Death through Apoptosis and Ferroptosis Pathway in Adenocarcinoma Gastric Cells.
38911731|a|Ferroptosis and apoptosis are programmed cell death pathways with distinct characteristics. Sometimes, cancer cells are aided by the induction of a different pathway, such as ferroptosis, when they develop chemoresistance and avoid apoptosis. Identifying the nanomedicine that targets dual pathways is considered as one of the best strategies for diverse cancer types. In our previous work, we synthesized gold nanoparticles (GNP) utilizing Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens in conjunction with compound K (CK) and coprisin (CopA3), yielding GNP-CK-CopA3. Here, we assessed the inhibitory effect of GNP-CK-CopA3 on AGS cells and the induction of apoptosis using Hoechst and PI, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we conducted downstream proteomic analysis and molecular dynamic stimulation to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our investigation of cultured AGS cells treated with varying concentrations of GNP-CK-CopA3 demonstrated the anticancer properties of these nanoparticles. Penetration of GNP-CK-CopA3 into AGS cells was visualized using an enhanced dark field microscope. Apoptosis induction was initially confirmed by treating AGS cells with GNP-CK-CopA3, as evidenced by staining with dyes such as Hoechst and PI. Additionally, mitochondrial disruption and cellular localization induced by GNP-CK-CopA3 were validated through Mito-tracker staining and transmission electron microscopy images. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was used to distinguish early and late-stage apoptosis or necrosis based on fluorescence patterns. The gene expression of apoptotic markers indicated the initiation of cellular apoptosis. Further, proteomic analysis suggested that the treatment of GNP-CK-CopA3 to AGS cells led to the suppression of 439 proteins and the stimulation of 832 proteins. Among these, ferroptosis emerged as a significant interconnected pathway where glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and glutathione synthetase (GSS) were significant interacting proteins. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies confirmed the binding affinity and stability between CopA3 and CK with GSS and GPX4 proteins, suggesting the role of GNP-CK-CopA3 in ferroptosis induction. Overall, our study showed GNP-CK-CopA3 could play a dual role by inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis to induce AGS cell death.
