31091338|t|Amyloid beta25-35 impairs docosahexaenoic acid efflux by down-regulating fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1/SLC27A1) protein expression in human brain capillary endothelial cells.
31091338|a|Decreased levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an endogenous neuroprotective compound, in the brain are associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that DHA is a substrate of fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1/SLC27A1), and FATP1 is localized at the abluminal membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells. We hypothesized that amyloid beta (Abeta) decreases FATP1-mediated cellular efflux (i.e. supply to the brain) of DHA at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we tested this hypothesis using a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line, human cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), as a BBB model. The efflux of DHA-d5 by hCMEC/D3 cells increased time-dependently up to 3 min. Knock-down of FATP1 with specific siRNA indicated that FATP1-mediated efflux accounts for 47.0% of this DHA-d5 efflux. In hCMEC/D3 cells treated with Abeta25-35 (10 muM/24 h), which we employed as an in vitro model of the BBB in AD, FATP1 protein expression in the plasma membrane was decreased by 96.0%, which was greater than the decrease in the whole-cell lysate, and the DHA-d5 efflux was decreased by 68.3%. Of this 68.3% decrease, 45.1% (47.0 x 0.96) is accounted for by the decrease in FATP1-mediated efflux and the remaining 23.2% is presumably mediated by other mechanism(s). Thus, we have established for the first time that FATP1 is a major contributor to DHA efflux from human brain capillary endothelial cells, and its efflux activity at the abluminal membrane of the cells is blocked by Abeta. This may explain the decreased DHA level in the brain of AD patients.
