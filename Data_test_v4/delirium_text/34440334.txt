34440334|t|Post-Translational Modification of MRE11: Its Implication in DDR and Diseases.
34440334|a|Maintaining genomic stability is vital for cells as well as individual organisms. The meiotic recombination-related gene MRE11 (meiotic recombination 11) is essential for preserving genomic stability through its important roles in the resection of broken DNA ends, DNA damage response (DDR), DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair, and telomere maintenance. The post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, regulate directly the function of MRE11 and endow MRE11 with capabilities to respond to cellular processes in promptly, precisely, and with more diversified manners. Here in this paper, we focus primarily on the PTMs of MRE11 and their roles in DNA response and repair, maintenance of genomic stability, as well as their association with diseases such as cancer.
