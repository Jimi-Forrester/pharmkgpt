32368420|a|Gallbladder neuroendocrine neoplasms (GB-NEN) are very rare neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). GB-NEN can present as carcinoid or typical/atypical carcinoid or small cell carcinoma. Most of the GB-NENs present as gall bladder polyps or stones with right upper quadrant pain, nausea and non-specific symptoms which leads to clinical misdiagnosis. Considering the rare occurrence of GB-NENs, and lack of multi-center research data there is no unified standard for identification and treatment. We here present an 84-year-old male presenting with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, and eventually diagnosed with mixed cell (more of small cells mixed with intermediate to large cells) neuroendocrine cancer of gall bladder.
