28585095|t|A clinical review of inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane: from early research to emerging topics.
28585095|a|A large number of studies during the past two decades have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sevoflurane across patient populations. Clinical researchers have also investigated the effects of sevoflurane, its hemodynamic characteristics, its potential protective effects on several organ systems, and the incidence of delirium and cognitive deficiency. This review examines the clinical profiles of sevoflurane and other anesthetic agents, and focuses upon emerging topics such as organ protection, postoperative cognitive deficiency and delirium, and novel ways to improve postanesthesia outcomes.
