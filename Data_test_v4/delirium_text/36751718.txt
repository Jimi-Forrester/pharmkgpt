36751718|t|Maintaining Continuity of Self as Perceived by People in the Early Stages of Dementia: A Qualitative Study.
36751718|a|AIM: The purpose of this study is to shed light on the sense of self that occurs among those who have been diagnosed with the early stages of dementia, where the individual attempts to maintain continuity within their world. METHOD: The research was conducted using qualitative induction research methods and data were collected using semi-structured interview methods. The data were reported according to COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ). RESULTS: The diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease for all participants. Of the 15 participants, 6 were male and 9 female. The average age was 69.9 years. For those with the early stages of dementia, a sense of self that attempts to maintain continuity for the world in which they live is made up of the following: "living in the present while connecting to the past," "relying on those that help to connect and fill in the gaps between the past, present, and very near future," and "living daily life in one's own world where past and present are connected." CONCLUSION: By understanding the sense of self that those who are diagnosed with the early stages of dementia experience while trying to maintain continuity within their world, one is able to get closer to their world and it is hoped that this may provide hints as to how to offer support in the future.
