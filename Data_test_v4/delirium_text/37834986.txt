37834986|t|Association between Antidepressants and Dementia Risk in Older Adults with Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37834986|a|Depression, commonly treated with antidepressants, is associated with an increased risk of dementia, especially in older adults. However, the association between antidepressant use and dementia risk is unclear. We searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane on 1 February 2022, restricting to full texts in English. Since dementia is a chronic disease requiring a long induction time, we restricted studies with >=1 year follow-up. We extracted the relative risk (RR) adjusted for the most variables from each study and evaluated the heterogeneity using I square (I2). The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO International Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42022338038). We included six articles in the systematic review, of which the sample size ranged from 716 to 141,740, and the median length of follow-up was 5 years. The pooled RR was 1.21 (95% CI = 1.12-1.29) with an I2 of 71%. Our findings suggest that antidepressant use was associated with an increased risk of dementia in older adults with depression, yet moderate to high heterogeneity existed across studies. Future work accounting for the depression progression is needed to differentiate the effect of depression and antidepressants on dementia risk.
