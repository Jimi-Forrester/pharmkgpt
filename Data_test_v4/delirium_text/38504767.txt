38504767|t|A case of surgical treatment for bronchial foreign bodies with obstructive pneumonia.
38504767|a|Children and older adults are prone to unintentional foreign body aspiration. A 69-year-old man with fever and anorexia presented with obstructive pneumonia resulting from foreign body aspiration. Attempts to remove the foreign body using a bronchoscope failed due to its adhesion to the periphery of the bronchus. Although antibiotic therapy did not improve the obstructive pneumonia caused by the bronchial foreign body, surgery enabled an improvement. The surgical specimen showed similar pathological findings as the fine brown granular material observed in root granulomas occurring as a complication following leakage of root canal filling used in the treatment of dental caries. Therefore, the bronchial foreign body may have been a dental filling. Case reports describing surgical improvement of difficult-to-remove bronchial foreign bodies with concurrent infection are rare.
