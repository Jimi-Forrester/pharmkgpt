29983487|t|Computer-Aided Multi-Target Management of Emergent Alzheimer's Disease.
29983487|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an enormous global health burden in terms of human suffering and economic cost. AD management requires a shift from the prevailing paradigm targeting pathogenesis to design and develop effective drugs with adequate success in clinical trials. Therefore, it is of interest to report a review on amyloid beta (Abeta) effects and other multi-targets including cholinesterase, NFTs, tau protein and TNF associated with brain cell death to be neuro-protective from AD. It should be noted that these molecules have been generated either by target-based or phenotypic methods. Hence, the use of recent advancements in nanomedicine and other natural compounds screening tools as a feasible alternative for circumventing specific liabilities is realized. We review recent developments in the design and identification of neuro-degenerative compounds against AD generated using current advancements in computational multi-target modeling algorithms reflected by theragnosis (combination of diagnostic tests and therapy) concern.
