26682770|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The involvement of metabolic factors in the development of dementia has received much attention. However, previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding how blood adipocytokine level impacts cognitive decline and dementia. This study aimed to clarify whether serum high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin level is related to incident dementia. METHODS: Data were from 466 patients (mean age 67.8 years, male 57%)--who had normal cognitive function and received brain magnetic resonance imaging--from amongst the 1106 patients in the Osaka Follow-up Study for Carotid Atherosclerosis, Part 2, a prospective cohort study of cardiovascular events and dementia amongst patients with vascular risk factors enrolled between 2001 and 2009. Baseline HMW adiponectin levels were measured using frozen serum. Dementia occurrence was examined in June 2013. RESULTS: Serum HMW adiponectin level was 4.33 +- 2.95 mug/ml; the levels were lower in men than in women and negatively correlated with body mass index. During the follow-up period (median 6.9 years), 47 patients had incident dementia including Alzheimer's disease dementia (27), vascular dementia (13), mixed dementia (four), other dementia (three). Risks of dementia in patients with high versus low HMW adiponectin levels were almost identical (P = 0.689). No association was found between adiponectin levels and Alzheimer's disease dementia or vascular dementia in the whole group or amongst men and women separately. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that serum HMW adiponectin level has little association with future dementia. Determination of metabolic factors involved in dementia requires evaluation of other biomarkers or parameters.
