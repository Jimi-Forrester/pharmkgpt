Methods: A sample of 107 participants (i.e., 65 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 42 controls) were recruited and followed up for 40 months. At baseline, they underwent assessment with the ViewMind digital biomarker, which draws cognitive-related patterns of eye movement while people perform the visual short-term memory binding task. Results: Baseline data predicted that 36 patients with MCI would progress to the AD clinical syndrome (ADS Progressing). The remaining 29 MCI patients were predicted to remain as MCI or progress to other forms of dementia. After 40 months of follow-up, 94% of ADS Progressing patients had received a diagnosis of dementia, whereas none of the non-ADS Progressing had. Discussion: The analysis of eye movement behavior combined with cognitive markers for AD can effectively predict progression to ADS among patients with MCI.
