37863934|a|This study investigated the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress (OS), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), ADAMTS (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs), and neuropathology associated with coenurus cerebralis (Taenia multiceps). ADAMTS-13, HMGB1, glutathione reductase (GR), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expression levels were studied. The study found that ADAMTS-13 (P < 0.005), HMGB1 (P < 0.005), GR (P < 0.005), Cu/Zn SOD (P < 0.005), and 8-OHdG (P < 0.005) levels were significantly higher in T. multiceps (c. cerebralis)-infected animals compared to healthy control animals. This study's most important finding was that HMGB1 up-regulation in neurons, endothelial cells, and glial cells can directly cause brain parenchymal destruction and that HMGB1-mediated oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the neuropathogenesis of coenurosis. The results also showed that increased levels of ADAMTS-13 may play a pivotal role in regulating and protecting the blood-brain barrier integrity and neuroprotection. These findings also suggest that ADAMTS-13 and HMGB1 compete in the prevention or formation of microthrombi, which was regarded as a remarkable finding. ADAMTS-13 and HMGB1 are valuable biomarkers for disease risk assessment, estimating host neuropathy following T. multiceps (c. cerebralis) exposure, and providing a new therapeutic target. This is the first study to show that HMGB1 and ADAMTS-13 are expressed in reactive cells and are associated with neuroimmunopathology in coenurosis.
