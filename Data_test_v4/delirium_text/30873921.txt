30873921|t|N-alkylated Tacrine Derivatives as Potential Agents in Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.
30873921|a|BACKGROUND: Based on the prevalence studies, the number of people suffering from dementia will almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050, assuming no changes in mortality, effective preventative measures, definitive diagnostic guidelines or curative treatment. From the abovementioned epidemiological data, it is obvious that dementia constitutes a major public health problem not only at present, but unfortunately also in the future. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Several N-alkylated tacrine (THA) derivatives have already been synthesized by Pomponi et al., in 1997. However, these compounds were tested for their anti-AChE activity using enzyme isolated from Electrophorus electricus. For this reason, we have decided to extend the previously reported series of THA derivatives and consequently test them in the battery of experiments, the results of which have served to more relevant evaluation of these compounds from the perspective of Alzeimer s disease compared to that published by Pomponi. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In summary, all compounds of interest effectively inhibited ChEs in vitro. One of the most promising derivatives 8 bearing an N-octyl chain showed 2.5-fold higher AChE inhibitory activity in relation to tacrine. With respect to blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, it can be claimed that synthesized analogues are presumably able to cross the BBB. From the point of view of hepatotoxicity, selected Nalkylated tacrine derivatives exerted worse results compared to tacrine. However, in vitro results are only illustrative, therefore, only in vivo experiments could determine the real value of selected N-alkylated THA derivatives.
