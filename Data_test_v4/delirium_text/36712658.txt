36712658|a|Background: Older people experience greater morbidity with a corresponding increase in medication use resulting in a potentially higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Objectives: The aim of this study was to; 1) determine the prevalence and characteristics of ADR-related hospital admissions among older patients (>=65 years) in Ireland; and 2) identify the risk factors associated with ADR-related hospital admissions. Methods: A cross-sectional study of ADR prevalence in patients aged >=65 years admitted acutely to hospital in Ireland over a 8 month period (November 2016- June 2017). A multifaceted review of each hospital admission was undertaken to assess the likelihood of an ADR being a reason for admission (cause of admission or contributing to admission) in the context of the patient's medication, clinical conditions, comorbidities and investigations. A number of decision aids were applied by two independent reviewers to assess ADR causality, avoidability and severity. A random sample of patients, determined not to have a suspected ADR on screening, were assigned to a non-ADR control group. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between potential risk factors for ADR-related admissions compared with non-ADR-related admissions. Results: In total, 3,760 hospital admission episodes (in 3,091 patients) were screened and 377 admissions were considered ADR-related (10.0%, 95% CI 9.1%, 11.0%). 219 (58.1%) ADR-related admissions were caused by an ADR, while ADRs contributed to 158 (41.9%) admissions. 268 (71.1%) of all ADR-related admissions were deemed definitely or possibly preventable/avoidable. 350 (92.8%) ADRs were classified as being of moderate severity, with 27 (7.2%) classified as severe. Antithrombotic agents, mainly aspirin and warfarin, were the drugs most frequently associated with ADR-related admissions (gastrointestinal and vascular haemorrhagic disorders). In multivariable analysis, immobility, frailty, having delirium or ulcer disease and taking anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication on admission were significantly associated with an ADR-related hospital admission. Conclusion: One in ten hospital admissions, among those aged 65 + years, were considered ADR-related, with approximately 70% potentially avoidable. Reliable and validated ADR detection and prediction tools are needed to develop prevention strategies.
