39080359|t|Diagnostic and predictive power of plasma proteins in Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in China.
39080359|a|Convenient and effective biomarkers are essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the cross-sectional study, 103 patients with AD, 82 patients with aMCI and 508 normal controls (NC) were enrolled. The single-molecule array (Simoa) technique was used to assess the levels of plasma proteins, including NfL, T-tau, P-tau-181, Abeta40, Abeta42. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess the overall cognitive function of all subjects. Moreover, Amyloid PET and structural head MRI were also performed in a subset of the population. In the follow-up, the previous 508 normal older adults were followed up for two years, then COX regression analysis was used to investigate the association between baseline plasma proteins and future cognitive outcomes. NfL, T-tau, P-tau-181, Abeta40, Abeta42 and Abeta42/40 were altered in AD dementia, and NfL, Abeta42 and Abeta42/40 significantly outperformed all plasma proteins in differentiating AD dementia from NC, while NfL and Abeta42/40 could effectively distinguish between aMCI and NC. However, only plasma NfL was associated with future cognitive decline, and it was negatively correlated with MoCA (r = - 0.298, p < 0.001) and the volume of the left globus pallidus (r = - 0.278, p = 0.033). Plasma NfL can help distinguish between cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals (MCI/dementia) at the syndrome level. However, since we have not introduced other biomarkers for AD, such as PET CT or cerebrospinal fluid, and have not verified in other neurodegenerative diseases, whether plasma NFL can be used as a biomarker for AD needs to be further studied and explored.
