38178795|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is described as acute brain dysfunction that often fluctuates throughout the day and is highly prevalent in hospitalized adults. Delirium negatively affects patient outcomes with consequences including decreased cognitive functioning and increased mortality and healthcare costs. Furthermore, neurological patients are at increased risk for developing delirium due to their underlying diagnoses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this evidence-based practice project was to evaluate the long-term impact of nursing education and use of trained volunteers to prevent the development of delirium in an inpatient neuroscience unit. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: This was a pre-post designed evidence-based practice project to educate and prioritize nursing care interventions for delirium prevention compared to a delirium management framework. The interventions included delirium education for nurses and nursing assistants along with the development of a specialized volunteer program to implement non-pharmacological, multi-component delirium prevention interventions. Long-term sustainment and enculturation occurred over the subsequent year. OUTCOMES: The baseline data collection period included 2520 patients. The intervention period included 4515 patients, with both groups being similar in age, race, gender, and length of stay. The total number of patients with a discharge diagnosis of delirium decreased from 29.2% to 19.8% (p < .001). Fewer patients in the intervention group were discharged to a skilled nursing facility (p < .001) and other post-acute facility (p = .008), along with more patients being discharged to home care (p < .001). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This evidence-based practice project demonstrates long-term sustained reduction of delirium in the neuroscience population. Despite the challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, delirium prevention strategies were found to be effective in decreasing the rate at which patients develop delirium.
