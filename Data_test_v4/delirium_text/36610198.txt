36610198|a|Alterations in cerebral perfusion is increasingly considered to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and together with accumulated amyloid-beta, deficiencies in the brain microvascular circulation may result in local hypoxia. Here, we studied alterations in cerebral circulation and the correlation between amyloid-beta load and cerebral perfusion in prodromal AD (pAD). Using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI and PET, we evaluated cerebral perfusion and amyloid-beta levels in 19 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and high amyloid-beta load (pAD-MCI), 13 MCI individuals without AD pathology and 21 healthy controls. The pAD-MCI group showed significantly lower microvascular blood flow and significantly higher heterogeneity of microvascular blood transit times (p < 0.01) compared with the other 2 groups. Additionally, in the pAD-MCI group raised amyloid-beta levels correlated with decreased microvascular blood flow and increased heterogeneity of microvascular blood flow in frontal and temporal areas (p < 0.01). These results indicate a close connection between levels of amyloid-beta deposition and brain microvascular perfusion in pAD. A vicious cycle may be established where amyloid-beta load and deficiencies in brain perfusion may reinforce each other.
