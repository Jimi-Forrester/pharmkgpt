34489686|t|Postmortem Neocortical 3H-PiB Binding and Levels of Unmodified and Pyroglutamate Abeta in Down Syndrome and Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.
34489686|a|Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have a genetic predisposition for amyloid-beta (Abeta) overproduction and earlier onset of Abeta deposits compared to patients with sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) with Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) detects fibrillar Abeta pathology in living people with DS and AD, but its relationship with heterogeneous Abeta forms aggregated within amyloid deposits is not well understood. We performed quantitative in vitro 3H-PiB binding assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of fibrillar (insoluble) unmodified Abeta40 and Abeta42 forms and N-terminus truncated and pyroglutamate-modified AbetaNpE3-40 and AbetaNpE3-42 forms in postmortem frontal cortex and precuneus samples from 18 DS cases aged 43-63 years and 17 late-onset AD cases aged 62-99 years. Both diagnostic groups had frequent neocortical neuritic plaques, while the DS group had more severe vascular amyloid pathology (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA). Compared to the AD group, the DS group had higher levels of Abeta40 and AbetaNpE3-40, while the two groups did not differ by Abeta42 and AbetaNpE3-42 levels. This resulted in lower ratios of Abeta42/Abeta40 and AbetaNpE3-42/AbetaNpE3-40 in the DS group compared to the AD group. Correlations of Abeta42/Abeta40 and AbetaNpE3-42/AbetaNpE3-40 ratios with CAA severity were strong in DS cases and weak in AD cases. Pyroglutamate-modified Abeta levels were lower than unmodified Abeta levels in both diagnostic groups, but within group proportions of both pyroglutamate-modified Abeta forms relative to both unmodified Abeta forms were lower in the DS group but not in the AD group. The two diagnostic groups did not differ by 3H-PiB binding levels. These results demonstrate that compared to late-onset AD cases, adult DS individuals with similar severity of neocortical neuritic plaques and greater CAA pathology have a preponderance of both pyroglutamate-modified AbetaNpE3-40 and unmodified Abeta40 forms. Despite the distinct molecular profile of Abeta forms and greater vascular amyloidosis in DS cases, cortical 3H-PiB binding does not distinguish between diagnostic groups that are at an advanced level of amyloid plaque pathology. This underscores the need for the development of CAA-selective PET radiopharmaceuticals to detect and track the progression of cerebral vascular amyloid deposits in relation to Abeta plaques in individuals with DS.
