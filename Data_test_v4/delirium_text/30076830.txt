30076830|a|The focus of this study is the expression of Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3), a receptor for double-stranded RNA, in human brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Toll-like receptors are a family of pattern recognition molecules primarily involved in host defenses to microbial pathogens, but roles in neurodegenerative disease have also been shown, as amyloid beta (Abeta) can be a ligand for TLR-2 and -4 and alpha-synuclein for TLR-1 and TLR-2, while TLR-9 activation promotes Abeta removal. However, involvement of TLR-3 in AD has not been rigorously studied. Immunohistochemical analyses in human temporal cortical sections with a validated antibody for TLR-3 predominantly identified microglia, particularly strongly in cells associated with amyloid plaques, also brain vascular endothelial cells and subsets of astrocytes, but not neurons or p62-immunoreactive structures. Microglial TLR-3 colocalized with the endosomal/lysosomal marker CD68, which identifies phagocytic cells. Quantitative analyses of neuropathologically-staged human brain middle temporal gyrus samples using immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression methods demonstrated increased TLR-3 immunoreactivity and increased TLR-3 mRNA in AD compared to non-demented cases. There were significant positive correlations between TLR-3 mRNA levels and plaque or tangle loads in both series of samples. Increased expression of interferon beta (IFN-beta) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 mRNA, two factors induced by TLR-3 signaling, were detected in the AD cases. Increased expression of TLR-4 and TLR-9 mRNA was also observed in these same samples, but not TLR-2. In vitro cultured human brain microglia responses to Abeta inflammatory activation were not altered by TLR-3 activation with activator polyinosinic;polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), while human brain endothelial cells showed reduction in responses when stimulated with both agents. Treatment of microglia with poly I:C did not increase their uptake and breakdown of Abeta.
