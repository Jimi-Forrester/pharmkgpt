34102130|a|BACKGROUND: Second-generation antipsychotic agents are commonly used by clinicians for the treatment of various psychiatric and medical conditions. Despite their presumed safety, an overdose with olanzapine may lead to the development of anticholinergic toxicity. The anticholinergic toxidrome is characterized by both central and peripheral physical findings. Central anticholinergic syndrome, a term used to describe the symptoms that arise from reduced cholinergic activity in the central nervous system, is characterized primarily by signs and symptoms consistent with hyperactive delirium. Signs of peripheral anticholinergia include mydriasis and blurred vision, tremors, ataxia, fever/hyperthermia, flushed and dry skin, dry oral mucosa, decreased bowel sounds, constipation, and urinary retention, among other symptoms. In extreme cases, central anticholinergic syndrome can be associated with seizures, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse. OBJECTIVE: To provide scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of physostigmine use in cases of anticholinergic toxicity. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the published literature on the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of anticholinergic toxicity. RESULTS: Currently the recommended treatment for olanzapine overdose, as is the case of most severe anticholinergic toxicity cases, involves supportive care, along with cardiac, neurological, and respiratory status monitoring. In addition, we detail the symptoms characteristic of anticholinergic toxicity, using the case of a patient experiencing central anticholinergic syndrome after an overdose with olanzapine. CONCLUSION: Physostigmine, a tertiary acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, can be used to assist in the both the diagnosis and management of severe anticholinergic toxicity associated with an olanzapine overdose, which might be applicable to the antimuscarinic toxidrome associated with the ingestion of agents with significant anticholinergic activity.
