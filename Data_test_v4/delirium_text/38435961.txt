38435961|t|Navigating Pediatric Capnography: A Comprehensive Review of Scope and Limitations.
38435961|a|This review comprehensively explores pediatric capnography, a vital tool in contemporary respiratory monitoring. The overview encompasses the foundational principles of capnography, elucidating its real-time measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) in respiratory gases. The review emphasizes its paramount role in pediatric care and underscores capnography's significance in detecting respiratory abnormalities and guiding timely interventions. The distinctions between mainstream and sidestream capnography, the key to understanding their applications, are meticulously outlined. Addressing the importance of ongoing research and education, the review advocates for a dynamic approach to refine guidelines and optimize capnography utilization in pediatric settings. The conclusion reflects on the scope and limitations of pediatric capnography, acknowledging its transformative impact while advocating for a judicious recognition of constraints. As we navigate the future of pediatric respiratory care, the synergy of research, education, and clinical application emerges as the cornerstone for advancing pediatric capnography to new horizons.
