21820509|a|The aim of the present work was to develop an easy, safe and effective vaccine in Balb/c mice using the Abeta(1-15) peptide as immunogen entrapped in PLGA microparticles to reduce the risk of an adverse T cell-mediated response. Abeta(1-15,) which contains the N-terminal antibody epitope of the full Abeta(1-42) peptide was encapsulated in PLGA by a modified solvent evaporation/extraction technique using a double emulsion system. Microparticles were characterized in terms of size distribution (1.22+-0.28 mum), encapsulation efficiency (75.05+-4.17%), surface associated peptide (59.81+-0.96%) and "in vitro" release profile. Balb/c mice were immunized by subcutaneous and intranasal routes with three 30 mug doses of the peptide microencapsulated in PLGA. A solution of the peptide alone and an emulsion in the Freund's adjuvant were administered subcutaneously as control groups. Antibody levels elicited against the toxic Abeta(1-40) fraction in the serum of PLGA microparticles treated groups were higher than that of the peptide alone groups. Our initial results indicate that immunotherapy with Abeta(1-15) loaded PLGA microparticles could be a promising approach for the future development of a safe vaccine against Alzheimer's disease.
