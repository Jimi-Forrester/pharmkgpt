37787052|a|Phosphorylation of tau at sites associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) likely plays a role in the disease progression. Mitochondrial impairment, correlating with increased presence of phosphorylated tau, has been identified as a contributing factor to neurodegenerative processes in AD. However, how tau phosphorylated at specific sites impacts mitochondrial function has not been fully defined. We examined how AD-relevant phosphomimetics of tau impact selected aspects of mitochondrial biology. To mimic phosphorylation at AD-associated sites, the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) sites in wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tau (T4) were converted to glutamic acid (E) to make pseudo-phosphorylated GFP-tagged Ser-396/404 (2EC) and GFP-tagged Thr-231/Ser-235 (2EM) constructs. These constructs were expressed in immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines, and their impact on specific mitochondrial functions and responses to stressors were measured. Phosphomimetic tau altered mitochondrial distribution. Specifically, mitochondria accumulated in the soma of cells expressing either 2EC or 2EM and neurite-like extensions in 2EC cells were shorter. Additionally, adenosine triphosphate levels were reduced in both 2EC- and 2EM-expressing cells, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increased in 2EC cells during oxidation of succinate when compared to T4-expressing cells. Thapsigargin reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS production in both 2EC and 2EM cells relative to T4 cells, with no significant difference in the effects of rotenone. These results show that tau phosphorylation at specific AD-relevant epitopes negatively affects mitochondria, with the extent of dysfunction and stress response varying according to the sites of phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings show that phosphorylated tau increases mitochondrial susceptibility to stressors and extend our understanding of potential mechanisms whereby phosphorylated tau promotes mitochondria dysfunction in tauopathies, including AD.
