33637793|a|Although it is reported that olanzapine (OLZ), which is an atypical antipsychotic drug, causes sexual dysfunction in men, it is noteworthy that there is not any study evaluating the toxic effects of OLZ on the male reproductive system. In the scope of this research, it was aimed to assess the reproductive toxic effects of OLZ by oral administration of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg of it to male rats for 28 days. For this purpose, sperm concentration, motility and morphology, and DNA damage were determined, and histopathological examination of testis tissue was carried out in rats. Also, the levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone, which play roles in the regulation of reproductive functions, and the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) which play roles in reproductive pathologies as oxidative stress biomarkers, were determined. According to the results, normal sperm morphology was decreased in 5 ve 10 mg/kg OLZ-administered groups, and pathological findings were evident in the testicular structure of the OLZ-administered group when compared with the control group. It was determined that serum LH, FSH, and testosterone levels were decreased in the OLZ-administered group. Also, decreases of GSH levels in testis tissue were determined and evaluated as the markers of the oxidative stress induced by OLZ in the testis. In conclusion, it was determined that reproductive toxic effects were induced in rats by OLZ administration. This pathology was accompanied by alterations of the hormone levels and testicular oxidative stress.
