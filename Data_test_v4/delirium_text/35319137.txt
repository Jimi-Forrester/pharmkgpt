35319137|a|BACKGROUND: People with head and neck cancer (HNC) have complex health care needs; however, limited evidence exists regarding the nature or patterns of service access and use. This study explored the post-discharge health care needs and experiences of individuals with HNC from metropolitan and rural areas. METHODS: Health care appointments and services accessed by people with HNC were collated for 6-month post-treatment. Data analysis of the whole cohort examined patterns of access while journey mapping integrated participants' experiences of recovery. RESULTS: The 6-month service access journey was mapped for 11 people. Rural participants attended a significantly greater number of appointments (p = 0.012), higher canceled/missed appointments (p = 0.013), and saw more professionals (p = 0.007). Rural participants reported higher stress and burden due to service access barriers and unmet needs. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple challenges and inequities exist for rural people with HNC. Findings inform opportunities to enhance the post-treatment recovery of people with HNC in rural areas.
