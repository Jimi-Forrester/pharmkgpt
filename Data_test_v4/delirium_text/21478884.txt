21478884|a|It is well established that retinal neurogenesis in mouse embryos requires the activation of Notch signaling, but is independent of the Wnt signaling pathway. We found that genetic inactivation of Sfrp1 and Sfrp2, two postulated Wnt antagonists, perturbs retinal neurogenesis. In retinas from Sfrp1(-/-); Sfrp2(-/-) embryos, Notch signaling was transiently upregulated because Sfrps bind ADAM10 metalloprotease and downregulate its activity, an important step in Notch activation. The proteolysis of other ADAM10 substrates, including APP, was consistently altered in Sfrp mutants, whereas pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 partially rescued the Sfrp1(-/-); Sfrp2(-/-) retinal phenotype. Conversely, ectopic Sfrp1 expression in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc prevented the expression of Notch targets, and this was restored by the coexpression of Kuzbanian, the Drosophila ADAM10 homolog. Together, these data indicate that Sfrps inhibit the ADAM10 metalloprotease, which might have important implications in pathological events, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
