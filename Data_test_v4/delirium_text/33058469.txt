33058469|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the postoperative complication and mortality rate following laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD) in octogenarians. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing postoperative complication and mortality rates depending on age in a consecutive series of 1890 patients who underwent RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer between 2004 and 2018 in 10 European centres. Outcomes of patients aged <80 years and those aged >=80 years were compared with regard to postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grading) and mortality rate. Cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) after surgery were calculated using the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimator. RESULTS: A total of 1726 patients aged <80 years and 164 aged >=80 years were included in the analysis. The 30- and 90-day rate for high-grade (Clavien-Dindo grades III-V) complications were 15% and 21% for patients aged <80 years compared to 11% and 13% for patients aged >=80 years (P = 0.2 and P = 0.03), respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for pre- and postoperative variables, age >=80 years was not an independent predictor of high-grade complications (odds ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.3-1.1; P = 0.12). The non-cancer-related 90-day mortality was 2.3% for patients aged >=80 years and 1.8% for those aged <80 years, respectively (P = 0.7). The estimated 12-month CSM and OCM rates for those aged <80 years were 8% and 3%, and for those aged >=80 years, 15% and 8%, respectively (P = 0.009 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive approach to RARC with ICUD for bladder cancer in well-selected elderly patients (aged >=80 years) achieved a tolerable high-grade complication rate; the 90-day postoperative mortality rate was driven by cancer progression and the non-cancer-related rate was equivalent to that of patients aged <80 years. However, an increased OCM rate in this elderly group after the first year should be taken into account. These results will support clinicians and patients when balancing cancer-related vs treatment-related risks and benefits.
