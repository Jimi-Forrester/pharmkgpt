39290133|t|Quantification of persulfidation on specific proteins: are we nearly there yet?
39290133|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) played a pivotal role in the early evolution of life on Earth before the predominance of atmospheric oxygen. The legacy of a persistent role for H2S in life's processes recently emerged through its discovery in modern biochemistry as an endogenous cellular signalling modulator involved in numerous biological processes. One major mechanism through which H2S signals is protein cysteine persulfidation, an oxidative post-translational modification. In recent years, chemoproteomic technologies have been developed to allow the global scanning of protein persulfidation targets in mammalian cells and tissues, providing a powerful tool to elucidate the broader impact of altered H2S in organismal physiological health and human disease states. While hundreds of proteins were confirmed to be persulfidated by global persulfidome methodologies, the targeting of specific proteins of interest and the investigation of further mechanistic studies are still underdeveloped due to a lack of stringent specificity of the methods and the inherent instability of persulfides. This review provides an overview of the processes of endogenous H2S production, oxidation, and signalling and highlights the application and limitations of current persulfidation labelling approaches for investigation of this important evolutionarily conserved biological switch for protein function.
