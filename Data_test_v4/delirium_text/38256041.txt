38256041|a|The link between mitochondria and major depressive disorder (MDD) is increasingly evident, underscored both by mitochondria's involvement in many mechanisms identified in depression and the high prevalence of MDD in individuals with mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial functions and energy metabolism are increasingly considered to be involved in MDD's pathogenesis. This study focused on cellular and mitochondrial (dys)function in two atypical cases: an antidepressant non-responding MDD patient ("Non-R") and another with an unexplained mitochondrial disorder ("Mito"). Skin biopsies from these patients and controls were used to generate various cell types, including astrocytes and neurons, and cellular and mitochondrial functions were analyzed. Similarities were observed between the Mito patient and a broader MDD cohort, including decreased respiration and mitochondrial function. Conversely, the Non-R patient exhibited increased respiratory rates, mitochondrial calcium, and resting membrane potential. In conclusion, the Non-R patient's data offered a new perspective on MDD, suggesting a detrimental imbalance in mitochondrial and cellular processes, rather than simply reduced functions. Meanwhile, the Mito patient's data revealed the extensive effects of mitochondrial dysfunctions on cellular functions, potentially highlighting new MDD-associated impairments. Together, these case studies enhance our comprehension of MDD.
