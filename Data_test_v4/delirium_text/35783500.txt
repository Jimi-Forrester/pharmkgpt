35783500|t|Investigating the Relationship between Fingerprint Pattern and Development of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
35783500|a|Statement of the Problem: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) constitutes more than 90% of oral malignancies. The main risk factors of OSCC include cigarette smoking and alcohol. However, since not all smokers or alcohol drinkers develop this disease, other factors have also been suggested including genetic characteristics of every person to be implicated in the probability of developing OSCC. Purpose: Our aim in this study is to investigate the possible relationship between fingerprint patterns and the probability of developing OSCC. Materials and Method: In a cross sectional study, we had 140 patients in 2 groups as OSCC and cancer free. Fingerprints were recorded by fingerprint scanner device. The fingerprint patterns were categorized into three major groups and four subgroups. Groups were tested by chi-square. Results: The relationship between the main fingerprint patterns and incidence of OSCC became significant (p= 0.037). The frequency of the main pattern of Arch was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p< 0.05). Considering the main patterns of Loop and Whorl, no significant difference existed between the two groups. Furthermore, the frequency of subtype patterns of Double Whorl and Central Pocket Whorl was significantly higher in the control group than in the experimental group (p< 0.05). Conclusion: Since dermatoglyphics is contingent upon genetic variations, fingerprint can be used for investigating the susceptibility of people in developing different diseases, though further studies are required in this regard. This method is in no way a substitute for gold standard methods for diagnosis.
