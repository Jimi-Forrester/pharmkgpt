32224069|a|This study investigated the clinicopathological relationship between cognitive dysfunction and Lewy body-related pathology (LRP), and the role of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) in affecting this relationship in the Chinese population. A total of 127 brains with antemortem cognition assessment were collected. The postmortem neuropathological classification of LRP and staging of ADNC were evaluated. Pairwise correlation and ordered logistic regression analysis showed that LRP had a moderate correlation with Global Everyday Cognition scores. The proportion of the people with intermediate and high levels of comorbid ADNC increased with the deterioration of LRP. The fit of the cognition prediction model improved when we incorporated both LRP and ADNC into the model compared with LRP alone. Our study indicated that comorbid ADNC can variably present in patients with Lewy body disease. A combination of LRP and concurrent ADNC improves the prediction of cognitive dysfunction compared with LRP alone. These findings may suggest the potential benefit of combined therapeutic approaches targeting concurrent pathological pathways for the Lewy body diseases in the Chinese population.
