34969353|t|Relationships between plasma expression levels of microRNA-146a and microRNA-132 in epileptic patients and their cognitive, mental and psychological disorders.
34969353|a|We aimed to explore the relationships between the plasma expression levels of microRNA (miR)-146a and miR-132 in epileptic patients and cognitive, mental and psychological disorders. Eighty epileptic patients and seventy healthy subjects as controls were evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD) scales, and plasma samples were collected. MiR-146a and miR-132 levels were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The total incidence rate of cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depression in epilepsy group was 62.5%. Cognitive dysfunction was correlated positively with educational level, but negatively with disease course, duration and type of administration. The frequency and duration of seizures were positively correlated with anxiety. Depression was correlated negatively with educational level, whereas positively with course of disease and number of used drugs. Epileptic patients had significantly higher miR-146a and miR-132 levels than those of healthy controls. The miR-146a and miR-132 levels of patients with complications were significantly higher than those of cases without complications. Their expressions were correlated negatively with total MoCA scale score, but positively with type of complications. MiR-132 expression was positively correlated with the total scores of HAMA and HAMD scales. Plasma miR-146a and miR-132 expressions increased in epileptic patients, and miR-132 expression reflected the severity of epilepsy and predicted the risks of complications.
