15935057|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for the function and survival of neurons that degenerate in the late stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are two forms of BDNF, the BDNF precursor (proBDNF) and mature BDNF, in human brain. Previous studies have shown that BDNF mRNA and protein, including proBDNF, are dramatically decreased in end-stage AD brain. To determine whether this BDNF decrease is an early or late event during the progression of cognitive decline, we used western blotting to measure the relative amounts of BDNF proteins in the parietal cortex of subjects clinically classified with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate AD. We found that the amount of proBDNF decreased 21 and 30% in MCI and AD groups, respectively, as compared with NCI, consistent with our previous results of a 40% decrease in end-stage AD. Mature BDNF was reduced 34 and 62% in MCI and AD groups, respectively. Thus, the decrease in mature BDNF and proBDNF precedes the decline in choline acetyltransferase activity which occurs later in AD. Both proBDNF and mature BDNF levels were positively correlated with cognitive measures such as the Global Cognitive Score and the Mini Mental State Examination score. These results demonstrate that the reduction of both forms of BDNF occurs early in the course of AD and correlates with loss of cognitive function, suggesting that proBDNF and BDNF play a role in synaptic loss and cellular dysfunction underlying cognitive impairment in AD.
