31065590|t|Role of dexmedetomidine in pediatric dental sedation.
31065590|a|Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist with a vast array of properties, making it suitable for sedation in numerous clinical scenarios. Its use was previously restricted to the sedation of intensive care unit patients. However, its use in pediatric dental sedation has been gaining momentum, owing to its high suitability when compared with conventional pediatric sedatives. Its properties range from sedation to anxiolysis to analgesia, due to its sympatholytic properties and minimal respiratory depression ability. Because dexmedetomidine is an efficacious and safe drug, it is gaining importance in pediatric sedation. Thus, the aim of this review is to highlight the properties of dexmedetomidine, its administration routes, its advantages over the commonly used pediatric sedatives, and especially its role as an alternative pediatric sedative.
