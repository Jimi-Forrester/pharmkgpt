36882054|t|Mortality of adult patients due to sepsis and septic shock in South Korea: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
36882054|a|Objective: To evaluate mortality from sepsis and septic shock in South Korea during the past ten years, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We searched six databases for studies on mortality from sepsis and septic shock in adult patients. Our outcomes were 28- or 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality from sepsis and septic shock. To assess the risk of bias, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Risk of Bias 2 tools. Results: A total of 61 studies were included. The overall 28- or 30-day mortality rates from sepsis and septic shock were 24.8% (95% CI 22.1%-27.7%, I2 = 95%) and 25.1% (95% CI 21.8%-28.8%, I2 = 97%), respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality rates from sepsis and septic shock were 26.3% (95% CI 22.6%-30.5%, I2 = 95%) and 31.4% (95% CI 26.1%-37.3%, I2 = 97%), respectively. Using the Sepsis-3 criteria, the 28- or 30-day mortality rates from sepsis and septic shock were 22.7% and 28.1%, respectively, and the in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6% and 34.3%, respectively. Conclusion: The mortality rates from sepsis and septic shock in South Korea are high. In the case of septic shock, the in-hospital mortality rate is approximately 30%. Furthermore, septic shock diagnosed according to the Sepsis-3 criteria is associated with a higher mortality rate than that diagnosed using other criteria.
