27438500|a|In brief Sports and fitness activities of patients who have degenerative neurologic diseases must be individually tailored to the type and severity of their disease. In early Alzheimer's disease, dementia is the only restrictive problem. In Parkinson's disease, bradykinesia, rigidity, and dysequilibrium have to be considered, whereas in multiple sclerosis, weakness, incoordination, and impaired balance are the most serious problems. Patients who have degenerative neurologic diseases must avoid contact sports, but can continue most other sports for a while. Using stationary exercise equipment is beneficial, and supervised swimming is the single most rewarding fitness activity for most patients who have these diseases.
