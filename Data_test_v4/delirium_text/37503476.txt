37503476|t|The Trend of Cefepime-Induced Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review.
37503476|a|There has been increased use of cefepime due to concerns about the nephrotoxic effects of the combined use of vancomycin and Zosyn. However, cefepime is associated with neurotoxicity. We conducted a systematic review using online data to explore the trend of cefepime-induced neurotoxicity over the last 10 years. Forty-six articles met our inclusion criteria, including 73 cases of cefepime-induced neurotoxicity. We noticed a steady increase in the reports of cefepime-induced neurotoxicity, from one case in 2013 to 11 cases in 2022. Individuals aged 65 and older accounted for most cefepime-induced neurotoxicity cases (52%). The top three indications for cefepime administration included bone and joint infections (25%), urinary tract infections (22.7%), and pneumonia (22.7%). Most patients with renal impairment have never had a renal adjustment of their cefepime dosage (either 2 g 12 hours a day or 2 g eight hours a day). Most cases of cefepime-induced neurotoxicity occurred between days two and five (n=29, 71%), while most resolution occurred between days one and five (n=29, 85%). While cefepime continues to be a popularly used and effective antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its dosage needs to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment to avoid neurotoxicity.
