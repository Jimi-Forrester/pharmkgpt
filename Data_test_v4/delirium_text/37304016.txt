37304016|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) refers to diffuse brain dysfunction secondary to systemic infection without central nervous system infection. The early diagnosis of SAE remains a major clinical problem, and its diagnosis is still exclusionary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) related techniques, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), molecular MRI (mMRI), arterial spin-labeling (ASL), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), currently provide new options for the early identification of SAE. This review collected clinical and basic research and case reports related to SAE and MRI-related techniques in recent years, summarized and analyzed the basic principles and applications of MRI technology in diagnosing SAE, and provided a basis for diagnosing SAE by MRI-related techniques.
