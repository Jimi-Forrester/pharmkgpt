36699248|t|Relationship Between Skeletal Muscle Quality and Hospital-Acquired Disability in Patients With Sepsis Admitted to the ICU: A Pilot Study.
36699248|a|Early risk assessment of functional decline in patients with sepsis is clinically challenging. Recently, there is increasing interest in the nonvolitional evaluation of skeletal muscle quality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between skeletal muscle quality and functional decline after intensive care. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot study was a single-center prospective observational study conducted from March 2021 to February 2022. We included consecutive patients with sepsis who were admitted to our ICU. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hospital-acquired disability (HAD), which is defined as a decrease in the Barthel index score of at least 5 points from pre-hospital to hospital discharge. Muscle quality was assessed by: 1) muscle echogenicity with ultrasound and 2) phase angle (PhA) with bioelectrical impedance analysis, both of which were measured on ICU days less than 3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-10, and 10-14. We compared longitudinal changes in muscle echogenicity and PhA between the HAD and non-HAD groups using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with mixed models. RESULTS: Among the 22 patients, 7 (31.8%) had HAD. Muscle echogenicity was higher in the HAD group than in the non-HAD group (p < 0.001); however, no interaction effects were found between the two groups (p = 0.189). PhA showed a main effect on each evaluation day in patients (p = 0.040) and a significant interaction effect between the groups, including an early decreased pattern in the HAD group (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher muscle echogenicity and a decreased PhA pattern are related to HAD. Noninvasive assessment of muscle quality using ultrasound and bioelectrical impedance analysis may be useful in predicting the functional prognosis of patients with sepsis.
