39433035|a|INTRODUCTION: Nocturnal lower urinary tract symptoms (nLUTS) are common in geriatric rehabiliation inpatients but have not been well described. The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics stratified by self-reported nocturia severity in geriatric rehabilitation inpatients. METHODS: The REStORing health of acutely unwell adulTs (RESORT) is an observational, longitudinal, prospective inception cohort of geriatric rehabilitation inpatients who underwent a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) at admission and discharge. Nocturia was captured by item 7 of the American Urology Association Symptom Score (AUASS) and dichotomised as <=1 void and >1 void at night as per the International Continence Society definition. Differences in demographic, functional and medical characteristics of the inpatients with and without nocturia >1 were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 641 inpatients completed the nocturia item (mean age 82.6 (SD 7.7) years, 59.9% female). Nocturia occurred > once per night in 57.4%; mean number of episodes was 1.96 (SD 1.38), ranging from 0-5. There was no change in nocturia severity between admission and discharge. Daily urinary incontinence, urinary urgency and comorbid illness were independently associated with multiple nocturia episodes. A history of falls within the last year, difficulty climbing stairs pre-admission, higher faecal incontinence score, impaired quality of life domains, higher levels of anxiety and depression were significantly more common in inpatients with multiple episodes of nocturia compared to no or only one episode of nocturia Conclusion: Bladder symptoms, poor functional status and frailty markers were associated with repeated episodes of nocturia. Targeted intervention may reduce the severity of nocturia, with potential to improve sleep quality, impact therapeutic gains and influence discharge destination.
