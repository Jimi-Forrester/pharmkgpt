33529680|t|Structural elucidation of three novel oligosaccharides from Kunlun Chrysanthemum flower tea and their bioactivities.
33529680|a|Coreopsis tinctoria is commonly called Kunlun Chrysanthemum and a plateau plant with tremendous commercial value in functional tea and medicinal applications. In folk medicine, Kunlun Chrysanthemum flower is often used as an adjunctive therapy for diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. To further explore the chemicals responsible for the health benefits of Kunlun Chrysanthemum flowers, three homogeneous oligosaccharides, CT70-1A, CT70-1B and CT70-2 were isolated, and their detailed structures were determined from chemical and spectral analyses. The three oligosaccharides were composed of glucose, mannose, galactose, and arabinose in different ratios. They showed dose-dependent alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects. In addition, they showed NO production inhibitory activities in BV2 cells, with IC50 values of 0.23, 0.24 and 0.27 mM, respectively. Taken together, these results suggested that Kunlun Chrysanthemum oligosaccharides might ameliorate hyperglycemia and neuroinflammation, which could prevent the development of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. This study provides chemical and bioactive perspectives that support the consumption of Kunlun Chrysanthemum flower tea for health benefits.
