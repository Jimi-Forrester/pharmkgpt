34145792|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the deadliest brain tumors with an unfavorable prognosis and overall survival of approximately 20 months following diagnosis. The current treatment for GBM includes surgical resections and chemo- and radiotherapeutic modalities, which are not effective. CAR-T immunotherapy has been proven effective for CD19-positive blood malignancies, and the application of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors including GBM offers great hope for this aggressive tumor which has a limited response to current treatments. CAR-T technology depends on the use of patient-specific T cells genetically engineered to express specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Interaction of CAR-T cells with tumor cells triggers the destruction/elimination of these cells by the induction of cytotoxicity and the release of different cytokines. Despite the great promise of CAR-T cell-based therapy several challenges exist. These include the heterogeneity of GBM cancer cells, aberrant various signaling pathways involved in tumor progression, antigen escape, the hostile inhibitory GBM microenvironment, T cell dysfunction, blood-brain barrier, and defective antigen presentation. All need to be addressed before full application at the clinical level can begin. Herein we provide a focused review of the rationale for the use of different types of CAR-T cells (including FcgammaRs), the different GBM-associated antigens, the challenges still facing CAR-T-based therapy, and means to overcome such challenges. Finally, we enumerate currently completed and ongoing clinical trials, highlighting the different ways such trials are designed to overcome specific problems. Exploitation of the full potential of CAR-T cell therapy for GBM depends on their solution.
