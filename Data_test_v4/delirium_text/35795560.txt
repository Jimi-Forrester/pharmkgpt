35795560|t|Effect of Stress Ulcers Prophylaxis, Sedative and Statin on Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: A Retrospective Analysis Based on MIMIC Database.
35795560|a|Background: The use of MV can easily lead to VAP especially in ICU patients. SUP, sedatives, statin and insulin have been proved to prevent VAP and improve the prognosis of patients. Our aim was to analyze the effects of SUP, sedative, statin, and insulin on patients with MV. Methods: The occurrence of VAP and death in MV patients and VAP patients were explored by multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression to analyze analyses. Results: Totally, 5277 cases who received MV in ICU from MIMIC IV database were included. There were 826 (15.7%) cases in VAP-group and 4451 (84.3%) cases in non-VAP group and there were 1914 (36.3%) cases in hospital mortalities altogether. No protective effect of drugs on VAP was found in MV patients. The risk of death was 1.43 times higher in MV patients taking midazolam than in propofol (aHR = 1.43 95% CI: 1.04,1.97). No protective effect of drugs on death was found in VAP patients. Conclusion: Compared with midazolam, propofol is more recommended as sedation regimen in ICU patients with MV. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm this finding.
