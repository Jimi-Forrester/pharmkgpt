36837753|t|Cholesterol Regulation of Membrane Proteins Revealed by Two-Color Super-Resolution Imaging.
36837753|a|Cholesterol and phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are hydrophobic molecules that regulate protein function in the plasma membrane of all cells. In this review, we discuss how changes in cholesterol concentration cause nanoscopic (<200 nm) movements of membrane proteins to regulate their function. Cholesterol is known to cluster many membrane proteins (often palmitoylated proteins) with long-chain saturated lipids. Although PIP2 is better known for gating ion channels, in this review, we will discuss a second independent function as a regulator of nanoscopic protein movement that opposes cholesterol clustering. The understanding of the movement of proteins between nanoscopic lipid domains emerged largely through the recent advent of super-resolution imaging and the establishment of two-color techniques to label lipids separate from proteins. We discuss the labeling techniques for imaging, their strengths and weakness, and how they are used to reveal novel mechanisms for an ion channel, transporter, and enzyme function. Among the mechanisms, we describe substrate and ligand presentation and their ability to activate enzymes, gate channels, and transporters rapidly and potently. Finally, we define cholesterol-regulated proteins (CRP) and discuss the role of PIP2 in opposing the regulation of cholesterol, as seen through super-resolution imaging.
