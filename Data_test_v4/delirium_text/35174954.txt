35174954|t|Synaptic density and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease: A PET imaging study with [11 C]UCB-J.
35174954|a|INTRODUCTION: For 30 years synapse loss has been referred to as the major pathological correlate of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this statement is based on remarkably few patients studied by autopsy or biopsy. With the recent advent of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we have begun to evaluate the consequences of synaptic alterations in vivo. METHODS: We examined the relationship between synaptic density measured by [11 C]UCB-J PET and neuropsychological test performance in 45 participants with early AD. RESULTS: Global synaptic density showed a significant positive association with global cognition and performance on five individual cognitive domains in participants with early AD. Synaptic density was a stronger predictor of cognitive performance than gray matter volume. CONCLUSION: These results confirm neuropathologic studies demonstrating a significant association between synaptic density and cognitive performance, and suggest that this correlation extends to the early stages of AD.
