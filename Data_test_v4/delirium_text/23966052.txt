23966052|a|An accumulating body of evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Therefore, the suppression of neuroinflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine might theoretically slow down the progression of AD. Xanthoceraside, a novel triterpenoid saponin extracted from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge, has potent antiinflammatory and neuroprotective effects. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its anti-inflammatory action remains unclear. In the present study, we attempted to determine the effects of xanthoceraside on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in amyloid beta25-35 (Abeta25-35)/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-stimulated microglia. Our results indicated that xanthoceraside (0.01 and 0.1 muM) significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in a concentration-dependent manner. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses showed that xanthoceraside decreased the Abeta25-35/IFN-gamma-induced production of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NO synthase. These effects were accompanied by inhibited activities of nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase through Toll-like receptor 2 in a myeloid differentiation protein 88-dependent manner. Our results provide support for the therapeutic potential of xanthoceraside in AD.
