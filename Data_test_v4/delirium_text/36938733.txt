36938733|t|Temporal Dementia and Cognitive Impairment Trends in the Very Old in the 21st Century.
36938733|a|BACKGROUND: Long-increasing dementia incidence and prevalence trends may be shifting. Whether such shifts have reached the very old is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate temporal trends in the incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment and prevalence of dementia, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and unclassified dementia among 85-, 90-, and >= 95-year-olds in Sweden during 2000-2017. METHODS: This study was conducted with Umea 85 + /Gerontological Regional Database data from 2182 85-, 90-, and >= 95-year-olds in Sweden collected in 2000-2017. Using logistic regression, trends in the cumulative 5-year incidences of dementia and cognitive impairment; prevalences of dementia, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia; and Mini-Mental State Examination thresholds for dementia diagnosis were estimated. RESULTS: Dementia and cognitive impairment incidences decreased in younger groups, which generally showed more-positive temporal trends. The prevalences of overall dementia, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease were stable or increasing; longer disease durations and increasing dementia subtype classification success may mask positive changes in incidences. Vascular dementia increased while unclassified dementia generally decreased. CONCLUSION: The cognitive health of the very old may be changing in the 21st century, possibly indicating a trend break.
