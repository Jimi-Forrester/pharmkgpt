31284222|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common neurological system disorder in surgical patients. Anesthesia providers have a wide choice of sedative agents involving different mechanisms in clinical practice, and the incidence of POD varies regarding which sedative agent administered. This network meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively analyze the safety and efficacy of each choice for patients. DESIGN: A network meta-analysis. SETTING: Vanderbilt University Medical Center. MEASUREMENTS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) through the end of September 2018 with the registration number CRD42018110585. The randomized controlled trials were identified and extracted by two reviewers independently. Commonly used sedative agents such as placebo, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, dexmedetomidine, propofol, midazolam, and ketamine were assessed in this network meta-analysis and the primary outcome was the incidence of POD. The data were synthesized by network meta-analysis. Pair-wise meta-analyses were conducted using the random-effects model. Each intervention was ranked according to its corresponding surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values. The GRADE framework was undertaken to evaluate the risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 39 RCTs and 5991 patients in this meta-analysis. Dexmedetomidine was found to be the most effective option in reducing POD, compared to midazolam, propofol, desflurane, and sevoflurane. The results revealed that dexmedetomidine was associated with a lower incidence of POD, whereas midazolam was associated with a significantly higher number of patients with delirium. Midazolam and propofol were also associated with a higher incidence of perioperative hypotension and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: Our study provided meta-analytic evidence and suggested dexmedetomidine could be considered as the most effective sedative agent to reduce POD. However, clinical practitioners still need to weigh the pros and cons before choosing a sedative agent for individual patient.
