34402289|a|Puerarin has the anti-Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) activity,which can reverse nerve injury induced by Abetaand inhibit neuronal apoptosis.However,its potential pharmacodynamic mechanism still needs to be further researched.The occurrence and development of AD is due to the change of multiple metabolic links in the body,which leads to the destruction of balance.Puerarin may act on multiple targets and multiple metabolic processes to achieve therapeutic purposes.Quantitative proteomic analysis provides a new choice to understand the mechanism as completely as possible.This research adopted SH-SY5Y cells induced by Abeta_(1-42)to establish AD cell model,and Abetaimmunofluorescence detection showed that Abetadecreased significantly after puerarin intervention.The mechanism of puerarin reversing SH-SY5Y cell injured by Abeta_(1-42)was further explored by using label-free non-labeled quantitative technology and Western blot detection based on bioinformatics analysis result.The results showed that most of the differential proteins were related to biological processes such as cellular component organization or biogenesis,cellular component organization and cellular component biogenesis,and they mainly participated in the top ten pathways of P value such as pathogenic Escherichia coli infection,m TOR signaling pathway,regulation of autophagy,regulation of actin cytoskeleton,spliceosome,hepatocellular carcinoma,tight junction,non-small cell lung cancer,apoptosis and gap junction.Annexin V/PI flow cytometry and TUNEL were used to detect apoptosis,and the results showed that Abetadecreased significantly and the rate of apoptosis decreased significantly after puerarin intervention.Western blot analysis found that the protein expression level of autophagy related protein LC3IIwas up-regulated after Abetainduction,and the degree of this up-regulation was further enhanced in puerarin intervention group.The trend of the ratio of LC3II/LC3Iamong groups was the same as the protein expression level of LC3II,the protein expression level of p62 in the control group,AD model group and puerarin intervention group decreased successively.Protein interaction network analysis showed that CAP1 was correlated with TUBA1B,HSP90AB2P,DNM1L,TUBA1A and ERK1/2,and the correlation between CAP1 and ERK1/2 was the highest among them.Western blot showed that the expressions of p-ERK1/2,Bax and CAP1 were significantly down-regulated and the protein expression level of Bcl-2 was significantly up-regulated after puerarin intervention.Therefore,puerarin might improve the SH-SY5Y cells injured by Abeta_(1-42)through the interaction of multiple biological processes and pathways in cells multiple locations,and CAP1 might play an important role among them.
