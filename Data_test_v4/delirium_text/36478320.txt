36478320|t|Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Regulated Chaperones as a Serum Biomarker Panel for Parkinson's Disease.
36478320|a|Examination of post-mortem brain tissues has previously revealed a strong association between Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Evidence in the literature regarding the circulation of ER stress-regulated factors released from neurons provides a rationale for investigating ER stress biomarkers in the blood to aid diagnosis of PD. The levels of ER stress-regulated proteins in serum collected from 29 PD patients and 24 non-PD controls were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A panel of four biomarkers, protein disulfide-isomerase A1, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, and clusterin, together with age and gender had higher ability (area under the curve 0.64, sensitivity 66%, specificity 57%) and net benefit to discriminate PD patients from the non-PD group compared with other analyzed models. Addition of oligomeric and total alpha-synuclein to the model did not improve the diagnostic power of the biomarker panel. We provide evidence that ER stress-regulated proteins merit further investigation for their potential as diagnostic biomarkers of PD.
