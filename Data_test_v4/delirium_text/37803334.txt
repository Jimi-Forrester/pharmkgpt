37803334|a|BACKGROUND: The most favorable anesthesia protocol during on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with coronary heart disease remains unclear, despite previous publications regarding the interaction between anesthesia protocol and postoperative complications. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of a multimodal low-opioid anesthesia protocol (MLOP) on early postoperative complications during on-pump CABG. METHODS: A single-center prospective cohort study including 120 patients undergoing on-pump CABG aged 18 to 65 years, divided into two groups according to undergoing MLOP or routine-opioid anesthesia protocol (ROP). The analyzed parameters were plasma IL-6 levels, complications, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, and hospitalization. RESULTS: In the MLOP group, the levels of IL-6 at the end of the surgery were 25.6% significantly lower compared to the ROP group (33.4 +- 9.4 vs. 44.9 +- 15.9, p < 0.0001), the duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter (2.0 (2.0; 3.0) h vs. 4.0 (3.0; 5.0) h, p < 0.001), the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome was almost two and half times lower (7 (11.7%) vs. 16 (26.7%), p = 0.037), and also the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower (9 (15.0%) vs. 19 (31.7%), p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that using MLOP was characterized by significantly lower levels of IL-6 at the end of surgery and a lower incidence of low cardiac output syndrome and postoperative atrial fibrillation than ROP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov NoNCT05514652.
