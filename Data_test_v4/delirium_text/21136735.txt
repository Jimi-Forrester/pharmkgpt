21136735|a|The development of MALDI ESI in the late 1980s has revolutionized the biological sciences and facilitated the emergence of a new discipline called proteomics. Application of proteomics to human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has greatly hastened the advancement of characterizing the CSF proteome as well as revealing novel protein biomarkers that are diagnostic of various neurological diseases. While impressive progressions have been made in this field, it has become increasingly clear that proteomics results generated by various laboratories are highly variable. The underlying issues are vast, including limitations and complications with heterogeneity of patients/testing subjects, experimental design, sample processing, as well as current proteomics technology. Accordingly, this review not only summarizes the current status of characterization of the human CSF proteome and biomarker discovery for major neurodegenerative disorders, i.e., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but also addresses a few essential caveats involved in several steps of CSF proteomics that may contribute to the variable/contradicting results reported by different laboratories. The potential future directions of CSF proteomics are also discussed with this analysis.
