38474161|a|Obesity is a serious global health challenge, closely associated with numerous chronic conditions including type 2 diabetes. Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (AA) known as Jimo has been used to address conditions associated with pathogenic heat such as wasting-thirst in Korean Medicine. Timosaponin A3 (TA3), a natural compound extracted from AA, has demonstrated potential therapeutic effects in various disease models. However, its effects on diabetes and obesity remain largely unexplored. We investigated the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic properties of TA3 using in vitro and in vivo models. TA3 treatment in NCI-H716 cells stimulated the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) through the activation of phosphorylation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc) and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TA3 effectively inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis. In a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice model, TA3 administration significantly reduced body weight gain and food intake. Furthermore, TA3 improved glucose tolerance, lipid profiles, and mitigated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Histological analysis revealed that TA3 reduced the size of white adipocytes and inhibited adipose tissue generation. Notably, TA3 downregulated the expression of lipogenic factor, including fatty-acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), emphasizing its potential as an anti-obesity agent. These findings revealed that TA3 may be efficiently used as a natural compound for tackling obesity, diabetes, and associated metabolic disorders, providing a novel approach for therapeutic intervention.
