35879221|a|Mushrooms are a group of fungi with great diversity and ultra-accelerated metabolism. As a consequence, mushrooms have developed a protective mechanism consisting of high concentrations of antioxidants such as selenium, polyphenols, beta-glucans, ergothioneine, various vitamins and other bioactive metabolites. The mushrooms of the Pleurotus genus have generated scientific interest due to their therapeutic properties, especially related to risk factors connected to the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this report, we highlight the therapeutic properties of Pleurotus mushrooms that may be associated with a reduction in the severity of COVID-19: antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic, antiatherogenic, anticholesterolemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihyperglycemic properties. These properties may interact significantly with risk factors for COVID-19 severity, and the therapeutic potential of these mushrooms for the treatment or prevention of this disease is evident. Besides this, studies show that regular consumption of Pleurotus species mushrooms or components isolated from their tissues is beneficial for immune health. Pleurotus species mushrooms may have a role in the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases either as food supplements or as sources for pharmacological agents.
