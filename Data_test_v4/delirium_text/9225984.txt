9225984|t|Microsatellite polymorphism in the human heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter and its application in association studies with Alzheimer and Parkinson disease.
9225984|a|Oxidative stress has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a key enzyme in heme catabolism, also functions as an antioxidant enzyme. Here, we show that a (GT)n repeat in the human HO-1 gene promoter region is highly polymorphic, although no particular alleles are associated with AD or PD. This newly identified genetic marker should allow us to study the possible involvement of HO-1 in certain human diseases.
