8001648|a|Septal lesions disrupt septohippocampal neurotransmission and impair spatial memory. (-)-Nicotine reduces the memory deficits but has substantial side effect liabilities. Previous studies have demonstrated that ABT-418 is a novel, selective ligand for neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the current study, ABT-418 (0.19 and 1.9 mumol/kg, i.p.) administered before training significantly attenuated lesion-induced deficits in a spatial discrimination version of the Morris water maze. As lesion-induced learning deficits might parallel the cognitive deficits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, these results suggest that ABT-418 may be useful in the treatment of this condition.
