36426333|t|The Global Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of General Population: A Narrative Review.
36426333|a|Mental wellness is a crucial component of happiness. A person is happy with better relationships, financial stability, good mental health, and longevity. Disinformation, stigma, ongoing isolation, and disruption of daily activities are all quite prevalent. Any of these elements may impact one's mental health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken several steps to address COVID's mental health concerns. In addition to frontline healthcare personnel, who engage in dealing with COVID-19, the general population's mental health was also at stake due to the unprecedented and catastrophic emergency of COVID. Various keywords, including MeSH terms, were used in PubMed and Google Scholar searches. This paper was based on previously available data and article searches on how COVID-19 affected the mental health of the general population and the elements that may influence it. Quarantine and self-isolation have been found to have affected people's daily livelihoods and behaviors, leading to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, dejection, insomnia, risky alcohol and drug use, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Many of the victims of COVID-19 who were critical survivors exhibited lasting psychological harm a year after being discharged, including high anxiety levels, melancholy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Healthcare employees too experienced significant psychological consequences due to factors such as an excessive workload or the number of hours worked, inadequate personal safety equipment, overly enthusiastic media coverage, and a sense of being under-supported. As a result of this major disaster, mental health concerns have surfaced, perhaps leading to long-term health problems, loneliness, and guilt. To reduce this deportment, global health solutions should be used, particularly while executing the isolation/quarantine and dealing with the people with fear and vulnerability. The mental health of the general population should be at the forefront of any worldwide response.
