38293541|a|Lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD) is a prevalent circulatory disorder with risks of critical limb ischemia and amputation. This study aimed to develop a prediction model for a novel LE-PAD subtype to predict the severity of the disease and guide personalized interventions. Additionally, LE-PAD pathogenesis involves altered immune microenvironment, we examined the immune differences to elucidate LE-PAD pathogenesis. A total of 460 patients with LE-PAD were enrolled and clustered using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (UMLAs). Logistic regression analyses were performed to screen and identify predictive factors for the novel subtype of LE-PAD and a prediction model was built. We performed a comparative analysis regarding neutrophil levels in different subgroups of patients and an immune cell infiltration analysis to explore the associations between neutrophil levels and LE-PAD. Through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lower-extremity arteries, neutrophil infiltration in patients with and without LE-PAD was compared. We found that UMLAs can helped in constructing a prediction model for patients with novel LE-PAD subtypes which enabled risk stratification for patients with LE-PAD using routinely available clinical data to assist clinical decision-making and improve personalized management for patients with LE-PAD. Additionally, the results indicated the critical role of neutrophil infiltration in LE-PAD pathogenesis.
