37876162|t|ERAS in Cardiac Surgery: Wishful Thinking or Reality.
37876162|a|Enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery (ERACS) is a multi-disciplinary approach to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications following cardiac surgery. The aim of ERACS protocol is to optimize pre-operative preparation, reduce surgical trauma, and minimize post-operative stress.The protocol has been shown to improve patient outcomes, including shorter hospital stays, lower rates of complications, and faster return to normal activities. It is important to note that ERACS is a multi-disciplinary approach, and requires close collaboration between surgeons, anaesthesiologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to ensure successful implementation. Anaesthesiologists play a crucial role in the ERACS protocol, as they are responsible for the management of the patient's anaesthesia and pain management during and after surgery. In this paper provide an overview of the ERACS protocol from the perspective of an anaesthesiologist.
