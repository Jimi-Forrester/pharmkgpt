35657627|a|Importance: Delayed graft function (DGF) is a risk factor for acute rejection and graft failure after kidney transplant. Previous studies have suggested that dexmedetomidine may be renoprotective, but whether the use of dexmedetomidine would improve kidney allograft function is unknown. Objective: To investigate the effects of perioperative dexmedetomidine on DGF following a donation-after-cardiac-death (DCD) kidney transplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China. Adults (18 years or older) who were scheduled for DCD kidney transplant were enrolled between September 1, 2019, and January 28, 2021, and then randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine or normal saline (placebo). One-year postoperative outcomes were recorded. All analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat population. Interventions: Patients who were randomized to the dexmedetomidine group received a 24-hour perioperative dexmedetomidine intravenous infusion (0.4 mug/kg/h intraoperatively and 0.1 mug/kg/h postoperatively). Patients who were randomized to the normal saline group received an intravenous infusion of the placebo with the same dose regimen as the dexmedetomidine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of DGF, defined as the need for dialysis in the first posttransplant week. The prespecified secondary outcomes were in-hospital repeated dialysis in the first posttransplant week, in-hospital acute rejection, and serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate, need for dialysis, and patient survival on posttransplant day 30. Results: Of the 114 patients enrolled, 111 completed the study (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [10.8] years; 64 male patients [57.7%]), of whom 56 were randomized to the dexmedetomidine group and 55 to the normal saline group. Dexmedetomidine infusion compared with normal saline reduced the incidence of DGF (17.9% vs 34.5%; odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.98; P = .04) and repeated dialysis (12.5% vs 30.9%; OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.88; P = .02, which was not statistically significant after multiple testing corrections), without significant effect on other secondary outcomes. Dexmedetomidine vs normal saline infusion led to a higher median (IQR) creatinine clearance rate on postoperative days 1 (9.9 [4.9-21.2] mL/min vs 7.9 [2.0-10.4] mL/min) and 2 (29.6 [9.7-67.4] mL/min vs 14.6 [3.8-45.1] mL/min) as well as increased median (IQR) urine output on postoperative days 2 (106.5 [66.3-175.6] mL/h vs 82.9 [27.1-141.9] mL/h) and 7 (126.1 [98.0-151.3] mL/h vs 107.0 [82.5-137.5] mL/h) and at hospital discharge discharge (110.4 [92.8-121.9] mL/h vs 97.1 [77.5-113.8] mL/h). Three patients (5.5%) from the normal saline group developed allograft failure by the post hoc 1-year follow-up visit. Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that 24-hour perioperative dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of DGF after DCD kidney transplant. The findings support the use of dexmedetomidine in kidney transplants. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR1900025493.
