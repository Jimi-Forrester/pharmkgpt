36362827|t|Use of Maximum Tongue Pressure Values to Examine the Presence of Dysphagia after Extubation and Prevent Aspiration Pneumonia in Elderly Emergency Patients.
36362827|a|Background: Tongue pressure values in patients with dysphagia are reported to be significantly lower than those in healthy controls. The aim of this study was to measure the maximum tongue pressure (MTP) values after extubation in order to assess the presence of post-extubation dysphagia for the safe initiation of oral intake in elderly patients. Methods: Data from 90 patients who were extubated after mechanical ventilation under tracheal intubation were collected retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups as follows: normal group (those who did not develop aspiration pneumonia after extubation; median age 62 years) and aspiration group (those who developed aspiration during the evaluation period; median age 75 years). The MTP values were measured at 6 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days after extubation. Results: The values were significantly increased 24 h after extubation in the normal group (p < 0.05). Alternatively, no increase was observed even after 1 week of extubation in the aspiration group, and the values were significantly lower than those in the normal group. The cutoff values at 6 and 24 h after extubation, which were measured using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, were 17.8 and 23.2 kpa, respectively; furthermore, the results of these assessments were strongly related to the development of aspiration 6 h after extubation (chi2-value: 6.125; p = 0.0133). Conclusions: The presence of post-extubation dysphagia in patients who are intubated for >=24 h can be predicted based on age and the MTP values at 6 h after extubation.
