36373315|t|Wisconsin Healthcare Utilization Cost Among American Indians/Alaska Natives with and without Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.
36373315|a|Individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) accrue higher healthcare utilization costs than peers without ADRD, but incremental costs of ADRD among American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) is unknown. State-wide paid electronic health record data were retrospectively analyzed using percentile-based bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the weighted mean difference of total 5-year billed costs to compare total accrued for non-Tribal and Indian Health Service utilization costs among Medicaid and state program eligible AI/AN, >=40 years, based on the presence/absence of ADRD (matching by demographic and medical factors). AI/AN individuals with ADRD accrued double the costs compared to those without ADRD, costing an additional $880.45 million to $1.91 billion/year.
