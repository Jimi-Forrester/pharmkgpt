35267413|t|Targeting Protein Kinase C for Cancer Therapy.
35267413|a|Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, a group of serine-threonine kinases, are important regulators in carcinogenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that PKC isoforms exert both positive and negative effects on cancer cell demise. In this review, we systematically summarize the current findings on the architecture, activity regulation and biological functions of PKCs, especially their relationship with anti-cancer therapy-induced cell death. Additionally, we elaborate on current knowledge of the effects of PKCs on tumor metabolism and microenvironment, which have gained increasing attention in oncology-related areas. Furthermore, we underscore the basic experimental and clinical implications of PKCs as a target for cancer therapy to evaluate their therapeutic benefits and potential applications.
