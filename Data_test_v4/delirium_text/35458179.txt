35458179|t|Total 25(OH)D Concentration Moderates the Association between Caffeine Consumption and the Alkaline Phosphatase Level in Pregnant Women.
35458179|a|The evidence as to whether caffeine consumption is beneficial or harmful to human health has been mixed. This study aimed to examine the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration on the association between caffeine consumption and mineral metabolism in pregnant women. This is a cross-sectional study involving pregnant women at their 25th to 35th gestational week recruited at antenatal clinics in the period of July 2019 to December 2020. Peripheral blood samples were collected to determine their total 25(OH)D, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium, phosphate, and ferritin level in serum. Questionnaires on demographics and dietary intake were also administered. Among 181 pregnant women recruited (Average age = 32.9 years), 50 (27.6%) of them were found to be vitamin D insufficient (25(OH)D concentration < 75 nmol/L), and 131 (72.4%) were vitamin D sufficient (25(OH)D concentration >= 75 nmol/L). Adjusted regression models identified an association between higher caffeine intake and lower ALP level only among vitamin D-sufficient pregnant women (beta = -0.24, p = 0.006), but not in those with insufficient vitamin D (beta = -0.02, p = 0.912). The findings provide new insights into 25(OH)D concentration as a potential modifier of the health effects of caffeine consumption during pregnancy.
