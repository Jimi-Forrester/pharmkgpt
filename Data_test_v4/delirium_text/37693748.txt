37693748|a|Background: There is conflicting data regarding the predictors of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. The main objective of the study is to evaluate potential predictors of AD progression using a comprehensive follow-up dataset that includes functional/cognitive assessments, clinical and neuropsychiatric evaluations, and neuroimaging biomarkers such as hippocampal atrophy or white matter intensities (WMIs). Method: A total of 161 AD cases were recruited from a dementia database consisting of individuals who consulted the Dementia Outpatient Clinic of the Neurology Department at Mersin University Medical Faculty between 2000 and 2022, under the supervision of the same senior author have at least 3 full evaluation follow-up visit including functional, clinical, biochemical, neuropsychological, and radiological screening. Data were exported and analyzed by experts accordingly. Results: Mean follow-up duration of study sample was 71.66 +- 41.98, min 15 to max 211 months. The results showed a fast and slow progressive subgroup of our AD cases with a high sensitivity (Entropy = 0.836), with a close relationship with several cofactors and the level of disability upon admittance. Hippocampal atrophy and WMIs grading via Fazekas were found to be underestimated predictors of AD progression, and functional capacity upon admittance was also among the main stakeholders. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of evaluating multiple potential predictors for AD progression, including functional capacity upon admittance, hippocampal atrophy, and WMIs grading via Fazekas. Our findings provide insight into the complexity of AD progression and may contribute to the development of effective strategies for managing and treating AD.
