39360436|t|Associations of metabolic syndrome with cognitive function and dementia risk: Evidence from the UK Biobank cohort.
39360436|a|AIM: To investigate the associations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with cognitive function, dementia and its subtypes. METHODS: Based on the participants recruited by UK Biobank, this study aims to investigate the associations of MetS with cognitive function, dementia and its subtypes. Generalized estimating equations, Cox proportional risk models, and multiple linear regression models were respectively used to assess associations between MetS and dementia-related outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 363,231 participants, 95,713 had MetS at baseline. The results showed that MetS was significantly associated with cognitive function related to fluid intelligence and prospective memory at follow-up. Among participants aged >=60 years, MetS was correlated with elevated risk of all-cause dementia, particularly vascular dementia (VaD) [hazard ratio 1.115 (95% confidence interval: 1.047, 1.187), hazard ratio 1.393 (95% confidence interval: 1.233, 1.575), respectively]. With increasing MetS components, the risk of all-cause dementia and VaD tended to be elevated. MetS has also been associated with dementia-related structural changes in the brain, including alterations in overall brain volume, white matter volume, grey matter volume and white matter integrity. CONCLUSION: MetS was associated with poorer cognitive performance and might increase the risk of all-cause dementia as well as VaD, but the effect on Alzheimer's disease was not significant. Holistic control of the MetS may benefit the prevention and control of cognitive impairment and dementia.
