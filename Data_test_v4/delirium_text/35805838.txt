35805838|t|Analyzing Successful Aging and Longevity: Risk Factors and Health Promoters in 2020 Older Adults.
35805838|a|Geriatric syndromes (GSs) and aging-associated diseases (AADs) are common side effects of aging. They are affecting the lives of millions of older adults and placing immense pressure on healthcare systems and economies worldwide. It is imperative to study the factors causing these conditions and develop a holistic framework for their management. The so-called long-lived individuals-people over the age of 90 who managed to retain much of their health and functionality-could be holding the key to understanding these factors and their health implications. We analyzed the health status and lifestyle of the long-lived individuals and identified risk factors for GSs. Family history greatly contributes to the health and prevention of cognitive decline in older adults. Lifestyle and certain socioeconomic factors such as education, the age of starting to work and retiring, job type and income level, physical activity, and hobby were also associated with certain GSs. Moreover, the levels of total protein, albumin, alpha-1 globulins, high-density lipoprotein, free triiodothyronine, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were direct indicators of the current health status. The proposed mathematical model allows the prediction of successful aging based on family history, social and economic factors, and life-long physical activity (f1 score = 0.72, AUC = 0.68, precision = 0.83 and recall = 0.64).
