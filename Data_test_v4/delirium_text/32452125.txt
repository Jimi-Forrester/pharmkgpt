32452125|t|Identification of circRNA and mRNA expression profiles and functional networks of vascular tissue in lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis.
32452125|a|Sepsis is the most common cause of death in intensive care units. This study investigated the circular RNA (circRNA) and mRNA expression profiles and functional networks of the aortic tissue in sepsis. We established a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat sepsis model. High-throughput sequencing was performed on the aorta tissue to identify differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and mRNAs, which were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatic analysis was carried out and coding and non-coding co-expression (CNC) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks were constructed to investigate the mechanisms. In total, 373 up-regulated and 428 down-regulated circRNAs and 2063 up-regulated and 2903 down-regulated mRNAs were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of mRNAs showed that the down-regulated genes were mainly enriched in the process of energy generation. CNC and ceRNA regulatory networks were constructed with seven DE circRNAs. The results of functional enrichment analysis of CNC target genes revealed the important role of circRNAs in inflammatory response. The ceRNA network also highlighted the significant enrichment in calcium signalling pathway. Significant alterations in circRNAs and mRNAs were observed in the aortic tissue of septic rats. In addition, CNC and ceRNA networks were established.
