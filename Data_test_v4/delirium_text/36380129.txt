36380129|t|A Preliminary Pharmacodynamic Study for the Management of Alzheimer's Disease Using Memantine-Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles.
36380129|a|Alzheimer's disease is becoming a common disorder of the elderly population due to shrinkage of the brain size with age and many other neurological complications. To provide an effective treatment option, memantine-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles were prepared in the study. The nanoparticles were prepared by using nanoprecipitation followed by homogenization and ultrasonication methods, characterized on the basis of particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Further, in vitro release profile, cytotoxicity analysis, and Giemsa staining were conducted. To observe the efficacy of nanoparticles in scopolamine-induced Alzheimer models in vivo studies were also carried out. The results showed that nanoparticles were in the nano range with a particle size of 58.04 nm and - 23 mV zeta potential. The in vitro release was also sustained till 24 h with ~ 100% release in selected media phosphate buffer saline, simulated nasal fluid, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The cytotoxicity results with ~ 98 to 100% cell viability and no morphological changes through Giemsa staining indicated that nanoparticles were not leading to cell toxicity. The gamma scintigraphy studies showed higher uptake of the drug in the target site through the intranasal route and pharmacodynamic studies indicated that nanoparticles were able to inhibit the spatial memory impairment significantly as compared to the control group. The findings clearly indicated that the developed memantine nanoparticles could act as an alternative approach for the management of Alzheimer's disease.
