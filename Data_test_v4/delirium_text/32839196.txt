32839196|t|How I treat adverse effects of CAR-T cell therapy.
32839196|a|Chimeric antigenreceptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated efficacy in B cell malignancies, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, this regimen is not harmless and, in some patients, can lead to a multi organ failure. For this reason, the knowledge and the early recognition and management of the side effects related to CAR-T cell therapy for the staff is mandatory. In this review, we have summarised the current recommendations for the identification, gradation and management of the cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, as well as infections, and related to CAR-T cell therapy.
