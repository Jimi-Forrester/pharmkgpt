3969219|t|Head injury as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
3969219|a|A case-control study was performed in which the frequency of prior head injury was assessed in 78 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 124 control subjects matched for age, sex, and race. A history of head injury with loss of consciousness was reported in 25.6% of patients and 5.3% and 14.6% of hospital and neighborhood controls, respectively. Matched-pair analysis of patients and hospital controls yielded an odds ratio of 4.50, which was significant (p less than 0.01). The ranges of times of occurrence of head injuries were similar in patients and controls, spanning several decades. The findings suggest a possible etiologic role for head injury in DAT.
