Males and females are impacted differently when it comes to cognitive health, and this can be influenced by various risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study highlights the sociodemographic, chronic disease, and genetic biomarker risk factors associated with gender differences and cognitive impairments in the elderly population living in Cochran, Parmer, and Bailey counties of rural West Texas. METHODS: Cross tabulation, Pearson's chi-squared, two sample proportions, binary logistic regression, and multinomial logistic regression were utilized to analyze data. SPSS software was used to detect significant risk factors. RESULTS: Using a bivariate logistic regression, the age group 70 and above of males and females for the Cochran and Parmer counties was found significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Anxiety, depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment in females in Parmer County. Gender differences were observed in Cochran County for smoking but females in Bailey County were found to be more tobacco-dependent compared to other counties. However, in Cochran County the prevalence of cognitive impairment with rates of 66% for males and 70% for females was observed to be significantly lower in hypertensive group who consumed modified diet. CONCLUSIONS: Gender-based disparities in cognitive impairment are essential for gaining more insights into Alzheimer's disease or dementia prevention and advancement of healthcare and medical approaches in the underserved rural communities of West Texas.
