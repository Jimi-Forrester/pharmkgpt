36768920|t|The Potential Role of Connexins in the Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis.
36768920|a|Connexins (Cx) are members of a protein family which enable extracellular and intercellular communication through hemichannels and gap junctions (GJ), respectively. Cx take part in transporting important cell-cell messengers such as 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), among others. Therefore, they play a significant role in regulating cell homeostasis, proliferation, and differentiation. Alterations in Cx distribution, degradation, and post-translational modifications have been correlated with cancers, as well as cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Depending on the isoform, Cx have been shown either to promote or suppress the development of atherosclerosis, a progressive inflammatory disease affecting large and medium-sized arteries. Cx might contribute to the progression of the disease by enhancing endothelial dysfunction, monocyte recruitment, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) activation, or by inhibiting VSMC autophagy. Inhibition or modulation of the expression of specific isoforms could suppress atherosclerotic plaque formation and diminish pro-inflammatory conditions. A better understanding of the complexity of atherosclerosis pathophysiology linked with Cx could result in developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to present the role of Cx in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and discusses whether they can become novel therapeutic targets.
