33742387|t|Pathophysiology and treatment of osteoporosis: challenges for clinical practice in older people.
33742387|a|Osteoporosis, a common chronic metabolic bone disease is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. As the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age, a paralleled elevation in the rate of incident fragility fractures will be observed. This narrative review explores the origins of bone and considers physiological mechanisms involved in bone homeostasis relevant to management and treatment. Secondary causes of osteoporosis, as well as osteosarcopenia are discussed followed by an overview of the commonly used pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in older people.
