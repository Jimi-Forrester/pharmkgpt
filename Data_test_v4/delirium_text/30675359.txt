30675359|t|Lithium: contributor to movement disorder sensitivity after anoxic brain injury?
30675359|a|Although lithium-induced dystonia has been well documented in the literature, conflicting evidence discusses whether a patient may be susceptible to adverse effects from the drug after an anoxic brain injury. More recent literature discusses that lithium may, in fact, be neuroprotective. This case report presents a 35-year-old male who, after an anoxic brain injury after a suicide attempt, developed lithium-induced dystonia with characteristic symptoms of sustained muscle contractions, repetitive movements, and postures, which was not markedly improved with benztropine or benzodiazepines. It is postulated that because this patient received a depot neuroleptic with a subsequent anoxic brain injury, he may have become more sensitive to lithium and its rare complications.
