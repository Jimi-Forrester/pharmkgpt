37812268|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Melittin Against Cerebral Ischemia and Inflammatory Injury via Upregulation of MCPIP1 to Suppress NF-kappaB Activation In Vivo and In Vitro.
37812268|a|Melittin, a principal constituent of honeybee venom, exhibits diverse biological effects, encompassing anti-inflammatory capabilities and neuroprotective actions against an array of neurological diseases. In this study, we probed the prospective protective influence of melittin on cerebral ischemia, focusing on its anti-inflammatory activity. Mechanistically, we explored whether monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1, also known as ZC3H12A), a recently identified zinc-finger protein, played a role in melittin-mediated anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. Male C57/BL6 mice were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion to create a focal cerebral cortical ischemia model, with melittin administered intraperitoneally. We evaluated motor functions, brain infarct volume, cerebral blood flow, and inflammatory marker levels within brain tissue, employing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blotting. In vitro, an immortalized BV-2 microglia culture was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish an inflammatory cell model. Post-melittin exposure, cell viability, and cytokine expression were examined. MCPIP1 was silenced using siRNA in LPS-induced BV-2 cells, with the ensuing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB assessed through cellular immunofluorescence. In vivo, melittin enhanced motor functions, diminished infarction, fostered blood flow restoration in ischemic brain regions, and markedly inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB). In vitro, melittin augmented MCPIP1 expression in LPS-induced BV-2 cells and ameliorated inflammation-induced cell death. The neuroprotective effect conferred by melittin was attenuated upon MCPIP1 knockdown. Our findings establish that melittin-induced tolerance to ischemic injury is intrinsically linked with its anti-inflammatory capacity. Moreover, MCPIP1 is, at the very least, partially implicated in this process.
