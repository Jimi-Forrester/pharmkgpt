37508337|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. AD more commonly occurs in females than in males, so it is necessary to consider new treatments specifically targeting this population. The present study investigated the protective effects of Begacestat (gamma-secretase inhibitor-953, GSI-953) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) during pregnancy on cognitive impairment in rat dams and neurodegeneration in offspring caused by the intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta 25-35 before pregnancy. The performances of dams injected with amyloid-beta 25-35 (Abeta 25-35) during behavioral tests were significantly impaired. The offspring of Abeta 25-35-injected dams treated with BM-MSCs or GSI-953 showed a dramatically reduced number and size of activated microglial cells, enhancement in the processes length, and a decrease in the proinflammatory cytokine levels. Additionally, BM-MSC or GSI-953 therapy reduced Abeta 25-35-induced increases in tau phosphorylation and amyloid precursor protein levels in the neonates' hippocampus and elevated the lower levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor; moreover, reversed Abeta 25-35-induced alterations in gene expression in the neonatal hippocampus. Finally, the treatments with BM-MSC or GSI-953 are globally beneficial against Abeta 25-35-induced brain alterations, particularly by suppressing neural inflammation, inhibiting microglial cell activation, restoring developmental plasticity, and increasing neurotrophic signaling.
