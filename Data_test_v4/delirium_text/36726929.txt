36726929|a|Introduction Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. It is more severe in people with African heritage, and intraocular pressure remains the only modifiable risk factor in managing glaucoma. Attempts to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma are ongoing. One of those attempts is the development of optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, there is a theoretical possibility of a delayed or wrong diagnosis of glaucoma using the OCT because of racial, age, and sex differences in the RNFL (retina nerve fibre layer), GCL (ganglion cell layer), and GCL+IPL (ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer) thickness. Objective This study aims to provide the measurements of RNFL, GCL, and GCL+IPL in normal eyes of southern Nigerian patients and specifically to evaluate the relationship of these measurements to gender, age, intra-eye variability, and the Topcon SD-OCT normative database. Method Three hundred and four eyes of 152 patients who had normal OCT scans using the 6x6 RNFL (four sectors) and Macula scans of the Topcon OCT-1 3D Maestro OCT machine were included for analysis. Parametric tests were used to interrogate the relationship between normally distributed parameters and gender, age, and the Topcon reference database. Non-parametric tests were used for non-normally distributed data. Results The male-to-female ratio was 1:1, and ages ranged between 18 and 71 for both genders. The average RNFL values were 111.49 +- 10.44 (right eye - RE) and 111.96 +- 9.66 (left eye - LE). For the GCL, average values were 66.23 +- 4.4 (RE) and 66.34 +- 4.19 (LE). GCL+IPL values were 104.02 +- 6.71 (RE) and 103.89 +- 6.66 (LE). There was no difference between genders (X2 = 56.467; df = 46; p = 0.160), and RNFL, GCL, and GCL+IPL values showed a significant reduction as the age of the respondents increased. There was a significant difference between RNFL, GCL, and GCL+IPL values and the Topcon reference database, p < 0.001. Conclusion Significant differences exist between the Southern Nigerian eyes' RNFL, GCL, and GCL+ IPL values and the Topcon OCT-1 3D Maestro reference database. While randomised control trials and extensive multi-centre studies have not been conducted to determine the possible effects of these differences between measured values and reference databases of the OCTs, they need to be considered while diagnosing and managing glaucoma with the OCT.
