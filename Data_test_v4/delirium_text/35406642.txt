35406642|t|Pyroptosis and Sarcopenia: Frontier Perspective of Disease Mechanism.
35406642|a|With global ageing, sarcopenia, as an age-related disease, has brought a heavy burden to individuals and society. Increasing attention has been given to further exploring the morbidity mechanism and intervention measures for sarcopenia. Pyroptosis, also known as cellular inflammatory necrosis, is a kind of regulated cell death that plays a role in the ageing progress at the cellular level. It is closely related to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, and sarcopenia. In the process of ageing, aggravated oxidative stress and poor skeletal muscle perfusion in ageing muscle tissues can activate the nod-like receptor (NLRP) family to trigger pyroptosis. Chronic inflammation is a representative characteristic of ageing. The levels of inflammatory factors such as TNF-alpha may activate the signaling pathways of pyroptosis by the NF-kappaB-GSDMD axis, which remains to be further studied. Autophagy is a protective mechanism in maintaining the integrity of intracellular organelles and the survival of cells in adverse conditions. The autophagy of skeletal muscle cells can inhibit the activation of the pyroptosis pathway to some extent. A profound understanding of the mechanism of pyroptosis in sarcopenia may help to identify new therapeutic targets in the future. This review article focuses on the role of pyroptosis in the development and progression of sarcopenia.
