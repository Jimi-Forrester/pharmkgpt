32858147|a|There is a strong unmet need for translational progress towards Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying therapy. Unfortunately, preclinical modeling of the disease has been disappointing, relying primarily on transgenic mouse overexpression of rare dominant mutations. Clinical manifestation of AD symptoms is known to reflect interaction between environmental and genetic risks. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an environmental risk for dementia, including Alzheimer's, but there has been limited mechanistic analysis of mTBI contribution to AD. Here, we investigate the interplay between mTBI and Abeta precursor protein gene mutation in AD pathogenesis. We employed a knock-in (KI) model of AD that expresses the Ass-containing exons from human APP bearing the Swedish and Iberian mutations, namely AppNL-F/NL-F mice. Without environmental risk, this genetic variation yields minimal mouse symptomatology. Anesthetized 4-month-old KI mice and their age-matched wild type (WT) controls were subjected to repeated mild closed head injury (rmCHI), once daily for 14 days. Anesthetized, uninjured genotype- and age-matched mice were used as sham controls. At 3- and 8-months post-injury, amyloid-beta, phospho-tau and Iba1 expression in the injured KI cortices were assessed. Our data reveal that rmCHI enhances accumulation of amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau inclusions, as well as neuroinflammation in AppNL-F/NL-F mice. Furthermore, novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests demonstrated that rmCHI greatly exacerbates persistent cognitive deficits in APPNL-F/NL-F mice. Therefore, study of gene-environment interaction demonstrates that combining risk factors provides a more robust model for AD, and that repeated mTBI substantially accelerates AD pathology in a genetically susceptible situation.
