38262932|a|Institutionalized persons with dementia often lack access to meaningful activity, which can lead to agitation, loneliness, and depression. Engagement in activity may improve negative symptoms but is difficult in most settings. In this study, we investigated the degree to which the Reading Buddies Program, in which occupational therapy graduate students read books with residents with dementia, engaged residents. We further assessed whether the level of engagement was affected by various parameters, including those related to interaction, environment, attention, attitude, and activity. The primary outcome measure was engagement percentage-duration of time the book was read divided by duration of time the person with dementia engaged with the book. As expected, increased attention, attitude, and activity parameters were associated with increased engagement. None of the environmental parameters significantly affected engagement. Overall, we found that reading with persons with dementia led to a very high level of engagement and appeared to reduce negative symptoms.
