38445809|a|This study aimed to explore the impact of SCD Probiotics supplementation on biomolecule profiles and histopathology of ileum and colon tissues during a 30-day intermittent fasting (IF) program. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 24 months, underwent 18-h daily fasting and received 3 mL (1 x 108 CFU) of SCD Probiotics. The differences in biomolecule profiles were determined using FTIR Spectroscopy and two machine learning techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which showed significant differences with high accuracy rates. Spectrochemical bands indicating alterations in lipid, protein and nucleic acid profiles in both tissues. The most notable changes were observed in the group subjected to both IF and SCD Probiotics, particularly in the colon. Both interventions, individually and in combination, decreased protein carbonylation levels. SCD Probiotics exerted a more substantial impact on membrane dynamics than IF alone. Additionally, both IF and SCD Probiotics were found to have protective effects on intestinal structure and stability by reducing mast cell density and levels of TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB expression in ileum and colon tissues, thus potentially mitigating age-related intestinal damage and inflammation. Furthermore, our results illustrated that while IF and SCD Probiotics individually instigate unique changes in ileum and colon tissues, their combined application yielded more substantial benefits. This study provides evidence for the synergistic potential of IF and SCD Probiotics in combating age-related intestinal alterations.
