34541400|t|Osteogenesis and angiogenesis of a bulk metallic glass for biomedical implants.
34541400|a|Implantation is an essential issue in orthopedic surgery. Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), as a kind of novel materials, attract lots of attentions in biological field owing to their comprehensive excellent properties. Here, we show that a Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12 (at. %) BMG (Zr-based BMG) displays the best cytocompatibility, pronounced positive effects on cellular migration, and tube formation from in-vitro tests as compared to those of commercial-pure titanium and poly-ether-ether-ketone. The in-vivo micro-CT and histological evaluation demonstrate the Zr-based BMG can significantly promote a bone formation. Immunofluorescence tests and digital reconstructed radiographs manifest a stimulated effect on early blood vessel formation from the Zr-based BMG. Accordingly, the intimate connection and coupling effect between angiogenesis and osteogenesis must be effective during bone regeneration after implanting Zr-based BMG. Dynamic gait analysis in rats after implanting Zr-based BMG demonstrates a tendency to decrease the pain level during recovery, simultaneously, without abnormal ionic accumulation and inflammatory reactions. Considering suitable mechanical properties, we provide a realistic candidate of the Zr61Ti2Cu25Al12 BMG for biomedical applications.
