18807903|a|Thyroid storm, sudden onset of life-threatening manifestations of hyperthyroidism, often appears during and after surgery in patients with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. We report perioperative and postoperative management of two such cases with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. The first patient is a 41-year-old man with a past history of uncontrolled Graves disease, and was scheduled for emergency video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax. The second patient is a 25-year-old man with a past history of hypertension, and was scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation for mandibular fracture. In both patients, tachycardia and hypertension were observed at admission to the operating room. Therapy included the use of landiolol infusion, a short acting beta blocker, for control of tachycardia. Heart rate was controlled around 90 beats x min(-1) using landiolol during surgery. In each case, landiolol was administered until they can take long acting beta blocker and antithyroid drug orally. In the postoperative period, delirium appeared for a few hours in the first case, but no severe complications were observed in each case. Short acting beta blocker was useful for control of tachycardia in the perioperative and postoperative management of the patient with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.
