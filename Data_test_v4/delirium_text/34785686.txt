34785686|t|Poly (Orange CD) sensor for paracetamol in presence of folic acid and dopamine.
34785686|a|In the present work, Orange CD was chosen as an intriguing modifier for the electropolymerization on the surface of CPE by the CV technique. A novel, sensitive, and cost-effective poly (Orange CD) MCPE (PoOCD/MCPE) sensor was utilized for the selective detection of paracetamol (PA) in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 7.4. The oxidation peak current of PA was vastly enhanced at the sensor. The scan rate study is suggested that electro-oxidation of PA was adsorption-controlled. The pH study testifies the redox pathways transport with the same quantity of electrons and protons. The detection limit of PA is found to be 2.64 microM. DPV results show that substantial peak separation between PA, folic acid (FA), and dopamine (DA) could be facilitating their individual and simultaneous determination on the sensor. The decorated sensor demonstrates high sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, repeatability and has been successfully exploited for the detection of PA in a tablet with promising results.
