30581970|t|Validation into Arabic versions of Dementia Rating Scales, Dementia Caregivers Scales, and Dementia Research Instruments.
30581970|a|INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to examine the validity and internal consistency of Arabic versions of the eight-item Alzheimer's Dementia, Alzheimer Questionnaire, and Clinical Dementia Rating scales and to assess the Arabic version of Katz Activities of Daily Living, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. METHODS: One hundred fifty participants were recruited from different settings; they underwent clinical interviews and filled the aforementioned scales. RESULTS: In our sample, 56.8% of the sample suffered from dementia. The Arabic eight-item Alzheimer's Dementia had excellent psychometric properties, and the Arabic Alzheimer Questionnaire showed near-perfect properties with sensitivity and specificity reaching 100%. In addition, the Arabic Clinical Dementia Rating (A-CDR)-sum of boxes was superior to the regular A-CDR score in detecting dementia cases among the study sample. The A-CDR showed similar characteristics as the original version. The Katz scores demonstrated a strong negative correlation with eight-item Alzheimer's Dementia scores. CONCLUSION: Based on this study, health professionals now have reliable and validated tools to be used in clinical and research settings among Arabic-speaking populations.
