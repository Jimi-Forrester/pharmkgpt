34527689|a|This study was conducted to investigate the effect of fermented Radix puerariae residue (FRPR) on reproductive performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients, and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents of sows. A total of 36 landrace x large white multiparous sows were randomly arranged into three treatments, representing supplementation with 0, 2, and 4% FRPR to a corn-soybean meal and wheat bran-based diet during the whole gestation period. The results showed that dietary FRPR had no effects on litter size and the number of total alive piglets (P > 0.05), and that the number of weaned piglets and weaning weight of litter were increased in sows with 4% FRPR treatment compared with control treatment (P < 0.05). Dietary 4% FRPR significantly decreased constipation rate, improved the ATTD of dry matter and organics, and fecal contents of acetate, propionate, and total SCFAs (P < 0.05). In the offspring piglets, serum concentrations of total protein, alkaline phosphatase, IgG, IL-10, and TGF-beta were increased, but blood urea nitrogen content was decreased with 4% FRPR treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in all determined indexes except for fecal acetic acid and total SCFAs between control and 2% FRPR treatment (P > 0.05). These findings indicated that FRPR used in the diets of sows showed positive effects on fecal characteristics, utilization of nutrients, and reproductive performance. Maternal supplementation with 4% FRPR is recommended for improving immune responses, weaning litter size, and litter weight of offspring piglets, which provide useful information for the application of residues of R. puerariae.
