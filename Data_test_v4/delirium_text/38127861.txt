38127861|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the prevalence of substance use presentations. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of primary care visits for substance use including tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use among primary care patients in Ontario, Canada. Diagnostic and service fee code data were collected from a longitudinal cohort of family medicine patients during pre-pandemic (March 14, 2019-March 13, 2020) and pandemic periods (March 14, 2020-March 13, 2021). Generalized linear models were used to compare the rate of substance-use related visits pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. The effects of demographic characteristics including age, sex, and income quintile were also assessed. Relative to the pre-pandemic period, patients were less likely to have a primary care visit during the pandemic for tobacco-use related reasons (OR = 0.288, 95% CI [0.270-0.308]), and for alcohol-use related reasons (OR = 0.851, 95% CI [0.780-0.929]). In contrast, patients were more likely to have a primary care visit for other drug-use related reasons (OR = 1.150, 95% CI [1.080-1.225]). In the face of a known increase in substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in substance use-related primary care visits likely represents an unmet need for this patient population. This study highlights the importance of continued research in the field of substance use, especially in periods of heightened vulnerability such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.
