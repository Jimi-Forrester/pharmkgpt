37908051|t|Circulating metabolites and risk of incident dementia: A prospective cohort study.
37908051|a|Identifying circulating metabolites associated with dementia, cognition, and brain volume may improve the understanding of dementia pathogenesis and provide novel insights for preventive and therapeutic interventions. This cohort study included a total of 87 885 participants (median follow-up of 9.1 years, 54% female) without dementia at baseline from the UK Biobank. A total of 249 plasma metabolites were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline. Cox proportional regression was used to examine the associations of each metabolite with incident dementia (cases = 1134), Alzheimer's disease (AD; cases = 488), and vascular dementia (VD; cases = 257) during follow-up. Dementia-associated metabolites were further analyzed for association with cognitive deficits (N = 87 885) and brain volume (N = 7756) using logistic regression and linear regression. We identified 26 metabolites associated with incident dementia, of which 6 were associated with incident AD and 5 were associated with incident VD. These 26 dementia-related metabolites were subfractions of intermediate-density lipoprotein, large low-density lipoprotein (L-LDL), small high-density lipoprotein (S-HDL), very-low-density lipoprotein, fatty acids, ketone bodies, citrate, glucose, and valine. Among them, the cholesterol percentage in L-LDL (L-LDL-C%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.87-0.97], p = 0.002), higher brain cortical (beta = 0.047, p = 3.91 x 10-6 ), and hippocampal (beta = 0.043, p = 1.93 x 10-4 ) volume. Cholesteryl ester-to-total lipid ratio in L-LDL (L-LDL-CE%) was associated with lower risk of AD (HR [95% CI] = 0.93 [0.90-0.96], p = 1.48 x 10-4 ), cognitive deficits (odds ratio = 0.98, p = 0.009), and higher hippocampal volume (beta = 0.027, p = 0.009). Cholesteryl esters in S-HDL (S-HDL-CE) were associated with lower risk of VD (HR [95% CI] = 0.81 [0.71-0.93], p = 0.002), but not AD. Taken together, circulating levels of L-LDL-CE% and L-LDL-C% were robustly associated with risk of AD and AD phenotypes, but not with VD. S-HDL-CE was associated with lower risk of VD, but not with AD or AD phenotypes. These metabolites may play a role in the advancement of future intervention trials. Additional research is necessary to gain a complete comprehension of the molecular mechanisms behind these associations.
