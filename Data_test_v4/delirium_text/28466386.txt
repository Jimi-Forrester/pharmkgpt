28466386|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant immunoreceptor combining an antibody-derived targeting fragment with signaling domains capable of activating cells, which endows T cells with the ability to recognize tumor-associated surface antigens independent of the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Recent early-phase clinical trials of CAR-modified T (CAR-T) cells for relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies have demonstrated promising results (that is, anti-CD19 CAR-T in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)). Given this success, broadening the clinical experience of CAR-T cell therapy beyond hematological malignancies has been actively investigated. Here we discuss the basic design of CAR and review the clinical results from the studies of CAR-T cells in B cell leukemia and lymphoma, and several solid tumors. We additionally discuss the major challenges in the further development and strategies for increasing anti-tumor activity and safety, as well as for successful commercial translation.
