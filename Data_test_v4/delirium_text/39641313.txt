39641313|a|The application of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as vehicles for anti-Parkinson's agents represents a significant advance, yet their clinical translation is hampered by challenges in efficient brain delivery and complex blood-brain barrier (BBB) targeting strategies. In this study, we engineered dopamine onto the surface of adipose-derived stem cell EVs (Dopa-EVs) utilizing a facile, two-step cross-linking approach. This engineering enhanced neuronal uptake of the EVs in primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells, a process shown to be competitively inhibited by dopamine pretreatment and dopamine receptor antibodies. Notably, Dopa-EVs demonstrated increased brain accumulation in mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Therapeutically, Dopa-EVs administration led to the rescue of dopaminergic neuronal loss and amelioration of behavioural deficits in both 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and alpha-Syn PFF-induced PD models. Furthermore, we observed that Dopa-EVs stimulated autophagy evidenced by the upregulation of Beclin-1 and LC3-II. These findings collectively indicate that surface modification of EVs with dopamine presents a potent strategy for targeting dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The remarkable therapeutic potential of Dopa-EVs, demonstrated in PD models, positions them as a highly promising candidate for PD treatment, offering a significant advance over current therapeutic modalities.
