38439066|t|Successful management of massive digoxin overdose using DIGIFab and therapeutic plasma exchange: a case report.
38439066|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the efficacy and safety of DIGIFab, it is relatively expensive and has limited availability. In addition, alternative interventions, such as therapeutic plasma exchange, may need to be considered in massive digoxin overdoses. Although few case reports describe its efficacy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 17-year-old white male patient brought by family members to our emergency department in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. After intentionally ingesting 48 mg of digoxin tablets to commit suicide, the patient's initial digoxin serum level was 8.04 ng/mL. The patient was resuscitated in the emergency department. After admission to the intensive care unit, the patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange, because of insufficient DIGIFab doses. Afterward, the serum digoxin levels drastically decreased, and his symptoms reverted. The patient was successfully managed and discharged 7 days after admission. CONCLUSION: Despite insufficient evidence and a limited number of case reports describing the use of extracorporeal treatment in digoxin overdose, we noted the significant impact of therapeutic plasma exchange on our patient. However, therapeutic plasma exchange's use in routine treatment requires stronger evidence to confirm its benefits.
