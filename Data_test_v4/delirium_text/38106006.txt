38106006|a|Brain rhythms provide the timing and concurrence of brain activity required for linking together neuronal ensembles engaged in specific tasks. In particular, the gamma-oscillations (30-120 Hz) orchestrate neuronal circuits underlying cognitive processes and working memory. These oscillations are reduced in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, including early cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report on a potent brain permeable small molecule, DDL-920 that increases gamma-oscillations and improves cognition/memory in a mouse model of AD, thus showing promise as a new class of therapeutics for AD. As a first in CNS pharmacotherapy, our lead candidate acts as a potent, efficacious, and selective negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs) assembled from alpha1beta2delta subunits. We identified these receptors through anatomical and pharmacological means to mediate the tonic inhibition of parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons (PV+INs) critically involved in the generation of gamma-oscillations. Our approach is unique as it is meant to enhance cognitive performance and working memory in a state-dependent manner by engaging and amplifying the brain's endogenous gamma-oscillations through enhancing the function of PV+INs.
