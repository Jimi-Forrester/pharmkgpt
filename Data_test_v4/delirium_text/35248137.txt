35248137|t|Klinefelter syndrome mosaicism in boys with neurodevelopmental disorders: a cohort study and an extension of the hypothesis.
35248137|a|BACKGROUND: Klinefelter syndrome is a common chromosomal (aneuploidy) disorder associated with an extra X chromosome in males. Regardless of numerous studies dedicated to somatic gonosomal mosaicism, Klinefelter syndrome mosaicism (KSM) has not been systematically addressed in clinical cohorts. Here, we report on the evaluation of KSM in a large cohort of boys with neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, these data have been used for an extension of the hypothesis, which we have recently proposed in a report on Turner's syndrome mosaicism in girls with neurodevelopmental disorders. RESULTS: Klinefelter syndrome-associated karyotypes were revealed in 49 (1.1%) of 4535 boys. Twenty one boys (0.5%) were non-mosaic 47,XXY individuals. KSM was found in 28 cases (0.6%) and manifested as mosaic aneuploidy (50,XXXXXY; 49,XXXXY; 48,XXXY; 48,XXYY; 47,XXY; and 45,X were detected in addition to 47,XXY/46,XY) and mosaic supernumerary marker chromosomes derived from chromosome X (ring chromosomes X and rearranged chromosomes X). It is noteworthy that KSM was concomitant with Rett-syndrome-like phenotypes caused by MECP2 mutations in 5 boys (0.1%). CONCLUSION: Our study provides data on the occurrence of KSM in neurodevelopmental disorders among males. Accordingly, it is proposed that KSM may be a possible element of pathogenic cascades in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. These observations allowed us to extend the hypothesis proposed in our previous report on the contribution of somatic gonosomal mosaicism (Turner's syndrome mosaicism) to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, it seems to be important to monitor KSM (a possible risk factor or a biomarker for adult-onset multifactorial brain diseases) and analysis of neuromarkers for aging in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome. Cases of two or more supernumerary chromosomes X were all associated with KSM. Finally, Rett syndrome-like phenotypes associated with KSM appear to be more common in males with neurodevelopmental disorders than previously recognized.
