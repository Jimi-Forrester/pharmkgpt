39665388|t|Antibody-mediated degradation of 4R-tau restores mitochondrial membrane polarization in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons with the MAPT 10+16 mutation.
39665388|a|Microtubule-associated protein tau is inextricably linked to a group of clinically diverse neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies. The ratio balance of the major tau splicing isoform groups (3 R- and 4 R-tau) is critical in maintaining healthy neurons. An imbalance causing excess 4 R tau is associated with diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. The mechanisms by which increased 4 R results in neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration are not fully understood, and progress has been limited partly by a lack of suitable tools to investigate tau isoform imbalance. This work generated novel 3 R- and 4 R-specific antibody tools and 4 R-tau degrading intracellular antibody fragment "degrabodies". These were used to probe the molecular mechanisms of excess 4 R-tau in disease-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. For the first time, we demonstrate a causative link between excess 4 R-tau and mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization with wide-ranging potential for elucidating novel therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative disease.
