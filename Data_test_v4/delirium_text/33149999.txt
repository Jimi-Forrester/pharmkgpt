33149999|a|During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), adequate maintenance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is vital in preventing postoperative neurological injury - i.e. stroke, delirium, cognitive impairment. Reductions in CBF large enough to impact cerebral energy metabolism can lead to tissue damage and subsequent brain injury. Current methods for neuromonitoring during surgery are limited. This study presents the clinical translation of a hybrid optical neuromonitor for continuous intraoperative monitoring of cerebral perfusion and metabolism in ten patients undergoing non-emergent cardiac surgery with non-pulsatile CPB. The optical system combines broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (B-NIRS) to measure changes in the oxidation state of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO) - a direct marker of cellular energy metabolism - and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to provide an index of cerebral blood flow (CBFi). As the heart was arrested and the CPB-pump started, increases in CBFi (88.5 +- 125.7%) and significant decreases in oxCCO (-0.5 +- 0.2 microM) were observed; no changes were noted during transitions off CPB. Fifteen hypoperfusion events, defined as large and sustained reductions in CPB-pump flow rate, were identified across all patients and resulted in significant decreases in perfusion and metabolism when mean arterial pressure dropped to 30 mmHg or below. The maximum reduction in cerebral blood flow preceded the corresponding metabolic reduction by 18.2 +- 15.0 s. Optical neuromonitoring provides a safe and non-invasive approach for assessing intraoperative perfusion and metabolism and has potential in guiding patient management to prevent adverse clinical outcomes.
