37176641|t|Oral Health Factors Related to Rapid Oral Health Deterioration among Older Adults: A Narrative Review.
37176641|a|Older adults who face systemic health issues and lack adequate social support are at risk for oral health deterioration. How rapidly such changes take place depends on the severity of their medical condition and their ability to access oral health services in a timely manner. The management of dental caries and periodontal disease in this cohort is made complex by the interaction of local and host factors such as the presence of dry mouth, involvement of root surfaces, and altered wound healing. in addition to enhanced maintenance needs to avoid recurrence or progression. Tooth replacement can be beneficial in restoring oral function, allowing patients to enjoy a healthy and nutritious diet but requires careful consideration to avoid further damage to remaining dental units. Establishing a dental home for the older adult can facilitate routine surveillance, disease prevention, and patient/caregiver education to achieve oral health goals commensurate with overall health. This narrative review details oral health factors that are related to rapid oral health deterioration among older adults.
