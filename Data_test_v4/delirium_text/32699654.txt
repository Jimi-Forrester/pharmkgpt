32699654|t|Effect of Osteosarcopenia on Postoperative Functional Outcomes and Subsequent Fracture in Elderly Hip Fracture Patients.
32699654|a|INTRODUCTION: In this study, we evaluated how muscle mass and bone density affect postoperative functional scores and subsequent fracture rates and investigated the correlation between sarcopenia and osteoporosis by measuring preoperative psoas muscle indices (PMIs) and bone mineral densities (BMDs) in elderly patients followed for more 1 year after surgical treatment for hip fracture. METHODS: Among patients older than 65 years who underwent surgery for hip fracture from January 2009 to November 2018, 154 patients with preoperative 3D pelvic bone computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry BMD data and followed postoperatively for at least 1 year were considered for the present study. One hundred twenty-six patients were finally included. These patients were divided into 4 groups based on PMIs and T-score, that is, to osteoporosis, sarcopenia, osteosarcopenia, or normal groups. To analyze outcomes after surgery, we measured functional activity levels using the Barthel index and Harris hip score (HHS) systems. In addition, we compared the rates of subsequent hip fracture ratio with patient's characteristics, and analyzed the correlation between PMIs and BMDs using Pearson correlations analysis. RESULTS: Barthel index and HHS score showed significant differences between the normal and osteosarcopenia group at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery (P < .001). Subsequent fracture incidences were significantly higher in the osteosarcopenia group than in the normal group (P = .046), and T-score and PMI were found to be strongly correlated (a < 0.01; R = 0.763). CONCLUSION: Postoperative functional outcomes were significantly poorer and the subsequent fracture rate was significantly higher in the osteosarcopenia group than in the normal group. In addition, sarcopenia and osteoporosis were found to be highly correlated.
