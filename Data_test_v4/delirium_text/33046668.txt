33046668|t|First Results of the Single Heartstring Aortotomy for Multiple Off-Pump Vein Grafts: A Case Series.
33046668|a|To validate the technique of the single Heartstring aortotomy for multiple off-pump venous bypass grafts (described in 2015), the results of a 38-month follow-up study of 18 patients, including high-risk patients, are presented. No early deaths or cardiac or cerebral complications occurred. During the follow-up period, 2 patients died of non-cardiac causes, and 3 developed coronary ischemia. Ischemia occurred due to late graft occlusion in 2 patients, both of whom had normal postoperative courses and correct graft flow. The presence of acute symptoms 24 months after surgery in these patients indicated that technical graft failure was unlikely. This safe technique combines the advantages of simple and reproducible revascularization, the off-pump approach, and minimal aortic manipulation.
