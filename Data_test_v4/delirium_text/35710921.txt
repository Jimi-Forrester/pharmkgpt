35710921|a|Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) potentially decrease all-cause and cardiovascular death, however, associations with non-cardiovascular death remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated SGLT2i associations with death and the cause of death. We used the Taiwanese National Health Institutes Research database linked to the National Register of Deaths (NRD). Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and propensity score matched T2DM SGLT2i and Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) users were investigated. The index year was the SGLT2i or DPP4i prescription date from May 2016. Patients were followed-up until death or December 2018. Deaths verified by the NRD and grouped accordingly. Multiple Cox proportional hazards models were used. In total, 261,211 patients were included in the population; 47% of the patients were female and the average age was 62 years. The overall incidence of all-cause death was 8.67/1000 patient-years for SGLT2i and 12.41 for DPP4i users during follow-up. After adjusting for potential risk factors in the propensity score matched population, SGLT2i users were associated with lower risks of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, cancer death, and non-cancer, non-vascular death compared with DPP4i-users. For specific death causes, significantly lower death risks from heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and accidents were associated with SGLT2i-use. SGLT2i benefits for T2DM patients were not different across subgroups. Compared with DPP4i-use, SGLT2i-use for T2DM was associated with lower disease and death risk.
