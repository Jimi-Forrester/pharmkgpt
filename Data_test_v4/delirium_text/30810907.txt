30810907|a|Microglial cells are brain specific professional phagocytic immune cells that play a crucial role in the inflammation- mediated neurodegeneration especially in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. Glia maturation factor (GMF) is a neuroinflammatory protein abundantly expressed in the brain. We have previously shown that GMF expression is significantly upregulated in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD brains. However, its possible role in PD progression is still not fully understood. The Clustered-Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR Associated (Cas) protein9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system is a simple, rapid and often extremely efficient gene editing tool at desired loci, enabling complete gene knockout or homology directed repair. In this study, we examined the effect of GMF editing by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique in BV2 microglial cells (hereafter referred to as BV2-G) on oxidative stress and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/Hemeoxygenase1 (HO-1)-dependent ferritin activation after treatment with (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) MPP+. Knockout of GMF in BV2-G cells significantly attenuated oxidative stress via reduced ROS production and calcium flux. Furthermore, deficiency of GMF significantly reduced nuclear translocation of NRF2, which modulates HO-1 and ferritin activation, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression in BV2 microglial cells. Lack of GMF significantly improved CD11b and CD68 positive microglial cells as compared with untreated cells. Our results also suggest that pharmacological and genetic intervention targeting GMF may represent a promising and a novel therapeutic strategy in controlling Parkinsonism by regulating microglial functions. Targeted regulation of GMF possibly mediates protein aggregation in microglial homeostasis associated with PD progression through regulation of iron metabolism by modulating NRF2-HO1 and ferritin expression.
