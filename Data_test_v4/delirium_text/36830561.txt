36830561|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be a series of neuroinflammatory diseases caused by abnormal deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau protein in the brain as part of its etiology. We focused on Abeta aggregation and M1 and M2 microglial polarity in microglia to search for novel therapeutic agents. It has been reported that the inhibition of choline uptake via choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) in microglia preferentially induces M2 microglial polarity. However, the role of the choline transport system on the regulation of microglial M1/M2 polarity in AD is not fully understood. Licochalcones (Licos) A-E, flavonoids extracted from licorice, have been reported to have immunological anti-inflammatory effects, and Lico A inhibits Abeta aggregation. In this study, we compared the efficacy of five Licos, from Lico A to E, at inhibiting Abeta1-42 aggregation. Among the five Licos, Lico E was selected to investigate the relationship between the inhibition of choline uptake and microglial M1/M2 polarization using the immortalized mouse microglial cell line SIM-A9. We newly found that Lico E inhibited choline uptake and Abeta1-42 aggregation in SIM-A9 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of Lico E on choline uptake is mediated by CTL1. The mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), a marker of M1 microglia, was increased by Abeta1-42, and its effect was inhibited by choline deprivation and Lico E in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the mRNA expression of arginase-1 (Arg-1), a marker of M2 microglia, was increased by IL-4, and its effect was enhanced by choline deprivation and Lico E. We found that Lico E has an inhibitory effect on Abeta aggregation and promotes polarity from M1 to M2 microglia via inhibition of the CTL1 function in microglia. Thus, Lico E may become a leading compound for a novel treatment of AD.
