17620262|a|INTRODUCTION: The increasing number of foreign patients being attended in our health centres makes it necessary to have tests that are compatible among different countries, especially in Europe. The objective of this study is to compare the Eurotest with other screening tests and to determine whether there are any differences between European (other than Spanish) and Spanish patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients who were referred because of complaints that were compatible with cognitive impairment and they were asked to carry out a protocol of tests that included the global deterioration scale (GDS), Folstein's MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), the Clock Test (CT) and the Eurotest. Epidemiological data were collected. The sample used in the study included 45 patients, 21 males and 24 females, with a mean age of 69.76 years; 34 were born in Spain and 11 abroad. RESULTS: Diagnoses were 17 with mild cognitive impairment, 8 with Alzheimer's disease, 6 with age-associated impairment, 5 with vascular dementia, 5 with a psychiatric disorder, 1 with mixed dementia and 1 with dementia with Lewy bodies. The distribution according to the GDS was as follows: 10 with a GDS of 2, 18 with a GDS of 3, and 17 with a GDS of 4. All the patients with a GDS 2 completed the tests correctly, those with a GDS 3 scored below the cut-off point 5 for the Eurotest, 4 for the MMSE and 3 for CT, and in the GDS 4 they were 9, 7 and 6, respectively. Results did not vary between Spaniards and foreigners, the kappa index between MMSE and the Eurotest was 0.39 and the Pearson coefficient was 0.67. CONCLUSION: The Eurotest was slightly more useful in patients with a greater degree of impairment.
