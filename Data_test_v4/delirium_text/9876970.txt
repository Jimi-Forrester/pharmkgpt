9876970|t|Intracellular receptors for activated C-kinase in the postmortem human brain: no alteration in Alzheimer disease.
9876970|a|Previous studies have identified a 36-kDa protein that has the properties of an intracellular receptor for the activated C-kinase (RACK1). In the present investigation we quantified levels of RACK1 protein in brains from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-matched controls. Western analysis using a specific antibody showed that the protein levels for RACK1 were not significantly different in AD brains than in controls, indicating that RACK1 is preserved in AD.
