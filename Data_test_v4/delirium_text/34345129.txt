34345129|a|Enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid)is caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi. It is spread by fecal-oral route, largely through contamination of water and foodstuff. Developing countries are the worst affected. It takes 7 - 21 days from ingestion of the organism to manifestation of symptoms which are generally Fever, relative bradycardia, and pain abdomen. Hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal bleeding, and perforation are the features at various stages of the disease. The bacteria invade the submucous layer and proliferate in the Payer's patches. Blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosis but it is only rarely positive. Fluroquinolones, cephalosporins, and azithromycin are antibiotics of choice. There is increasing evidence of the development of resistance to all antibiotics. Salmonella sepsis, though uncommon, can occur. Intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and secondary sepsis are complications that may require intensive care unit management. How to cite this article: Ray B, Raha A.
