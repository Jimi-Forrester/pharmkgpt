36293192|a|Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is associated with changes in the immune system including an increased pro-inflammatory environment and altered differentiation of CD4+ T lymphocytes. The mechanisms remain unknown. Changes in extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo including proteins and miRNAs could play a main role as mediators of immune system changes associated with MHE. The aim was to assess whether plasma EVs from MHE patients played a role in inducing the pro-inflammatory environment and altered differentiation of CD4+ T lymphocyte subtypes in MHE patients. We characterized the miRNA and protein cargo of plasma EVs from 50 cirrhotic patients (27 without and 23 with MHE) and 24 controls. CD4+ T cells from the controls were cultured with plasma EVs from the three groups of study, and the cytokine release and differentiation to CD4+ T-cell subtypes were assessed. Plasma EVs from MHE patients had altered miRNA and protein contents, and were enriched in inflammatory factors compared to the controls and patients without MHE. EVs from MHE patients modulated the expression of pro-inflammatory IL-17, IL-21, and TNF-alpha and anti-inflammatory TGF-beta in cultured CD4+ T lymphocytes, and increased the proportion of Th follicular and Treg cells and the activation of Th17 cells. In conclusion, plasma EVs could play an important role in the induction of immune changes observed in MHE.
