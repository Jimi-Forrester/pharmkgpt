21297274|t|CSF amyloid-beta peptides in neuropathologically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.
21297274|a|Appropriate treatment of dementia requires biomarkers that provide an exact and differential diagnosis. We recently presented differentially expressed amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide patterns in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as biomarker candidates for neurochemical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The objective of the present study was to investigate CSF Abeta peptide patterns in both neuropathologically and clinically defined diagnostic groups of AD and DLB. Using the quantitative Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, we analyzed CSF samples of neuropathologically defined patients with AD (definite AD, dAD; n = 11) and DLB (definite, dDLB; n = 12). We compared absolute and relative quantities of CSF Abeta-peptides with a larger cohort of clinically diagnosed patients with probable AD (pAD; n = 71), probable DLB (pDLB; n = 32), and non-demented controls (NDC; n = 71). Each neuropathologically and clinically defined diagnostic group showed a similar relative distribution of CSF Abeta-peptides (Abeta(1-X%)). Abeta(1-42%) was lowered in dAD compared to NDC (p = 1.6 x 10-7, but did not differ between dAD and pAD. Abeta(1-40ox%) was elevated in dDLB as compared to NDC (p = 1.8 x 10-5, but did not differ between dDLB and pDLB. Thus, we were able to confirm previous results on Abeta peptide patterns in neuropathologically characterized patients with AD and DLB. Our results underline the usefulness of the CSF Abeta(1-42%) and Abeta(1-40ox%) as diagnostic biomarkers for AD and DLB, respectively.
