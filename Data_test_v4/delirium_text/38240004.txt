38240004|a|Psychological aspects of rehabilitation nutrition affect physical, cognitive, and social rehabilitation nutrition. When depression is recognized, not only pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, but also non-pharmacological therapies such as exercise, nutrition, psychosocial, and other interventions can be expected to improve depression. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and intervention without overlooking depression is important. Psychological aspects of preventive rehabilitation nutrition is also important because depression can be partially prevented by appropriate exercise and nutritional management. Even in the absence of psychological negatives, increasing more psychological positives from a positive psychology perspective can be useful for both patients and healthcare professionals. Positive rehabilitation nutrition interventions can increase more psychological positives, such as well-being, through cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness on their own, as well as through interventions on environmental factors. Consequently, physical, cognitive, and social positives are also expected to be enhanced.
