38140375|t|Improving Cognitive Function with Nutritional Supplements in Aging: A Comprehensive Narrative Review of Clinical Studies Investigating the Effects of Vitamins, Minerals, Antioxidants, and Other Dietary Supplements.
38140375|a|Cognitive impairment and dementia are burgeoning public health concerns, especially given the increasing longevity of the global population. These conditions not only affect the quality of life of individuals and their families, but also pose significant economic burdens on healthcare systems. In this context, our comprehensive narrative review critically examines the role of nutritional supplements in mitigating cognitive decline. Amidst growing interest in non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive enhancement, this review delves into the efficacy of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other dietary supplements. Through a systematic evaluation of randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and meta-analysis, this review focuses on outcomes such as memory enhancement, attention improvement, executive function support, and neuroprotection. The findings suggest a complex interplay between nutritional supplementation and cognitive health, with some supplements showing promising results and others displaying limited or context-dependent effectiveness. The review highlights the importance of dosage, bioavailability, and individual differences in response to supplementation. Additionally, it addresses safety concerns and potential interactions with conventional treatments. By providing a clear overview of current scientific knowledge, this review aims to guide healthcare professionals and researchers in making informed decisions about the use of nutritional supplements for cognitive health.
