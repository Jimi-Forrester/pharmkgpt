31786409|a|BACKGROUND: The motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaints, is a high risk for transitioning to dementia. However, little is known regarding the cognitive profile among individuals with MCR. This study was performed to examine the association of MCR with cognitive functional domains. METHODS: We analyzed 2881 community-dwelling older adults aged 70-84 years (52 % women, mean age: 75.9 years) from the nationwide Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study. MCR was defined as the presence of subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait >= 1.0 standard deviations below age- and sex-specific means. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet and the Frontal Assessment Battery. RESULTS: A total of 231 participants met MCR criteria (prevalence = 8.02 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7.07-9.08 %). The prevalence of MCR did not increase with advancing age: 70-74 years, 8.90 %; 75-79 years, 7.06 %; and 80-84 years, 8.04 %; moreover, there were no sex-related differences. After adjusting for various confounders, MCR was associated with decline in global cognitive function, attention, processing speed and executive function (all P < 0.05). In particular, MCR was significantly associated with impairments in processing speed (odds ratio [OR]: 1.89, 95 % CI: 1.16-3.07) and executive function (OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 1.28-2.93) (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCR was associated with deficits in global cognition, processing speed, and executive function, but not delayed free recall memory. Individuals with MCR had an increased risk of poor cognitive profile related to brain frontal and prefrontal function.
