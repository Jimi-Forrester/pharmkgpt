31505368|a|OBJECTIVE: The three recognized variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) are associated with different loci of degeneration-left posterior perisylvian in logopenic variant (lvPPA), left frontal operculum in non-fluent variant (nfvPPA), and left rostroventral-temporal in semantic variant (svPPA). Meanwhile, it has become apparent that patients with lvPPA, in which Alzheimer pathology is the norm, frequently have more extensive language deficits-namely semantic and grammatical problems-than is captured in the strict diagnostic recommendations for this variant. We hypothesized that this may be because the degeneration in AD-related PPA typically extends beyond the left posterior perisylvian region. METHODS: Magnetic resonance images from 25 PPA patients (9AD-related PPA, 10 svPPA, 6 nfvPPA) and a healthy control cohort were used to calculate cortical thickness in three regions of interest (ROIs). The three ROIs being the left-hemispheric loci of maximal reported degeneration for each of the three variants of PPA. RESULTS: Consistent with past studies, the most severe cortical thinning was in the posterior perisylvian ROI in AD-related PPA; the ventral temporal ROI in svPPA; and the frontal opercular ROI in nfvPPA. Significant cortical thinning in AD-related PPA, however, was evident in all three ROIs. In contrast, thinning in svPPA and nfvPPA was largely restricted to their known peak loci of degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Although cortical degeneration in AD-related PPA is maximal in the left posterior perisylvian region, it extends more diffusely throughout the left hemisphere language network offering a plausible explanation for why the linguistic profile of lvPPA so often includes additional semantic and grammatic deficits.
