38162022|a|The plasma proteome can mediate the association of hospital-treated infections with dementia incidence. We screened up to 37,269 UK Biobank participants aged 50-74 years for the presence of a prevalent hospital-treated infection, subsequently tested as a predictor for <=1,463 plasma proteins and dementia incidence. Four-way decomposition models decomposed infection-dementia total effect into pure mediation, pure interaction, neither or both through the plasma proteome. Hospital-treated infections increased dementia two-fold. The strongest mediation effect was through the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) protein. Top 17 proteomic mediators explained collectively 5% of the total effect, while pathway analysis of all mediators (k = 221 plasma proteins) revealed top pathways including the immune system, signal transduction, metabolism, disease and metabolism of proteins, with the GDF15 cluster reflecting most strongly the "transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway". The association of hospital-treated infections with dementia was partially mediated through GDF15 and other plasma proteomic markers.
