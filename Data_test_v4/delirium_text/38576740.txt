38576740|a|BACKGROUND: Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is a severe manifestation of spontaneous hypoglycemia. It is characterized by elevated levels of immune-reactive insulin and highly potent insulin autoantibodies (IAAs), which are induced by endogenous insulin circulating in the bloodstream. It is distinguished by recurring instances of spontaneous hypoglycemia, the presence of IAA within the body, a substantial elevation in serum insulin levels, and an absence of prior exogenous insulin administration. Nevertheless, recent studies show that both conventional insulin and its analogs can induce IAS episodes, giving rise to the notion of non-classical IAS. Therefore, more attention should be paid to these diseases. CASE SUMMARY: In this case report, we present a rare case of non-classical IAS in an 83-year-old male patient who present with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. Upon symptom onset, the patient exhibited Whipple's triad (including hypoglycemia, blood glucose level less than 2.8 mmol/L during onset, and rapid relief of hypoglycemic symptoms after glucose administration). Concurrently, his serum insulin level was significantly elevated, which contradicted his C-peptide levels. After a comprehensive examination, the patient was diagnosed with exogenous insulin autoimmune syndrome. Considering that the patient had type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of exogenous insulin use before disease onset, it was presumed that non classical IAS was induced by this condition. The PubMed database was used to search for previous cases of IAS and non-classical IAS to analyze their characteristics and treatment approaches. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of non-classical IAS is associated with exogenous insulin or its analogs, as well as with sulfhydryl drugs. Symptoms can be effectively alleviated through the discontinuation of relevant medications, administration of hormones or immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and lifestyle adjustments.
