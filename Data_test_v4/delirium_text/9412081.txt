9412081|t|[ Indicators of thiamine content and energy homeostasis in alcoholic psychosis].
9412081|a|In dynamics of acute alcoholic psychoses--delirium and hallucinosis-- considerable deficit of thiamine in the organisms of ill people that can not be compensated while desintoxicative treatment and signs of energy homeostasis changes and of deterioration of tissues reserves depending on the type of psychoses were determined. Pathogenic peculiarities of the revealed disorders were analysed, possible compensative mechanisms connected in particular with the rise of pyruvate utilization speed and activation of glyconeogenesis while leaving the psychotic state were considered.
