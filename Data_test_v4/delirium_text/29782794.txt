29782794|t|Peptides, Peptidomimetics, and Carbohydrate-Peptide Conjugates as Amyloidogenic Aggregation Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease.
29782794|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases. For many years, AD causality was attributed to amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregated species. Recently, multiple therapies that target Abeta aggregation have failed in clinical trials, since Abeta aggregation is found in AD and healthy patients. Attention has therefore shifted toward the aggregation of the tau protein as a major driver of AD. Numerous inhibitors of tau-based pathology have recently been developed. Diagnosis of AD has shifted from measuring late stage senile plaques to early stage biomarkers, amyloid-beta and tau monomers and oligomeric assemblies. Synthetic peptides and some derivative structures are being explored for use as theranostic tools as they possess the capacity both to bind the biomarkers and to inhibit their pathological self-assembly. Several studies have demonstrated that O-linked glycoside addition can significantly alter amyloid aggregation kinetics. Furthermore, natural O-glycosylation of amyloid-forming proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau, and alpha-synuclein, promotes alternative nonamyloidogenic processing pathways. As such, glycopeptides and related peptidomimetics are being investigated within the AD field. Here we review advancements made in the last 5 years, as well as the arrival of sugar-based derivatives.
