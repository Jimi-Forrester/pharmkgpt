34897091|a|The immune system plays a critical role in neurodegenerative processes involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a gene-based immunotherapeutic method examined the effects of anti-inflammatory cellular immune response elements (CIREs) in the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) mouse model. Bi-monthly intramuscular administration, beginning at either 4 or 6 months, and examined at 7.5 through 16 months, with plasmids encoding Interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, TGF-beta polynucleotides, or a combination thereof, into AbetaPP mice improved spatial memory performance. This work demonstrates an efficient gene therapy strategy to downregulate neuroinflammation, and possibly prevent or delay cognitive decline in AD.
