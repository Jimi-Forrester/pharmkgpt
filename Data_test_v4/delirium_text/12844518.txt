12844518|t|Gamma-secretase--intramembrane protease with a complex.
12844518|a|Gamma-secretase catalyzes intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid beta protein precursor, a process closely linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease. This protease also cleaves the transmembrane domain of the Notch receptor as part of a signaling pathway that is essential for proper embryonic development. Recent findings suggest that gamma-secretase is a complex of at least four integral membrane proteins: presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. Assembly of these four components apparently leads to autocleavage of presenilin into two subunits that together compose the intramembranous active site of gamma-secretase. Understanding the mechanism of this unusual enzyme is important, as it is both a key therapeutic target and a founding member of a newly discovered class of intramembrane-cleaving proteases.
