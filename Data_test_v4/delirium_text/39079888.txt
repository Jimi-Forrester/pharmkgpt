39079888|a|BACKGROUND: It has been reported that patients with geriatric psychiatric disorders include many cases of the prodromal stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Abnormal 123I-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) reveals a nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficit and is considered useful to detect dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease as well as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. We aimed to determine the proportion of cases that are abnormal on DAT-SPECT in patients with geriatric psychiatric disorders and to identify their clinical profile. METHODS: The design is a cross-sectional study. Clinical findings of 61 inpatients aged 60 years or older who underwent DAT-SPECT and had been diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, but not neurodegenerative disease or dementia were analysed. RESULTS: 36 of 61 (59%) had abnormal results on DAT-SPECT. 54 of 61 patients who had DAT-SPECT (89%) had undergone 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy (123I-MIBG scintigraphy); 12 of the 54 patients (22.2%) had abnormal findings on 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. There were no cases that were normal on DAT-SPECT and abnormal on 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. DAT-SPECT abnormalities were more frequent in patients with late-onset (55 years and older) psychiatric disorders (69.0%) and depressive disorder (75.7%), especially late-onset depressive disorder (79.3%). CONCLUSION: Patients with geriatric psychiatric disorders include many cases showing abnormalities on DAT-SPECT. It is suggested that these cases are at high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases characterised by a dopaminergic deficit. It is possible that patients with geriatric psychiatric disorders with abnormal findings on DAT-SPECT tend to show abnormalities on DAT-SPECT first rather than on 123I-MIBG scintigraphy.
