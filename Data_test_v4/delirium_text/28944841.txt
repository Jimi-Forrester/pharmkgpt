28944841|a|Research on neural stem cells (NSCs) has recently focused on microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that have crucial roles in regulating NSC proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, a quantitative-polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that the expression of miRNA (miR)-138-5p was significantly decreased during neural differentiation of NSCs in vitro. Overexpression of miR-138-5p reduced NSC proliferation and increased NSC differentiation. Furthermore, suppression of miR-138-5p via transfection with a miRNA inhibitor enhanced NSC proliferation and attenuated NSC differentiation. Additionally, expression of thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 6 (TRIP6), a critical regulator of NSCs, was negatively correlated with the miR-138-5p level. A luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-138-5p regulate TRIP6 by directly binding the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA. Additionally, upregulation of TRIP6 rescued the NSC proliferation deficiency induced by miR-138-5p and abolished miR-138-5p-promoted NSCs differentiation. By contrast, downregulation of TRIP6 produced the opposite effect on proliferation and differentiation of NSCs transfected with anti-miR-138-5p. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-138-5p regulates NSCs proliferation and differentiation, and may be useful in developing novel treatments for neurological disorders via manipulation of miR-138-5p in NSCs.
