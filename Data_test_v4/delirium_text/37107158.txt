37107158|t|The Key Role of Mitochondrial Function in Health and Disease.
37107158|a|The role of mitochondrial function in health and disease has become increasingly recognized, particularly in the last two decades. Mitochondrial dysfunction as well as disruptions of cellular bioenergetics have been shown to be ubiquitous in some of the most prevalent diseases in our society, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple diseases have yet to be elucidated, making it one of the most significant medical challenges in our history. However, the rapid advances in our knowledge of cellular metabolism coupled with the novel understanding at the molecular and genetic levels show tremendous promise to one day elucidate the mysteries of this ancient organelle in order to treat it therapeutically when needed. Mitochondrial DNA mutations, infections, aging, and a lack of physical activity have been identified to be major players in mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple diseases. This review examines the complexities of mitochondrial function, whose ancient incorporation into eukaryotic cells for energy purposes was key for the survival and creation of new species. Among these complexities, the tightly intertwined bioenergetics derived from the combustion of alimentary substrates and oxygen are necessary for cellular homeostasis, including the production of reactive oxygen species. This review discusses different etiological mechanisms by which mitochondria could become dysregulated, determining the fate of multiple tissues and organs and being a protagonist in the pathogenesis of many non-communicable diseases. Finally, physical activity is a canonical evolutionary characteristic of humans that remains embedded in our genes. The normalization of a lack of physical activity in our modern society has led to the perception that exercise is an "intervention". However, physical activity remains the modus vivendi engrained in our genes and being sedentary has been the real intervention and collateral effect of modern societies. It is well known that a lack of physical activity leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and, hence, it probably becomes a major etiological factor of many non-communicable diseases affecting modern societies. Since physical activity remains the only stimulus we know that can improve and maintain mitochondrial function, a significant emphasis on exercise promotion should be imperative in order to prevent multiple diseases. Finally, in populations with chronic diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is involved, an individualized exercise prescription should be crucial for the "metabolic rehabilitation" of many patients. From lessons learned from elite athletes (the perfect human machines), it is possible to translate and apply multiple concepts to the betterment of populations with chronic diseases.
