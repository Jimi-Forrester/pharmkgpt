3539293|a|A potential relationship between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and insulin gene expression was suggested by the observation that patients with AD have altered levels of fasting blood sugar and insulin. Since polymorphisms in the region 5' to the insulin gene have been associated with blood glucose levels, we have studied this polymorphism in AD patients. Subjects were 19 nondiabetic AD patients with symptoms of aphasia and apraxia and a family history of AD; and 20 age and sex-matched nondiabetic controls without family history of AD. The 5' polymorphic region of the insulin gene was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion of DNA extracted from whole venous blood. We did not observe a correlation between the size of the 5' polymorphic region and AD.
