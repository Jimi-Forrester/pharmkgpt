24215579|a|AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate risk factors for postoperative urinary retention (POUR) in female patients with femoral neck fractures. METHODS: We recruited 72 female patients (age 86.5 +- 6.7 years) from among 90 cases of hip surgery carried out between January and December 2011 at Goto Chuo Hospital. We evaluated the risk factors for POUR, including the administration of anticholinergic drugs, diabetes mellitus, preoperative dementia and/or delirium, neurological disorders, age, hypertension, overactive bladder, and the postoperative duration of the use of an indwelling urethral catheter using a multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In the present study, POUR occurred in eight out of 72 cases (11.1%). The multivariate analysis showed that the indwelling period of the urethral catheter (per 1-day increase; P = 0.04, OR 0.33 95% CI 0.11-0.96), and preoperative dementia and/or delirium (P = 0.03, OR10.4, 95%CI 1.21-89.2) correlated with the occurrence of POUR. Diabetes mellitus (P = 0.78), anticholinergic agents (P = 0.23), neurological disorders (P = 0.83), age (P = 0.86), hypertension (P = 0.76) and overactive bladder (P = 0.34) did not significantly correlate with the occurrence of POUR. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the early removal of the urethral catheter, and preoperative dementia and/or delirium had significant correlations with POUR. The femoral neck fractures and the surgical procedure used for the hip surgery do not induce damage to the bladder and nerve system related to the voiding function, and the voiding function in all of the patients recovered after short-term intermittent catheterization. Physicians should not place permanent indwelling urethral catheters without carrying out urological assessments.
