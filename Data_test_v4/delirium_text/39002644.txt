39002644|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in which senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are crucially involved in its physiological and pathophysiological processes. Growing animal and clinical studies have suggested that AD is also comorbid with some metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and therefore, it is often considered brain diabetes. AD and T2DM share multiple molecular and biochemical mechanisms, including impaired insulin signaling, oxidative stress, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review article, we mainly introduce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and explain their role and the underlying molecular mechanism in T2DM and AD pathogenesis; then, according to the current literature, we comprehensively evaluate the possibility of regulating oxidative homeostasis and mitochondrial function as therapeutics against AD. Furthermore, considering dietary polyphenols' antioxidative and antidiabetic properties, the strategies for applying them as potential therapeutical interventions in patients with AD symptoms are assessed.
