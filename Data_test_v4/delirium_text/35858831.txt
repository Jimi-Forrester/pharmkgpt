35858831|a|BACKGROUND: Exposure to anesthesia in the elderly might increase the risk of dementia. Although the mechanism underlying the association is uncertain, anesthesia has been shown to induce acute tau hyperphosphorylation in preclinical models. We sought to investigate the impact of anesthesia on gene expression and on acute and long-term changes in tau biochemistry in transgenic models of tauopathy in order to better understand how anesthesia influences the pathophysiology of dementia. METHODS: We exposed mice with over-expressed human mutant tau (P301L and hyperdopaminergic COMTKO/P301L) to two hours of isoflurane and compared anesthetized mice to controls at several time points. We evaluated tau hyperphosphorylation with quantitative high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and performed differential expression and functional transcriptome analyses following bulk mRNA-sequencing. RESULTS: Anesthesia induced acute hyperphosphorylation of tau at epitopes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both P301L-based models. Anesthesia was associated with differential expression of genes in the neurodegenerative pathways (e.g., AD-risk genes ApoE and Trem2) and thermogenesis pathway, which is related to both mammalian hibernation and tau phosphorylation. One and three months after anesthesia, hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates were increased in the anesthetized mice. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia may influence the expression of AD-risk genes and induce biochemical changes in tau that promote aggregation even after single exposure. Further preclinical and human studies are necessary to establish the relevance of our transcriptomic and biochemical findings in these preclinical models to the pathogenesis of dementia following anesthesia.
