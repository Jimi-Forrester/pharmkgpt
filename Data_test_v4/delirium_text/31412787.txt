31412787|a|BACKGROUND: Hospitals are in need of valid and economic screening and assessment tools that help identifying older patients at risk for complications which require intensified support during their hospital stay. METHODS: Five hundred forty-seven internal medicine in-patients (mean age 78.14 +- 5.96 years; 54.7% males) prospectively received Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR) screening. If screening results were positive (ISAR score >= 2), a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) was performed. We explored sensitivity and specificity of different ISAR and CGA cutoffs. Further, we analyzed the risk of falls and how patients got discharged from hospital. RESULTS: ISAR+/CGA abnormal patients spent more days in hospital (16.1 +- 14.5), received more nursing hours per day (3.0 +- 2.3), more hours of physiotherapy during their hospital stay (2.2 +- 3.2), and had more falls (10.1%) compared to ISAR+/CGA normal (10.9 +- 12.3, 2.0 +- 1.2, 1.2 +- 4.3, and 2.8%, respectively, all p <= 0.016) and ISAR- (9.6 +- 11.5, 2.3 +- 4.5, 0.7 +- 2.0, and 2.2%, respectively, all p <= 0.002) patients. ISAR+/CGA abnormal patients terminated their treatment regularly with being discharged back home less often (59.6%) compared to ISAR+/CGA normal (78.5%, p = 0.002) and ISAR- (78.2%, p = 0.056) patients. ISAR cutoff>=2 and CGA defined as abnormal in case of impairment of ADL plus another CGA domain achieved best sensitivity/specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal geriatric risk screening and assessment are associated with longer hospital stay and higher amount of nursing and physiotherapy during hospital stay, greater risk of falling, and a lower percentage of successfully terminated treatment in older in-patients.
