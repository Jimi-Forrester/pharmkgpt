16712718|t|A paradox of immunodeficiency and inflammation in human aging: lessons learned from apoptosis.
16712718|a|Aging is associated with a paradox of immunodeficiency and inflammation (an evidence of hyperactive immune system). Apoptosis is associated with cellular depletion and suppression of inflammatory response. In this brief review, we will present evidence for the role of increased apoptosis in immunodeficiency and paradoxical increased inflammation associated with human aging. In particular, a role of apoptotic cells in failure to generate anti-inflammatory responses and directly activating inflammatory responses will be discussed.
