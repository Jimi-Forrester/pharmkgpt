22441728|t|Endovascular versus open approach to aortic aneurysm repair surgery: rates of postoperative delirium.
22441728|a|PURPOSE: Our objective was to compare open and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with respect to postoperative delirium. METHODS: After Institutional Ethics Review Board approval, we conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent abdominal and thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery at Toronto General Hospital during June 2006 to December 2007. Patients were classed into either the OPEN or the endovascular (EVAR) group based on the type of surgery and were assessed for the presence of delirium after surgery. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the validated chart review instrument were used for diagnosis of delirium. Patients with dementia and/or abnormal levels of consciousness preoperatively were excluded. RESULTS: There were 256 patients included in the study, 149 (58%) in the OPEN group and 107 (42%) in the EVAR group. Patients in the EVAR group were considerably older, 74 (10) yr vs 68 (9) yr, and they had shorter duration of surgery, 150 [119, 180] min vs 200 [165, 260] min, respectively, P < 0.0001. Postoperative delirium was present in 43 (29%) patients in the OPEN group and 14 (13%) patients in the EVAR group (95% confidence interval [CI], 22 to 36 vs 95% CI, 7 to 19, respectively; P = 0.003). Hospital length of stay was 8.3 [6.6, 13.4] days in the OPEN group and 4.5 [3.1, 6.4] days in the EVAR group, P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative management of patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair was associated with lower rates of delirium after surgery than that of patients undergoing open aortic aneurysm repair.
