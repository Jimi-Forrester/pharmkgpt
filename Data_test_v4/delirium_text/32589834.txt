32589834|t|Targeting Pathological Tau by Small Molecule Inhibition of the Poly(A):MSUT2 RNA-Protein Interaction.
32589834|a|Neurofibrillary tangles composed of aberrantly aggregating tau protein are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia disorders. Recent work has shown that mammalian suppressor of tauopathy 2 (MSUT2), also named ZC3H14 (Zinc Finger CCCH-Type Containing 14), controls accumulation of pathological tau in cultured human cells and mice. Knocking out MSUT2 protects neurons from neurodegenerative tauopathy and preserves learning and memory. MSUT2 protein functions to bind polyadenosine [poly(A)] tails of mRNA through its C-terminal CCCH type zinc finger domains, and loss of CCCH domain function suppresses tauopathy in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting the poly(A):MSUT2 RNA-protein interaction would ameliorate pathological tau accumulation. Here we present a high-throughput screening method for the identification of small molecules inhibiting the poly(A):MSUT2 RNA-protein interaction. We employed a fluorescent polarization assay for initial small molecule discovery with the intention to repurpose hits identified from the NIH Clinical Collection (NIHCC). Our drug repurposing development workflow included validation of hits by dose-response analysis, specificity testing, orthogonal assays of activity, and cytotoxicity. Validated compounds passing through this screening funnel will be evaluated for translational effectiveness in future studies. This preclinical drug development pipeline identified diverse FDA approved drugs duloxetine, saquinavir, and clofazimine as potential repurposing candidates for reducing pathological tau accumulation.
