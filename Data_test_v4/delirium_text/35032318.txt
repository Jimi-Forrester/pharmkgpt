35032318|t|N6-methyladenosine and Neurological Diseases.
35032318|a|N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a dynamic reversible methylation modification of the adenosine N6 position and is the most common chemical epigenetic modification among mRNA post-transcriptional modifications, including methylation, demethylation, and recognition. Post-transcriptional modification involves multiple protein molecules, including METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, KIAA1429, ALKBH5, YTHDF1/2/3, and YTHDC1/2. m6A-related proteins are expressed in almost all cells. However, the abnormal expression of m6A-related proteins may occur in the nervous system, thereby affecting neuritogenesis, brain volume, learning and memory, memory formation and consolidation, etc., and is implicated in the development of diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, epilepsy, and brain tumors. This review focuses on the functions of m6A in the development of central nervous system diseases, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis and providing potential clinical therapeutic targets for neurological diseases.
