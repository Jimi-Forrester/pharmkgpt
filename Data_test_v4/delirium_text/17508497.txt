17508497|a|Oncology providers are faced with delirium on a daily basis in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Using appropriate screening tests and a comprehensive delirium safety protocol can empower both providers and family members and assist in the protection of patients. While delirium cannot always be prevented, knowledge of its pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment strategies can minimize the effects and possibly shorten the duration.
