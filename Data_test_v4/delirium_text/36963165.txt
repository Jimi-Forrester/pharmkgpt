36963165|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between history of anti-inflammatory medication use and delirium risk, as well as long-term mortality. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, subjects recruited between January 2016 and March 2020 were analyzed. Information about anti-inflammatory medication use history including aspirin, NSAIDs, glucosamine, and other anti-inflammatory drugs, was collected. Logistic regression analysis investigated the relationship between anti-inflammatory medications and delirium. Log-rank analysis and cox proportional hazards model investigated the relationship between anti-inflammatory medications and one-year mortality. RESULTS: The data from 1274 subjects were analyzed. The prevalence of delirium was significantly lower in subjects with NSAIDs usage (23.0%) than in those without NSAIDs usage (35.0%) (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, dementia status, and hospitalization department showed that the risk of delirium tended to be reduced by a history of NSAIDs use (OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.03]). The one-year mortality in the subjects with NSAIDs (survival rate, 0.879 [95% CI, 0.845 to 0.906]) was significantly higher than in the subjects without NSAIDs (survival rate, 0.776 [95% CI, 0.746 to 0.803]) (p < 0.001). A history of NSAIDs use associated with the decreased risk of one-year mortality even after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, delirium status, and hospitalization department (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96]). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that NSAIDs usage was associated with decreased delirium prevalence and lower one-year mortality. The potential benefit of NSAIDs on delirium risk and mortality were shown.
