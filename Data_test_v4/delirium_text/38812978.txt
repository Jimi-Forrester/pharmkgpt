38812978|t|Diagnostic test accuracy of assessment tools for detecting delirium in patients with acute stroke: commentary of a systematic review.
38812978|a|Delirium is a common presentation after acute stroke. Post-stroke delirium is related to poor recovery, higher rates of mortality, falls, and longer hospital stays. Delirium can lead to challenging behaviour such as anger, aggression, and confusion. As such, it is important to identify delirium promptly for early management and to reduce the negative impact on post-stroke recovery and outcomes. An important aspect of identifying delirium depends on the use of efficient, easy to use and validated assessment tools. A wide range of tools are available, although it is not known how accurately they can identify post-stroke delirium. This article critically appraises a systematic review which identified delirium screening tools for patients with acute stroke, and summarised their accuracy.
