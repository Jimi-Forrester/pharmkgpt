30917904|t|Metabolic Syndrome, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia: A Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies.
30917904|a|OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and a meta-analysis of both clinical and population-based studies was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to clarify whether Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a risk or a protective factor for incident dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD), and whether it's involved in progression to dementia in patients affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Search terms included ("metabolic syndrome" OR "syndrome x" OR "plurimetabolic syndrome") AND ("dementia" OR "Alzheimer disease" OR "vascular dementia" OR "mild cognitive impairment" OR "MCI"). Research was restricted to articles published in English between January 1, 2000 and August 31, 2018. No age limit was set. RESULTS: At the end of the selection procedure, nine longitudinal studies were selected for the meta-analysis: six studies enrolled cognitively well-functioning participants and three studies involved MCI patients. A total of 18,313 participants aged older than 40 years with mean MetS prevalence of 22.7% were followed on average for 9.41years. A fixed model was used to estimate pooled hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant pooled association emerged between MetS and incident dementia and AD. MetS increased the incidence of pure VaD. MetS increased the risk of progression from MCI to dementia. Follow-up length might be a key factor in investigating these associations further. Because MetS is constituted by a set of potentially modifiable factors, further studies with longer follow-up and repeated assessment of both MetS and cognitive status are desirable to draw definite conclusions.
