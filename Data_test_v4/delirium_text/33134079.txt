33134079|a|BACKGROUND: Recently, gintonin and gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) have been isolated from ginseng, a herbal medicine. Gintonin induces [Ca2+]i transition in cultured hippocampal neurons and stimulates acetylcholine release through LPA receptor activation. Oral administration of GEF is linked to hippocampus-dependent cognitive enhancement and other neuroprotective effects; however, effects of its long-term administration on hippocampal gene expression remains unknown. Here, we used next-generation sequence (NGS) analysis to examine changes in hippocampal gene expressions after long-term oral administration of GEF. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control group, GEF50 (GEF 50 mg/kg, p.o.), and GEF100 (GEF 100 mg/kg, p.o.). After 22 days, total RNA was extracted from mouse hippocampal tissues. NGS was used for gene expression profiling; quantitative-real-time PCR and western blot were performed to quantify the changes in specific genes and to confirm the protein expression levels in treatment groups. RESULTS: NGS analysis screened a total of 23,282 genes, analyzing 11-related categories. We focused on the neurogenesis category, which includes four genes for candidate markers: choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene, beta3-adrenergic receptor (Adrb3) gene, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (Crh) gene, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (Tdo2) gene. Real-time PCR showed a marked overexpression of ChAT, Adrb3, and Crh genes, while reduced expression of Tdo2. Western blot analysis also confirmed increased ChAT and decreased Tdo2 protein levels. CONCLUSION: We found that GEF affects mouse hippocampal gene expressions, associated with memory, cognitive, anti-stress and anti-anxiety functions, and neurodegeneration at differential degree, that might explain the genetic bases of GEF-mediated neuroprotective effects.
