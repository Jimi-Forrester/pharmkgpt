36467615|t|Glycyrrhizin as a promising kryptonite against SARS-CoV-2: Clinical, experimental, and theoretical evidences.
36467615|a|COVID-19 is the most devastating disease in recent times affecting most people globally. The higher rate of transmissibility and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 along with the lack of potential therapeutics has made it a global crisis. Potential molecules from natural sources could be a fruitful remedy to combat COVID-19. This systematic review highlights the detailed therapeutic implication of naturally occurring glycyrrhizin and its related derivatives against COVID-19. Glycyrrhizin has already been established for blocking different biomolecular targets related to the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. In this article, several experimental and theoretical evidences of glycyrrhizin and related derivatives have been discussed in detail to evaluate their potential as a promising therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. Moreover, the implication of glycyrrhizin in traditional Chinese medicines for alleviating the symptoms of COVID-19 has been reviewed. The potential role of glycyrrhizin and related compounds in affecting various stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle has also been discussed in detail. Derivatization of glycyrrhizin for designing potential lead compounds along with combination therapy with other anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents followed by extensive evaluation may assist in the formulation of novel anti-coronaviral therapy for better treatment to combat COVID-19.
