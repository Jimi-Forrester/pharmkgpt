37333692|t|Utility of cerebral oximetry in balloon mitral valvotomy and its correlation with post-procedure neurological complications: A pragmatic prospective observational study.
37333692|a|Background and Aims: Neurological complications (NCs) are significantly associated with reduced regional cerebral saturation (rSO2) in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries, as assessed with cerebral oximetry (COx). However, limited evidence is available in patients undergoing balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). Thus, we evaluated the utility of COx in patients undergoing BMV, the incidence of BMV-related NCs and the association of >20% reduction in rSO2 with NCs. Methods: This pragmatic, prospective, observational study was performed after ethical approval, over November 2018 to August 2020, in the cardiology catherization laboratory of a tertiary care hospital. The study involved 100 adult patients undergoing BMV for symptomatic mitral stenosis. The patients were evaluated at initial presentation, pre-BMV, post-BMV and 3 months after the BMV. Results: The incidence of NCs was 7%, including transient ischaemic attack (n = 3), slurred speech (n = 2) and hemiparesis (n = 2). A significantly greater proportion of patients with NCs had a > 20% decrease in the rSO2 (P value = 0.020). At >20% cut-off, the COx had a sensitivity and specificity of 57.1% and 80%, respectively, in the prediction of NCs. Female sex (P value = 0.039), history of cerebrovascular episodes (P value < 0.001) and number of balloon attempts (P value < 0.001) were significantly associated with NCs. Patients with and without NCs had a significantly greater post-BMV mean % change in rSO2 than pre-BMV (both right and left sides), but the magnitude of mean % change was greater in those with NCs. Conclusions: COx alone has low sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of NCs and cannot reliably predict the development of post-BMV NCs.
