8347328|t|A pilot clinical trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ceranapril in Alzheimer disease.
8347328|a|This pilot clinical trial was a 15-week, double-blind, controlled, three-way crossover study evaluating cognitive effects of ceranapril in subjects with dementia of the Alzheimer type (age range 50-75 years). Computerized (CNTB) and noncomputerized cognitive test batteries revealed no significant results (p > 0.05). On further analysis of the data, however, a study of longer duration and/or higher dosages may be warranted.
