18560281|a|In the first part of this 2-part continuing education series, sources of medication errors were discussed. A predominant source of errors was the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications for older adults. In this second part, drug classifications and drugs posing problems for older adults and cautions for advanced practice acute care and critical care nurses in their medication therapy management are highlighted. Cautions are advanced for anticholinergics, antihypertensives, analgesics, and psychotropics because of the severity of adverse reactions, including anticholinergic symptoms; mental status changes (especially confusion, sedation, delirium, and cognitive impairment); orthostatic hypotension; gastrointestinal tract problems (especially hemorrhage); depression; and neurobehavioral disturbances (agitation and aggressiveness). Risks of life-threatening outcomes associated with medications and adverse reactions are highlighted.
