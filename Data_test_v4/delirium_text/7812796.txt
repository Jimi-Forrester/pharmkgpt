7812796|a|The monoclonal antibody Alz-50 is directed against Alzheimer's disease-related modified tau proteins and reveals cytoskeletal changes, i.e. neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites. The present study shows that, in the hypothalamus of non-demented control subjects, this same antibody gives a distinctive staining pattern of a subpopulation of somatostatin neurons and beaded fibres. Furthermore, Alz-50 occasionally recognizes somatostatin-containing cell bodies and dystrophic neurite-like fibers in the (neuritic) senile plaques of AD patients. These observations have direct consequences for the interpretation of Alz-50 staining in diagnostic usage and for the assessment of Alzheimer's disease-like changes induced by beta-amyloid in experimental animal brains. On dot spotting, Alz-50 was found to bind to a number of fragments from the somatostatin precursor, of which somatostatin 15-28 stained best. Preadsorption of Alz-50 by somatostatin 15-28, as well as other specificity tests, failed, however, to provide any clue to the nature of the unknown compound(s) stained in the control hypothalamus.
