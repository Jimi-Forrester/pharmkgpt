15957156|a|Inflammation-mediated mechanisms for human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have evolved from being on the fringe of medical hypotheses to mainstream thinking. Pioneering immunopathology studies with human brain tissues identified microglia associated with neuropathologic hallmarks of these diseases. As activated macrophages were known to produce many potential toxic products, this gave rise to the hypothesis that activated microglia (brain resident macrophages) could be contributing to the degeneration of key target neurons in these diseases, as well as potential vascular dysfunction. Studies with microglia derived from different sources, including human brains, have confirmed that activated microglia can mediate neuronal cell death. Based on these theories, a number of human clinical trials with antiinflammatory agents have been carried out on AD patients. Results to date have indicated a lack of effectiveness at slowing disease progression and have begun to cast doubt on the significance of inflammation in AD. It has been shown recently that activating microglia through immunization of amyloid plaque-developing mice with amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) has promise as a therapeutic strategy and despite some setbacks, has potential as a treatment for AD patients. This article will consider experimental data with microglia to determine whether the additional targets need to be investigated. The use of human microglia cultures, in particular those derived from elderly diseased human brains, offers an experimental system that can closely model the cell type activated in human neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental data produced by our laboratory and others is reviewed to determine the contribution of this unique experimental model to understanding disease mechanisms and possibly discovering new therapeutic targets.
