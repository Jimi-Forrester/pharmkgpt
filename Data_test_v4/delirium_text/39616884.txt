39616884|t|NOX2 in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
39616884|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and related dementias, represent a growing concern for the worldwide population given the increased numbers of people of advanced age. Marked by significant degradation of neurological tissues and critical processes, in addition to more specific factors such as the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in AD, robust discussion is ongoing regarding the precise mechanisms by which these diseases arise. One of the major interests in recent years has been the contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, particularly, the contribution of the ROS-generating NADPH Oxidase proteins. NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2), the prototypical member of the family, represents a particularly interesting target for study given its close association with vascular and inflammatory processes in all tissues, including the brain, and the association of these processes with AD development and progression. In this review, we discuss the most relevant and recent work regarding the contribution of NOX2 to AD progression in neuronal, microglial, and cerebrovascular signaling. Furthermore, we will discuss the most promising NOX2-targeted therapeutics for potential AD management and treatment.
