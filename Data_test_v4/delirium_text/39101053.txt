39101053|a|Background: The efficacy of bright light therapy (BLT) in ameliorating depression has been validated. The present study is to investigate the changes of depressive symptoms, cognitive function and cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) following BLT in individuals with subthreshold depression (StD). Method: Participants were randomly assigned to BLT group (N = 47) or placebo (N = 41) in this randomized controlled trial between March 2020 and June 2022. Depression severity and cognitive function were assessed, as well as resting-state functional MRI scan was conducted before and after 8-weeks treatment. Seed-based whole-brain static FC (sFC) and dynamic FC (dFC) analyses of the bilateral cerebellar subfields were conducted. Besides, a multivariate regression model examined whether baseline brain FC was associated with changes of depression severity and cognitive function during BLT treatment. Results: After 8-week BLT treatment, individuals with StD showed improved depressive symptoms and attention/vigilance cognitive function. BLT also increased sFC between the right cerebellar lobule IX and left temporal pole, and decreased sFC within the cerebellum, and dFC between the right cerebellar lobule IX and left medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the fusion of sFC and dFC at baseline could predict the improvement of attention/vigilance in response to BLT. Conclusions: The current study identified that BLT improved depressive symptoms and attention/vigilance, as well as changed cerebellum-DMN connectivity, especially in the cerebellar-frontotemporal and cerebellar internal FC. In addition, the fusion features of sFC and dFC at pre-treatment could serve as an imaging biomarker for the improvement of attention/vigilance cognitive function after BLT in StD.
