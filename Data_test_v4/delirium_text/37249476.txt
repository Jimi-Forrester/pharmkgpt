37249476|t|Maturation of amyloid beta fibrils alters their molecular stability.
37249476|a|Little is known about how maturation of Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils alters their stability and potentially influences their spreading in the brain. Using high-pressure NMR, we show that progression from early to late Abeta40 aggregates enhances the kinetic stability, while ageing during weeks to months enhances their thermodynamic stability.
