32245677|t|Radio Signal Sensing and Signal Processing to Monitor Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia: A Case Study.
32245677|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related behavioral symptoms (i.e. agitation and/or pacing) develop in nearly 90% of AD patients. In this N = 1 study, we provide proof-of-concept of detecting changes in movement patterns that may reflect underlying behavioral symptoms using a highly novel radio sensor and identifying environmental triggers. METHODS: The Emerald device is a Wi-Fi-like box without on-body sensors, which emits and processes radio-waves to infer patient movement, spatial location and activity. It was installed for 70 days in the room of patient 'E', exhibiting agitated behaviors. RESULTS: Daily motion episode aggregation revealed motor activity fluctuation throughout the data collection period which was associated with potential socio-environmental triggers. We did not detect any adverse events attributable to the use of the device. CONCLUSION: This N-of-1 study suggests the Emerald device is feasible to use and can potentially yield actionable data regarding behavioral symptom management. No active or potential device risks were encountered.
