16097211|t|[Mental confusion in the elderly].
16097211|a|The prevalence of delirium in hospitalized patients aged 80 years or older ranges from 35 to 50%. Its onset is acute, recovery is erratic, and the principal differential diagnosis is dementia. Hypoactive confusion is a clinical form that should not be ignored. Prognosis is severe with impairments in activities of daily living and high mortality. Risk factors are age (older than 80 years), dementia, sensory impairments, dehydration, sleep deprivation and immobility. Initial treatment must focus on identifying the cause of the delirium. Primary nonpharmacological prevention in subjects at risk is possible and effective.
