26028312|t|Characterization of the interactions between beta-amyloid peptide and the membranes of human SK-N-SH cells.
26028312|a|Interaction of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) with cell membranes is thought to be an initial step in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, some data are controversial and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this report, two populations of Abeta were found in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Notably, one of the Abeta populations was tightly inserted into the plasma membrane whilst the other was only peripherally associated with it. Here we show that reducing membrane cholesterol decreased the number of membrane-embedded Abetas and increased the number of membrane-attached Abetas. We also found that cholesterol depletion inhibited Abeta degradation and exacerbated Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity. Our detailed and direct observations provide specific insights into the mechanism of Abeta membrane-associated toxicity.
