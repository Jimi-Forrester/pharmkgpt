38434997|t|Age and period of ventilator use are related to walking independence at the time of discharge in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective observational study.
38434997|a|[Purpose] This study aimed to identify the factors and cutoffs associated with walking independence in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. [Participants and Methods] In total, 112 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (98 males and 14 females) who were hospitalized between March 2020 and August 2021 and underwent physiotherapy during mechanical ventilation were included in the study. Attributes, respiratory function, physical function, and bed-withdrawal status were compared between two groups of patients, who were classified according to their ability to walk independently at discharge. The independent variables were reduced to four components by principal component analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed with walking independence at discharge as the dependent variable. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the extracted factors were drawn, and cutoff values were calculated. [Results] At discharge, 76 patients were able to walk independently, while 36 were not. The logistic regression analysis was adjusted according to age and mechanical ventilation time. Cutoffs were an age of 56 years and a ventilation period of 7.5 days. [Conclusion] In cases of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who required ventilators, age and mechanical ventilation time were associated with ambulatory independence at discharge, indicating the importance of reducing the ventilation period by providing respiratory physiotherapy, including expectoration, positioning, and weaning.
