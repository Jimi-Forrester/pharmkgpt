35661149|a|Relationships between the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and/or the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neuroinflammatory diseases have been reported. Depression is also associated with neuroinflammation. Here, we determined the association between the NLR, PLR, and depressive symptoms. This cross-sectional study is a secondary analysis of the data of the Iwaki Health Promotion Project 2017. We analyzed the characteristics and laboratory data of 1,015 Japanese subjects (597 females, 408 males) including their NLR and PLR values. We assigned the subjects with a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score >= 16 to the depressive symptoms group. We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine whether the NLR and/or PLR were associated with depressive symptoms (CES-D >= 16). Two hundred subjects (19.7%; 122 [20.4%] females, 78 [19.1%] males) were assigned to the depressive symptoms group. There were significant differences between the non-depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms groups in the NLR [median (25th to 75th percentile): 1.54 (1.24, 1.97) vs. 1.76 (1.32, 2.37), P = 0.005] and the PLR [median (25th to 75th percentile): 123.7 (102.0, 153.9) vs. 136.8 (107.0, 166.5), P = 0.047] in males, but not in females. The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the NLR was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in males (adjusted odds ratio: per 1 increase, 1.570; 95% confidence interval: 1.120-2.220; P = 0.009). In conclusion, our findings indicate that higher NLR may be associated with depressive symptoms in males.
