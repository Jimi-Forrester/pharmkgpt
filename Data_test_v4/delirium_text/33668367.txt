33668367|t|Association between Sour Taste SNP KCNJ2-rs236514, Diet Quality and Mild Cognitive Impairment in an Elderly Cohort.
33668367|a|Differences in sour-taste thresholds have been identified in cognition-related diseases. Diet is a modulator of cognitive health, and taste perception influences dietary preferences and habits. Heritable genetics and polymorphisms in the KCNJ2 gene involved in the transduction of sour taste have been linked to variations in sour taste and non-gustatory functions. However, relationships between sour taste genetics, mild cognitive impairment, and diet quality are yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the associations between the presence of the KCNJ2-rs236514 variant (A) allele, diet quality indices, and mild cognitive impairment evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in a secondary cross-sectional analysis of data from the Retirement Health & Lifestyle Study. Data from 524 elderly Australians (>=65y) were analyzed, using standard least squares regression and nominal logistic regression modeling, with demographic adjustments applied. Results showed that the presence of the KCNJ2-A allele is associated with increased proportions of participants scoring in the range indicative of mild or more severe cognitive impairment (MMSE score of <=26) in the total cohort, and males. These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, and diet quality indices. The absence of association between the KCNJ2-A allele and cognitive impairment in women may be related to their higher diet quality scores in all indices. The potential link between sour taste genotype and cognitive impairment scores may be due to both oral and extra-oral functions of sour taste receptors. Further studies are required on the role and relationship of neurotransmitters, sour taste genotypes and sour taste receptors in the brain, and dietary implications, to identify potential risk groups or avenues for therapeutic or prophylactic interventions.
