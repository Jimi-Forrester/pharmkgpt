30976999|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of hip fractures is increasing. Elderly patients with a hip fracture frequently present with comorbidities, which are associated with higher mortality rates. Clinical studies regarding long-term functional outcome and mortality in hip fractures are rare. The aim of this study was to analyse the functional outcome and the mortality rate after a follow-up of 5 years in elderly patients with a hip fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This combined retrospective and cross-sectional study included patients aged 65 years or older with a low energy hip fracture who underwent surgery in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, the Netherlands. Data such as demographics and mortality rates were retrospectively collected and functional outcome (i.e. mobility, pain, housing conditions and quality of life) was assessed by a questionnaire. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients were included in this study (mean age 82.2, SD +- 7.5). No significant differences were found in pain before hip fracture and after 1-year and 5-year follow-ups. Long-term functional outcome deteriorated after a hip fracture, with a significant increase in the use of walking aids (p < 0.001), a significant decrease of patients living in a private home (p < 0.001), and a low physical quality of life (SF-12 PCS = 27.1). The mortality incidences after 30-day, 1-year and 5-year follow-ups were 7.9%, 37.0% and 69.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Long-term functional outcome in elderly patients with hip fractures significantly deteriorated, with an increased dependency for mobility and housing conditions and a decreased physical quality of life. In addition, hip fractures are associated with high mortality rates at the 5-year follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, a retrospective cohort study.
