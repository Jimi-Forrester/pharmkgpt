38927274|t|Harnessing Mitochondrial Stress for Health and Disease: Opportunities and Challenges.
38927274|a|Mitochondria, essential organelles orchestrating cellular metabolism, have emerged as central players in various disease pathologies. Recent research has shed light on mitohormesis, a concept proposing an adaptive response of mitochondria to minor disturbances in homeostasis, offering novel therapeutic avenues for mitochondria-related diseases. This comprehensive review explores the concept of mitohormesis, elucidating its induction mechanisms and occurrence. Intracellular molecules like reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium, mitochondrial unfolded proteins (UPRmt), and integrated stress response (ISR), along with external factors such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), physical stimuli, and exercise, play pivotal roles in regulating mitohormesis. Based on the available evidence, we elucidate how mitohormesis maintains mitochondrial homeostasis through mechanisms like mitochondrial quality control and mitophagy. Furthermore, the regulatory role of mitohormesis in mitochondria-related diseases is discussed. By envisioning future applications, this review underscores the significance of mitohormesis as a potential therapeutic target, paving the way for innovative interventions in disease management.
