34971747|a|Oxidative stress is defined as the persistent imbalance between the activity of toxic reactive forms of both oxygen and nitrogen and the antioxidant defense. In low concentrations, they are essential for the proper functioning of the body. Still, their excessive amount contributes to the damage of the biomolecules, consequently leading to various pathologies of the organism. Due to the lipid-rich brain structure, enormous oxygen consumption, and the lack of a sufficient antioxidant barrier make it highly susceptible to oxidative imbalance. Hence, oxidative stress has been linked to various psychiatric disorders. These diseases include all behavioral, emotional, and cognitive abnormalities associated with a significant impediment to social life. Each of the diseases in question: Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, is characterized by excessive oxidative stress. Considerable damages to DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and mitochondrial dysfunction, are observed. All conditions show increased lipid peroxidation, which appears to be typical of psychiatric disorders because the brain contains large amounts of these types of molecules. In addition, numerous abnormalities in the antioxidant defense are noted, but the results of studies on the activity of antioxidant enzymes differ significantly. The most promising biomarkers seem to be GSH in Alzheimer's disease as an early-stage marker of the disease and thioredoxin in schizophrenia as a marker for therapy monitoring. Data from the literature are consistent with the decrease in antioxidants such as vitamin C, E, uric acid, albumin, etc. Despite these numerous inconsistencies, it seems that oxidative stress is present in the course of psychiatric diseases. Still, it cannot be conclusively determined whether it is the direct cause of development, a consequence of other abnormalities at the biochemical or molecular level, or the result of the disease itself.
