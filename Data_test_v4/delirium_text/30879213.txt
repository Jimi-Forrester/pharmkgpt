30879213|t|Predictors of long-term survival after hip fractures?-5-year results of a prospective study in Germany.
30879213|a|The incidence of hip fractures is increasing due to demographic transition. Data on long-term survival and influencing factors are sparse. Our prospective observational study with 395 patients shows a survival of 38% after 5 years. Significant risk factors were male gender, higher age, lower Barthel Index, lower Charlson Comorbidity Score, lower Mini-Mental State Examination, and delirium during hospitalization. PURPOSE: The incidence of hip fractures is increasing due to demographic transition. Until now, they are associated with poor results and high mortality rates. Data on long-term survival and influencing factors are sparse. Therefore, a prospective observational study was conducted. METHODS: Patients >= 60 years with hip fracture were included in this prospective study between 2009 and 2011. Demographic parameters, as well as ASA Score, pre-fracture Barthel Index and EQ-5D, Mini-Mental State Examination, Charlson Comorbidity Score, fracture type, type of surgical treatment, place of discharge, and arising complications were registered. Outcome parameter was survival during a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 539 patients attended to our emergency room during the period of recruitment. The recruitment rate was 75%. A total of 402 patients were included; 7 were lost to follow-up, and 152 (38%) survived the study period. The mortality was more than 25% in the first year after fracture. Subsequently, it was between 7 and 9% per year. In the multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for dying were male gender (p = 0.002), higher age (p < 0.001), lower Charlson Comorbidity Score (p = 0.033), lower Barthel Index (p = 0.024), lower Mini-Mental State Examination (p = 0.002), and occurrence of delirium during hospitalization (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm poor results of geriatric patients after hip fracture. While early results might be influenced by optimal fracture care, long-term results seem to be determined by not changeable patient factors. Nevertheless, more than one third of surviving patients after 5 years justify the elaborate treatment algorithms for these fragile patients.
