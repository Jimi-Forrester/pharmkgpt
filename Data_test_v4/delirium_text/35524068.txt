35524068|a|Real-world evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of abaloparatide versus teriparatide in women with osteoporosis may help inform treatment decisions. Following 18 months of treatment, abaloparatide was comparable to teriparatide for prevention of nonvertebral fractures, resulted in a 22% risk reduction for hip fractures, and demonstrated similar cardiovascular safety. Osteoporotic fracture risk can be reduced with anabolic or antiresorptive medications. In addition to efficacy and safety data from controlled clinical trials, real-world evidence on comparative effectiveness and safety may help inform treatment decisions. INTRODUCTION: The real-world effectiveness of abaloparatide versus teriparatide on nonvertebral fracture (NVF) incidence and cardiovascular safety during the 19-month period after treatment initiation were evaluated (NCT04974723). METHODS: Anonymized US patient claims data from Symphony Health, Integrated Dataverse (IDV) , May 1, 2017 to July 31, 2019, included women aged >= 50 years with >= 1 prescription of abaloparatide or teriparatide and no prior anabolic therapy. Most were enrolled in commercial and Medicare health plans. Index was the date of the initial prescription dispensed during the identification period. In 1:1 propensity score matched cohorts, time to first NVF following index date, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and MACE + heart failure (HF) were compared between cohorts using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Propensity score matching yielded 11,616 patients per cohort. Overall median age (interquartile range) was 67 (61, 75) years, and 25.6% had a fracture history. Over 19 months, 335 patients on abaloparatide and 375 on teriparatide had a NVF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.89 [0.77, 1.03]), and 121 and 154 patients, respectively, had a hip fracture [HR (95% CI): 0.78 (0.62, 1.00)]. The MACE and MACE + HF rates were similar between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Following 18 months of treatment, abaloparatide was comparable to teriparatide for prevention of NVF and similar cardiovascular safety was demonstrated between cohorts.
