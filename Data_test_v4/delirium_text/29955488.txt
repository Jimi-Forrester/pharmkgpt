29955488|t|Mania possibly linked with bupropion for smoking cessation: A case report.
29955488|a|Bupropion is an antidepressant thought to have a reduced risk of inducing mood switching as compared to other antidepressants. Minimal information is available on the induction of mood shifts when used for smoking cessation. This case describes a 38-year-old female who experienced mania following initiation of bupropion for smoking cessation. After completion of a thorough literature search, this appears to be the first case report describing mania induced by bupropion that was refractory to medications and was resolved with electroconvulsive therapy. This case highlights the need for clinicians to perform thorough histories of patients to avoid missing psychiatric history prior to starting bupropion as well as monitor for changes in mood or behavior after initiation of therapy.
