29162967|t|Lubricin: A Principal Modulator of the Psychoneuroendocrine - Osteoimmune Interactome - Implications for Novel Treatments of Osteoarthritic Pathologies.
29162967|a|Lubricin is a synovial glycoprotein that contributes to joint lubrication. We propose the hypothesis that lubricin is a key modulator of the psychoneuroendocrine-osteoimmune interactome, with important clinical relevance for osteoarthritic pathologies. We consider a variety of neuroendocrine-immune factors, including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the modulation of lubricin in rheumatic complications. Based on our preliminary immunocytochemistry and fractal analysis data, and in the context of translational research of modern healthcare, we propose that molecular lubricin gene expression modification by means of the novel CRISPR/Cas system be considered for osteoarthritic therapies.
