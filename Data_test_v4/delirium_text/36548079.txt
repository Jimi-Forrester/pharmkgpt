36548079|a|OBJECTIVE: The narrative description (ND) test objectively measures the ability to understand and describe visual scenes. As subtle differences in speech occur early in cognitive decline, we analyzed linguistic features for their utility in detecting cognitive impairment and predicting downstream decline. METHOD: Participants (n = 52) with normal cognition to mild dementia performed the ND test (watched twenty 30-s video clips and described the visual content). Cognitive function was followed for up to 5 years. We computed simple linguistic features such as content efficiency, speech rate, and part of speech and unique word counts. We examined (a) relationships between cognitive status and ND score and linguistic features; (b) ability to discriminate early cognitive impairment from normal cognition using ND score and linguistic features; and (c) whether ND score and linguistic features were associated with future cognitive functional decline. RESULTS: Many of the linguistic-feature metrics were related to cognitive status. Many of the linguistic features could distinguish between the cognitively normal group and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Dementia groups. The area under the curve (AUC) for ND score alone was 0.74, with a nonsignificant increase to 0.78 when adding mean word length. Among participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at the first visit, a smaller number of words plus more interjections or a lower ND score at baseline were predictive of future cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: While many linguistic features were associated with cognitive status, and some were able to detect early cognitive impairment or predictive of future cognitive decline, all the features we tested seem to have been captured by the ND score. Thus, adding linguistic measures to the ND test score did not add to its value in assessing current or predicting future cognitive status.
