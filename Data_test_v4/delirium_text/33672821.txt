33672821|a|Hyperuricemia is a risk factor for gout. It has been well observed that a large proportion of individuals with hyperuricemia have never had a gout flare(s), while some patients with gout can have a normuricemia. This raises a puzzle of the real role of serum uric acid (SUA) in the occurrence of gout flares. As the molecule of uric acid has its dual effects in vivo with antioxidant properties as well as being an inflammatory promoter, it has been placed in a delicate position in balancing metabolisms. Gout seems to be a multifactorial metabolic disease and its pathogenesis should not rely solely on hyperuricemia or monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. This critical review aims to unfold the mechanisms of the SUA role participating in gout development. It also discusses some key elements which are prerequisites for the formation of gout in association with the current therapeutic regime. The compilation should be helpful in precisely fighting for a cure of gout clinically and pharmaceutically.
