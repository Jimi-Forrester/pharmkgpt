35987203|a|The drivers of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain incompletely understood. Utilizing directly converted induced neurons (iNs) from AD-patient-derived fibroblasts, we identified a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis in AD iNs. Pathological isoform switching of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M (PKM) toward the cancer-associated PKM2 isoform conferred metabolic and transcriptional changes in AD iNs. These alterations occurred via PKM2's lack of metabolic activity and via nuclear translocation and association with STAT3 and HIF1alpha to promote neuronal fate loss and vulnerability. Chemical modulation of PKM2 prevented nuclear translocation, restored a mature neuronal metabolism, reversed AD-specific gene expression changes, and re-activated neuronal resilience against cell death.
