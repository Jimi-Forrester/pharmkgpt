37793397|t|Nature as a 'Lifeline': The Power of Photography when Exploring the Experiences of Older Adults living with Memory Loss and Memory Concerns.
37793397|a|The visual is an underutilised modality through which to investigate experiences of memory loss in older people. We describe a visual ethnography with older adults experiencing subjective or objective memory loss, receiving a cognitive wellbeing group intervention designed to prevent cognitive decline and dementia (APPLE-Tree programme). We aimed to explore lived experiences of people with memory concerns, how participants engaged with this photography and co-design project, and how collaboration with an artist/photographer enhanced this process. Nineteen participants shared photographs reflecting what they valued in their daily lives, their experiences of memory concerns, and the intervention. Fourteen participated in qualitative photo-elicitation interviews, and thirteen collaborated with a professional artist/photographer to co-create an exhibition, in individual meetings and workshops, during which a researcher took ethnographic field notes. Eight participants were re-interviewed after the exhibition launch. We contextualise images produced by participants in relation to discourses around the visual and ageing and highlight their relationship with themes developed through thematic analysis that interconnects photographic, observational and interview data. We present themes around the use of photographs to: (1) celebrate connections to nature as a lifeline; (2) anchor lives within the context of relationships with family; (3) reflect on self and identity, enduring through ageing, memory concerns, pandemic, and ageing stereotypes. We explore visual research as a powerful tool for eliciting meaningful accounts from older adults experiencing cognitive change and to connect the arts and social sciences within ageing studies.
