36065287|t|PDA-Based Drug Delivery Nanosystems: A Potential Approach for Glioma Treatment.
36065287|a|Glioma is characterized by high mortality and low postoperative survival. Despite the availability of various therapeutic approaches and molecular typing, the treatment failure rate and the recurrence rate of glioma remain high. Given the limitations of existing therapeutic tools, nanotechnology has emerged as an alternative treatment option. Nanoparticles, such as polydopamine (PDA)-based nanoparticles, are embodied with reliable biodegradability, efficient drug loading rate, relatively low toxicity, considerable biocompatibility, excellent adhesion properties, precisely targeted delivery, and strong photothermal conversion properties. Therefore, they can further enhance the therapeutic effects in patients with glioma. Moreover, polydopamine contains pyrocatechol, amino and carboxyl groups, active double bonds, catechol, and other reactive groups that can react with biofunctional molecules containing amino, aldehyde, or sulfhydryl groups (main including, self-polymerization, non-covalent self-assembly, pi-pi stacking, electrostatic attraction interaction, chelation, coating and covalent co-assembly), which form a reversible dynamic covalent Schiff base bond that is extremely sensitive to pH values. Meanwhile, PDA has excellent adhesion capability that can be further functionally modified. Consequently, the aim of this review is to summarize the application of PDA-based NPs in glioma and to acquire insight into the therapeutic effect of the drug-loaded PDA-based nanocarriers (PDA NPs). A wealthy understanding and argument of these sides is anticipated to afford a better approach to develop more reasonable and valid PDA-based cancer nano-drug delivery systems. Finally, we discuss the expectation for the prospective application of PDA in this sphere and some individual viewpoints.
