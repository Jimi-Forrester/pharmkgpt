38130349|t|Delirium Assessment Treatment Strategies in Critically Ill Pediatric Patients: A Pediatric Pharmacy Association Practice-Based Research Network Survey Study.
38130349|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe overall screening, prevention, and treatments for pediatric delirium at various neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), and pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) from the Pediatric Pharmacy Association (PPA) membership. The primary objective was to identify the number of respondents that had a defined delirium-based protocol. The secondary objectives included identification of delirium assessment tools used, first- and second-line delirium treatment options, and monitoring practices for antipsychotics for delirium management. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to PPA members from February 8, 2022, to March, 25, 2022. Comparisons between the NICUs, PICUs, and CICUs were conducted by using chi-square tests, with a priori p value of <0.05. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 84 respondents at 62 institutions; respondents practiced in the PICU or mixed PICU (n = 48; 57.1%), CICU (n = 13; 15.5%), and NICU (n = 23; 27.4%). Sixty-one respondents (72.6%) noted their units routinely screen for delirium, and there was a significant difference between the respondents of different units that use a delirium scoring tool (p < 0.01). Only 33 respondents (39.3%) had a defined delirium protocol, and there was no difference between units (p = 0.31). The most common agents used for delirium treatment were quetiapine and risperidone. There was variability in the monitoring used between respondents, but the majority (n = 74; 88%) monitor electrocardiograms to assess the corrected QT interval, but practice variability existed. CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents did not have a defined delirium protocol. Variations were noted in the treatment options and monitoring for critically ill pediatric patients with delirium.
