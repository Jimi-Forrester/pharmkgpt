19840942|t|A common mutation in paraoxonase-2 results in impaired lactonase activity.
19840942|a|Paraoxonases (PONs) are a family of lactonases with promiscuous enzyme activity that has been implicated in multiple diseases. PON2 is intracellularly located, is the most ubiquitously expressed PON, and has the highest lactonase activity of the PON family members. Whereas some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1 have resulted in altered enzymatic activity in serum, to date the functional consequences of SNPs on PON2 function remain unknown. We hypothesized that a common PON2 SNP would result in impaired lactonase activity. Substitution of cysteine for serine at codon 311 in recombinant PON2 resulted in normal protein production and localization but altered glycosylation and decreased lactonase activity. Moreover, we screened 200 human lung samples for the PON2 Cys(311) variant and found that in vivo this mutation impaired lactonase activity. These data suggest that impaired lactonase activity may play a role in innate immunity, atherosclerosis, and other diseases associated with the PON2 311 SNP.
