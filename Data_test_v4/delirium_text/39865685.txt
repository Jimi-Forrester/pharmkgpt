39865685|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a stage between cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease. Despite much published research on MCI, there continues to be a knowledge gap of volumetric brain changes in MCI versus cognitively normal (CN) in racially diverse, community-based samples. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to understand differences in volume of selected brain regions in individuals with MCI versus those who are cognitively normal. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with 1835 participants, which sampled all cognitively impaired participants (n = 667) and a subsample of cognitively normal participants from the ARIC neurocognitive study (ARIC-NCS). All individuals underwent a brain MRI. Two models (5 versus 22 regions of interest [ROI]) were built to analyze differences in brain volume between cognitively normal and MCI, and among 3 cognitive domains (memory, language, executive function). Using previous visits data, we estimated the standard deviations of 20-year cognitive decline equivalent to the difference in brain volume between MCI and CN. RESULTS: Every lobe was significantly smaller in individuals with MCI, with the largest difference observed in the temporal lobe. Moreover, there was a significant difference between MCI and CN in every subregion within the temporal lobe. The difference in volume between CN and MCI was equivalent to the total brain volume difference associated with a 1.24 standard deviation greater long-term cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of volume in all cortical lobes, but particularly in the temporal lobe, was associated with MCI. Additionally, significant volume differences were observed in the temporal lobe in all three cognitive domains.
