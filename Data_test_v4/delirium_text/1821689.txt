1821689|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid deposits in neocortex, hippocampus and amygdala. The major protein components of tangles and plaques have recently been identified. These findings, briefly reviewed here, will allow researchers to design investigations that will lead to an understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and to the development of new therapeutic approaches that may result in an effective treatment.
