37854697|a|Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) and the gamma-glutamyltransferase-CDT derived Anttila-Index are established biomarkers for sustained heavy alcohol consumption and their potential role to predict delirium and mortality in critically ill patients is not clear. In our prospective observational study, we included 343 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU, assessed the occurrence of delirium and investigated its association with biomarkers of alcohol abuse measured on the day of ICU admission. 35% of patients developed delirium during ICU stay. We found significantly higher CDT levels (p = 0.011) and Anttila-Index (p = 0.001) in patients with delirium. CDT above 1.7% (OR 2.06), CDT per percent increase (OR 1.26, AUROC 0.75), and Anttila-Index per unit increase (OR 1.28, AUROC 0.74) were associated with delirium development in adjusted regression models. Anttila-Index and CDT also correlated with delirium duration exceeding 5 days. Additionally, Anttila-Index above 4, Anttila-Index per unit increase, and CDT per percent increase were independently associated with hospital mortality.
