37396764|t|Modulated effectiveness of rehabilitation motivation by reward strategies combined with tDCS in stroke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
37396764|a|Background: Stroke survivors often exhibit low motivation for rehabilitation, hindering their ability to effectively complete rehabilitation training task effectively and participate in daily activities actively. Reward strategies have been identified as an effective method for boosting rehabilitation motivation, but their long-term efficacy remains uncertain. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been recognized as a technique that facilitates plastic changes and functional reorganization of cortical areas. Particularly, tDCS can improve the functional connectivity between brain regions associated with goal-directed behavior when applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Combing reward strategies with tDCS (RStDCS) has been shown to motivate healthy individuals to exert more effort in task performance. However, research exploring the combined and sustained effects of these strategies on rehabilitation motivation in stroke survivors is lacking. Methods and design: Eighty-seven stroke survivors with low motivation and upper extremity dysfunction will be randomized to receive either conventional treatment, RS treatment, or RStDCS treatment. The RStDCS group will receive reward strategies combined with anodal tDCS stimulation of the left dlPFC. The RS group will receive reward strategies combined with sham stimulation. The conventional group will receive conventional treatment combined with sham stimulation. tDCS stimulation is performed over 3 weeks of hospitalization, 20 min/time, five times a week. Reward strategies refers to personalized active exercise programs for patients during hospitalization and at home. Patients can voluntarily choose tasks for active exercise and self-report to the therapist so as to punch a card for points and exchange gifts. The conventional group will receive home rehabilitation instructions prior to discharge. Rehabilitation motivation, measured using RMS. RMS, FMA, FIM, and ICF activity and social engagement scale will be compared at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-enrollment to evaluate patients' multifaceted health condition based on the ICF framework. Discussion: This study integrates knowledge from social cognitive science, economic behavioral science, and other relevant fields. We utilize straightforward and feasible reward strategies, combined with neuromodulation technology, to jointly improve patients' rehabilitation motivation. Behavioral observations and various assessment tools will be used to monitor patients' rehabilitation motivation and multifaceted health condition according to the ICF framework. The aim is to provide a preliminary exploration path for professionals to develop comprehensive strategies for improving patient rehabilitation motivation and facilitating a complete "hospital-home-society" rehabilitation process.
