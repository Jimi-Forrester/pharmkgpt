1315381|t|Phosphatidylinositol kinase is reduced in Alzheimer's disease.
1315381|a|Phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase and PI phosphate (PIP) kinase activities were measured in postmortem samples of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease and nondemented control subjects. A membrane-free cytosolic fraction from four neocortical locations, with exogenous inositol lipids as the substrate, was used. Tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease was characterized by reduced PIP formation; the reduction was 50% in prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and parietal cortex and 40% in precentral gyrus. In contrast, no alterations were found in PI bisphosphate formation in these four neocortical locations. The specific changes in PI kinase but not PIP kinase activity suggest that the findings may have functional relevance to the involvement of brain membrane processes in Alzheimer's disease.
