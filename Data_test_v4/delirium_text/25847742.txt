25847742|t|[A case of bisalbuminemia in a patient with digestive adenocarcinoma].
25847742|a|UNLABELLED: Bisalbuminemia whether hereditary or acquired, is a rare electrophoretic abnormality of albumin, characterized by a duplication of the albumin fraction on the electrophoretic trace of the serum proteins. This duplication reflects the presence in the same individual normal plasma albumin and a modified albumin. OBSERVATION: This is a patient of 62 years hospitalized at the Internal Medicine Department of HMIMV for liver metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma and including serum protein electrophoresis (EP) performed on capillary (Capillarys society Sebia) reveals bisalbuminemia. The family investigation has ruled that inheritance of acquired bisalbuminemia to retain appearance. COMMENT: Bisalbuminemia acquired outside treatment with high doses of beta-lactam antibiotics, chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst rupture or fixing a monoclonal immunoglobulin on albumin in the myeloma subjects is an exceptional event. The pathophysiologic mechanism in the reported cases remains unexplained as is also the case of acquired bisalbuminemias associated with other pathological contexts (Alzheimer's disease nephrotic syndrome). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, the bisalbuminemia in the gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma liver metastases has not been reported to date, hence the importance of the reported cases.
