37551643|t|Language Impairment in Vascular Dementia: A Clinical Review.
37551643|a|Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) encompasses a wide range of conditions, including cognitive impairment associated with stroke or vascular brain injury, mild vascular cognitive impairment, and vascular dementia (VD). Knowledge of language impairment associated with VD is far less extensive than that of Alzheimer's disease. Although not prevalent in VD, impairment in language skills has been reported. A better understanding of the neurolinguistic features associated with the different presentations of VD could facilitate medical diagnosis. In this article, we report data on language impairment in VD, with particular attention to their primary or secondary functional origin. To better appreciate this functional origin, we also outline the main characteristics of impairment in other cognitive functions. Key elements that should be considered in the speech-language assessment of individuals with possible or proven VD are also highlighted.
