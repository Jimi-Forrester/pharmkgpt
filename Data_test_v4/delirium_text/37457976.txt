37457976|a|Dementia is a growing public health concern, with an estimated prevalence of 57 million adults worldwide. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60-80% of the cases. Clinical trials testing potential drugs and neuroprotective agents have proven futile, and currently approved drugs only provide symptomatic benefits. Emerging epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that lifestyle changes, including diet and physical activity, offer an alternative therapeutic route for slowing and preventing cognitive decline and dementia. Age is the single most common risk factor for dementia, and it is associated with slowing cellular bioenergetics and metabolic processes. Therefore, a nutrient-rich diet is critical for optimal brain health. Furthermore, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a risk factor for AD, and diets that reduce the risk of T2D may confer neuroprotection. Foods predominant in Mediterranean, MIND, and DASH diets, including fruits, leafy green vegetables, fish, nuts, and olive oil, may prevent or slow cognitive decline. The mechanisms by which these nutrients promote brain health, however, are not yet completely understood. Other dietary approaches and eating regimes, including ketogenic and intermittent fasting, are also emerging as beneficial for brain health. This review summarizes the pathophysiology, associated risk factors, and the potential neuroprotective pathways activated by several diets and eating regimes that have shown promising results in promoting brain health and preventing dementia.
