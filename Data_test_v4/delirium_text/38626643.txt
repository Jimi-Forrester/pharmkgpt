38626643|t|Fixed dose ketamine for prehospital management of hyperactive delirium with severe agitation.
38626643|a|INTRODUCTION: Patients exhibiting signs of hyperactive delirium with severe agitation (HDSA) may require sedating medications for stabilization and safe transport to the hospital. Determining the patient's weight and calculating the correct weight-based dose may be challenging in an emergency. A fixed dose ketamine protocol is an alternative to the traditional weight-based administration, which may also reduce dosing errors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of adverse events following pre-hospital ketamine administration for HDSA. METHODS: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) records from four agencies were searched for prehospital ketamine administration. Cases were included if a 250 mg dose of ketamine was administered on standing order to an adult patient for clinical signs consistent with HDSA. Protocols allowed for a second 250 mg dose of ketamine if the first dose was not effective. Both the 250 mg initial dose and the total prehospital dose were analyzed for weight based dosing and adverse events. RESULTS: Review of 132 cases revealed 60 cases that met inclusion criteria. Patients' median weight was 80 kg (range: 50-176 kg). No patients were intubated by EMS, one only requiring suction, three required respiratory support via bag valve mask (BVM). Six (10%) patients were intubated in the emergency department (ED) including the three (5%) supported by EMS via BVM, three (5%) others who were sedated further in the ED prior to requiring intubation. All six patients who were intubated were discharged from the hospital with a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 score. The weight-based dosing equivalent for the 250 mg initial dose (OR: 2.62, CI: 0.67-10.22) and the total prehospital dose, inclusive of the 12 patients that were administered a second dose, (OR: 0.74, CI: 0.27, 2.03), were not associated with the need for intubation. CONCLUSION: The 250 mg fixed dose of ketamine was not >5 mg/kg weight-based dose equivalent for all patients in this study. Although a second 250 mg dose of ketamine was permitted under standing orders, only 12 (20%) of the patients were administered a second dose, none experienced an adverse event. This indicates that the 250 mg initial dose was effective for 80% of the patients. Four patients with prehospital adverse events likely related to the administration of ketamine were found. One required suction, three (5%) requiring BVM respiratory support by EMS were subsequently intubated upon arrival in the ED. All 60 patients were discharged from the hospital alive. Further research is needed to determine an optimal single administration dose for ketamine in patients exhibiting signs of HDSA, if employing a standardized fixed dose medication protocol streamlines administration, and if the fixed dose medication reduces the occurrence of dosage errors.
