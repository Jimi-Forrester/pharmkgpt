29436433|a|Symptom management is an important part of both palliative care and end-of-life care. This article will examine the recent research evidence about drugs commonly used for symptom management in adult patients receiving palliative care. In particular, the management of symptoms where recent palliative care-based evidence has changed recommended practice will be reviewed. This includes: breathlessness, delirium, nausea and vomiting in bowel obstruction, opioid-induced constipation and upper respiratory tract secretions. For each symptom, a review of recent pharmacological evidence has been undertaken, with emphasis on potential important changes to physicians' practice.
