33575836|a|There are increasingly comprehensive data on recognition of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic on global populations. In most regions of the world, the economic and psychological burden on the general population and persons with mental disorders has risen sharply over the course of the pandemic. Beyond anxieties regarding severe acute respiratory syndromes due to coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, in many countries the measures for containing the pandemic also led to psychological burdens. It was shown that social distancing and contact restrictions were risk factors for the development or deterioration of mental health problems on a global scale. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or reduced mental health services in many countries. Thus, there is a substantial need for low threshold offers of assistance and for coping strategies. Current studies could show that certain coping strategies, such as virtual social contacts and physical activity, appear to be useful in counteracting the negative psychological sequelae of the pandemic; however, in order to improve care provision for people with psychological burden and mental illness in the medium term, it is necessary to offer targeted treatment, such as online psychotherapy in particular. Collaborative research tackles poverty, social isolation and loneliness.
