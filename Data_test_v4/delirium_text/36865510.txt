36865510|t|Incidence, Subtypes, Risk factors, and Outcome of Delirium: A Prospective Observational Study from Indian Intensive Care Unit.
36865510|a|Background: Delirium is a common, under-recognized, and often fatal condition in critically ill patients, characterized by acute disorder of attention and cognition. The global prevalence varies with a negative impact on outcomes. A paucity of Indian studies exists that have systematically assessed delirium. Objective: A prospective observational study designed to determine the incidence, subtypes, risk factors, complications, and outcome of delirium in Indian intensive care units (ICUs). Patients and methods: Among 1198 adult patients screened during the study period (December 2019-September 2021), 936 patients were included. The confusion assessment method score (CAM-ICU) and Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) were used, with additional confirmation of delirium by the psychiatrist/neurophysician. Risk factors and related complications were compared with a control group. Results: Delirium occurred in 22.11% of critically ill patients. The hypoactive subtype was the most common (44.9%). The risk factors recognized were higher age, increased acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE-II) score, hyperuricemia, raised creatinine, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, alcoholism, and smoking. Precipitating factors included patients admitted on noncubicle beds, proximity to the nursing station, requiring ventilation, as well as the use of sedatives, steroids, anticonvulsants, and vasopressors. Complications observed in the delirium group were unintentional removal of catheters (35.7%), aspiration (19.8%), need for reintubation (10.6%), decubitus ulcer formation (18.4%), and high mortality (21.3% vs 5%). Conclusion: Delirium is common in Indian ICUs with a potential effect on length of stay and mortality. Identification of incidence, subtype, and risk factors is the first step toward prevention of this important cognitive dysfunction in the ICU.
