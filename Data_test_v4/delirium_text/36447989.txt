36447989|a|Background: To investigate the effect of dapagliflozin combined with cognitive behavior training on quality of life and cognitive function in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complicated with mild cognitive impairment. Methods: Ninety-six elderly patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment treated in Shenzhen People's Hospital, Guangdong Province China from June 2019 to December 2020 were selected and equally randomized into control group (CG) and experimental group (EG). The CG received conventional intervention, while the EG received dapagliflozin combined with cognitive behavior training based on the CG. The clinical observation indexes of both groups were compared to assess the clinical intervention effect of dapagliflozin combined with cognitive behavior training on elderly patients with T2DM complicated with mild cognitive impairment. Results: After intervention, the blood glucose levels of both groups decreased, and compared with the CG, the blood glucose level of the EG was markedly lower (P<0.05). The scores of C-DMSES, ADL and MMSE of both groups were higher than those before intervention, and compared with the CG, the scores of the EG were obviously higher (P<0.05). The QOL-AD scores of both groups gradually increased, and compared with the CG, the QOL-AD scores of the EG were higher at 3 and 6 months after intervention (P<0.05). Conclusion: For elderly patients with T2DM complicated with mild cognitive impairment, dapagliflozin combined with cognitive behavior training intervention can obviously improve their cognitive function, self-efficacy of diabetes management and quality of life, which should be promoted in clinic.
