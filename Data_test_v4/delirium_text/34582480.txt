34582480|a|INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimunne disorder affecting both small and large synovial joints, leading to their destruction. Platelet biomarkers are involved in inflammation in RA patients. Increased circulating platelet counts in RA patients may contribute to platelet hyperactivity and thrombosis. In this pilot study we evaluated platelet mitochondrial bioenergy function, CoQ10 levels and oxidative stress in RA patients. METHODS: Twenty-one RA patients and 19 healthy volunteers participated in the study. High resolution respirometry (HRR) was used for analysis of platelet mitochondrial bioenergetics. CoQ10 was determined by HPLC method; TBARS were detected spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Slight dysfunction in platelet mitochondrial respiration and reduced platelet CoQ10 levels were observed in RA patients compared with normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: The observed decrease in platelet CoQ10 levels may lead to platelet mitochondrial dysfunction in RA diseases. Determination of platelet mitochondrial function and platelet CoQ10 levels could be used as new diagnostic strategies for mitochondrial bioenergetics in rheumatoid diseases.
