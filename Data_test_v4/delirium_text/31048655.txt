31048655|a|BACKGROUND: There have been reports of neurolytic transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block using different agents such as alcohol or phenol for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain caused by malignant abdominal wall invasion. However, to date, there have been no reports on neurolytic abdominal wall blocks for pain with non-cancer-related origin in cancer patients. CASE: We performed subcostal TAP neurolysis using ethanol in a patient with esophageal cancer with constant pain at the site of gastrostomy. After neurolysis, the patient's overall pain decreased, with the exception of pain in the medial part of the gastrostomy site. We performed additional rectus sheath neurolysis using ethanol for the treatment of continuous pain at the medial site, and the effect of neurolysis has persisted for over 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-based TAP neurolysis and rectus sheath neurolysis provide effective pain control in a cancer patient with chronic treatment-related pain involving the abdominal wall.
