31228378|a|To study the effectiveness of the inclusion of Cytoflavin in the management of postoperative delirium treating in elderly patients. Analyzed the results of treatment of 89 elderly patients (65-74 years) who, according to similar emergency indications, underwent surgery and postoperatively showed signs of delirium (according to the DDS scale >=8 points). Depending on the treatment regimen, the patients were divided into three groups: in the first (n=32) group, bromodihydrochlorophenylbenzodiazepine was administered intravenously (1-5 min) in a dose of 1 mg in the 1st group (n=32) to the group (patients of the 2nd group (n=28) with the same purpose and at the same time cytoflavin was injected: 10 ml of the drug in dilution per 200 ml of 10% glucose solution intravenously at a rate of 140 drops (7 ml) per minute. Patients of 3rd group (n=29) were injected with ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate intravenous (within 5-7 min) at a dose of 200 mg. The condition was assessed using the SOFA, DDS and RASS scales. The inclusion of drugs with antioxidant/membrane-protective action (Cytoflavin and ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate) in the treatment regimen of postoperative delirium in the elderly increases the effectiveness of treatment, which is manifested in more rapid relief of the condition. When comparing the efficacy of Cytoflavin and ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate, it was noted that in a number of indicators (restoration of spontaneous breathing, improvement after the first dose and complete relief of signs of delirium) both drugs showed comparable results, however, when assessing the depth of sedation (on the RASS scale), Cytoflavin was more effective (p=0,001).The obtained results of the effectiveness of cytoflavin in combination with good patient tolerance allows us to recommend the inclusion of the drug in the treatment regimens of this pathology.
