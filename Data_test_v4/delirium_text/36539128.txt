36539128|t|THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE LEVEL AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE DISABILITY.
36539128|a|The second common disease that is neurodegenerative is connected with PD in elderly patients which is the distribution of gender. The proliferation has been reported in the last decade in homocysteine (Hcy) along with other diseases, epilepsy, Alzheimer, and idiopathic Parkinson's. Objectives - identifying the elevated level of Hcy which is a common factor for developmental disease and making the increase in motor disability of Hcy. With Parkinson's disease, a total of 70 patients were included in the case-control research which indicates that the newly diagnosed patients are not receiving any treatment at the department of neurology. These patients were compared with 70 healthy individuals attending the hospital for routine checkups matched for age and sex who were considered the control group. measurements of serum Hcy levels were done in both the case and control groups by the ELIZA method. This study shows that The mean Hcy level among the Parkinson's bunch was (16.884 +- 15.582) which is essentially higher than that of the control bunch (9.493 +- 3.752) at p=0.000 and albeit The Hcy level is higher in the currently analyzed patients (14.895+-9.073) contrasted and recently analyzed patients (17.640+-17.453) this distinction is genuinely non-critical Hcy level has a moderate direct relationship with the importance of brain highlights of the illness (r=0.682) in a genuinely huge way (p=0.000) While the connection with the term is exceptionally powerless (r=0.198) and measurably non-critical. Parkinson's patients have raised degrees of Hcy contrasted with ordinary individuals and there is an immediate relationship between the Hcy level and the importance of brain highlights of the sickness despite the fact that the Hcy level expanded with the span of the illness this shows a non-critical connection with sickness importance.
