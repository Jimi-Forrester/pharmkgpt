36254294|t|Role of gasdermin family proteins in the occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
36254294|a|Primary liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 75%-85% of cases. The occurrence and progression of HCC involve multiple events. Pyroptosis is a gasdermins mediated programmed cell death and is intricately associated with cancerogenesis, including HCC. This review mainly concerns the recent research advances of the gasdermin family members in HCC. The biological roles and specific expression patterns of the family members are discussed, especially those that are involved in the regulatory pathways in the occurrence and progression of HCC. We provide the latest progress into the distinct molecular mechanisms of gasdermin family members involved in the occurrence and development of HCC.
