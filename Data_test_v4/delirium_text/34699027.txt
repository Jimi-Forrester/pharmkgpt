34699027|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the foremost type of dementia that afflicts considerable morbidity and mortality in aged population. Several transcription molecules, pathways, and molecular mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, and immune system interact in a multifaceted way that disrupt physiological processes (cell growth, differentiation, survival, lipid and energy metabolism, endocytosis) leading to apoptosis, tauopathy, beta-amyloidopathy, neuron, and synapse loss, which play an important role in AD pathophysiology. Despite of stupendous advancements in pathogenic mechanisms, treatment of AD is still a nightmare in the field of medicine. There is compelling urgency to find not only symptomatic but effective disease-modifying therapies. Recently, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt are identified as a pathway triggered by diverse stimuli, including insulin, growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress, that link amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary tangles, and brain atrophy. The present review aims to explore and analyze the role of PI3K-Akt pathway in AD and agents which may modulate Akt and have therapeutic prospects in AD. The literature was researched using keywords "PI3K-Akt" and "Alzheimer's disease" from PubMed, Web of Science, Bentham, Science Direct, Springer Nature, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases including books. Articles published from 1992 to 2021 were prioritized and analyzed for their strengths and limitations, and most appropriate ones were selected for the purpose of review. PI3K-Akt pathway regulates various biological processes such as cell proliferation, motility, growth, survival, and metabolic functions, and inhibits many neurotoxic mechanisms. Furthermore, experimental data indicate that PI3K-Akt signaling might be an important therapeutic target in treatment of AD.
