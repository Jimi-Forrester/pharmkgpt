38438485|a|We investigated the effects of acute-phase intensive electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on physical function in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in the intensive care unit (ICU). Consecutive COVID-19 patients requiring IMV admitted to a university hospital ICU between January and April 2022 (EMS therapy group) or between March and September 2021 (age-matched historical control group) were included in this retrospective observational case-control study. EMS was applied to both upper and lower limb muscles for up to 2 weeks in the EMS therapy group. The study population consisted of 16 patients undergoing EMS therapy and 16 age-matched historical controls (median age, 71 years; 81.2% male). The mean period until initiation of EMS therapy after ICU admission was 3.2 +- 1.4 days. The EMS therapy group completed a mean of 6.2 +- 3.7 EMS sessions, and no adverse events occurred. There were no significant differences between the two groups in Medical Research Council sum score (51 vs. 53 points, respectively; P = 0.439) or ICU mobility scale at ICU discharge. Addition of upper and lower limb muscle EMS therapy to an early rehabilitation program did not result in improved physical function at ICU discharge in severe COVID-19 patients.
