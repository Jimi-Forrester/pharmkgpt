33821435|t|A Review of Cancer Immunotherapy Toxicity II: Adoptive Cellular Therapies, Kinase Inhibitors, Monoclonal Antibodies, and Oncolytic Viruses.
33821435|a|Immunotherapy for cancer has undergone a rapid expansion in classes, agents, and indications. By utilizing aspects of the body's innate immune system, immunotherapy has improved life expectancy and quality of life for patients with several types of cancer. Adoptive cellular therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy, involve the genetic engineering of patient T cells to allow for targeting of neoplastic cells. Monitoring of patients during the lymphodepletion prior to therapy and following CAR T cell infusion is necessary to detect toxicity of therapy. Specific toxicities include cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity, both of which may be life-threatening. Tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids should be considered for moderate to severe toxicity. Kinase inhibitor toxicity can occur as "on target" effects or "off target" effects to multiple organ systems due to shared protein epitopes. Treatments are organ-specific. Infusion reactions are common during treatment with monoclonal antibodies and treatment is largely supportive. Clinical experience with oncolytic viruses is limited, but local reactions including cellulitis as well as systemic influenza-like syndromes have been seen but are typically mild. Although clinical experience with adverse effects due to newer immunotherapy agents is growing, an up-to-date understanding of their mechanisms and potential toxicities is critical.
