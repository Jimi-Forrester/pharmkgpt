36719834|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a main mechanism of cerebrovascular disease and is associated with various cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, treatment of CCH in clinical practice is not ideal, but neurotropin (NTP) has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect. Therefore, this study examined the effect and possible mechanism of NTP in nerve injury caused by CCH. A rat CCH model was established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO), and rats were treated with intragastric administration of NTP (200 nu/kg/day) for 28 consecutive days. After treatment, rats were subjected to the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test. Subsequently, an ELISA was applied to detect amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels in rat hippocampal tissues, quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays were used to detect the mRNA expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Trk B, and Western blots were used to detect the protein expression levels of BACE1, tau, p-tau, and protein kinase B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) pathway-related proteins. The rat model of CCH was successfully established by 2VO. Behavioral tests indicated that the cognitive ability of 2VO rats was severely impaired. NTP treatment greatly ameliorated the cognitive disability, reduced Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels and tau phosphorylation, and upregulated BACE1, Trk B, and BDNF expression in the hippocampus of 2VO rats. Finally, we found that NTP markedly activated Akt/GSK3beta pathway activity. NTP can ameliorate cognitive disability in CCH rats possibly by reducing Abeta accumulation and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. These effects of NTP may be related to the Akt/GSK3beta pathway activation. NTP may be a promising new drug candidate for CCH patients.
