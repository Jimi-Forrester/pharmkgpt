38238679|a|Salvia verticillata L. is a well-known herb rich in rosmarinic acid (RA) and with therapeutic values. To better understand the possible roles of phytohormones in the production of phenolic acids in S. verticillata, in this work, we investigated some physiological and biochemical responses of the species to methyl jasmonate (MJ) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as two effective elicitors. The leaves were sprayed with aqueous solutions containing 100 mg L-1 MWCNTs and 100 microM MJ and then harvested during interval times of exposure up to 96 h. The level of abscisic acid, as the first effective phytohormone, was altered in the leaves in response to MJ and MWCNTs elicitation (2.26- and 3.06-fold more than the control, respectively), followed by significant increases (P   0.05) detected in jasmonic acid and salicylic acid contents up to 8 h after exposure. Obtained data revealed that simultaneously with changes in phytohormone profiles, significant (P   0.05) rises were observed in the content of H2O2 (8.85- and 9.74-folds of control), and the amount of lipid peroxidation (10.18- and 17.01-folds of control) during the initial times after exposure to MJ and MWCNTs, respectively. Later, the content of phenolic acids increased in the elicited leaves due to changes in the transcription levels of key enzymes involved in their biosynthesis pathways, so 2.71- and 11.52-fold enhances observed in the RA content of the leaves after exposure to MJ and MWCNTs, respectively. It is reasonable to conclude that putative linkages between changes in some phytohormone pools lead to the accumulation of phenolic acids in the leaves of S. verticillata under elicitation. Overall, the current findings help us improve our understanding of the signal transduction pathways of the applied stimuli that led to enhanced secondary metabolite production in medicinal plants.
