37964480|a|The primary objective of this study was to investigate the factors contributing to hyperglycemic adverse events associated with the administration of remdesivir in hospitalized patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, the study aimed to develop a risk score model employing various machine learning approaches. A total of 1262 patients were enrolled in this investigation. The relationship between covariates and hyperglycemic adverse events was assessed through logistic regression analysis. Diverse machine learning algorithms were employed for the purpose of forecasting hyperglycemia-related complications. After adjusting for covariates, individuals with a body mass index >= 23 kg/m2 , those using proton pump inhibitors, cholinergic medications, or individuals with cardiovascular diseases exhibited approximately 2.41-, 2.73-, 2.65-, and 1.97-fold higher risks of experiencing hyperglycemic adverse events (95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.271-4.577, 1.223-6.081, 1.168-5.989, and 1.119-3.472, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression, elastic net, and random forest models displayed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.65, 0.66, and 0.60, respectively (95% CI 0.572 - 0.719, 0.640 - 0.671, and 0.583 - 0.611, respectively). This study comprehensively explored factors associated with hyperglycemic complications arising from remdesivir administration and, concurrently, leveraged a range of machine learning methodologies to construct a risk scoring model, thereby facilitating the tailoring of individualized remdesivir treatment regimens for patients with COVID-19.
