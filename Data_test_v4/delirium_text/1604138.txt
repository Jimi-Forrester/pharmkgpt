1604138|t|[Multiple cerebral hemorrhage and amyloid angiopathy of the white matter in a case of Alzheimer's disease].
1604138|a|Amyloid angiopathy is a common pathological finding in Alzheimer's disease. It usually involves leptomeningeal and cortical vessels but spares the white matter. It may cause lobar cerebral hemorrhages at a late stage of the disease. We report a case of Alzheimer's disease at an early stage with diffuse lesions of amyloid angiopathy including some within the white matter, apparently responsible for 2 deep and 1 superficial cerebral hemorrhages.
