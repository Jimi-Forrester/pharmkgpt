35740277|t|Apoptosis and (in) Pain-Potential Clinical Implications.
35740277|a|The deregulation of apoptosis is involved in the development of several pathologies, and recent evidence suggests that apoptosis may be involved in chronic pain, namely in neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain state caused by primary damage or dysfunction of the nervous system; however, the details of the molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Recently, it was found that nerve endings contain transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that sense and detect signals released by injured tissues and respond to these damage signals. TRP channels are similar to the voltage-gated potassium channels or nucleotide-gated channels that participate in calcium and magnesium homeostasis. TRP channels allowing calcium to penetrate into nerve terminals can activate apoptosis, leading to nerve terminal destruction. Further, some TRPs are activated by acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are mainly produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and an increase in ROS production and/or a decrease in the antioxidant network may induce oxidative stress (OS). Depending on the OS levels, they can promote cellular proliferation and/or cell degeneration or death. Previous studies have indicated that proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), play an important role in the peripheral mediation of neuropathic pain. This article aims to perform a review of the involvement of apoptosis in pain, particularly the role of OS and neuroinflammation, and the clinical relevance of this knowledge. The potential discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets can result in the development of more effective and targeted drugs to treat chronic pain, namely neuropathic pain. Highlights: Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can activate cell signaling pathways that can lead to nerve terminal destruction by apoptosis. These could constitute potential new pain biomarkers and targets for therapy in neuropathic pain.
