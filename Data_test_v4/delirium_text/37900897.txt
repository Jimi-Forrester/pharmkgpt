37900897|a|Introduction: The use of medical cannabis in pediatrics is not common in clinical practice, and there is a lack of prospective studies, especially in pediatric subpopulations. This study aimed to provide data on the off-label administration of tetrahydrocannabinol ( 9-THC) in a pediatric tertiary center in Austria. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was performed to assess the use of  9-THC at the Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the Comprehensive Center of Pediatrics (Medical University Vienna) from 2016 to 2018. The use of  9-THC in the Pediatric Department at the Medical University Vienna between 2016 and 2018 was analyzed using a retrospective design. Results: The most common diagnoses of patients receiving  9-THC were brain cancer and genetic diseases, including inborn metabolic disorders. The 32 patients who had received  9-THC had an arithmetic mean of 9.42 diagnoses and were treated with an arithmetic mean of 13.52 other drugs. Eleven of the 32 patients died by the end of the study period, indicating palliative use. Conclusion: The data shows that only severely ill patients were treated with  9-THC. A lack of information on the drug's indications, duration, and dosage was noticed in the files, which could represent problems for patient safety.
