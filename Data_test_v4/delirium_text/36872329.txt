36872329|a|Meniere's disease, a multifactorial disorder of the inner ear, is characterized by severe vertigo episodes and hearing loss. Although the role of immune responses in Meniere's disease has been proposed, the precise mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we show that downregulation of serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 is associated with activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in vestibular-resident macrophage-like cells from Meniere's disease patients. Serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 depletion markedly enhances IL-1beta production which leads to the damage of inner ear hair cells and vestibular nerve. Mechanistically, serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 binds to the PYD domain of NLRP3 and phosphorylates it at Serine 5, thereby interfering inflammasome assembly. Sgk-/- mice show aggravated audiovestibular symptoms and enhanced inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide-induced endolymphatic hydrops model, which is ameliorated by blocking NLRP3. Pharmacological inhibition of serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 increases the disease severity in vivo. Our studies demonstrate that serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 functions as a physiologic inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and maintains inner ear immune homeostasis, reciprocally participating in models of Meniere's disease pathogenesis.
