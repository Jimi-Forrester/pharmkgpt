36350497|t|In pursuit of inter-specialty consensus on excited delirium syndrome: a scoping literature review.
36350497|a|Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) is a controversial and disputed diagnosis involving altered mentation, agitation, and, frequently, substance abuse. Recently, it has become a common pre-hospital diagnosis, serving as justification for use of force, restraint, and/or medication administration. To conduct a scoping review across three databases to describe the most frequently reported diagnostic criteria for ExDS, as well as to explore its use as a diagnosis for deaths of individuals in the custody of law enforcement. In 2021, three literature databases were searched: Ovid Medline, PsycInfo, and Scopus. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed, English articles describing (1) ExDS symptoms, (2) substance intoxication with at least 2 ExDS symptoms present, or (3) centering on deaths occurring in the custody of law enforcement and attributed to ExDS. Key study data were extracted and the current literature was described qualitatively. Analysis took place between March and December 2021. A total of 97 studies were identified through initial abstract and secondary full-text review, with noted discrepancies in the definition of ExDS itself. After review, differences in ExDS diagnosis among organizations were explored, along with subsequent clinical impact, particularly in the pre-hospital setting. Resulting impact on patients, particularly those of minoritized ethnic and racial groups, was also noted. Prone aggressive restraint, in particular, is noted as an established risk factor for fatalities in ExDS cases. At this time, ExDS should not be utilized as a diagnosis; major medical organizations have an urgent responsibility to convene to formalize consensus-based diagnostic criteria or to propose alternate management guidelines for agitated and altered persons.
