37692157|t|Thrombotic microangiopathy after traumatic brain injury: A case report and review of the literature.
37692157|a|Key Clinical Message: This case report supports that trauma can rarely cause thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Early recognition is important due to a high mortality of untreated TMA, but diagnosis can be delayed by attributing lab abnormalities as due to blood loss. Abstract: Major trauma can provoke coagulopathy, ranging from hypo- to hypercoagulation. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), characterized by hemolytic anemia, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and intravascular hemolysis, results in bleeding tendency but also microvascular thrombosis. We report a rare case of isolated traumatic brain injury leading to TMA treated with plasmapheresis.
