35148842|a|The horizontal basal cells (HBCs) of olfactory epithelium (OE) serve as reservoirs for stem cells during OE regeneration, through proliferation and differentiation, which is important in recovery of olfactory function. However, the molecular mechanism of regulation of HBC proliferation and differentiation after injury remains unclear. Here, we found that yes-associated protein (YAP) was upregulated and activated in HBCs after OE injury. Deletion of YAP in HBCs led to impairment in OE regeneration and functional recovery of olfaction after injury. Mechanically, YAP was activated by S1P/S1PR2 signaling, thereby promoting the proliferation of HBCs and OE regeneration after injury. Finally, activation of YAP signaling enhanced the proliferation of HBCs and improved functional recovery of olfaction after OE injury or in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Taken together, these results reveal an S1P/S1PR2/YAP pathway in OE regeneration in response to injury, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for OE injury.
