36425441|a|Objective: There are few studies on oxidative stress in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The thiol/disulfide homeostasis is a new marker of oxidative stress. This study aimed to examine the oxidative DNA damage and thiol/disulfide homeostasis after 6 months in patients who developed PTSD after an avalanche disaster and to compare them with healthy controls. Methods: A total of 31 patients who developed PTSD after 2 consecutive avalanche disasters that occurred in Van on February 4 and 5, 2020, resulting in 42 deaths, and 33 healthy volunteers were included in the study. The patients were followed up by a psychiatrist within the framework of psychosocial intervention during their admission to Yuzuncu Yil University Medical Faculty Emergency Service. The patients monitored for a long time were diagnosed according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The clinical follow-up was evaluated with the post-traumatic stress disorder self-assessment (PTSD-KD) and the impact of events scale. To determine oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and deoxyguanosine (dG) levels were determined by isolating leukocyte DNA. Oxidative DNA damage was given as a ratio of 8-OHdG/106dG. Total thiol/native thiol levels were also determined. Disulfide levels were calculated by subtracting native thiol results from the total thiol results and dividing them by 2. Results: It was determined that total thiol and native thiol levels in patients with PTSD were statistically significantly lower than in the healthy control group (P = .001), and the disulfide levels were higher in the PTSD group compared with that in the healthy control group (P = .001). In addition, 8-OHdG, an indicator of DNA damage, was found to be significantly lower in the control group than in the patient group (P = .001). Conclusion: In our study, thiol/disulfide homeostasis was observed to shift toward disulfide in patients with PTSD when compared with healthy controls. The level of 8-OHdG, the indicator of DNA damage, was observed to increase in patients with PTSD. This result indicates that thiol/disulfide homeostasis can be significant in the pathophysiology of oxidative stress in these patients.
