32803969|t|Ethanol-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Imaging: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease Research.
32803969|a|Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is rapidly becoming a crucial tool in disease research. Fresh-frozen tissue is ideal for MSI because the protein and lipid structures are undisturbed by chemical fixatives; however, that means long-term preservation is limited. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue has a virtually infinite shelf life, but whole proteins are difficult or impossible to image directly. To bridge this gap, we examine the use of ethanol-fixed, paraffin-embedded (EFPE) tissue for the localization of intact proteins and lipids and comment on implications in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The new sample preparation methods for EFPE tissues have allowed us to greatly broaden the information we can extract from MSI experiments. Our methods involve a xylene-free deparaffination for lipid analysis and an intact protein method for visualizing amyloid-beta plaques from human AD brain tissue. This unique combination streamlines the MSI sample preparation process while allowing for the most biologically and pathologically relevant information to be extracted from a single tissue source.
