36430497|t|Altered Cortical Palmitoylation Induces Widespread Molecular Disturbances in Parkinson's Disease.
36430497|a|The relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD), the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, and palmitoylation, a post-translational lipid modification, is not well understood. In this study, to better understand the role of protein palmitoylation in PD and the pathways altered in this disease, we analyzed the differential palmitoyl proteome (palmitome) in the cerebral cortex of PD patients compared to controls (n = 4 per group). Data-mining of the cortical palmitome from PD patients and controls allowed us to: (i) detect a set of 150 proteins with altered palmitoylation in PD subjects in comparison with controls; (ii) describe the biological pathways and targets predicted to be altered by these palmitoylation changes; and (iii) depict the overlap between the differential palmitome identified in our study with protein interactomes of the PD-linked proteins alpha-synuclein, LRRK2, DJ-1, PINK1, GBA and UCHL1. In summary, we partially characterized the altered palmitome in the cortex of PD patients, which is predicted to impact cytoskeleton, mitochondrial and fibrinogen functions, as well as cell survival. Our study suggests that protein palmitoylation could have a role in the pathophysiology of PD, and that comprehensive palmitoyl-proteomics offers a powerful approach for elucidating novel cellular pathways modulated in this neurodegenerative disease.
