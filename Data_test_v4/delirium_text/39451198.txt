39451198|t|Mini-Review: Tregs as a Tool for Therapy-Obvious and Non-Obvious Challenges and Solutions.
39451198|a|Tregs have the potential to be utilized as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of various chronic diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. One of the challenges associated with developing a therapeutic product based on Tregs is the non-selectivity of polyclonal cells. A potential solution to this issue is a generation of antigen-specific CAR-Tregs. Other challenges associated with developing a therapeutic product based on Tregs include the phenotypic instability of these cells in an inflammatory microenvironment, discrepancies between engineered Treg-like cells and natural Tregs, and the expression of dysfunctional isoforms of Treg marker genes. This review presents a summary of proposed strategies for addressing these challenges.
