The present work was to explore whether BBR ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD and to investigate whether its underlying mechanism involves inhibiting hyperphosphorylated tau protein. METHODS: The cognitive function was measured by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The levels of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins were determined by Western blot. The biomarkers of NF-kappaB signaling pathway and oxidative stress were detected by Western blot and biochemical assays. The biomarkers of neuroinflammation were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: BBR improved learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice. BBR decreased the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. BBR lowered the activity of NF-kappaB signaling in the hippocampus of AD mice. BBR-administration promoted the activity of glutathione (GSH) and inhibited lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus of AD mice. CONCLUSION: BBR attenuated cognitive deficits and limited hyperphosphorylation of tau via inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway, and by retarding oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation.
