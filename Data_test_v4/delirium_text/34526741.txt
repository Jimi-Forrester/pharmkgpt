34526741|t|Enhanced Recovery after Surgery: Perspective in Elder Women.
34526741|a|Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal convention first reported for colorectal and gynecologic procedures. The main benefits have been a shorter length of stay and reduced complications, leading to improved clinical outcomes and cost savings substantially. With increase in life expectancy, recent years has shown a significant rise in advanced age population, and similarly, a rise in age-related disorders requiring surgical management. Due to pathophysiological and metabolic changes in geriatric age group with increased incidence of medical comorbidities, there is higher risk of enhanced surgical stress response with undesirable postoperative morbidity, complications, prolonged immobility, and extended convalescence. The feasibility and effectiveness of ERAS protocols have been well researched and documented among all age groups, including the geriatric high-risk population.[1] Adhering to ERAS protocols after colorectal surgery showed no significant difference in postoperative complications, hospital stay, or readmission rate among various age groups.[2] A recent report mentions the safety and benefits following ERAS guidelines with reduced length of stay in elderly patients with short-level lumbar fusion surgery.[3] The concept of prehabilitation has evolved as an integral part of ERAS to build up physiological reserve, especially in geriatric high-risk group, and to adapt better to surgical stress.[4] High levels of compliance with ERAS interventions combined with prehabilitation can be achieved when a dedicated multidisciplinary team is involved in care of these high-risk patients.
