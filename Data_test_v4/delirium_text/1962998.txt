1962998|t|[Decreased level of creatine phosphokinase BB in the brain of patients with mental disorders (complex immunochemical and immunocytochemical studies)].
1962998|a|Immunochemical and immunocytochemical studies were carried out to reveal the cerebral isozyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK BB) in autopsy brain of patients with different mental diseases. The studies covered schizophrenic patients (n-19), patients with senile dementia (n-9), with Alzheimer's disease (n-13) and controls without any mental pathology (n-17). It has been demonstrated that in mental pathology in the frontal cortex (field 10), there was an appreciable decrease in the content of immunoreactive CPK BB. That decrease was significantly more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease than in schizophrenia or senile dementia (p less than 0.01). Apparently, the decrease of the content of immunoreactive CPK BB determines to a considerable measure the early detected decrease of CPK BB activity in the patients' brain.
