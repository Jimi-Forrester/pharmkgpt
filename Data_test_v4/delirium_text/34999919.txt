34999919|t|Ethyl pyruvate, a versatile protector in inflammation and autoimmunity.
34999919|a|Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has potent influence on redox processes, cellular metabolism, and inflammation. It has been intensively studied in numerous animal models of systemic and organ-specific disorders whose pathogenesis involves a strong immune component. Here, basic chemical and biological properties of EP are discussed, with an emphasis on its redox and metabolic activity. Further, its influence on myeloid and T cells is considered, as well as on intracellular signaling beyond its effect on immune cells. Also, the effects of EP on animal models of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders are presented. Finally, a possibility to apply EP as a treatment for such diseases in humans is discussed. Scientific papers cited in this review were identified using the PubMed search engine that relies on the MEDLINE database. The reference list covers the most important findings in the field in the past twenty years.
