32087019|t|Analytical and Clinical Performance of Amyloid-Beta Peptides Measurements in CSF of ADNIGO/2 Participants by an LC-MS/MS Reference Method.
32087019|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) reliably detects brain amyloidosis based on its high concordance with plaque burden at autopsy and with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) ligand retention observed in several studies. Low CSF Abeta42 concentrations in normal aging and dementia are associated with the presence of fibrillary Abeta across brain regions detected by amyloid PET imaging. METHODS: An LC-MS/MS reference method for Abeta42, modified by adding Abeta40 and Abeta38 peptides to calibrators, was used to analyze 1445 CSF samples from ADNIGO/2 participants. Seventy runs were completed using 2 different lots of calibrators. For preparation of Abeta42 calibrators and controls spiking solution, reference Abeta42 standard with certified concentration was obtained from EC-JRC-IRMM (Belgium). Abeta40 and Abeta38 standards were purchased from rPeptide. Abeta42 calibrators' accuracy was established using CSF-based Abeta42 Certified Reference Materials (CRM). RESULTS: CRM-adjusted Abeta42 calibrator concentrations were calculated using the regression equation Y (CRM-adjusted) = 0.89X (calibrators) + 32.6. Control samples and CSF pools yielded imprecision ranging from 6.5 to 10.2% (Abeta42) and 2.2 to 7.0% (Abeta40). None of the CSF pools showed statistically significant differences in Abeta42 concentrations across 2 different calibrator lots. Comparison of Abeta42 with Abeta42/Abeta40 showed that the ratio improved concordance with concurrent [18F]-florbetapir PET as a measure of fibrillar Abeta (n = 766) from 81 to 88%. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term performance assessment substantiates our modified LC-MS/MS reference method for 3 Abeta peptides. The improved diagnostic performance of the CSF ratio Abeta42/Abeta40 suggests that Abeta42 and Abeta40 should be measured together and supports the need for an Abeta40 CRM.
