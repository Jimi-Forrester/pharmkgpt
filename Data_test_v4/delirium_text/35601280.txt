35601280|a|The duodenum is the second most common site of diverticula following the colon, but is associated with fewer complications than colonic diverticula. Diverticulitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, perforation, hemorrhage, and blind loop syndrome may occur as complications of duodenal diverticula. Although nonoperative treatment is an option for patients in good condition without signs of sepsis, surgery is generally required for definitive treatment of complications. There are several surgical procedures for symptomatic duodenal diverticula. We performed laparoscopic duodenal segmental resection and duodenojejunostomy without open conversion in three cases. We believe that this procedure is ideal for cases of symptomatic duodenal diverticula when performed by an experienced surgeon with the goal of definitive treatment.
