37781687|a|Introduction: This exploratory review article describes about the genetic factors behind Alzheimer's disease (AD), their association with foods, and their relationships with cognitive impairment. It explores the dietary patterns and economic challenges in AD prevention. Methods: Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles that examined the relationships between Diets, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and Socioeconomic conditions in preventative Alzheimer's disease studies. Graphs and Network analysis data were taken from Scopus under the MeSH search method, including words, Alzheimer's, APoE4, Tau protein, APP, Amyloid precursor protein, Beta-Amyloid, Abeta, Mediterranean Diet, MD, DASH diet, MIND diet, SES, Socioeconomic, Developed country, Underdeveloped country, Preventions. The network analysis was done through VOS viewer. Results: Mediterranean diet (MD) accurately lowers AD (Alzheimer's Disease) risk to 53% and 35% for people who follow it moderately. MIND scores had a statistically significant reduction in AD rate compared to those in the lowest tertial (53% and 35% reduction, respectively). Subjects with the highest adherence to the MD and DASH had a 54% and 39% lower risk of developing AD, respectively, compared to those in the lowest tertial. Omega-6, PUFA, found in nuts and fish, can play most roles in the clearance of Abeta. Vitamin D inhibits induced fibrillar Abeta apoptosis. However, the high cost of these diet components rise doubt about the effectiveness of AD prevention through healthy diets. Conclusion: The finding of this study revealed an association between diet and the effects of the chemical components of foods on AD biomarkers. More research is required to see if nutrition is a risk or a protective factor for Alzheimer's disease to encourage research to be translated into therapeutic practice and to clarify nutritional advice.
