1855820|t|Psychiatric morbidity in HIV infected individuals.
1855820|a|Forty six subjects infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were followed up, for recording psychiatric morbidity if any, before and after the information regarding their HIV status was revealed to them. Among these, four patients had the AIDS syndrome, while 42 individuals were HIV carriers. The pre-information morbidity in the AIDS group included two individuals who presented with delirium and one with an adjustment disorder. The psychiatric diagnosis among the HIV carriers revealed one patient with major depression, four with adjustment disorders and four with alcohol dependence syndrome. The additional morbidity after the diagnoses was revealed included major depression and adjustment disorders which could be managed by psychological intervention and counselling in most cases. The individual who developed major depression later, committed suicide. The study though preliminary in nature, suggests that it may be beneficial to include psychiatric management as part of the general care of individuals with HIV infection.
