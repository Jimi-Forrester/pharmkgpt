25969603|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative parameters are altered during alcohol withdrawal and are said to contribute towards withdrawal symptoms in alcoholic patients. AIMS: To study levels of five selected oxidative parameters during alcohol withdrawal state and after treatment of the withdrawal state and to assess the association of the oxidative parameters with the severity of alcohol withdrawal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a case-control study done in a De-addiction clinic of a tertiary teaching centre, Southern India. 50 persons having alcohol withdrawal symptoms were included. The oxidative stress parameters malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase were assessed in during the withdrawal phase and again after the withdrawal had subsided. The same oxidative stress parameters were measured in the control group. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0. One way ANOVA and Pearson correlation test were used for finding the association between the oxidative stress parameters levels and the severity of alcohol withdrawal. Multiple linear regression analysis done to predict variables associated with level of oxidative parameters. RESULTS: During alcohol withdrawal the pro-oxidant malondialdehyde was elevated compared to that in the control group. Among the antioxidant enzymes the superoxide dismutase was higher and catalase was lower than the control group levels. After remission of the alcohol withdrawal both malondialdehyde remained higher and superoxide dismutase lower than in the control group. The levels of oxidative stress parameters not correlated with the severity of alcohol withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: oxidative stress parameters show changes during alcohol withdrawal and during the remission of withdrawal. However, levels of oxidative stress parameters not correlated with the severity of withdrawal.
