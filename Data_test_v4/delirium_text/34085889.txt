34085889|t|Sleep Interventions for Informal Caregivers of Persons with Dementia: A Systematic Review.
34085889|a|We conducted a systematic review on the state of the science related to sleep interventions for informal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD). This review included English-written, peer-reviewed articles that studied the effect of an intervention on sleep health outcomes for informal caregivers of persons with ADRD. Our search yielded 15 articles that met our a priori inclusion criteria. We categorized interventions into four categories: environmental, physical, cognitive, and collaborative. Intervention effects were heterogeneous, with most yielding nonsignificant sleep health effects. There is a need for theoretically sound and robust sleep health interventions for informal caregiver samples. Future research in this area could benefit from the use of more controlled, pragmatic, and adaptive research designs, and the use of objective measures that conceptually represent the multiple domains of sleep health to enhance intervention quality.
