36495794|t|Delirium superimposed on dementia in post-acute care: Nurse documentation of symptoms and interventions.
36495794|a|Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is common in older adults being discharged to post-acute care settings (PAC). Nurse documentation remains poorly understood. Aims were to describe nurse documentation and to determine associations in a secondary data analysis of a large, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (Recreational Stimulation For Elders As A Vehicle To Resolve DSD (Reserve For DSD). Just under 75% of the sample had at least one symptom of delirium documented by the nursing staff, while 25.9% had none despite being CAM positive by expert adjudication. Only 32% had an intervention documented. Number of documented interventions were significantly associated with number of documented symptoms. There is a need for research and innovation related to nurse documentation and communication of DSD symptoms and interventions in an efficient and accurate manner to impact care for vulnerable older adults in these settings.
