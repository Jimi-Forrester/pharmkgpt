32117487|a|INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopy-assisted radical total gastrectomy is technically demanding. AIM: To introduce the "enjoyable space" approach to achieve D2 plus complete mesogastrium excision (CME) and to investigate its safety and feasibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2015 and December 2017, 165 patients with primary advanced upper gastric cancer underwent laparoscopy-assisted radical total gastrectomy. Among these patients, 81 underwent conventional D2 total gastrectomy (D2 group) and 84 underwent D2 plus CME total gastrectomy (D2 + CME group). Clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups (p > 0.05) in clinicopathological characteristics. However, the D2 + CME group had a longer mean operative time, lower mean blood loss and slightly higher mean number of retrieved lymph nodes (LNs) than the D2 group (p < 0.05 each). The mean time to first flatus, liquid diet, and soft diet and the duration of hospital stay were similar between the two groups (p > 0.05 each). No significant difference in postoperative complication rates was found between the groups (16.0% vs. 9.5%, p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The "enjoyable space" approach is an option to achieve D2 + CME, and its safety and feasibility over conventional method are confirmed with lower intraoperative blood loss and more harvested LNs.
