25394739|a|Oral donepezil and rivastigmine are two commonly used cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) used in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rivastigmine transdermal patch formulation has high tolerability profile, allowing patients to achieve optimal therapeutic doses and providing potential advantages over oral ChEIs. This is a 6-month, multicentre, observational efficacy and tolerability study of switching from oral ChEIs to rivastigmine patch in AD patients who failed to show benefit from previous treatment. The reasons of the switch were: (1) lack/loss of benefit from previous oral ChEI treatment; (2) tolerability problems. The primary outcome was cognitive changes measured with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test. Secondary outcomes were modifications of functional independence and behavioral disturbances and occurrence of adverse events (AEs) after switching. 174 patients, over 180 patients screened, entered the study (lack/loss of efficacy: 57 %, tolerability problems: 33 %, both reasons: 10 %). 6 months after switching 56 % of patients stabilized or increased the MMSE score respect to baseline. The only predictor of this outcome was the response at 3 months. In the group with lack/loss of response to oral ChEI, the decline of the MMSE score changed from -3.4 +- 2.5 points in the 6 months before switching to -0.5 +- 3.2 in the 6 months after the switch (p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the IADL or NPI scores. Drug discontinuation rate was 20 %, due to AEs (18 %) and lack of compliance (2 %). Switching from an unsuccessful oral ChEI therapy to rivastigmine patch is effective and safe in more than half of the switched patients after a 6-month period.
