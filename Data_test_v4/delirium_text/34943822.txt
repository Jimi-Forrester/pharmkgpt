34943822|t|Senescent Cells in Cancer: Wanted or Unwanted Citizens.
34943822|a|Over recent decades, the field of cellular senescence has attracted considerable attention due to its association with aging, the development of age-related diseases and cancer. Senescent cells are unable to proliferate, as the pathways responsible for initiating the cell cycle are irreversibly inhibited. Nevertheless, senescent cells accumulate in tissues and develop a pro-inflammatory secretome, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can have serious deleterious effects if not properly regulated. There is increasing evidence suggesting senescent cells contribute to different stages of carcinogenesis in different anatomical sites, mainly due to the paracrine effects of the SASP. Thus, a new therapeutic field, known as senotherapeutics, has developed. In this review, we aim to discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the senescence response and its relationship with cancer development, focusing on the link between senescence-related inflammation and cancer. We will also discuss different approaches to target senescent cells that might be of use for cancer treatment.
