36569917|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells technology has been successfully used in the treatment of B cell-derived hematological tumors and multiple myeloma. CAR-T cells are also being studied in a variety of solid tumors. Current clinical reports on CAR-T cells in the treatment of malignant tumors are abundant. The tumor-killing activity of CAR-T cells and the unique adverse effects of CAR-T cells have been confirmed by many studies. There is evidence that serious adverse events can be life-threatening. CAR-T cells therapy is increasingly used in clinical settings, so it is important to pay attention to its serious adverse events. In this review, we summarized the serious adverse events of CAR-T cells in the treatment of malignant tumors by reading literature and searching relevant clinical studies, and discussed the management and treatment of serious adverse events in an effort to provide theoretical support for clinicians who deal with such patients.
