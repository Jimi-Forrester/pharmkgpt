17003227|a|Major characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are synaptic loss, cholinergic dysfunction, and abnormal protein depositions in the brain. The amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a proteolytic fragment of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), aggregates to form neuritic plaques and has a causative role in AD. A present focus of AD research is to develop safe Abeta-lowering drugs. A selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, phenserine, in current human trials lowers both APP and Abeta. Phenserine is dose-limited in animals by its cholinergic actions; its cholinergically inactive enantiomer, posiphen (+)-[phenserine], was assessed. In cultured human neuroblastoma cells, posiphen, like phenserine, dose- and time-dependently lowered APP and Abeta levels by reducing the APP synthesis rate. This action translated to an in vivo system. Posiphen administration to mice (7.5-75 mg/kg daily, 21 consecutive days) significantly decreased levels of total APP (tissue mass-adjusted) in a dose-dependent manner. Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were significantly lowered by posiphen (> or =15 mg/kg) compared with controls. The activities of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases were assessed in the same brain samples, and beta-secretase activity was significantly reduced. Posiphen, like phenserine, can lower Abeta via multiple mechanisms and represents an interesting drug candidate for AD treatment.
