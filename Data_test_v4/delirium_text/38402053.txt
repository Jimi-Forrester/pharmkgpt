38402053|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the Start to move protocol compared to conventional treatment in subjects over 15 years of age hospitalized in the ICU on an improvement in functionality, decrease in ICU-acquired weakness (DAUCI), incidence of delirium, days of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in ICU and mortality at 28 days. DESIGN: randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Intensive Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: Includes adults older than 15 years with invasive mechanical ventilation more than 48h, randomized allocation. INTERVENTIONS: Start to move protocol and conventional treatment. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Functionality, incidence of ICU-acquired weakness, incidence of delirium, days on mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and mortality-28 days, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05053724. RESULTS: 69 subjects were admitted to the study, 33 to the Start to move group and 36 to conventional treatment, clinically and sociodemographic comparable. In the "Start to move" group, the incidence of IUCD at ICU discharge was 35.7% vs. 80.7% in the "conventional treatment" group (p=0.001). Functionality (FSS-ICU) at ICU discharge corresponds to 26 vs. 17 points in favor of the "Start to move" group (p=0.001). The difference in Barthel at ICU discharge was 20% in favor of the "Start to move" group (p=0.006). There were no significant differences in the incidence of delirium, days of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and 28-day mortality. The study did not report adverse events or protocol suspension. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the "Start to move" protocol in ICU showed a reduction in the incidence of IUAD, an increase in functionality and a smaller decrease in Barthel score at discharge.
