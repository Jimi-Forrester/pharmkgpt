18180816|a|This article presents the history of typhoid fever in Chile since its definition as a clinical entity until our days. From this history is evident the long lasting confusion with typhus (rickettsial spotted fever) in Chile although the identity and characteristics of typhoid fever had been established in the first half of nineteenth century in Europe. This confusion could be explained because some clinical features are similar in both diseases (high fever and delirium) and because of its occurrence in poor hygienic conditions. This misconception was resolved only during 1918 on occasion of a major typhus outbreak that allowed physicians to clearly diagnose this rickettsial disease. Once typhoid fever was recognized it was possible to describe its epidemiological pattern with high endemic incidence mainly in urban districts, with summer increases and epidemic cycles. In the contemporary history of typhoid fever it is remarkable a huge outbreak during 1976-1985, associated to abrupt socioeconomical and environment crisis, as well as an abrupt diminution of the disease in 1992, with a marked reduction that persists until now. This last phenomenon was the consequence of a quasi-experimental public health intervention and sanitary education conducted in 1992 to avoid the cholera epidemic that was spreading in Peru, a neighboring country. We conclude that, although the hypothesis of environment contamination as the cornerstone in typhoid persistence was present since the recognition of the disease in 1894, it was faced efficiently only and perhaps in a definitely manner only almost 100 years later.
