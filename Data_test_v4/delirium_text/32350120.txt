32350120|a|Several reports have been published recently demonstrating a beneficial effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in improving pathologic and behavioral conditions in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as well as the brain and spinal cord injuries (SCI). Despite successful therapeutic effects of EGFR inhibition in these pathologic conditions, there is still no report of proof-of-concept studies in well-characterized animal models using recently developed blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating EGFR inhibitors, which is due to previous conflicting reports concerning the level of EGFR or activated EGFR in normal and pathologic conditions that caused target engagement to be a concern in any future EGFR inhibition therapy. In this review, the level of EGFR expression and activation in the developing central nervous system (CNS) compared with the adult CNS will be explained as well as how neuronal injury or pathologic conditions, especially inflammation and amyloid fibrils, induce reactive astrocytes leading to an increase in the expression and activation of EGFR and, finally, neurodegeneration. Furthermore, in this review, we will discuss two main molecular mechanisms that can be proposed as the neuroprotective effects of EGFR inhibition in these pathologic conditions. We will also review the recent advances in the development of BBB-penetrating EGFR inhibitors in cancer therapy, which may eventually be repositioned for NDDs and SCI therapy in the future. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Based on the lessons from the applications of EGFR inhibitors in oncology, it is concluded that EGFR inhibitors can be beneficial in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries. They carry their therapeutic potentials through induction of autophagy and attenuation of reactive astrocytes.
