37107042|a|BACKGROUND: Amoxicillin (AMX)-induced neurotoxicity is well described and may be associated with AMX overexposure. No neurotoxic concentration threshold has been determined thus far. A better knowledge of maximum tolerable AMX concentrations is of importance to improve the safety of high doses of AMX. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the local hospital data warehouse EhOP  to generate a specific query related to AMX neurotoxicity symptomatology. All patient medical reports containing a mention of neurotoxicity clinical symptoms coupled with AMX plasma concentration measurements were explored. Patients were classified into two groups according to the imputability of AMX in the onset of their neurotoxicity, on the basis of chronological and semiological criteria. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was performed to identify an AMX neurotoxic steady-state concentration (Css) threshold. RESULTS: The query identified 101 patients among 2054 patients benefiting from AMX TDM. Patients received a median daily dose of 9 g AMX, with a median creatinine clearance of 51 mL/min. A total of 17 of the 101 patients exhibited neurotoxicity attributed to AMX. The mean Css was higher for patients with neurotoxicity attributed to AMX (118 +- 62 mg/L) than those without 74 +- 48 mg/L (p = 0.002). A threshold AMX concentration of 109.7 mg/L predicted the occurrence of neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified, for the first time, an AMX Css threshold of 109.7 mg/L associated with an excess risk of neurotoxicity. This approach needs to be confirmed by a prospective study with systematic neurological evaluation and TDM.
