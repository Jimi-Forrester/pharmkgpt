37215402|t|Improving the Prevention, Detection, and Management of Delirium in Adult Inpatients; an Interprofessional Consultative Team Pilot Project.
37215402|a|Delirium is a common, often preventable fluctuating state of cognition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This report describes the implementation of an interprofessional consultative Delirium Team formed to improve the prevention, detection, and management of delirium in a community hospital. Team members consulted refered inpatients with delirium to establish a care plan and provide recommendations for pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. The team also offered delirium-related education to unit staff, patients, and caregivers. Consultations were initially completed by the team Nurse Practitioner or Occupational Therapist, and complex patients were discussed with the team Geriatrician and Psychiatrist at rounds to optimize specialist input. Of the 160 patients managed by the team over the 8-month study period, two-thirds of referred patients did not require specialist consultation for their delirium management. Strategies most often recommended by experts for managing delirium were related to medical management, social/cognitive engagement, and functional mobility. Two-thirds of all recommendations made by the team were implemented. Barriers and facilitators to implementation and improving unit staff adherence are further described. The consultative Delirium Team is a promising model that should be further explored for managing an aging population in a capacity-limited medical system.
