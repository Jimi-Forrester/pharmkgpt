39469999|a|INTRODUCTION: People living with dementia are less likely to be admitted to high-rated nursing homes than people without dementia, despite their increased care needs. We investigated the effect of admission to nursing homes with higher staffing ratings on adverse outcomes for individuals with and without dementia post-hospitalization. METHODS: Among Traditional Medicare beneficiaries discharged to nursing homes between 2011 and 2017, we examined the relationship between facility staffing star-ratings and short-term readmission and mortality using an instrumental variables approach to account for selection bias. The instrumental variables were the number of nearby vacant beds in high-rated facilities. RESULTS: Admission to a higher-rated nursing home lowered post-discharge mortality risk at 90 days and reduced 30- and 90-day readmission. Point estimates were larger for people with dementia. DISCUSSION: Findings underscore the need for enhancing direct care staffing in nursing homes and addressing access disparities, particularly for individuals with dementia who benefit significantly from high-quality care. HIGHLIGHTS: We assessed how admission to nursing homes with higher staffing ratings impacted outcomes for individuals with and without dementia by exploiting variation in local bed vacancies as a source of quasi-random assignment. For both persons with and without dementia, adjusted short-term mortality and readmission rates were lower among those discharged to nursing homes with higher staffing ratings. Effects were larger for persons with dementia, indicating welfare loss from inequitable access to higher-rated nursing homes. Increasing staffing in nursing homes and reducing disparities for persons with dementia is essential for enhancing both equity and value.
