39896645|t|Shallow-angle intracranial cannula for repeated infusion and in vivo imaging with multiphoton microscopy.
39896645|a|Multiphoton microscopy serves as an essential tool for high-resolution imaging of the living mouse brain. To facilitate optical access to the brain during imaging, the cranial window surgery is commonly used. However, this procedure restricts physical access above the imaging area and hinders the direct delivery of imaging agents and drugs. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a cannula delivery system that enables the implantation of a low-profile cannula nearly parallel to the brain surface at angles as shallow as 8 degrees, while maintaining compatibility with multiphoton microscopy. To validate this approach, we perform direct infusion and imaging of various fluorescent cell markers in the brain. Additionally, we successfully demonstrate tracking of degenerating neurons over time in Alzheimer's disease mice using Fluoro-Jade C. Furthermore, we show longitudinal imaging of brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen using a phosphorescent oxygen sensor. Our developed technique should enable a wide range of new longitudinal imaging studies in the mouse brain.
