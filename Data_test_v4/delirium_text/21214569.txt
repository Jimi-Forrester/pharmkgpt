21214569|t|Membrane targeting, shedding and protein interactions of brain acetylcholinesterase.
21214569|a|The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are characterized by cholinergic deficits and the preservation of cholinergic function through the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is the basis for current treatments of the disease. Understanding the causes for the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in neurodegeneration is therefore a key to developing new therapeutics. In this study, we review novel aspects of cholinesterase membrane localization in brain and propose mechanisms for its lipid domain targeting, secretion and protein-protein interactions. In erythrocytes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is localized to lipid rafts through a GPI anchor. However, the main splice form of AChE in brain lacks a transmembrane peptide anchor region and is bound to the 'proline-rich membrane anchor', PRiMA, in lipid rafts. Furthermore, AChE is secreted ('shed') from membranes and this shedding is stimulated by cholinergic agonists. Immunocytochemical studies on rat brain have shown that membrane-associated PRiMA immunofluorescence is located selectively at cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and striatum. A strong association of AChE with the membrane via PRiMA seems therefore to be a specific requirement of forebrain cholinergic neurons. alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are also associated with lipid rafts where they undergo rapid internalisation on stimulation. We are currently probing the mechanism(s) of AChE shedding, and whether this process and its apparent association with alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and metabolism of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein is determined by its association with lipid raft domains either in normal or pathological situations.
