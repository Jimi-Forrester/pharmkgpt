25444600|t|Anterior and posterior MTL networks in aging and MCI.
25444600|a|Two neuroanatomically dissociable, large-scale cortical memory networks, referred to as the anterior and posterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks have recently been described in young adults using resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based functional connectivity (fc-BOLD). They have been hypothesized to subserve distinct mnemonic and non-memory cognitive functions and are thought to be associated with differential vulnerability in neurological disorders. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of these functional networks in an older adult population and in a cohort of patients diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Anatomic subregions of interest in the MTL were defined using high-resolution T2-weighted MRI and used as seeds for defining the putative networks using fc-BOLD. Although the literature has suggested that the posterior MTL network is particularly vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease, we show that both the networks are affected in MCI, to varying degrees, compared with the control group. Furthermore, cortical thickness in the brain regions defined by these networks was reduced in MCI.
