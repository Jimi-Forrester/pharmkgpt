34367622|t|Expression of TNF, IL1B, and  iNOS2 in the neural cell after induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis with and without coating antibody anti -Porphyromonas gingivalis.
34367622|a|Porphyromonas gingivalis has virulence factors such as gingipain and lipopolysaccharide, causing bacteremia to reach the brain and activate neuroinflammatory release cytokines. This study analyzed the effect of the co-culture of neuron cells with P. gingivalis coated with anti -P. gingivalis antibodies against cytokines produced by neuron cells. The gene expressions of the TNF, IL1B,  iNOS2 in neurons was evaluated using RT-qPCR. The results showed that P. gingivalis coated with anti -P. gingivalis antibody before co-culture with neuron cells could decrease the gene expression of TNF, IL1B, and  iNOS2 of neuron cells.
