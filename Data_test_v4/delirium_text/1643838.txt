1643838|t|Daughters caregiving for Hispanic and non-Hispanic Alzheimer patients: does ethnicity make a difference?
1643838|a|This study assessed Cuban-American Hispanic and White non-Hispanic daughters who were major caregivers for their mothers suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Although patients in both ethnic groups did not differ in their level of cognitive and functional impairment, Cuban-American Hispanic patients were significantly more likely to be living in their daughters' homes while the White non-Hispanic patients resided in institutional settings. Caregivers were equivalent in their knowledge and utilization of community services, but Cuban-American daughters were significantly more aware of financial aid resources. Cuban-American patients were significantly more depressed than their White non-Hispanic counterparts with daughters showing similar but nonsignificant trends. The impact of cultural factors on caregiving is discussed.
