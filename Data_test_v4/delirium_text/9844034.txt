9844034|a|Since dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has been involved in the regulation of cellular immunity, the aim of the presence study was to evaluate whether the age-dependent reduction of DHEAS was associated with changes of natural killer (NK) immune function in healthy elderly subjects and in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). Circulating DHEAS was determined throughout 24 h (circadian profile). NK cytotoxic activity was measured as spontaneous and induced cytotoxicity during exposure with DHEAS (10(-7) M), interleukin-2 (IL-2; 100 IU) and IL-2 (100 IU) coincubated with DHEAS (10(-7) M). DHEAS was significantly reduced in healthy elderly subjects (mesor M +/- SD = 2.3 +/- 0.5 micromol/l) and SDAT (1.6 +/- 0.4 micromol/l) patients compared to healthy young subjects (6.7 +/- 0.9 micromol/l; p < 0.001); significant differences were also found when healthy elderly subjects and SDAT patients were compared (p < 0.01). A significant inverse correlation between age and DHEAS levels was demonstrated in SDAT and healthy elderly subjects (p < 0.05). The decrease in 24-hour DHEAS secretion was associated with a higher NK cytotoxic response to DHEAS in the healthy elderly subject group than in healthy subjects of young age (p < 0.01). Increased NK cell activity during IL-2 incubation was found in patients with SDAT in comparison with the healthy elderly subject (p < 0.001). On the contrary, NK cell cytotoxic response of SDAT patients was less pronounced during DHEAS exposure and when DHEAS was coincubated with IL-2 (p < 0.001). These data suggest an immunomodulatory role of DHEAS on NK functional activity in physiological aging and SDAT. The antagonizing effect of DHEAS on NK overactivity during exposure with cytokines might counteract some neuroimmune components related to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.
