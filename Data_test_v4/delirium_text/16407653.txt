16407653|t|Functional Vitamin E deficiency in ApoE4 patients with Alzheimer's disease.
16407653|a|Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, antioxidant therapies including Vitamin E (VitE) supplementation for both prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases currently appears to be a promising avenue of research. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between AD and the ApoE phenotype, lipid parameters and VitE levels in a large cohort of elderly subjects. No absolute deficit was observed in plasma VitE levels. However in AD, ApoE4 is not associated with an increase in total cholesterol (TC) and VitE levels. Moreover, our results suggest that oxidative stress-induced injury and protection by VitE in AD are related to the ApoE phenotype. Our study strongly supports the hypothesis of an impairment of lipophilic antioxidant delivery to neuronal cells in AD leading to a tissular antioxidant deficiency which could facilitate oxidative stress.
