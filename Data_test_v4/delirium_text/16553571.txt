16553571|a|Delirium is a common and usually reversible syndrome occurring during a period of physical illness. It is most common in children and the elderly. The primary treatment of delirium focuses on the underlying cause, but behavioural and psychiatric symptoms are sometimes of sufficient severity to treat. If behavioural and environmental interventions are ineffective, psychotropic medication may be needed. This paper reviews the drugs commonly used in the management of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms in delirium, and suggests the need for further trials.
