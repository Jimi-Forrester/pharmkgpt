35177121|t|Is it time to reconsider the administration of thiamine alone or in combination with vitamin C in critically ill patients? A meta-analysis of clinical trial studies.
35177121|a|BACKGROUND: Although the effect of thiamine alone or in combination with vitamin C has been studied in multiple trials (RCT and interventional studies), their results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to assess impact of thiamine administration alone, thiamine in combination with vitamin C, and co-administration of low-dose hydrocortisone, vitamin C and thiamine (HVT) on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After electronic searches on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, initially 3367 papers were found, and 20 interventional studies were included in our analysis. We assessed the risk-difference between treatment and control (standard treatment) groups by pooling available data on ICU length of stay, number of ventilator free days, mortality, and changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. RESULTS: The results of present studies revealed no significant effect of thiamine in combination with vitamin C, and HVT on number of free days of ventilation. Thiamine alone supplementation was associated with high mortality percentage (WMD: 5.17%; 95% CI: 2.67, 7.67). Thiamine in combination with vitamin C had no significant impact on mortality rate. In contrast, HVT could decrease mortality rate (WMD: - 7.23%; 95% CI: - 10.31, - 4.16; I-square: 0.0%). There was no significant effect of thiamine alone, co-administration of thiamine and vitamin C, and HVT on ICU length of stay. The results of the meta-analysis showed that thiamine alone and HVT supplementation had no significant effect on SOFA score. Interestingly, co-supplementation of thiamine and vitamin C had a significant decreasing effect on SOFA score (WMD: - 0.73; 95% CI: - 1.29, - 0.17; I-square: 0.0%). CONCLUSION: In contrast to HVT, thiamine supplementation alone was associated with increased mortality rate in ICU. However, co-supplementation of thiamine and vitamin C had a significant decreasing effect on SOFA score.
