25387614|t|Modulation of the Abeta peptide aggregation pathway by KP1019 limits Abeta-associated neurotoxicity.
25387614|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is increasing worldwide due to increased life expectancy. AD is characterized by two pathological hallmarks in the brain: amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. A focus of AD research has concentrated on either inhibiting Abeta peptide aggregation that leads to plaque formation or breaking down pre-formed Abeta peptide aggregates. An alternative approach is to modulate the Abeta aggregation profile by facilitating the formation of Abeta species that are off-pathway and non-toxic. Herein, we report the re-purposing of the widely studied Ru(iii) anti-cancer complex KP1019, towards regulating the aggregation profile of the Abeta peptide. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we conclude that KP1019 binds to histidine residues, located at the N-terminus of the peptide, in a rapid and robust fashion. Native gels and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses have provided insight into the species and structures that are generated by KP1019-Abeta interactions. Finally, incubation in an in vitro human neuronal cell model has demonstrated that the formation of KP1019-Abeta species rescues cell viability from Abeta-associated neurotoxicity. Modulation of the Abeta aggregation pathway via covalent interactions with small molecules is thus a promising AD therapeutic strategy.
