33502110|a|Perennial plant Mentha pulegium L. (pennyroyal, Lamiaceae) can be found in Europe and Mediterranean. In areas where it thrives, M. pulegium is used in nutrition and as medicinal plant. Essential oil of M. pulegium is also a frequent constituent of foods and fragrances, because of mint-like odor. Regarding the use of M. pulegium in traditional medicine and nutrition, as well as fact that essential oils are potential sources of bioactive components, this study was conducted to examine the chemical composition of essential oil of M. pulegium wild growing in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its biological activity. The chemical profile testing was made using GC/MS and GC/FID technique. Potential of cholinesterase inhibition was tested by Ellman's assay. The antioxidant activity was tested by DPPH and FRAP assay. The dominant components in analyzed oil were pulegone 54.4 %, p-menthone 14.0 % and piperitenone 12.8 %. Good antioxidant activity and moderate cholinesterase inhibition potential of tested essential oil indicates to possibility of its use in treatment of diseases related to free radicals, Alzheimer disease and as lipid protecting antioxidant.
