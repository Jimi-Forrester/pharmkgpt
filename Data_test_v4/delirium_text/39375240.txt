39375240|t|Therapeutic Effects of Metformin on Central Nervous System Diseases: A Focus on Protection of Neurovascular Unit.
39375240|a|Metformin is one of the most commonly used oral hypoglycemic drugs in clinical practice, with unique roles in neurodegeneration and vascular lesions. Neurodegeneration and vasculopathy coexist in many diseases and typically affect the neurovascular unit (NVU), a minimal structural and functional unit in the central nervous system. Its components interact with one another and are indispensable for maintaining tissue homeostasis. This review focuses on retinal (diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa) and cerebral (ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease) diseases to explore the effects of metformin on the NVU. Metformin has a preliminarily confirmed therapeutic effect on the retinal NUV, affecting many of its components, such as photoreceptors (cones and rods), microglia, ganglion, Muller, and vascular endothelial cells. Since it rapidly penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulates in the brain, metformin also has an extensively studied neuronal protective effect in neuronal diseases. Its mechanism affects various NVU components, including pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, and vascular endothelial cells, mainly serving to protect the BBB. Regulating the inflammatory response in NVU (especially neurons and microglia) may be the main mechanism of metformin in improving central nervous system related diseases. Metformin may be a potential drug for treating diseases associated with NVU deterioration, however, more trials are needed to validate its timing, duration, dose, clinical effects, and side effects.
