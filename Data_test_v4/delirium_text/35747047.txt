35747047|t|Ciprofloxacin-Induced Acute Delirium in a Young Female.
35747047|a|Ciprofloxacin is a commonly used drug in our setup. Neurological disturbances are rare side effects of its use and are reported in older adults, patients with comorbidities, or patients with a background of psychiatric illness and antipsychotic drug use. We report the case of a 21-year-old female who developed delirium after taking ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection. She underwent extensive workup and her final diagnosis was based on the exclusion of other causes. Her symptoms completely settled within three weeks of ciprofloxacin discontinuation.
