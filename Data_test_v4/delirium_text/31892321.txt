31892321|t|Post-sepsis syndrome - an evolving entity that afflicts survivors of sepsis.
31892321|a|BACKGROUND: The sequelae of sepsis were once thought to be independent of sepsis itself and assumed to be either comorbid to sick patients or complications of critical illness. Recent studies have reported consistent patterns of functional disabilities in sepsis survivors that can last from months to years after symptoms of active sepsis had resolved. BODY: Post-sepsis syndrome is an emerging pathological entity that has garnered significant interest amongst clinicians and researchers over the last two decades. It is marked by a significantly increased risk of death and a poor health-related quality of life associated with a constellation of long-term effects that persist following the patient's bout with sepsis. These include neurocognitive impairment, functional disability, psychological deficits, and worsening medical conditions. CONCLUSION: This "post-sepsis syndrome" has been the subject of active preclinical and clinical research providing new mechanistic insights and approaches linked to survivor well-being. Here we review important aspects of these research efforts and goals of care for patients who survive sepsis.
