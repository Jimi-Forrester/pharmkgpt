33154842|t|Psychiatric Manifestations in Fahr's Syndrome: A Case Report.
33154842|a|Fahr's syndrome is a rare neurological entity, primarily impacting basal ganglia with bilateral intracranial calcium deposition. It mainly manifests motor and psychiatric symptoms in affected individuals. After the patient and her family members' consent and proper ethical clearance from the institutional ethical committee, we here report a case presented with a few motor symptoms, features of delirium, and prominent psychiatric symptoms such as disorganized behavior, auditory hallucinations, and delusions. The imaging study found bilateral basal ganglia calcification and edema in the parietal region, primarily on the right side. Laboratory studies revealed mildly low parathyroid hormone and calcium levels, but no significant findings in other investigational tests. Her past medical and psychiatric history were negative, except for her well-adjusted pre-morbid personality. Our aim through this case is to highlight the psychiatric manifestation of a rare neurological syndrome. It also showcases the importance of ruling out medical causes when a patient presents primarily with behavioral symptoms.
