33851391|t|Delirium in Cardiac and Cardiovascular Surgical Intensive Care Units.
33851391|a|Delirium is a common occurrence in cardiac and cardiovascular surgical intensive care units. Due to multiple confounding factors, this diagnosis remains challenging for medical professionals. Multiple theories exist regarding the pathophysiology of delirium, which include disruption of neurotransmitters as well as inflammation. Delirium has been associated with prolonged hospitalizations and an increase in mortality. Although there are widely used screening tools for delirium, none have been validated in this particular patient population. Limited treatments exist for delirium, so: both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic preventative measures should be employed in this patient population.
