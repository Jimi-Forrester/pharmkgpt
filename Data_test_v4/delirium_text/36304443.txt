36304443|t|A comparison of in-hospital outcomes after elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in cases with and without Parkinson's Disease.
36304443|a|Background: Following orthopedic surgery, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been shown to have high rates of surgical complications, and some studies suggest that PD may be associated with greater risk for postoperative medical complications. As complication rates are critical to consider for elective surgery planning, the current study aimed to describe the association of PD with medical complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), the most commonly performed procedure to treat cervical degenerative pathology. Methods: The 2008-2018 National Inpatient Sample database was queried for cases involving elective ACDF. Demographics and comorbidities were extracted using ICD codes. Cases were propensity matched based on demographic and comorbidity burden, and logistic regression was used to compare in-hospital complications between patients with and without PD. Results: After weighting, a total of 1,273,437 elective ACDF cases were identified, of which 3948 (0.31%) involved cases with PD. After 1:1 propensity score matching by demographic and comorbidity variables, there were no differences between the PD and non-PD cohorts. Logistic regression models constructed for the matched and unmatched populations showed that PD cases have greater odds of in-hospital minor adverse events with no differences in odds of serious adverse events or mortality. Conclusions: After matching for demographics and comorbidity burden, PD cases undergoing elective ACDF had slightly longer length of stay and greater risk for minor adverse events but had similar rates of serious adverse events and mortality. These findings are important for surgeons and patients to consider when making decisions about surgical intervention.
