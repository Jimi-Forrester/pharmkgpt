34240627|t|Neurostimulation for cognitive enhancement in Alzheimer's disease (the NICE-AD study): a randomized clinical trial.
34240627|a|New therapies for symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are urgently needed. Prior studies suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive neuromodulatory method, may be a safe and potentially effective treatment, but conclusions have been limited by small-sample sizes and brief stimulation protocols. This double-blind randomized trial involving 100 older adults with mild-to-moderate AD examines effects of 6 months of at-home active tDCS or sham delivered over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The primary outcome is global cognitive performance. Secondary outcomes include executive-control/spatial selective attention, functional neuroplasticity, depressive symptoms, quality of life and the durability of effects 3 months after the stimulation period. The results will provide evidence on the efficacy of multimonth at-home tDCS in the AD treatment. =Clinical trial identifier NCT04404153 (Clinicaltrials.gov).
