Tumor cell-intrinsic programming and signals from geographically and temporally changing microenvironments both contribute to this variability. Furthermore, the mutational load is typically lacking in childhood malignancies of adult cancers, and they still exhibit high cellular heterogeneity levels largely mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Ewing sarcomas represent highly aggressive malignancies affecting both bone and soft tissue, primarily afflicting adolescents. Unfortunately, the outlook for patients facing relapsed or metastatic disease is grim. These tumors are primarily fueled by a distinctive fusion event involving an FET protein and an ETS family transcription factor, with the most prevalent fusion being EWS/FLI1. Despite originating from a common driver mutation, Ewing sarcoma cells display significant variations in transcriptional activity, both within and among tumors. Recent research has pinpointed distinct fusion protein activities as a principal source of this heterogeneity, resulting in markedly diverse cellular phenotypes. In this review, we aim to characterize the role of the EWS/FLI fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma by exploring its general mechanism of activation and elucidating its implications for tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, we delve into potential therapeutic opportunities to target this aberrant fusion protein in the context of Ewing sarcoma treatment.
