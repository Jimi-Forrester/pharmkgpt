30480227|t|Overview and Current Status of Alzheimer's Disease in Bangladesh.
30480227|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder with economic, social, and medical burdens which is acknowledged as leading cause of dementia marked by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein and concomitant dementia, neuron loss and brain atrophy. AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative brain disorder with sporadic etiology, except for a small fraction of cases with familial inheritance where familial forms of AD are correlated to mutations in three functionally related genes: the amyloid-beta protein precursor and presenilins 1 and 2, two key gamma-secretase components. The common clinical features of AD are memory impairment that interrupts daily life, difficulty in accomplishing usual tasks, confusion with time or place, trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships. Age is the most significant risk factor for AD, whereas other risk factors correlated with AD are hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Despite decades of research, there is no satisfying therapy which will terminate the advancement of AD by acting on the origin of the disease process, whereas currently available therapeutics only provide symptomatic relief but fail to attain a definite cure and prevention. This review also represents the current status of AD in Bangladesh.
