11731713|a|To demonstrate the economic impact of donepezil treatment for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Japanese clinical settings, we conducted a cost-utility analysis using the Markov model. This analysis was made from a payer's perspective, and the cost was estimated based on the fee schedule of the Japanese national health insurance and the long-term care insurance. The results of the clinical trial of donepezil on AD in Japan were used to estimate the drug efficacy. Under the base-case analysis with a 2-year time horizon, donepezil treatment for patients with mild to moderate AD was considered to be an economically dominant strategy compared to conventional therapy.
