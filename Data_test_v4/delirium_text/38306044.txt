38306044|t|Reduced Prefrontal-Thalamic Theta Flow During Working Memory Retrieval in APP/PS1 Mice.
38306044|a|Background: Working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are linked to impairments in the retrieval of stored memory information. However, research on the mechanism of impaired working memory retrieval in Alzheimer's disease is still lacking. Objective: The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) are involved in memory retrieval. The purpose of this study is to investigate the functional interactions and information transmission between mPFC and MD in the AD model. Methods: We recorded local field potentials from mPFC and MD while the mice (APP/PS1 transgenic model and control) performed a T-maze spatial working memory task. The temporal dynamics of oscillatory activity and bidirectional information flow between mPFC and MD were assessed during the task phases. Results: We mainly found a significant decrease in theta flow from mPFC to MD in APP/PS1 mice during retrieval. Conclusions: Our results indicate an important role of the mPFC-MD input for retrieval and the disrupted information transfer from mPFC to MD may be the underlying mechanism of working memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice.
