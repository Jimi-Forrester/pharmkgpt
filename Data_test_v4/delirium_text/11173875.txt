11173875|a|In order to study progressive dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, we analyzed the gene expression of apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE mRNA level in the brains of patients with AD was determined by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. ApoE genotype and the promoter polymorphisms (-491A/T, Th1/E47cs) were determined by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The apoE mRNA level was significantly higher in the AD group than the control group (p < 0.05). ApoE mRNA in the AD group with apoE epsilon 4 was also significantly higher than that in the control group with apoE epsilon 4 (p < 0.05). Our result did not indicate the possibility that the promoter polymorphisms modulate the apoE mRNA level. The higher level of apoE mRNA in AD with apoE epsilon4 may play an important role in the development of AD.
