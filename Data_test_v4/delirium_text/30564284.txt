30564284|t|Lymphatic Tissue Engineering and Regeneration.
30564284|a|The lymphatic system is a major circulatory system within the body, responsible for the transport of interstitial fluid, waste products, immune cells, and proteins. Compared to other physiological systems, the molecular mechanisms and underlying disease pathology largely remain to be understood which has hindered advancements in therapeutic options for lymphatic disorders. Dysfunction of the lymphatic system is associated with a wide range of disease phenotypes and has also been speculated as a route to rescue healthy phenotypes in areas including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and neurological conditions. This review will discuss lymphatic system functions and structure, cell sources for regenerating lymphatic vessels, current approaches for engineering lymphatic vessels, and specific therapeutic areas that would benefit from advances in lymphatic tissue engineering and regeneration.
