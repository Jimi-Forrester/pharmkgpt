17914918|a|Helicobacter pylori infection is a chronic gastric gram-negative infection that increases with age worldwide. However, the percentage age of H. pylori-positive elderly patients who are tested and treated for their infection remains very low. It is now demonstrated that H. pylori infection induces a whole cascade of events leading to gastric pathologies, such as peptic ulcer diseases, gastric precancerous lesions and gastric cancer. Recent data also demonstrated that H. pylori chronic infection can play a role in gastric aging, appetite regulation and extradigestive diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, in the elderly. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection remains difficult to realize in the very old population, and the urea breath test obtains the best performance in this population. 1-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy regimens are highly effective and well tolerated in elderly patients, and antibiotic resistance remains very low. Low compliance is the main factor related to treatment failure in this population.
