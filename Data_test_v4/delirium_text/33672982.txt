33672982|a|Tauopathies represent a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) that are characterized by the deposition of filamentous tau aggregates in the brain. The pathogenesis of tauopathies starts from the formation of toxic 'tau seeds' from hyperphosphorylated tau monomers. The presence of specific phosphorylation sites and heat shock protein 90 facilitates soluble tau protein aggregation. Transcellular propagation of pathogenic tau into synaptically connected neuronal cells or adjacent glial cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis facilitate disease spread through the brain. While neuroprotective effects of glial cells-including phagocytotic microglial and astroglial phenotypes-have been observed at the early stage of neurodegeneration, dysfunctional neuronal-glial cellular communication results in a series of further pathological consequences as the disease progresses, including abnormal axonal transport, synaptic degeneration, and neuronal loss, accompanied by a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, the discovery of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene mutations and the strongest genetic risk factor of tauopathies-an increase in the presence of the epsilon2 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-provide important clues to understanding tau pathology progression. In this review, we describe the crucial signaling pathways and diverse cellular contributors to the progression of tauopathies. A systematic understanding of disease pathogenesis provides novel insights into therapeutic targets within altered signaling pathways and is of great significance for discovering effective treatments for tauopathies.
