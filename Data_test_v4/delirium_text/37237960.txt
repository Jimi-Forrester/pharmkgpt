37237960|t|How to Increase Cellular Glutathione.
37237960|a|Glutathione (GSH) has special antioxidant properties due to its high intracellular concentration, ubiquity, and high reactivity towards electrophiles of the sulfhydryl group of its cysteine moiety. In most diseases where oxidative stress is thought to play a pathogenic role, GSH concentration is significantly reduced, making cells more susceptible to oxidative damage. Therefore, there is a growing interest in determining the best method(s) to increase cellular glutathione for both disease prevention and treatment. This review summarizes the major strategies for successfully increasing cellular GSH stores. These include GSH itself, its derivatives, NRf-2 activators, cysteine prodrugs, foods, and special diets. The possible mechanisms by which these molecules can act as GSH boosters, their related pharmacokinetic issues, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.
