32630818|t|IL-6 Trans-Signaling in the Brain Influences the Metabolic Phenotype of the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
32630818|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes the most prevalent dementia in the elderly people. Obesity and insulin resistance, which may cause major health problems per se, are risk factors for AD, and cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have a role in these conditions. IL-6 can signal either through a membrane receptor or by trans-signaling, which can be inhibited by the soluble form of the co-receptor gp130 (sgp130). We have addressed the possibility that blocking IL-6 trans-signaling in the brain could have an effect in the triple transgenic 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD and/or in obesity progression, by crossing 3xTg-AD mice with GFAP-sgp130Fc mice. To serve as control groups, GFAP-sgp130Fc mice were also crossed with C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice. Seventeen-month-old mice were fed a control diet (18% kcal from fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD; 58.4% kcal from fat). In our experimental conditions, the 3xTg-AD model showed a mild amyloid phenotype, which nevertheless altered the control of body weight and related endocrine and metabolic factors, suggestive of a hypermetabolic state. The inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling modulated some of these traits in both 3xTg-AD and control mice, particularly during HFD, and in a sex-dependent manner. These experiments provide evidence of IL-6 trans-signaling playing a role in the CNS of a mouse model of AD.
