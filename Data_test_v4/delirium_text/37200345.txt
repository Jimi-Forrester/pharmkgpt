37200345|t|A qualitative study exploring the lived experiences of patients living with mild, moderate and severe frailty, following hip fracture surgery and hospitalisation.
37200345|a|It is well recognised that hip fracture surgery is associated with a negative impact on short and long-term post-operative physical health and emotional well-being for patients. Furthermore, these patients are known to be frail with multiple co-morbidities. This study explores how frailty shapes the lived experiences of rehabilitation and recovery for patients who have undergone hip fracture surgery. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen participants, recently discharged from hospital following hip fracture surgery. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to explore the lived experiences of frail patients and ascertain important themes. Patient experiences were captured in seven overarching themes: 1) the hospital as a place of "safety", 2) placing trust in others, 3) the slow recovery journey impeded by attitude and support, 4) maintaining autonomy and dignity whilst feeling vulnerable, 5) seeking a new normal, 6) loneliness and social isolation and 7) the ageing body. Based on our study findings, we have been able to suggest a number of opportunities to improve support for frailer patients in finding a new routine to their everyday lives, these include on-going physical and psychological support, information and education and a robust pathway for transition of care into the community. A conceptual thematic diagram is presented which helps to understand the experience and the complex needs of frail older people undergoing hip fracture surgery.
