36385246|t|A review of the potential neurological adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines.
36385246|a|Despite the advantages of getting access to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, their potential ability to induce severe adverse events (AEs) has been a significant concern. Neurological complications are significant among the various adverse events following immunization (AEFI) due to their likely durability and debilitating sequelae. Neurological AEs following COVID-19 vaccination can either exacerbate or induce new-onset neuro-immunologic diseases, such as myasthenia gravis (MG) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The more severe spectrum of AEs post-COVID19 vaccines has included seizures, reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, strokes, GBS, Bell's palsy, transverse myelitis (TM), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Here, we discuss each of these neurological adverse effects separately.
