34394398|a|Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is one of the main causes of low back pain (LBP), which severely reduces the quality of life and imposes a heavy financial burden on the families of affected individuals. Current research suggests that IDD is a complex cell-mediated process. Inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mechanical load, telomere shortening, DNA damage, and nutrient deprivation contribute to intervertebral disc cell senescence and changes in matrix metabolism, ultimately causing IDD. Natural products are widespread, structurally diverse, afford unique advantages, and exhibit great potential in terms of IDD treatment. In recent years, increasing numbers of natural ingredients have been shown to inhibit the degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells through various modes of action. Here, we review the pharmacological effects of natural products on nucleus pulposus cells and the mechanisms involved. An improved understanding of how natural products target signalling pathways will aid the development of anti-IDD drugs. This review focuses on potential IDD drugs.
