39584313|a|BACKGROUND: Although links between social networks and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been suggested. The pathway between social networks and MCI from the Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO) model perspective among older adults remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between social networks and MCI, and further identify whether neuropsychological factors mediate the relationship. METHODS: 1036 participants aged 55 to 75 years were recruited from two districts of Fuzhou, China, from December 2020 to December 2022. Data were obtained via a face-to-face neuropsychological scale assessment. Social networks and cognitive function were assessed by the Lubben Social Network Scale and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, respectively. The mediation model and structural equation model (SEM) pathway analysis were used to examine the direct and indirect effects of social networks on MCI via neuropsychological factors. RESULTS: Data from 580 participants were analyzed (year: 65.16 +- 5.38). Regression analysis indicated that higher levels of social networks and psychological resilience were positively correlated with improved cognitive function, even after adjusting for demographic data. Increased depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality were linked to cognitive decline. Support from family members had a greater impact than support from friends in reducing the risk of developing MCI. The SEM model supported the hypothesis that significant indirect effects of social networks on MCI via psychological resilience, depressive tendencies, and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of social networks on MCI are mediated by psychological resilience, depressive tendencies, and sleep quality.
