22779027|t|Is There Inflammatory Synergy in Type II Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease?
22779027|a|Metabolic dysregulation, including abnormal glucose utilization and insulin resistance or deficiency, occurs at an early stage of AD independent of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Thus, AD has been considered as type 3 diabetes. T2DM is a risk factor for AD; the coexistence of these two diseases in a society with an increasing mean age is a significant issue. Recently, research has focused on shared molecular mechanisms in these two diseases with the goal of determining whether treating T2DM can lessen the severity of AD. The progress in this field lends strong support to several mechanisms that could affect these two diseases, including insulin resistance and signaling, vascular injuries, inflammation, and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and their ligands. In this paper, we focus on inflammation-based mechanisms in both diseases and discuss potential synergism in these mechanisms when these two diseases coexist in the same patient.
