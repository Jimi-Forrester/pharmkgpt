37038219|t|Efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning on outcomes following non-cardiac non-vascular surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37038219|a|BACKGROUND: Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been investigated as a simple intervention to potentially mitigate the ischaemic effect of the surgical insult and reduce postoperative morbidity. This review systematically evaluates the effect of RIPC on morbidity, including duration of hospital stay and parameters reflective of cardiac, renal, respiratory, and hepatic dysfunction following non-cardiac non-vascular (NCNV) surgery. METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched from their inception date to November 2021. Studies investigating the effect of local preconditioning or postconditioning were excluded. Methodological quality and risk of bias were determined according to the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Calculation of the odds ratios and a random effects model was used for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences or standardised mean differences as appropriate were used for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest were cardiac and renal morbidity, and the secondary outcomes included other organ function parameters and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: A systematic review of the published literature identified 36 randomised controlled trials. There was no significant difference in postoperative troponin or acute kidney injury. RIPC was associated with lower postoperative serum creatinine (9 studies, 914 patients, mean difference (MD) - 3.81 micromol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 6.79 to - 0.83, p = 0.01, I2 = 5%) and lower renal stress biomarker (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), 5 studies, 379 patients, standardized mean difference (SMD) - 0.66, 95% CI - 1.27 to - 0.06, p = 0.03, I2 = 86%). RIPC was also associated with improved oxygenation (higher PaO2/FiO2, 5 studies, 420 patients, MD 51.51 mmHg, 95% CI 27.32 to 75.69, p < 0.01, I2 = 89%), lower biomarker of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde (MDA), 3 studies, 100 patients, MD - 1.24 micromol/L, 95% CI - 2.4 to - 0.07, p = 0.04, I2 = 91%)) and shorter length of hospital stay (15 studies, 2110 patients, MD - 0.99 days, 95% CI - 1.75 to - 0.23, p = 0.01, I2 = 88%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis did not show an improvement in the primary outcomes of interest with the use of RIPC. RIPC was associated with a small improvement in certain surrogate parameters of organ function and small reduction in hospital length of stay. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies addressing individual outcomes and the considerable heterogeneity identified.
