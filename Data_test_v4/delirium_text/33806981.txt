33806981|t|A Mitocentric View of the Main Bacterial and Parasitic Infectious Diseases in the Pediatric Population.
33806981|a|Infectious diseases occur worldwide with great frequency in both adults and children. Both infections and their treatments trigger mitochondrial interactions at multiple levels: (i) incorporation of damaged or mutated proteins to the complexes of the electron transport chain, (ii) mitochondrial genome (depletion, deletions, and point mutations) and mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and fission), (iii) membrane potential, (iv) apoptotic regulation, (v) generation of reactive oxygen species, among others. Such alterations may result in serious adverse clinical events with great impact on children's quality of life, even resulting in death. As such, bacterial agents are frequently associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, ultimately leading to mitochondrial apoptosis by activation of caspases-3 and -9. Using Rayyan QCRI software for systematic reviews, we explore the association between mitochondrial alterations and pediatric infections including (i) bacterial: M. tuberculosis, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis, E. coli, S. enterica, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and (ii) parasitic: P. falciparum. We analyze how these pediatric infections and their treatments may lead to mitochondrial deterioration in this especially vulnerable population, with the intention of improving both the understanding of these diseases and their management in clinical practice.
