37765144|t|Engineered Extracellular Vesicles for Drug Delivery in Therapy of Stroke.
37765144|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising therapeutic modalities for treating neurological conditions. EVs facilitate intercellular communication among brain cells under normal and abnormal physiological conditions. The potential capability of EVs to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes them highly promising as nanocarrier contenders for managing stroke. EVs possess several potential advantages compared to existing drug-delivery vehicles. These advantages include their capacity to surpass natural barriers, target specific cells, and stability within the circulatory system. This review explores the trafficking and cellular uptake of EVs and evaluates recent findings in the field of EVs research. Additionally, an overview is provided of the techniques researchers utilize to bioengineer EVs for stroke therapy, new results on EV-BBB interactions, and the limitations and prospects of clinically using EVs for brain therapies. The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and challenges related to engineered EVs drug delivery, specifically focusing on their application in the treatment of stroke.
