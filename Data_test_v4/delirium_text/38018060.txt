38018060|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as the most prevalent type of dementia in the elderly population. However, AD is regarded as a persistent sever clinical challenge due to its high morbidity but low rates of diagnosis and treatment in China. Intracerebral beta-Amyloid protein deposition is the earliest pathological process that occurs in the continuous spectrum of AD, prior to clinical symptoms such as cognitive decline. Standardizing the operation and result interpretation of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) during the clinical practice, and achieving the reliability, repeatability and comparability of the imaging process and results will contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, and outcome prediction. A global binary interpretation (positive or negative) of amyloid PET images is recommended. In clinical interpretation, amyloid PET image results should be combined with clinical and neuropsychological characteristics, other morphological and/or functional imaging data, and other biological markers.
