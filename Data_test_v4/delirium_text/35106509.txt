35106509|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts clinically relevant accumulation of many therapeutics in the CNS. Low-dose methamphetamine (METH) induces fluid-phase transcytosis across BBB endothelial cells in vitro and could be used to enhance CNS drug delivery. Here, we show that low-dose METH induces significant BBB leakage in rodents ex vivo and in vivo. Notably, METH leaves tight junctions intact and induces transient leakage via caveolar transport, which is suppressed at 4 C and in caveolin-1 (CAV1) knockout mice. METH enhances brain penetration of both small therapeutic molecules, such as doxorubicin (DOX), and large proteins. Lastly, METH improves the therapeutic efficacy of DOX in a mouse model of glioblastoma, as measured by a 25% increase in median survival time and a significant reduction in satellite lesions. Collectively, our data indicate that caveolar transport at the adult BBB is agonist inducible and that METH can enhance drug delivery to the CNS.
