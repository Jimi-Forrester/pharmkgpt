3426578|t|Alzheimer's disease fibroblasts have normal repair of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced DNA damage determined by the alkaline elution technique.
3426578|a|Cultured fibroblast strains from two normal persons and from two patients with the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease were exposed to the alkylating chemical N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Immediately after exposure and also after a 24-h repair incubation period the single-strand breaks in the cells' DNA were quantified by the alkaline elution technique. In contrast to a report by others using alkaline elution, MNNG, and these same strains, we found no evidence of deficient repair of MNNG-induced DNA damage in the Alzheimer's disease cells. The putative DNA repair defect in Alzheimer's disease should be investigated by methods other than the alkaline elution technique which measures only a small fraction of the damage induced by an alkylating chemical such as MNNG.
