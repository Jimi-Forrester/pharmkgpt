37790602|t|Smaller and Denser Speech Graphs in Nondemented Patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
37790602|a|The well-established semantic fluency test measures the ability to produce a sequence of spoken words from a particular category within a limited period of time. Like patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) tend to produce fewer correct words than age-matched healthy adults. This study further examined the difference between patients with PSP and PD in their semantic fluency performance using a graph theory-based approach. Twenty-nine patients with PSP Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), thirty-eight patients with PD, and fifty-one healthy controls (HC) were recruited. All participants completed a standard semantic fluency test (animals). Their verbal responses were recorded, transcripted, and transformed into directed speech graphs. The speech graphs of the PSP-RS group showed higher density, shorter diameter, and shorter average shortest path than those of the PD and HC groups. It indicates that the PSP-RS group produced smaller and denser speech graphs than the PD and HC groups. In the PSP-RS group, moreover, the average shortest paths of the speech graphs correlated with the severity of motor symptoms. This study shows the potential of the graph theory-based approach in distinguishing the semantic fluency performance of nondemented patients with PSP-RS and PD.
