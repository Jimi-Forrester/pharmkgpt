2516974|t|[Cortical and subcortical dementia. The value of long auditory evoked potentials].
2516974|a|Long latency auditory evoked potentials were studied in 27 normal subjects, 19 patients with Alzheimer's Disease (A.D.) and 70 patients with Parkinson's Disease (P.D.). 17 patients with P.D. showed cognitive impairment measured by the "test rapide d'evaluation des fonctions cognitives - E.R.F.C.". The N2 and P3 peak latencies were prolonged in the demented group of P.D. compared to the non demented group P.D.. Between the electrophysiological parameters only the N1 latency prolongation distinguished the demented parkinsonian patients from the patients with A.D..
