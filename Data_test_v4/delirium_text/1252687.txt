1252687|a|During the fiscal year 1 April 1972 to 31 March 1973, 22,210 ECT treatments in 3,438 series were given in Denmark (6-46 treatments per series). Indications for treatment were: endogenous depression, acute delirium, mania, hysterical psychosis, reactive depression and schizophrenia. Unilateral ECT was used in more than half of the departments concerned. Two treatments were given weekly. The types of apparatus and anaesthesia techniques used are described. One death, which had questionable relation to the ECT, was reported, and other complications were few and mild. The advantages of ECT compared to tricyclic antidepressants are described, including the higher percentage of remissions or improvements in the treatment of endogenous depressions (about 80 per cent for ECT compared to about 60 per cent for tricyclic antidepressants). Little risk was found in out-patient administration of ECT. With present techniques and unilateral placement of electrodes out-patient ECT may be recommended for wider use than before.
