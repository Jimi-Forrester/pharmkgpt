AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this exploratory study was to profile the neurometabolic state of CSF from a South African paediatric cohort using GCxGC-TOF/MS. The study included 54 paediatric cases (< 12 years), 42 HIV-negative controls and 12 HIV-positive individuals. RESULTS: The results revealed distinct metabolic alterations in the HIV-infected cohort. In the PLS-DA model, 18 metabolites significantly discriminated between HIV-infected and control groups. In addition, fold-change analysis, Mann-Whitney U tests, and effect size measurements verified these findings. Notably, lactose, myo-inositol, and glycerol, although not significant by p-value alone, demonstrated practical significance based on the effect size. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided valuable insights on the impact of HIV on metabolic pathways, including damage to the gut and blood-brain barrier, disruption of bioenergetics processes, gliosis, and a potential marker for antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, the study recognized certain constraints, notably a limited sample size and the absence of a validation cohort. Despite these limitations, the rarity of the study's focus on paediatric HIV research underscores the significance and unique contributions of its findings.
