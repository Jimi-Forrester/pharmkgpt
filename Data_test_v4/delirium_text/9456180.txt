9456180|t|Localization of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor protein and mRNA in cortical neurons of the normal and cholinergically deafferented rhesus monkey.
9456180|a|The m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the cerebral cortex has traditionally been thought of as an autoreceptor located on cholinergic fibers that originate from neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. We now provide evidence for widespread localization of the m2 receptor in noncholinergic neurons and fibers of the cerebral cortex. The cellular and subcellular distribution of the m2 receptor protein and mRNA were examined in normal monkeys and in monkeys in which the cortical cholinergic afferents were selectively lesioned by injection of the specific immunotoxin, anti-p75NTR-saporin into the nucleus basalis. Both in normal and immunolesioned monkeys, the m2 mRNA and protein were localized in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons. In pyramidal neurons, membrane-associated receptor immunoreactivity was found exclusively in dendritic spines receiving asymmetric synapses, indicating that the m2 receptor may modulate excitatory neurotransmission at these sites. In nonpyramidal neurons, the m2 immunoreactivity was present along the cytoplasmic surface of membranes in cell bodies, dendrites and axons. Both in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons of normal and lesioned monkeys, the m2 receptor was located peri- and extra-synaptically, suggesting that it may be contacted by acetylcholine via volume transmission. The localization of the m2 receptor in cortical neurons and the sparing of m2 immunoreactivity in lesioned monkeys indicates that the m2 receptor is synthesized largely within the cortex and/or is localized to noncholinergic terminals of either intrinsic or extrinsic origin. These findings open the possibility that the loss of the m2 receptor in Alzheimer's disease may in part be due to degenerative changes in m2 positive neurons of the cortex rather than entirely due to the loss of autoreceptors.
