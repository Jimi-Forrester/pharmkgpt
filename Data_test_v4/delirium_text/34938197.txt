34938197|t|Identification of miRNA and Their Regulatory Effects Induced by Total Flavonoids From Dracocephalum moldavica in the Treatment of Vascular Dementia.
34938197|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is a general term used to describe difficulties in memory, reasoning, judgment, and planning caused by a reduced blood flow to the brain and consequent brain damage, in which microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved. Dracocephalum moldavica L. (D. moldavica) is traditionally used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases as well as VaD, but the biomolecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effect are obscure. In the present study, the molecular mechanisms involved in the treatment of VaD by the total flavonoids from Dracocephalum moldavica L. (TFDM) were explored by the identification of miRNA profiling using bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. A total of 2,562 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 3,522 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from the GSE120584 and GSE122063 datasets, in which the gene functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction network of 93 core targets, originated from the intersection of the top DEM target genes and DEGs, were established for VaD gene profiling. One hundred and eighty-five targets interacting with 42 flavonoids in the TFDM were included in a compound-target network, subsequently found that they overlapped with potential targets for VaD. These 43 targets could be considered in the treatment of VaD by TFDM, and included CaMKII, MAPK, MAPT, PI3K, and KDR, closely associated with the vascular protective effect of TFDM, as well as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. The subsequent analysis of the compound-target gene-miRNA network indicated that eight miRNAs that mediated 43 targets had a close interaction with TFDM, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects were principally due to kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin, which were mostly associated with the miR-3184-3p/ESR1, miR-6762-3p/CDK1, miR-6777-3p/ESRRA, and other related axes. Furthermore, the in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model demonstrated that the dysregulation of miR-3184-3p and miR-6875-5p found by qRT-PCR was consistent with the changes in the bioinformatics analysis. TFDM and its active compounds involving tilianin, luteolin, and apigenin showed significant effects on the upregulation of miR-3184-3p and downregulation of miR-6875-5p in OGD-injured cells, in line with the improved cell viability. In conclusion, our findings revealed the underlying miRNA-target gene network and potential targets of TFDM in the treatment of VaD.
