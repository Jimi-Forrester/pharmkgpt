8898750|t|Serum levels of the iron binding protein p97 are elevated in Alzheimer's disease.
8898750|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and incurable disease whose prevalence increases dramatically with age. A biochemical marker for monitoring the onset and progression of the disease would be a valuable tool for disease management. In addition, such a marker might be used as an end point in clinical intervention protocols. Here we provide evidence that the soluble form of the iron binding protein p97 is found in elevated amounts in the serum of Alzheimer's patients compared with healthy controls. This biochemical marker has the potential for identifying subjects afflicted with the disease and possibly for monitoring the onset and longitudinal progression of the disease.
