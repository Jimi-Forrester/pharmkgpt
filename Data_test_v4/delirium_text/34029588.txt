34029588|a|Many enveloped viruses bud from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the cell membrane. Depleting cellular cholesterol impedes this process and results in viral particles with reduced viability. Viperin (Virus Inhibitory Protein, Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated, Interferon iNducible) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated enzyme that exerts broad-ranging antiviral effects, including inhibiting the budding of some enveloped viruses. However, the relationship between viperin expression and the retarded budding of virus particles from lipid rafts on the cell membrane is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of viperin expression on cholesterol biosynthesis using transiently expressed genes in the human cell line human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T). We found that viperin expression reduces cholesterol levels by 20% to 30% in these cells. Following this observation, a proteomic screen of the viperin interactome identified several cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes among the top hits, including lanosterol synthase (LS) and squalene monooxygenase (SM), which are enzymes that catalyze key steps in establishing the sterol carbon skeleton. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that viperin, LS, and SM form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While coexpression of viperin was found to significantly inhibit the specific activity of LS in HEK293T cell lysates, coexpression of viperin had no effect on the specific activity of SM, although did reduce SM protein levels by approximately 30%. Despite these inhibitory effects, the coexpression of neither LS nor SM was able to reverse the viperin-induced depletion of cellular cholesterol levels, possibly because viperin is highly expressed in transfected HEK293T cells. Our results establish a link between viperin expression and downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis that helps explain viperin's antiviral effects against enveloped viruses.
