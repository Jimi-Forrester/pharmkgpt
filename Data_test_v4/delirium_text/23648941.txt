23648941|t|Ras signal triggers beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression.
23648941|a|It has recently been discovered that the Drosophila beta-amyloid protein precursor like (Appl) gene, the ortholog of the human beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) gene, is transcriptionally activated by receptor tyrosine kinase activity that involves Ras/MAPK signaling in vivo. This regulation is specifically controlled in photoreceptor neurons of the Drosophila retina. This suggests that some cases of Alzheimer disease, those which have been associated with high expression of the APP gene, may involve Ras signal transduction.
