38816676|t|Emerging Pro-neurogenic Therapeutic Strategies for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review of Pre-clinical and Clinical Research.
38816676|a|The neuroscience community has largely accepted the notion that functional neurons can be generated from neural stem cells in the adult brain, especially in two brain regions: the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. However, impaired neurogenesis has been observed in some neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and also in Lewy Body dementia. Therefore, restoration of neurogenic function in neurodegenerative diseases emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract, or at least delay, disease progression. Considering this, the present study summarizes the different neuronal niches, provides a collection of the therapeutic potential of different pro-neurogenic strategies in pre-clinical and clinical research, providing details about their possible modes of action, to guide future research and clinical practice.
