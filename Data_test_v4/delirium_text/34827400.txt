34827400|t|The Influence of Intraocular Lens Implantation and Alterations in Blue Light Transmittance Level on the Brain Functional Network Architecture Reorganization in Cataract Patients.
34827400|a|BACKGROUND: Cataract is one of the most common age-related vision deteriorations, leading to opacification of the lens and therefore visual impairment as well as blindness. Both cataract extraction and the implantation of blue light filtering lens are believed to improve not only vision but also overall functioning. METHODS: Thirty-four cataract patients were subject to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation (IOL). Global and local graph metrics were calculated in order to investigate the reorganization of functional network architecture associated with alterations in blue light transmittance. Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was conducted. RESULTS: Graph theory-based analysis revealed decreased eigenvector centrality after the cataract extraction and IOL replacement in inferior occipital gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and many cerebellum regions as well as increased clustering coefficient in superior and inferior parietal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and various cerebellum regions. PVT results revealed significant change between experimental sessions as patients responded faster after IOL replacement. Moreover, a few regions were correlated with the difference in blue light transmittance and the time reaction in PVT. CONCLUSION: Current study revealed substantial functional network architecture reorganization associated with cataract extraction and alteration in blue light transmittance.
