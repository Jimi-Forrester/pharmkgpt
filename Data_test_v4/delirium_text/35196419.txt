35196419|t|Outcome of neurocritical disorders, a multicenter prospective cross-sectional study.
35196419|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with neurocritical disorders who require admission to intensive care units (ICUs) constitute about 10-15% of critical care cases. OBJECTIVES: To study the outcome of neurocritical disorders in intensive care units. METHODOLOGY: This is a prospective cross-sectional study that was conducted among neurocritical patients who were admitted in four intensive care units of four major hospitals in Khartoum state during the period from November 2020 to March 2021. RESULTS: Seventy-two neurocritical patients were included in this study; 40(55.6%) were males and 32(44.4%) were females. Twenty-one (29.2%) patients fully recovered, 35 (48.6%) partially recovered and 16 (22.2%) died. The mortality of the common neurocritical diseases were as follows: stroke 30.4%, encephalitis (8.3%), status epilepticus (11.1%), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (16.7%), and myasthenia gravis (MG) (25%). CONCLUSION: This study identified that near two-thirds of the patients required mechanical ventilation. Delayed admission was observed due to causes distributed between the medical side and patient side. The majority of patients were discharged from ICU with partial recovery.
