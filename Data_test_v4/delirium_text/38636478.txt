38636478|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. The toxicity of amyloid to neuronal cell surfaces arises from interactions between small intermediate aggregates, namely amyloid oligomers, and the cell membrane. The nature of these interactions changes with age and disease progression. In our previous work, we demonstrated that both membrane composition and nanoscale structure play crucial roles in amyloid-membrane interactions. In our previous work, we demonstrated that both membrane composition and nanoscale structure play crucial roles in amyloid toxicity, and that membrane models mimicking healthy neuron were less affected by amyloid than model membranes mimicking AD neuronal membranes. This understanding introduces the possibility of modifying membrane properties with membrane-active molecules, such as melatonin, to protect them from amyloid-induced damage. In the present study, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) to investigate the protective effects of melatonin. We utilized synthetic lipid membranes that mimic the neuronal cellular membrane at various stages of AD and explored their interactions with amyloid-beta (1-42) in the presence of melatonin. Our findings reveal that the early diseased membrane model is particularly vulnerable to amyloid binding and subsequent damage. However, melatonin exerts its most potent protective effect on this early-stage membrane. These results suggest that melatonin could act at the membrane level to alleviate amyloid toxicity, offering the most protection during the initial stages of AD.
