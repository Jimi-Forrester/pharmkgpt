35793106|t|Oxygen Sensing in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Mechanisms, Implication of Transcriptional Response, and Pharmacological Modulation.
35793106|a|Significance: Oxygen (O2) sensing is the fundamental process through which organisms respond to changes in O2 levels. Complex networks exist allowing the maintenance of O2 levels through the perception, capture, binding, transport, and delivery of molecular O2. The brain extreme sensitivity to O2 balance makes the dysregulation of related processes crucial players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). In this study, we wish to review the most relevant advances in O2 sensing in relation to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent Advances: Over the years, it has been clarified that most NDs share common pathways, a great number of which are in relation to O2 imbalance. These include hypoxia, hyperoxia, reactive oxygen species production, metabolism of metals, protein misfolding, and neuroinflammation. Critical Issues: There is still a gap in knowledge concerning how O2 sensing plays a role in the above indicated neurodegenerations. Specifically, O2 concentrations are perceived in body sites that are not limited to the brain, but primarily reside in other organs. Moreover, the mechanisms of O2 sensing, gene expression, and signal transduction seem to correlate with neurodegeneration, but many aspects are mechanistically still unexplained. Future Directions: Future studies should focus on the precise characterization of O2 level disruption and O2 sensing mechanisms in NDs. Moreover, advances need to be made also concerning the techniques used to assess O2 sensing dysfunctions in these diseases. There is also the need to develop innovative therapies targeting this precise mechanism rather than its secondary effects, as early intervention is necessary. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 38, 160-182.
