39010691|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterised by cognitive dysfunction, memory loss and mood changes. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been suggested to play a role in learning and memory. Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) has been shown to be prevalent in the hippocampus region. The aim of the project was to investigate the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in the promnestic effects of NK3R agonist administration in an amyloid beta-induced AD rat model. Wistar albino rats were divided into control, Alzheimer, NK3R agonist and Alzheimer + NK3R agonist groups. The open field (OF) test and Morris water maze (MWM) test were performed for locomotor activity and memory analysis. Peptide gene expression levels (Nestin, DCX, Neuritin, MASH1, Neun, BDNF) were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the OF test, the group-time relationship was found to be statistically different in the parameters of distance travelled and percentage of movement (p < 0.05). In MWM, the time to reach the platform and the time spent in the target quadrant were statistically significant between the groups (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were observed in gene expression levels (Nestin, DCX, Neuritin, MASH1) in the hippocampal tissue of rats between the groups (p < 0.05). NK3 receptor agonism favourably affected hippocampal neurogenesis in AD model rats. It was concluded that NK3 receptor agonism in the hippocampus, which is the first affected region in the physiopathology of AD, may be effective in both the formation of neural precursor cells and the reduction of neuronal degeneration. The positive effect of NK3R on cognitive functions may be mediated by hippocampal neurogenesis.
