39035621|t|Adverse events related to physical restraint use in intensive care units: A review of the literature.
39035621|a|Physical restraints are widely used and accepted as protective measures during treatment in intensive care unit (ICU). This review of the literature summarizes the adverse events and outcomes associated with physical restraint use, and the risk factors associated with their use during treatment in the ICU. The PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were screened using predefined search terms to identify studies pertaining to adverse events and/or outcomes associated with physical restraint use, and the factors associated with their use in adult patients admitted to the ICU. A total of 24 articles (including 6126 patients) that were published between 2006 and 2022 were identified. The described adverse events associated with physical restraint use included skin injuries, subsequent delirium, neurofunctional impairment, and a higher rate of post-traumatic stress disorder. Subsequent delirium was the most frequent adverse event to be reported. No alternative measures to physical restraints were discussed, and only one study reported a standardized protocol for their use. Although physical restraint use has been reported to be associated with adverse events (including neurofunctional impairment) in the literature, the available evidence is limited. Although causality cannot be confirmed, a definite association appears to exist. Our findings suggest that it is essential to improve awareness regarding their adverse impact and optimize approaches for their detection, management, and prevention using protocols or checklists.
