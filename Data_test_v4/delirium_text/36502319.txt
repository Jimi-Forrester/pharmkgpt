36502319|t|Clinical and Economic Assessment in Early-Stage Dementia by Severity and Amyloid-beta Status: A 5-Year Retrospective Claims Study of GERAS-US Patients.
36502319|a|BACKGROUND: The high burden of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases substantially as disease progresses. Characterizing early patterns of health care utilization among patients who develop cognitive impairment may deepen our understanding of early disease trajectory and potentially facilitate timely diagnosis and management. OBJECTIVE: Describe clinical characteristics, healthcare utilization, and costs in early-stage dementia by disease severity and amyloid-beta status before enrollment in an observational study (GERAS-US). METHODS: Consented patients' GERAS-US data were linked to available five-years of Medicare claims history before GERAS-US enrollment. Clinical characteristics, comorbidity, and pre-/post-diagnosis healthcare use and costs were assessed. Continuous and categorical variables were compared between severity and amyloid-status cohorts using t-test and Chi-square statistics; linear regression models were used to compare cost and utilization measures after adjusting for differences in patients' observation time. Relative likelihood of observed diagnoses, comorbidity, and prescription drug use among cohorts were presented as OR and 90% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Of 174 patients clinically diagnosed with early dementia (mild cognitive impairment (MCI): 101; mild dementia (MILD): 73), 55% were amyloid-positive. Memory loss was more likely in MILD versus MCI (OR:1.85, 90% CI 1.10-3.09) and in amyloid-positive versus amyloid-negative cohorts (OR:1.98, 90% CI 1.19-3.29). Mean annual healthcare costs after cognitive impairment/dementia diagnosis were significantly higher for MILD versus MCI ($1191 versus $712, p = 0.067) and amyloid-negative versus amyloid-positive ($1281 versus $701, p = 0.034). Diabetes was more prevalent in MILD and amyloid-negative cohorts. CONCLUSION: Comorbidity and economic burden increased in earliest stages of MCI and MILD and were higher in patients who were amyloid-negative.
