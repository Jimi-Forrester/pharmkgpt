35834388|t|Current Recommendations for Perioperative Brain Health: A Scoping Review.
35834388|a|Perioperative complications such as stroke, delirium, and neurocognitive dysfunction are common and responsible for increased morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to characterize and synthesize the contemporary guidelines on perioperative brain health for noncardiac, non-neurologic surgery in a scoping review. We performed a structured search for articles providing recommendations on brain health published between 2016 and 2021 and included the following complications: perioperative stroke and perioperative neurocognitive disorders, the latter of which encompasses postoperative delirium and a spectrum of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We categorized recommendations by subtopic (stroke, postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction), type (disclosure/ethics/policies, prevention, risk stratification, screening/diagnosis, and management), and pharmacological versus nonpharmacological strategies. We noted country of origin, specialty of the authors, evidence grade (if available), and concordance/discordance between recommendations. Eight publications provided 129 recommendations, originating from the United States (n=5), Europe (n=1), United Kingdom (n=1), and China (n=1). Three publications (37%) applied grading of evidence as follows: Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE): A, 30%; B, 36%; C, 30%; D, 4%. We identified 42 instances of concordant recommendations (>=2 publications) on 15 themes, including risk factor identification, risk disclosure, baseline neurocognitive testing, nonpharmacological perioperative neurocognitive disorder prevention, intraoperative monitoring to prevent perioperative neurocognitive disorders, avoidance of benzodiazepines, delaying elective surgery after stroke, and emergency imaging and rapid restoration of cerebral perfusion after perioperative stroke. We identified 19 instances of discordant recommendations on 7 themes, including the use of regional anesthesia and monitoring for perioperative stroke prevention, pharmacological perioperative neurocognitive disorder management, and postoperative stroke screening. We synthesized recommendations for clinical practice and highlighted areas where high-quality evidence is required to inform best practices in perioperative brain health.
