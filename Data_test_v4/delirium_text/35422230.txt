35422230|t|The role of plant-based products in the prevention of neurological complications.
35422230|a|BACKGROUND: Neurological complications are most likely to be fatal and cause loss of ability to function or care for self. These include Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment. The main aim of the review is to determine the effects of various drugs and their cognitive risk with the need to opt for herbal therapy as an adjuvant in treating neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease with lesser-known side effects. The Methodology: Involved a detailed literature survey which was performed through an online database, such as Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, Cochrane, and PubMed. The study included randomized trials and original research conducted by herbal supplements on animal models to assess expression of upregulation of signalling pathways. Various studies involved in treating dementia, neurological disorders, Alzheimer disease, cognitive dysfunction were included. RESULTS: Found that various studies involved plant-based products were showing improvement in prevention of disease and signalling pathways with lesser-known side effects. CONCLUSION: It was observed that plant-based products play a major role in the prevention of neurological complications. Herbal medicines could most suitably prevent Alzheimer's risk with less known side effects in contrast with the existing treatment patterns. However, to improve the utility of herbal medicines, more evidences from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials need to be addressed.
