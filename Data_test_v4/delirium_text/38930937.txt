38930937|t|Synthesis and Isolation of Phenol- and Thiol-Derived Epicatechin Adducts Prepared from Avocado Peel Procyanidins Using Centrifugal Partition Chromatography and the Evaluation of Their Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activity.
38930937|a|Polyphenols from agro-food waste represent a valuable source of bioactive molecules that can be recovered to be used for their functional properties. Another option is to use them as starting material to generate molecules with new and better properties through semi-synthesis. A proanthocyanidin-rich (PACs) extract from avocado peels was used to prepare several semi-synthetic derivatives of epicatechin by acid cleavage in the presence of phenol and thiol nucleophiles. The adducts formed by this reaction were successfully purified using one-step centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and identified by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. The nine derivatives showed a concentration-dependent free radical scavenging activity in the DPPH assay. All compounds were also tested against a panel of pathogenic bacterial strains formed by Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644 and 19115), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Escherichia coli (ATCC 11775 and 25922), and Salmonella enterica (ATCC 13076). In addition, adducts were tested against two no-pathogenic strains, Limosilactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus UCO-25A. Overall, thiol-derived adducts displayed antimicrobial properties and, in some specific cases, inhibited biofilm formation, particularly in Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644). Interestingly, phenolic adducts were inactive against all the strains and could not inhibit its biofilm formation. Moreover, depending on the structure, in specific cases, biofilm formation was strongly promoted. These findings contribute to demonstrating that CPC is a powerful tool to isolate new semi-synthetic molecules using avocado peels as starting material for PACc extraction. These compounds represent new lead molecules with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.
