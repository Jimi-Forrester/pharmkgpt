20176329|a|The two main tyrosine kinases (TK) in the brain are p60Src and p59Fyn, expressed as specific isoforms (p60SrcNI, p60SrcNI+NII and p59fynB). They play a pivotal role in some major processes such as neuronal growth and myelinisation. Another member of this TK family was then reported in brain, the p56lck. Its name Lck (lymphocyte cell kinase) indicates its cellular specificity observed initially, so its presence in the brain was intriguing. But no further studies were performed to understand its role in brain until recent clinical studies on Alzheimer patients' brains. One study reveals a decreased p56lck level in the brains of these patients while another study shows an association between one peculiar SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) of the lck gene and some cases of the disease. These new data prompt us to reinvestigate the original biochemical data and to confront them with the present knowledge. This analysis suggests some hypothesis concerning both the Lck protein expressed in the brain (rather an isoform than the lymphocyte protein itself) and its role (to maintain the neuronal survival presumably by protecting them from inflammation, the main pathway that leads to neuron degeneracy).
