36283867|a|Traditionally, lymphocytic interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was considered to be a simple 'booster' of proinflammatory responses by microglia (brain-resident macrophages) during bacterial or viral infection. Recent slice culture (in situ) and in vivo studies suggest, however, that IFN-gamma has a unique role in microglial activation. Priming by IFN-gamma results in proliferation (microgliosis), enhanced synapse elimination, and moderate nitric oxide release sufficient to impair synaptic transmission, gamma rhythm activity, and cognitive functions. Moreover, IFN-gamma is pivotal for driving Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated microglia into neurotoxic phenotypes that induce energetic and oxidative stress, severe network dysfunction, and neuronal death. Pharmacological targeting of activated microglia could be beneficial during elevated IFN-gamma levels, blood-brain barrier leakage, and parenchymal T lymphocyte infiltration associated with, for instance, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.
