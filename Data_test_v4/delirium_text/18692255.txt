18692255|t|Prevalence of dementia subtypes: a 30-year retrospective survey of neuropathological reports.
18692255|a|We investigated the distribution of neuropathologically defined dementia subtypes among individuals with dementia disorder. The neuropathological reports were studied on all patients (n=524; 55.3% females; median age 80, range 39-102 years) with clinically diagnosed dementia disorder who underwent complete autopsy including neuropathological examination within the Department of Pathology at the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, during the years 1974-2004. The neuropathological diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 42.0% of the cases, vascular dementia (VaD) in 23.7%, dementia of combined Alzheimer and vascular pathology in 21.6%, and frontotemporal dementia in 4.0% of the patients. The remaining 8.8% of the patients had other dementia disorders, including combinations other than combined Alzheimer and vascular pathology. The registered prevalence of dementia subtypes depends on many variables, including referral habits, clinical and neuropathological judgments and diagnostic traditions, all of these variables potentially changing over time. This, however, does not seem to obscure the delineation of the major dementia subgroups. In this material of 30 years from Lund in the south of Sweden, AD by far dominated among dementia subtypes, while cerebrovascular pathology corresponded with the dementia disorder, either entirely or partly, in almost half of the demented patients.
