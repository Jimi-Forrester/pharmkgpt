25438579|a|In the current paper a review of the role of GSK-3b in mechanisms of learning and memory is presented. A regulation of GSK-3 by phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine sites and through Wnt signaling pathway by disruption of axin-beta-catenin complex is described. The data on participation of GSK-3b in regulation of NMDA-dependent long-term depression and potentiation, and the possible mechanisms of enzyme's influence through NMDA receptors and AMPA endocytosis are shown. A role of GSK-3b in development of Alzheimer's disease through inhibition of Wnt signaling parthway by beta-amyloid resulting in a strengthening of GSK-3b activity with further hyperphosphorylation of tay and formation of the neurofibrillary complexes are also considered. Behaviour of animals with knockout and overexpression of GSK-3b gene and effects of GSK-3 inhibitors in different behavioural models are also described.
