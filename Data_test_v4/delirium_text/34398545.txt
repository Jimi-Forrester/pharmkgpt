34398545|t|Postoperative Cardiovascular Surgery Delirium: Interrater Agreement Between Nurses and Clinical Nurse Specialist and Factors Associated With Prevalence.
34398545|a|PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to examine interrater agreement of delirium between clinical nurses and a clinical nurse specialist, determine delirium subtype prevalence, and examine associated patient, procedure, and hospital factors. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional design and a convenience sample of nurses and patients on progressive care units were used in this study. METHODS: Clinical nurse specialist data were collected on a case report form, and clinician and patient data were obtained from electronic databases. Interrater agreement of delirium prevalence was assessed by kappa statistic, and logistic regression models were used to determine patient factors associated with delirium. RESULTS: Of 216 patients, 23 had delirium; clinical nurses identified fewer cases than the clinical nurse specialist: 1.8% versus 10.7%; kappa agreement, 0.27 (0.06, 0.49). By delirium subtype, hypoactive delirium was more frequent (n = 10). Factors associated with delirium were history of cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.8 [1.01-7.7]; P = .044), history of mitral valve disease (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.31 [0.09-0.90]; P = .041), and longer perfusion time (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.7 [1.1-2.7]; P = .016). One factor was associated with hypoactive delirium, longer perfusion time (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.2 [1.3-4.2]; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Because clinician-clinical nurse specialist delirium agreement was low and hypoactive delirium was common, clinical interventions are needed.
