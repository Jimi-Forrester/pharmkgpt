Methods: This literature review examines the role of acupuncture in AD treatment. Results: Acupuncture can ameliorate AD symptoms through decreasing amyloid-beta protein, reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing the antioxidant system, improving neurogenesis, enhancing prosurvival protein, reducing proapoptotic protein, and regulating brain energy metabolism. Conclusions: According to various research findings, acupuncture may be a therapeutic choice for addressing AD that avoids the long-term side-effects caused by medical therapy.
