30321504|a|INTRODUCTION: Altered cell cycle reentry has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Denticleless (DTL) was predicted as the top driver of a cell cycle subnetwork associated with AD. METHODS: We systematically investigated DTL expression in AD and studied the molecular, cellular, and behavioral endophenotypes triggered by DTL overexpression. RESULTS: We experimentally validated that CDT2, the protein encoded by DTL, activated cyclin-dependent kinases through downregulating P21, which induced tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta toxicity, two hallmarks of AD. We demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinases inhibition by roscovitine not only rescued CDT2-induced cognitive defects but also reversed expression changes induced by DTL overexpression. RNA-seq data from the DTL overexpression experiments revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying CDT2 controlled cell cycle reentry in AD. DISCUSSION: These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and thus pave a way for developing novel therapeutics for AD by targeting AD specific cell cycle networks and drivers.
