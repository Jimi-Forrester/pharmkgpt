9915549|t|Microglia and Alzheimer's disease.
9915549|a|Microglia play a major role in the cellular response associated with the pathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease. As brain-resident macrophages, microglia elaborate and operate under several guises that seem reminiscent of circulating and tissue monocytes of the leucocyte repertoire. Although microglia bear the capacity to synthesize amyloid beta, current evidence is most consistent with their phagocytic role. This largely involves the removal of cerebral amyloid and possibly the transformation of amyloid beta into fibrils. The phagocytic functions also encompass the generation of cytokines, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and various proteolytic enzymes, events that may exacerbate neuronal damage rather than incite outgrowth or repair mechanisms. Microglia do not appear to function as true antigen-presenting cells. However, there is circumstantial evidence that suggests functional heterogeneity within microglia. Pharmacological agents that suppress microglial activation or reduce microglial-mediated oxidative damage may prove useful strategies to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
