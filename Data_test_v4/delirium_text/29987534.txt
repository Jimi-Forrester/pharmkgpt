29987534|t|A Review of Dementia with Lewy Bodies' Impact, Diagnostic Criteria and Treatment.
29987534|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies is one of the most common causes of dementia. It is not as common as Alzheimer's disease; the general public's awareness of the disease is poor in comparison. Its effects on caregivers and patients alike are not well known to the general population. There are currently no FDA-approved medications specifically for the treatment of DLB. Many of the medications that are approved for Alzheimer's disease are widely used in the treatment of DLB with varying degrees of success. Treatment of DLB is life long and requires a dedicated team of physicians and caregivers to minimize the degree of morbidity and mortality experienced by the patients suffering from the disease as it progresses.
