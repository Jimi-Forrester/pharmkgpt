Among the various subtypes of breast cancer, estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) is the most diagnosed. Estrogen upregulates cyclin D1, which in turn promotes the activity of CDK4/6 and facilitates cell cycle progression. To address this, the first-line treatment for ER+ breast cancer focuses on inhibiting estrogen production by targeting aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in estrogen synthesis. Thus, combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with aromatase inhibitors has emerged as a crucial treatment strategy for this type of breast cancer. This approach effectively suppresses estrogen biosynthesis and controls uncontrolled cell proliferation, significantly improving overall survival rates and delayed disease progression. This study aimed to identify compounds that are likely to inhibit CDK4/6 and aromatase simultaneously by using a structure-based drug design strategy. 12,432 approved and investigational drugs were prepared and docked into the active site of CDK6 using HTVS and XP docking modes of Glide resulting in 277 compounds with docking scores <= -7 kcal/mol. These compounds were docked into aromatase enzyme using XP mode to give seven drugs with docking scores<= -6.001 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the shortlisted drugs were docked against CDK4 showing docking scores ranging from -3.254 to -8.254 kcal/mol. Moreover, MM-GBSA for the top seven drugs was calculated. Four drugs, namely ellagic acid, carazolol, dantron, and apomorphine, demonstrated good binding affinity to all three protein targets CDK4/6 and aromatase. Specifically, they exhibited favourable binding free energy with CDK6, with values of -51.92, -53.90, -50.22, and -60.97 kcal/mol, respectively. Among these drugs, apomorphine displayed the most favourable binding free energy with all three protein targets. To further evaluate the stability of the interaction, apomorphine was subjected to a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation with CDK6. The results indicated the formation of a stable ligand-protein complex. While the results obtained from the MM-GBSA calculation of the binding free energies of the MD conformations of apomorphine showed less favourable binding free energy compared to that obtained post-docking. All these computational findings will provide better structural insight for the development of CDK4/6 and aromatase multi-target inhibitors.
