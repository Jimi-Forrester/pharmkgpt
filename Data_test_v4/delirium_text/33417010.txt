33417010|t|Clinical utility of brain computed tomography in prediction of post-stroke delirium.
33417010|a|Delirium is a common and serious complication of stroke. Early prediction of delirium is important for preventive strategies and close monitoring of high-risk patients. Pre-existing degenerative and vascular changes in the brain could predispose to delirium. We aimed to determine if computed tomography (CT)-based indices could provide additional information about a risk of stroke-associated delirium beyond easiest-to-access clinical predictors. Using semi-quantitative scales (global cortical atrophy, age-related white matter changes, and Scheltens scale), we assessed global and regional brain atrophy and white matter changes in 88 stroke patients with delirium and 142 patients without delirium matched for age and stroke severity. Patients with delirium had greater global and local brain atrophy (the right temporal region, the left parieto-occipital region, the right frontal and occipital horn, and the right and left temporal horn) than patients without delirium. Scores of white matter changes did not differ between groups with exception of greater white matter damage in the right parieto-occipital area in patients with delirium. The discriminatory properties of studied radiological indices were modest (areas under receiver operator curves: 0.58-0.64). CT-based indices of brain atrophy and white matter changes do not provide additional information about a risk of post-stroke delirium beyond the most important clinical predictors.
