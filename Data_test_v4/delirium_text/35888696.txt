35888696|t|Trans- and Multigenerational Maternal Social Isolation Stress Programs the Blood Plasma Metabolome in the F3 Generation.
35888696|a|Metabolic risk factors are among the most common causes of noncommunicable diseases, and stress critically contributes to metabolic risk. In particular, social isolation during pregnancy may represent a salient stressor that affects offspring metabolic health, with potentially adverse consequences for future generations. Here, we used proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy to analyze the blood plasma metabolomes of the third filial (F3) generation of rats born to lineages that experienced either transgenerational or multigenerational maternal social isolation stress. We show that maternal social isolation induces distinct and robust metabolic profiles in the blood plasma of adult F3 offspring, which are characterized by critical switches in energy metabolism, such as upregulated formate and creatine phosphate metabolisms and downregulated glucose metabolism. Both trans- and multigenerational stress altered plasma metabolomic profiles in adult offspring when compared to controls. Social isolation stress increasingly affected pathways involved in energy metabolism and protein biosynthesis, particularly in branched-chain amino acid synthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (lactate, citrate), muscle performance (alanine, creatine phosphate), and immunoregulation (serine, threonine). Levels of creatine phosphate, leucine, and isoleucine were associated with changes in anxiety-like behaviours in open field exploration. The findings reveal the metabolic underpinnings of epigenetically heritable diseases and suggest that even remote maternal social stress may become a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, and adverse mental health outcomes. Metabolomic signatures of transgenerational stress may aid in the risk prediction and early diagnosis of non-communicable diseases in precision medicine approaches.
