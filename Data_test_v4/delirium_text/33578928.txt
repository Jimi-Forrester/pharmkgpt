33578928|t|Association Between PM2.5 Exposure Level and Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma in Taiwanese Adults: A Nested Case-Control Study.
33578928|a|Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma. However, little is known about POAG in adults and exposure to air pollution. The current study aims to investigate whether exposure to particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of <=2.5 mum (PM2.5) is associated with POAG diagnosis. Patient data were obtained from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010 (LHID2010) of Taiwan for the 2008-2013 period. PM2.5 concentration data, collected from the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Network established by the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan, were categorized into four groups according to World Health Organization (WHO) exposure standards for PM2.5. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for risk factors for POAG with logistic regression. The OR of per WHO standard level increase was 1.193 (95% CI 1.050-1.356). Compared with the normal level, the OR of WHO 2.0 level was 1.668 (95% CI 1.045-2.663, P < 0.05). After excluding confounding risk factors for POAG in this study, we determined that increased PM2.5 exposure is related to POAG risk (ORs > 1, P < 0.05). In this study, PM2.5 was an independent factor associated with open-angle glaucoma. Further research is required to better understand the mechanisms connecting PM2.5 and open-angle glaucoma.
