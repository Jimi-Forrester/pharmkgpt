34515756|a|Cerebral small vessel disease is one of the most common causes of cognitive decline and stroke. While several lines of evidence have established a relationship between inflammation and cerebrovascular pathology, the mechanistic link has not yet been elucidated. Recent studies suggest activation of immune mediators, including the soluble form of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), may be critical regulators. In this study, we compared the plasma levels of soluble TREM2 and its correlations with neuroimaging markers and cerebral amyloid load in 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 66 survivors of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage with cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertensive small vessel disease, two of the most common types of sporadic small vessel disease. We performed brain MRI and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B PET for all participants to evaluate radiological small vessel disease markers and cerebral amyloid burden, and 18F-T807 PET in a subgroup of patients to evaluate cortical tau pathology. Plasma soluble TREM2 levels were comparable between patients with Alzheimer's disease and small vessel disease (P = 0.690). In patients with small vessel disease, plasma soluble TREM2 was significantly associated with white matter hyperintensity volume (P < 0.001), but not with cerebral amyloid load. Among patients with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, plasma soluble TREM2 was independently associated with a tau-positive scan (P = 0.001) and white matter hyperintensity volume (P = 0.013), but not amyloid load (P = 0.221). Our results indicate plasma soluble TREM2 is associated with white matter hyperintensity independent of amyloid and tau pathology. These findings highlight the potential utility of plasma soluble TREM2 as a strong predictive marker for small vessel disease-related white matter injury and hold clinical implications for targeting the innate immune response when treating this disease.
