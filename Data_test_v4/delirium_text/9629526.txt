9629526|t|Psychopathologic and functional outcome in the treatment of elderly inpatients with depressive disorders, dementia, delirium and psychoses.
9629526|a|The objectives of this report were to investigate the functional implications and the possible rehabilitation potentials of dementia, delirium, and psychosis in elderly inpatients, compared with that in depression. During 1 year, all patients in a psychogeriatric university clinic were assessed on admission and at discharge with a selection of rating scales and diagnosed according to ICD-10 by consultants with no knowledge of the results of the ratings. All patients who had a principal diagnosis of major depression, dementia, delirium, or a psychosis are discussed. Ratings were made for psychopathology, behavioral disorders, depressive statements, intellectual functioning, activities of daily living, and gait. Depressive and delirious patients improved their status significantly (p < or = .03) in all six assessments, and patients with dementia improved their psychopathology status (p = .002), but the other assessments were unchanged. Results from the small sample (n = 8) of psychotic patients were mainly inconclusive, but there was a tendency for improvement with respect to psychopathology and gait.
