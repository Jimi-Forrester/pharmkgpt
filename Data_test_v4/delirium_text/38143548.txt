38143548|t|Efficacy and Safety of Psychedelics in Treating Anxiety Disorders.
38143548|a|Background: Anxiety disorders are commonly diagnosed and cause substantial functional impairment. A mixture of pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments currently exists, but these treatments are not always tolerable and effective. For patients with anxiety resistant to standard therapy, psychedelics may be a promising alternative. This review assesses the therapeutic benefits and safety of psychedelics in treating anxiety disorders. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and CINAHL for clinical trials investigating psychedelics in patients with clinician-diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and anxiety attributable to another medical condition. We analyzed data from 9 independent psychedelic-assisted trials testing ayahuasca (1 study), ketamine (4 studies), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (2 studies), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (1 study), and psilocybin (1 study). Efficacy was assessed by measuring the change in outcome measures and the quality of life from baseline. Results: The reviewed studies demonstrated encouraging efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms, increasing self-perception, and increasing social function in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or anxiety attributable to another medical condition while establishing feasibility and evidence of safety. For many patients, the therapeutic effects of the psychedelic treatment lasted weeks, and no severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Based on the evidence of symptom reduction and safety, the current literature (2011 to 2021) shows that psychedelics could be considered for treating clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorders. Psychedelics may provide an alternative therapeutic option for patients resistant to current standard treatments.
