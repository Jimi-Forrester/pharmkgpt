26557134|t|Effects of a Multicomponent Exercise Program on Spatiotemporal Gait Parameters, Risk of Falling and Physical Activity in Dementia Patients.
26557134|a|BACKGROUND: Exercise programs are presumed to rehabilitate gait disorders and to reduce the risk of falling in dementia patients. This study aimed to analyze the specific effects of multicomponent exercise on gait disorders and to determine the association between gait impairments and the risk of falling in dementia patients before and after intervention. METHODS: We conducted an 8-week multicomponent exercise program in 16 dementia patients (age 86.7 +- 5.4 years). All participants were assessed several times for gait analysis (Locometrix ), Tinetti score and physical activity (Body Media SenseWear  Pro armband). RESULTS: After 8 weeks of the exercise program, the mean gait speed was 0.12 m/s faster than before the intervention (0.55 +- 0.17 vs. 0.67 +- 0.14 m/s). The multicomponent exercise program improved gait performance and Tinetti score (p < 0.05). Gait performance (gait speed, stride length) was correlated with the Tinetti score (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Analysis of spatiotemporal gait parameters using an accelerometer method provided a quick and easy tool to estimate the benefits of an exercise program and the risk of falling.
