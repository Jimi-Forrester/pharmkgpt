35011539|a|At high altitudes, drops in oxygen concentration result in the creation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which cause a variety of health concerns. We addressed these health concerns and reported the synthesis, characterization, and biological activities of a series of 10 oxoquinolines. N-Aryl-7-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoquinoline-1(2H)carboxamides (5a-j) were accessed in two steps under ultrasonicated irradiation, as per the reported method. The anticancer activity was tested at 10 microM against a total of 5 dozen cancer cell lines obtained from nine distinct panels, as per the National Cancer Institute (NCI US) protocol. The compounds 5a (TK-10 (renal cancer); %GI = 82.90) and 5j (CCRF-CEM (Leukemia); %GI = 58.61) showed the most promising anticancer activity. Compound 5a also demonstrated promising DPPH free radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 14.16 +- 0.42 microM. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and carbonic anhydrase (CA), two prospective cancer inhibitor targets, were used in the molecular docking studies. Molecular docking studies of ligand 5a (docking score = -8.839) against the active site of EGFR revealed two H-bond interactions with the residues Asp855 and Thr854, whereas ligand 5a (docking = -5.337) interacted with three H-bond with the residues Gln92, Gln67, and Thr200 against the active site CA. The reported compounds exhibited significant anticancer and antioxidant activities, as well as displayed significant inhibition against cancer targets, EGFR and CA, in the molecular docking studies. The current discovery may aid in the development of novel compounds for the treatment of cancer and oxidative stress, and other high altitude-related disorders.
