38330850|a|Although neuroinflammation is a significant pathogenic feature of many neurologic disorders, its precise function in-vivo is still not completely known. PET imaging enables the longitudinal examination, quantification, and tracking of different neuroinflammation biomarkers in living subjects. Particularly, PET imaging of Microglia, specialised dynamic immune cells crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis in central nervous system (CNS), is crucial for staging the neuroinflammation. Colony Stimulating Factor- 1 Receptor (CSF-1R) PET imaging is a novel method for the quantification of neuroinflammation. CSF-1R is mainly expressed on microglia, and neurodegenerative disorders greatly up-regulate its expression. The present review primarily focuses on the development, pros and cons of all the CSF-1R PET tracers reported for neuroinflammation imaging. Apart from neuroinflammation imaging, CSF-1R inhibitors are also reported for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a prevalent, advancing, and fatal neurodegenerative condition that have the characteristic feature of persistent neuroinflammation and primarily affects the elderly. The aetiology of AD is profoundly influenced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and microglial dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests that CSF-1R inhibitors (CSF-1Ri) can be helpful in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. This review article also summarises the most recent developments of CSF-1Ri-based therapy for AD.
