39669604|a|Purpose: Although chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, it is highly relevant in the pathogenicity of both cancer and congenital diseases, including Alzheimer disease and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). In addition, cases with rare structural variants (SVs) of chromosome 21 have been reported. These events vary in size and include large chromosomal events, such as ring chromosomes and small partial aneuploidies. The p-arm of the acrocentric chromosome 21 was devoid of reference genomic sequence in GRCh37 and GRCh38, which hampered our ability to solve genomic rearrangements and find the mechanism of formation of disease-causing SVs. We hypothesize that conserved satellite structures and segmental duplications located on the p-arm play an important role in the formation of complex SVs involving chromosome 21. Methods: Three cases with complex chromosome 21 rearrangements were studied with a combination of short-read and long-read genome sequencing, as well as optical genome mapping. The data were aligned to the T2T-CHM13 assembly. Results: We were able to resolve all 3 complex chromosome 21 rearrangements in which 15, 8, and 26 breakpoints were identified, respectively. By comparing the identified SV breakpoints, we were able to pinpoint a region between 21p13 and 21p12 that appears to be frequently involved in chromosome 21 rearrangements. Importantly, we observed acrocentric satellite DNA at several breakpoint junctions suggesting an important role for those elements in the formation of complex SVs. Conclusion: Taken together, our results provide further insights into the architecture and underlying mechanisms of complex rearrangements on acrocentric chromosomes.
