39119464|a|Background: The bulbs of Allium sativum are widely used as food or seasoning (garlic), while they have also been utilized as a famous traditional medicine since ancient eras for the treatment of scabies, tuberculosis, pertussis, diarrhea and dysentery, etc. However, very few studies focus on their abundant aerial parts, which are normally discarded during the harvest season. Methods: The hyperlipidemic mice model has been used to study the lipid-lowering effect of the aerial parts in this article. 180 mice were randomly divided into 18 groups, including blank control (BC), model (Mod), positive control (PC), and low-, medium-, and high-dose groups of the crude extract, petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and residual water extracts (corresponding to CE, PEE, EAE, NBE, WE), with 10 mice in each group. The preventive effects of the extracts on hyperlipidemic mice lasted for four weeks. Ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) were used to analyze the chemical components of NBE and PEE respectively. Results: The results of the mice experiment showed that n-butanol extract (NBE) and petroleum ether extract (PEE) from the aerial parts could significantly reduce the contents of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in serum of hyperlipidemic mice, and increase the contents of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). They could enhance the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and reduce the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). At the same time, they could improve steatosis and inflammation of liver cells. The results of phytochemical components analysis showed that NBE was rich in organic acids, flavonoids and nitrogen-containing constituents, while PEE contained organic sulfur compounds, aliphatic acids and derivatives, alkaloids, phytosterols, etc. Conclusion: These results support that the aerial parts of A. sativum are an interesting source of bioactive ingredients that may be useful in the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia.
