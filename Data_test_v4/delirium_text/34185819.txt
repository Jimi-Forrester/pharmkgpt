34185819|a|OBJECTIVE: To screen for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) biomarkers, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-labeled quantitative proteomics assay was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). METHOD: The iTRAQ technique was applied to compare DEPs in the serum of a CIH rat model and control group. Biological analysis of DEPs was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia to explore related biological functions and signaling pathways. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to validate their expression in sera from patients with OSA and CIH rats. RESULTS: Twenty-three DEPs (fold change >=1.2 or <=0.833, p<0.05) were identified, and two DEPs (unique peptides>3 and higher coverage) were further verified by ELISA in the CIH rat model and OSA subject: apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4, p<0.05) and Tubulin alpha-1A chain (TUBA1A, p<0.05). Both groups showed significant differences in the expression levels of DEPs between the CIH and control groups and the severe OSA and non-OSA groups. APOA4 was found to be upregulated and TUBA1A downregulated in both the sera from OSA patients and CIH rats, on comparing proteomics results with clinical results. There were two pathways that involved three DEPs, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (p<0.05) and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: APOA4 and TUBA1A may be potential novel biomarkers for CIH and OSA, and may play an important role in the development of OSA complications.
