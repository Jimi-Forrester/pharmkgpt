34619402|a|OBJECTIVE: With the exponential growth of literature on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we aimed to identify and characterize the 100 most cited COVID-19-related articles in neurology and neurosurgery. METHODS: In March 2021, we performed a title-specific search of the Scopus database using ("neurology" or "neurologic" or "neurosurgery" or "neurosurgical") and "COVID" as our search query term without date restrictions. The top 100 most cited English-language articles were obtained and reviewed. RESULTS: Our search yielded 9648 articles published from December 2019 to March 2021. Bibliometric analysis of the top 100 articles found that the most cited article had a citation count of 1741 and was the first to report on the detailed neurologic manifestations of the disease; Neurology had the most number of publications; the majority of the primary authors were neurologists, but 35% were from nonneuroscience specialties; the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, China, and Germany were the top contributors, with a combined total of 77%; most of the publications were correspondence or editorial articles; and most articles discussed the neurologic manifestations and complications of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the top 100 most cited neurologic or neurosurgical COVID-19-related articles published to date. This list can be used to identify high-impact studies that will help health care practitioners in clinical decision making and researchers in navigating key areas of study and guiding future research.
