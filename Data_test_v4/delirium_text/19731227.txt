19731227|a|Extracellular deposits of amyloid fibrils in the form of parenchymal plaques and cerebrovascular lesions, as well as intracellular accumulation of paired-helical filaments in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in selected neuronal populations are the main neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid fibrils composed of polymeric structures of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) concentrate at the center of senile plaques and accumulate in the walls of cerebral blood vessels, exhibiting extensive Congo red/thioflavin S staining. Intraneuronal NFT are composed of building blocks of aberrantly hyperphosphorylated species of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which accumulate in the perinuclear cytoplasm of vulnerable neurons in the form of paired helical filaments (PHF). This unit presents a variety of protocols for the isolation, biochemical analysis, and characterization of amyloid fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles.
