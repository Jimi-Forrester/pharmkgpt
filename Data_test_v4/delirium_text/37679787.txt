37679787|a|BACKGROUND: 17beta-Estradiol (E2) is generally considered neuroprotective in humans. However, the current clinical use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is based on the physiological dose of E2 to treat menopausal syndrome and has limited therapeutic efficacy. The efficacy and potential toxicity of superphysiological doses of ERT for menopausal neurodegeneration are unknown. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of E2 with a supraphysiologic dose (0.5 mg/kg, sE2) on the treatment of menopausal mouse models established by ovariectomy. We performed the open field, Y-maze spontaneous alternation, forced swim tests, and sucrose preference test to investigate behavioral alterations. Subsequently, the status of microglia and neurons was detected by immunohistochemistry, HE staining, and Nissl staining, respectively. Real-time PCR was used to detect neuroinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Using mass spectrometry proteomics platform and LC-MS/ MS-based metabolomics platform, proteins and metabolites in brain tissues were extracted and analyzed. BV2 and HT22 cell lines and primary neurons and microglia were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms in vitro. RESULTS: sE2 aggravated depression-like behavior in ovariectomized mice, caused microglia response, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as well as neuronal damage and glycerophospholipid metabolism imbalance. Subsequently, we demonstrated that sE2 induced the pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglia through ERalpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and downregulated the expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 in neuronal cells, which were important in the pathogenesis of depression. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that sE2 may be nonhelpful or even detrimental to menopause-related depression, at least partly, by regulating microglial responses and glycerophospholipid metabolism.
