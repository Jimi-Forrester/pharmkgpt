38998996|t|Morpholine, Piperazine, and Piperidine Derivatives as Antidiabetic Agents.
38998996|a|Diabetes mellitus is a severe endocrine disease that affects more and more people every year. Modern medical chemistry sets itself the task of finding effective and safe drugs against diabetes. This review provides an overview of potential antidiabetic drugs based on three heterocyclic compounds, namely morpholine, piperazine, and piperidine. Studies have shown that compounds containing their moieties can be quite effective in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of diabetes and its consequences.
