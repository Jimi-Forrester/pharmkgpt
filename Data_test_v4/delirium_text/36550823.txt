36550823|a|BACKGROUND: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, active controlled trial assessed whether a single preoperative administration of 40 mg of duloxetine could decrease postoperative pain and numbness after posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery (PLIF). METHODS: Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II undergoing PLIF were included. At 2 hours before inducing anesthesia, patients were administered 40 mg duloxetine or 4 mg diazepam (control drug). Postoperative pain and other symptoms were evaluated on the basis of a visual analog scale, amount of fentanyl used, fentanyl dose request times, rate of use of adjunctive analgesics (diclofenac sodium or pentazocine), and lower limb numbness score (0-3) during the first 2 postoperative days. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were randomly assigned to the duloxetine and diazepam groups (n = 23 each); 6 were lost to follow-up, and analysis was performed on data from 22 patients in the duloxetine group and 18 in the diazepam group. No significant differences were detected in the patient background, postoperative visual analog scale score at rest in the lumbar region and lower limbs, fentanyl use, rate of analgesic adjuvant use, or incidence of side effects. The numbness score in the lower limbs, however, was significantly lower in the duloxetine group. CONCLUSION: A single preoperative 40-mg dose of duloxetine did not improve postoperative pain after PLIF, but did improve lower limb numbness. Duloxetine may suppress neuropathic pain-like symptoms after PLIF surgery.
