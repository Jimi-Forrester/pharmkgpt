36050647|t|Disease- and headache-specific microRNA signatures and their predicted mRNA targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in migraineurs: role of inflammatory signalling and oxidative stress.
36050647|a|BACKGROUND: Migraine is a primary headache with genetic susceptibility, but the pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood, and it remains an unmet medical need. Earlier we demonstrated significant differences in the transcriptome of migraineurs' PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), suggesting the role of neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Post-transcriptional gene expression is regulated by miRNA (microRNA), a group of short non-coding RNAs that are emerging biomarkers, drug targets, or drugs. MiRNAs are emerging biomarkers and therapeutics; however, little is known about the miRNA transcriptome in migraine, and a systematic comparative analysis has not been performed so far in migraine patients. METHODS: We determined miRNA expression of migraineurs' PBMC during (ictal) and between (interictal) headaches compared to age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Small RNA sequencing was performed from the PBMC, and mRNA targets of miRNAs were predicted using a network theoretical approach by miRNAtarget.com . Predicted miRNA targets were investigated by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and validated by comparing network metrics to differentially expressed mRNA data. RESULTS: In the interictal PBMC samples 31 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in comparison to healthy controls, including hsa-miR-5189-3p, hsa-miR-96-5p, hsa-miR-3613-5p, hsa-miR-99a-3p, hsa-miR-542-3p. During headache attacks, the top DE miRNAs as compared to the self-control samples in the interictal phase were hsa-miR-3202, hsa-miR-7855-5p, hsa-miR-6770-3p, hsa-miR-1538, and hsa-miR-409-5p. MiRNA-mRNA target prediction and pathway analysis indicated several mRNAs related to immune and inflammatory responses (toll-like receptor and cytokine receptor signalling), neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, also confirmed by mRNA transcriptomics. CONCLUSIONS: We provide here the first evidence for disease- and headache-specific miRNA signatures in the PBMC of migraineurs, which might help to identify novel targets for both prophylaxis and attack therapy.
