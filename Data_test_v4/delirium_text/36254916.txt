36254916|t|Perioperative dexmedetomidine reduces delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: A prospective, single-blind, observational study.
36254916|a|Background: Delirium is a commonly seen complication of cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine, by its anti-inflammatory properties and other effects, can attenuate postoperative delirium. Aims: The aim of this work was to study the incidence of delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on the incidence of postoperative delirium in coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients. Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted on 180 consecutive patients undergoing off-pump or on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The patients were administered either intravenous dexmedetomidine (n = 90) or propofol (n = 90) after hemostasis was achieved, till they were ready for weaning from the ventilator. The Confusion Assessment Method was used to assess the incidence of postoperative delirium. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 25 (13.8%) patients developed delirium after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Sedation with dexmedetomidine was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative delirium (8.9% v 18.9% propofol, P = 0.049). Subgroup analyses showed reduced incidence of postoperative delirium in off-pump patients compared to on-pump coronary artery bypass graft patients (3.3% vs. 20%, P = 0.009 dexmedetomidine group and 11.6% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.047 propofol group respectively). The mean age of the patients who had delirium was significantly more (64.9 +- 8.1 years vs. 52.5 +- 5.8 years, P = 0.046) compared to those who did not have delirium. Conclusion: Administration of dexmedetomidine-based sedation resulted in the reduced incidence of postoperative delirium compared to propofol-based sedation in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
