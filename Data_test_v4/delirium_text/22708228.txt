22708228|t|Crack-ing the case: a patient with persistent delirium due to body packing with cocaine.
22708228|a|A 36-year-old male presented acutely with encephalopathy, following his return to Ireland from a visit to West Africa. Clinical findings included confusion, agitation and tonic-clonic seizures. Difficulties in weaning sedation prompted repeat urine toxicology screening at day 8, which was positive for cocaine. Work-up for a source of continued cocaine exposure led to the discovery of cocaine-containing packages in the gastrointestinal tract. An index of suspicion should be maintained in patients presenting with drug toxicity following cross-border travel.
