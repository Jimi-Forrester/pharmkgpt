38512682|a|Microglia are the resident brain macrophage cells that are involved in constant surveillance of brain microenvironment. In Alzheimer's disease, microglia get over activated upon the accumulation of Tau and amyloid-beta species in the extracellular space, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. Microglia phagocytose the extracellular Tau species by several mechanisms among which P2Y12 receptor-mediated internalization of extracellular Tau is recently studied. Extracellular Tau activates microglia and directly interacts with the P2Y12 receptor. Tau-receptor complex is then internalized followed by perinuclear accumulation and lysosomal degradation. Upon microglial activation by extracellular Tau, P2Y12 receptor is also involved in membrane-associated actin remodeling which has its key role in active migration and phagocytosis.
