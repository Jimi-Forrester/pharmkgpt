38954275|t|The neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations of Susac syndrome: a brief review of the literature and future directions.
38954275|a|Encephalopathy is part of the clinical triad of Susac syndrome, but a detailed understanding of the neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric profile of this condition is lacking. Existing literature indicates that cognitive deficits range in severity from subtle to profound. Executive function and short-term recall are affected frequently. Psychiatric manifestations may be absent or may include anxiety, mood disorders or psychosis. If psychiatric phenomena develop during the disease course, it can be hard to disentangle whether symptoms directly relate to the pathology of Susac syndrome or are secondary to treatment-related side effects. In this article, we review what is known about the cognitive and psychiatric morbidity of Susac syndrome and identify areas where knowledge is deficient. Importantly, we also provide a framework for future research, arguing that better phenotyping, understanding of pathophysiology, evaluation of treatments on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes, and longitudinal data capture are vital to improving patient outcomes.
