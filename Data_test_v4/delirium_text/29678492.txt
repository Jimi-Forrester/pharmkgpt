29678492|a|The high-mobility group A protein 1a (HMGA1a) protein is known as an oncogene whose expression level in cancer tissue correlates with the malignant potential, and known as a component of senescence-related structures connecting it to tumor suppressor networks in fibroblasts. HMGA1 protein binds to DNA, but recent studies have shown it exerts novel functions through RNA-binding. Our previous studies have shown that sequence-specific RNA-binding of HMGA1a induces exon-skipping of Presenilin-2 exon 5 in sporadic Alzheimer disease. Here we show that HMGA1a induced exon-skipping of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) gene and increased ERalpha46 mRNA expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. An RNA-decoy of HMGA1a efficiently blocked this event and reduced ERalpha46 protein expression. Blockage of HMGA1a RNA-binding property consequently induced cell growth through reduced ERalpha46 expression in MCF-7 cells and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen in the tamoxifen-resistant cell line, MCF-7/TAMR1. Stable expression of an HMGA1a RNA-decoy in MCF-7 cells exhibited decreased ERalpha46 protein expression and increased estrogen-dependent tumor growth when these cells were implanted in nude mice. These results show HMGA1a is involved in alternative splicing of the ERalpha gene and related to estrogen-related growth as well as tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
