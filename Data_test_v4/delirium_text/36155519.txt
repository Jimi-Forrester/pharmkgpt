36155519|t|Cognitive and Brain Metabolism Profiles of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Prodromal Alpha-Synucleinopathy.
36155519|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition. Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) can be associated with MCI (MCI-RBD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate neuropsychological and brain metabolism features of patients with MCI-RBD by comparison with matched MCI-AD patients. To explore their predictive value toward conversion to a full-blown neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: Seventeen MCI-RBD patients (73.6+-6.5 years) were enrolled. Thirty-four patients with MCI-AD were matched for age (74.8+-4.4 years), Mini-Mental State Exam score and education with a case-control criterion. All patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment and brain 18F-FDG-PET. Images were compared between groups to identify hypometabolic volumes of interest (MCI-RBD-VOI and MCI-AD-VOI). The dependency of whole-brain scaled metabolism levels in MCI-RBD-VOI and MCI-AD-VOI on neuropsychological test scores was explored with linear regression analyses in both groups, adjusting for age and education. Survival analysis was performed to investigate VOIs phenoconversion prediction power. RESULTS: MCI-RBD group scored lower in executive functions and higher in verbal memory compared to MCI-AD group. Also, compared with MCI-AD, MCI-RBD group showed relative hypometabolism in a posterior brain area including cuneus, precuneus, and occipital regions while the inverse comparison revealed relative hypometabolism in the hippocampus/parahippocampal areas in MCI-AD group. MCI-RBD-VOI metabolism directly correlated with executive functions in MCI-RBD (p = 0.04). MCI-AD-VOI metabolism directly correlated with verbal memory in MCI-AD (p = 0.001). MCI-RBD-VOI metabolism predicted (p = 0.03) phenoconversion to an alpha-synucleinopathy. MCI-AD-VOI metabolism showed a trend (p = 0.07) in predicting phenoconversion to dementia. CONCLUSION: MCI-RBD and MCI-AD showed distinct neuropsychological and brain metabolism profiles, that may be helpful for both diagnosis and prognosis purposes.
