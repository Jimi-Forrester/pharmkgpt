32892355|t|Hippocampal subfield pathologic burden in Lewy body diseases vs. Alzheimer's disease.
32892355|a|AIMS: Lewy body diseases (LBD) are characterized by alpha-synuclein (SYN) pathology, but comorbid Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is common and the relationship between these pathologies in microanatomic hippocampal subfields is understudied. Here we use digital histological methods to test the association between hippocampal SYN pathology and the distribution of tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in LBD and contrast with AD subjects. We also correlate pathologic burden with antemortem episodic memory testing. METHODS: Hippocampal sections from 49 autopsy-confirmed LBD cases, 30 with no/low AD copathology (LBD - AD) and 19 with moderate/severe AD copathology (LBD + AD), and 30 AD patients were stained for SYN, tau, and Abeta. Sections underwent digital histological analysis of subfield pathological burden which was correlated with antemortem memory testing. RESULTS: LBD - AD and LBD + AD had similar severity and distribution of SYN pathology (P > 0.05), CA2/3 being the most affected subfield (P < 0.02). In LBD, SYN correlated with tau across subfields (R = 0.49, P < 0.001). Tau burden was higher in AD than LBD + AD (P < 0.001), CA1/subiculum and entorhinal cortex (ERC) being most affected regions (P = 0.04 to <0.01). However, tau pathology in LBD - AD was greatest in CA2/3, which was equivalent to LBD + AD. Abeta severity and distribution was similar between LBD + AD and AD. Total hippocampal tau and CA2/3 tau was inversely correlated with memory performance in LBD (R = -0.52, -0.69, P = 0.04, 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that tau burden in hippocampal subfields may map closely with the distribution of SYN pathology in subfield CA2/3 in LBD diverging from traditional AD and contribute to episodic memory dysfunction in LBD.
