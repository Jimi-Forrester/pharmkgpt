36501311|t|Nutritional and Pharmaceutical Applications of Under-Explored Knottin Peptide-Rich Phytomedicines.
36501311|a|Phytomedicines reportedly rich in cystine knot peptides (Knottins) are found in several global diets, food/herbal supplements and functional foods. However, their knottin peptide content has largely been unexplored, notably for their emerging dual potentials at both the food and medicine space. The nutritional roles, biological targets and mechanism(s) of activity of these knotted peptides are largely unknown. Meanwhile, knottins have recently been unveiled as emerging peptide therapeutics and nutraceuticals of primary choice due to their broad spectrum of bioactivity, hyper stability, selective toxicity, impressive selectivity for biomolecular targets, and their bioengineering applications. In addition to their potential dietary benefits, some knottins have displayed desirable limited toxicity to human erythrocytes. In an effort to appraise what has been accomplished, unveil knowledge gaps and explore the future prospects of knottins, an elaborate review of the nutritional and pharmaceutical application of phytomedicines rich in knottins was carried out. Herein, we provide comprehensive data on common dietary and therapeutic knottins, the majority of which are poorly investigated in many food-grade phytomedicines used in different cultures and localities. Findings from this review should stimulate scientific interest to unveil novel dietary knottins and knottin-rich nutraceutical peptide drug candidates/leads with potential for future clinical application.
