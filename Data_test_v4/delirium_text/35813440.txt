35813440|a|Objective: To explore the application influence of dexmedetomidine (DEX) and dezocine in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery under general anesthesia and analysis of their roles in recovery time and cognitive function. Methods: A total of 120 patients who accepted thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection in our hospital from November 2021 to April 2022 were selected and randomly divided into group A (n =60) and group B (n =60). DEX combined with dezocine-assisted anesthesia was performed to group A, and the equal dose of normal saline was administered to group B, so as to compare their inflammatory influence level, brain function, arterial blood gas index, and cognitive function. Results: Compared with group B, group A obtained significantly lower intraoperative and postoperative inflammatory factor levels (P < 0.001), better postoperative brain function and arterial blood gas index (P < 0.001), and lower Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) scores after surgery (P < 0.001). Combining DEX with dezocine-assisted general anesthesia can improve the inflammatory factors level of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery and maintain their brain function and oxygen saturation, so that they have better postoperative cognitive function. Therefore, such anesthesia modality should be promoted in practice.
