21700583|a|OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship between postmortem precuneus cholinergic enzyme activity, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) binding, and soluble amyloid-beta concentration in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, [(3)H]PiB binding, and soluble amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42) concentration were quantified in precuneus tissue samples harvested postmortem from subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and mild AD and correlated with their last antemortem Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and postmortem pathologic evaluation according to the National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria, recommendations of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, and Braak stage. RESULTS: Precuneus ChAT activity was lower in AD than in NCI and was comparable between MCI and NCI. Precuneus [(3)H]PiB binding and soluble Abeta42 levels were elevated in MCI and significantly higher in AD than in NCI. Across all case subjects, reduced ChAT activity was associated with increased [(3)H]PiB binding, increased soluble Abeta42, lower MMSE score, presence of the APOE*4 allele, and more advanced AD pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Despite accumulating amyloid burden, cholinergic enzyme activity is stable in the precuneus during prodromal AD. A decline in precuneus ChAT activity occurs only in clinical AD, when PiB binding and soluble Abeta42 levels are substantially elevated compared with those in MCI. Anti-amyloid interventions in MCI case subjects with a positive PiB PET scan may aid in reducing cholinergic deficits and cognitive decline later in the disease process.
