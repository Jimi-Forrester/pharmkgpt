29920980|t|Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Subcutaneous Bapineuzumab: A Single-Ascending-Dose Study in Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer Disease.
29920980|a|This study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending subcutaneous doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Forty patients were randomized across 5 cohorts (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg; 8 patients each [bapineuzumab 6; placebo 2]). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher in pooled bapineuzumab cohorts (83%) than in the pooled placebo group (27.7%). Most common TEAEs in the bapineuzumab group were gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (bapineuzumab 17% each; placebo 0%). Serious TEAEs were observed in 7% of bapineuzumab-treated patients without any deaths or adverse event-related discontinuation. The median times to reach peak measurable concentration (Cmax ) of bapineuzumab were 14 days for 5-, 10-, and 20-mg cohorts, 11 days for 40-mg, and 7 days for 80-mg cohorts. The apparent volume of distribution of bapineuzumab was 134.29 to 204.68 mL/kg. The total body clearance was consistent at 10 to 80 mg. The average terminal half-life ranged from 26 to 46 days (5- to 80-mg groups). Exposure to bapineuzumab increased dose-proportionally from 10 to 80 mg. There was a positive correlation between Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve to the last measurable concentration (AUClast ) of plasma amyloid-beta, and between the Cmax and AUClast of serum bapineuzumab.
