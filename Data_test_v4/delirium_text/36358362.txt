36358362|t|The Role of Astrocytes in the Mechanism of Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
36358362|a|Recently, astrocytes are fast climbing the ladder of importance in cognitive-related diseases. Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common consequence of anesthesia and surgery, which is widely investigated in elderly and susceptible individuals. There is no doubt that astrocytes also play an irreplaceable role in the pathogenesis of PND. Reactive astrocytes can be found in the PND model, with an altered phenotype and morphology, suggesting a role in the development of the diseases. As a prominent participant cell in the central inflammatory response, the inflammatory response is unavoidably a crucial pathway in the development of the disease. Astrocytes also play a significant role in the homeostasis of the internal environment, neuronal metabolism, and synaptic homeostasis, all of which have an impact on cognitive function. In this article, we discuss the function of astrocytes in PND in order to establish a framework for investigating treatments for PND that target astrocytes.
