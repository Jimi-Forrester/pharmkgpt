33364931|t|The Role of Chronic Inflammatory Bone and Joint Disorders in the Pathogenesis and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.
33364931|a|Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant cognitive debilitation in tens of millions of patients worldwide. Throughout disease progression, abnormal secretase activity results in the aberrant cleavage and subsequent aggregation of neurotoxic Abeta plaques in the cerebral extracellular space and hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of structural tau proteins surrounding neuronal microtubules. Both pathologies ultimately incite the propagation of a disease-associated subset of microglia-the principle immune cells of the brain-characterized by preferentially pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and inhibited AD substrate uptake capacity, which further contribute to neuronal degeneration. For decades, chronic neuroinflammation has been identified as one of the cardinal pathophysiological driving features of AD; however, despite a number of works postulating the underlying mechanisms of inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, its pathogenesis and relation to the inception of cognitive impairment remain obscure. Moreover, the limited clinical success of treatments targeting specific pathological features in the central nervous system (CNS) illustrates the need to investigate alternative, more holistic approaches for ameliorating AD outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests significant interplay between peripheral immune activity and blood-brain barrier permeability, microglial activation and proliferation, and AD-related cognitive decline. In this work, we review a narrow but significant subset of chronic peripheral inflammatory conditions, describe how these pathologies are associated with the preponderance of neuroinflammation, and posit that we may exploit peripheral immune processes to design interventional, preventative therapies for LOAD. We then provide a comprehensive overview of notable treatment paradigms that have demonstrated considerable merit toward treating these disorders.
