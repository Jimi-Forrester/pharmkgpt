35807192|a|(1) Background: Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible brain disease, and current treatments are aimed at fighting cognitive decline. We have explored the feasibility of a game-based intervention for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease; (2) Methods: Six participants, five women and one man, were recruited from a day center to participate in a five-week study, which included a re- and post-evaluation with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and INECO Frontal Screening (IFS) tests. Three participants were assigned to the control group and three others to the experimental one. Both groups performed a play activity consisting of assembling a pie toy. Participants in the experimental group were asked to make a pie matching a sample after a time interval. Control group participants were asked to freely assemble a pie without the matching component; (3) Results: Patients were shown to be motivated during such an activity during the nine sessions. The experimental group showed a significant increase in IFS scores when comparing the post- and pre-intervention assessments. No significant differences were observed in MoCA scores; (4) The intervention created a social and emotional climate suitable to maintaining participants' satisfaction and motivation, as well as to developing executive function while promoting positive emotions.
