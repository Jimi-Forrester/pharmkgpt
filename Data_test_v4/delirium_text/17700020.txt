17700020|t|Reduction of phosphorylated tau during memantine treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
17700020|a|BACKGROUND: Memantine is a moderate affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated. However, no significant changes of phosphorylated tau levels in CSF are found at follow-up in studies with AD patients. It has been shown in vitro that memantine reverse induced abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in hippocampal neurons of rats. METHODS: Eleven AD patients were examined with cognitive tests and interviews of relatives. CSF analyses were performed before starting treatment with memantine as well as after 1 year. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction of CSF phosphorylated tau at the 1-year follow-up was seen, from median 126 (interquartile range 107-153) to 108 (88-133) ng/l (p = 0.018). No statistically significant differences of total tau or Abeta42 were found. CONCLUSION: The results may reflect effects of memantine on a key pathological feature in AD in line with previous in vitro findings.
