1791945|t|Amyloid angiopathy--a rare cause of intracerebral hemorrhage.
1791945|a|The cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), morphologically characterized by amyloid deposition in the vessel walls which are altered to rigid tubes, is a chronic disease of the cortical and meningeal vessels and can cause intracerebral hemorrhages (1.5% of all intracerebral bleedings). We report the course of five surgically treated patients with lobar space-occupying intracerebral hemorrhages and CAA confirmed by histological examination. All patients were elderly (74-84 years), in good condition, and self-providing before the hemorrhage. There were no signs of dementia of the Alzheimer's type. In four cases, CT showed a hematoma in the parieto-occipital, and in one case in the temporo-parietal, region. After surgical evacuation, two patients recovered, one patient remained in bad condition, and two patients died from recurrent hemorrhage within two weeks. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage of lobar localization in an elderly patient strongly suggests CAA. The prognosis seems to be poor in cases with recurrent hemorrhage, the other patients presented an uneventful course, comparable with patients operated on for intracerebral bleeding of other origin. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the prognosis of this entity.
