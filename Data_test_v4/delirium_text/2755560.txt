2755560|a|After a decade of intense study of cholinergic therapies for Alzheimer's disease, three conditions in this field are apparent: 1) The potential that cholinergic agents will ameliorate the memory dysfunction of Alzheimer patients (as 1-dopa benefits Parkinson patients) is still a stimulus for research. 2) Cholinergic neuropharmacology and its impact on the therapy of memory disorders associated with cholinergic dysfunction needs to be further characterized and understood. 3) While there is still a search for a symptomatic treatment for AD, the path to find a treatment for the Alzheimer disease process must first pass through a phase of basic research to find the cause of Alzheimer's disease. At the meeting, there was an undercurrent of concern that the cholinergic deficit is too severe to be treated, that the cholinergic systems are too complex to respond to a pharmacologic therapy and that too many other systems are involved in Alzheimer's disease for a cholinergic treatment to be successful. However, this concern was balanced by the evidence of basic scientific experiments which indicate that the central cholinergic system mediating memory can be positively manipulated in animal lesion preparations and Alzheimer tissue. Also there were reports that improved pharmacological approaches and psychological measures are being developed. It appears that Alzheimer therapy is at the stage that cancer chemotherapy was 20 years ago: the promising agents cause nausea without producing clear effects but the basic laboratory studies strongly suggest that substantial benefits are possible and several agents have shown encouraging results. Meanwhile, patients and scientists are becoming increasingly interested in the field.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
