35040140|a|This work chemically modified short linear glucan (SLG) by introducing a surface carboxymethyl group to obtain carboxymethylated SLG (CMSLG), then prepared CMSLG-based ternary nanocomplex particles based on electrostatic interactions with sodium-caseinate (NaCas) and pectin. These nanocomplex particles are homogeneous, generally exhibiting sizes of <200 nm with spherical shape and negative surface charge. In addition, the results showed the increase in both the mass ratio of CMSLG and NaCas and the synthesis temperature can improve the colloidal stability of nanocomplex particles when they are exposed to simulated gastrointestinal fluids containing digestive enzymes. Moreover, nanocomplex particles have an exceptional capability to encapsulate curcumin, and this encapsulation efficiency increased as the mass ratios of CMSLG and NaCas were increased. The study also investigated the antioxidant activity and in vitro release properties of curcumin encapsulated by nanocomplex particles and found that CMSLG/NaCas/pectin had improved higher ABTS radical scavenging capacity and allowed for the controlled, sustained release of curcumin in simulated gastrointestinal fluid within 6 hours. Thus, this study provides new insights into the design of a CMSLG-based ternary nanocomplex and its use as a potential oral delivery system for lipophilic bioactive compounds. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Curcumin, as a sort of natural polyphenolic compound, has many physiologic functions such as anti-oxidation, anticancer, and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. However, the application of the curcumin has been limited by its poor water solubility and unstable physicochemical property. To solve this problem, the nanotechnology has been used to prepare the nano-delivery carriers for curcumin. This work prepared a ternary nanoparticle based on the carboxymethyl short linear glucan, sodium-caseinate, and pectin. The ternary nanoparticle can achieve a higher encapsulation efficiency for curcumin. In addition, the ternary nanoparticle can enhance the ABTS radical scavenging capacity and provided control and sustained release of curcumin in the simulated gastrointestinal fluid.
