32246170|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of palliative care is to optimize the quality of life of patients with incurable advanced diseases. Adequate psychotherapeutic and psychiatric care is essential in this context. OBJECTIVE: This article presents the recommendations of the S3 guideline on palliative care for patients with incurable cancer with regard to psychotherapeutic and psychiatric contents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The guideline was developed under the leadership of the German Society for Palliative Medicine (DGP) within the methodological framework of the German Guideline Program in Oncology. Systematic literature reviews were carried out to identify relevant publications in the databases Medline, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and Embase. Based on the publications included and clinical experience, representatives of 61 professional associations developed and agreed on evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations. RESULTS: Out of the total of 15 chapters in the guidelines, four have a special reference to psychiatry or psychotherapy; they cover the topics depression, anxiety, delirium in the dying phase and dealing with the desire to die. These chapters contain a total of 71 recommendations, almost one third of which are evidence-based. In view of the regularly undetected psychological symptoms in patients with incurable cancer, an early assessment is recommended. Optimal control of physical symptoms and support in social and existential matters are general measures that should be provided in addition to non-pharmacological and pharmacological procedures. CONCLUSION: The guideline on palliative care deals with important mental issues that should be considered by all disciplines and professions. The need for research in palliative care remains high.
