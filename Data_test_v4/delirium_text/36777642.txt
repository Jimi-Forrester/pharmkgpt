36777642|t|Methods for the isolation and analysis of Abeta from postmortem brain.
36777642|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plays an initiating role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but only a small number of groups have studied Abeta extracted from human brain. Most prior studies have utilized synthetic Abeta peptides, but the relevance of these test tube experiments to the conditions that prevail in AD is uncertain. Here, we describe three distinct methods for studying Abeta from cortical tissue. Each method allows the analysis of different ranges of species thus enabling the examination of different questions. The first method allows the study of readily diffusible Abeta with a relatively high specific activity. The second enables the analysis of readily solubilized forms of Abeta the majority of which are inactive. The third details the isolation of true Abeta dimers which have disease-related activity. We also describe a bioassay to study the effects of Abeta on the neuritic integrity of iPSC-derived human neurons. The combined use of this bioassay and the described extraction procedures provides a platform to investigate the activity of different forms and mixtures of Abeta species, and offers a tractable system to identify strategies to mitigate Abeta mediated neurotoxicity.
