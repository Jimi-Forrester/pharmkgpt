20929546|a|BACKGROUND: The classic neuritic beta-amyloid plaque of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically associated with activated microglia and neuroinflammation. Similarly, cerebrovascular beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits are surrounded by perivascular macrophages. Both observations indicate a contribution of the mononuclear phagocyte system to the development of beta-amyloid. METHODS: Human CD14-positive mononuclear phagocytes were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood by magnetic activated cell sorting. After a cultivation period of 72 hours in serum-free medium we assessed the protein levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) as well as the patterns and the amounts of released Abeta peptides by ELISA or one-dimensional and two-dimensional urea-based SDS-PAGE followed by western immunoblotting. RESULTS: We observed strong and significant increases in Abeta peptide release upon phagocytosis of acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) or polystyrene beads and also after activation of the CD14/TLR4 pathway by stimulation with LPS. The proportion of released N-terminally truncated Abeta variants was increased after stimulation with polystyrene beads and acLDL but not after stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, strong shifts in the proportions of single Abeta1-40 and Abeta2-40 variants were detected resulting in a stimulus-specific Abeta signature. The increased release of Abeta peptides was accompanied by elevated levels of full length APP in the cells. The maturation state of APP was correlated with the release of N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that mononuclear phagocytes potentially contribute to the various N-truncated Abeta variants found in AD beta-amyloid plaques, especially under neuroinflammatory conditions.
