26336454|a|AIM: To investigate the relation between use of bone wax and postoperative sternal dehiscence after cardiac surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five thousnad three hundred and eighteen consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery between 1999 and 2009 were evaluated prospectively. Perioperative use of bone wax, perioperative data and outcome parameters were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to define independent risk factors for postoperative sternal dehiscence. RESULTS: Bone wax was used in a total of 1151 (21%) patients. Postoperative sternal dehiscence was detected in 88 (1.6%) patients. The postoperative sternal dehiscence rate was 1.4% in patients without bone wax and 2.5% in patients with bone wax (p = 0.001). The rate of bone wax use was 36.4% in patients with sternal dehiscence and 21.4% in patients without sternal dehiscence (p < 0.001). Independent risk factors for postoperative sternal dehiscence were defined as: age > 70 (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.1, p = 0.005), chronic obstructive lung disease (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5-3.9, p < 0.001), use of bone wax (OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.03-2.5, p = 0.03), nonelective operation (OR = 2, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4, p = 0.009), and body mass index > 30 (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.4-3.5, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that use of bone wax may be associated with increased postoperative sternal dehiscence after cardiac surgery. Thus liberal use of bone wax should be restricted.
