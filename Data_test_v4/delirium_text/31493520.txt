31493520|a|BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recently proposed an innovative model of care focusing on functional rather than disease-based perspectives, based on a construct of intrinsic capacity (IC). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze if low-grade inflammation (LGI) (chronically raised C-reactive protein - CRP) and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) were associated with variation in IC domains (mobility, cognition, psychological and vitality) and in a combined IC Z-score over a 5-year follow-up among non-demented, community-dwelling older adults at risk of cognitive decline. DESIGN: This observational study included 1516 subjects >=70 years (64.5% female, mean age 75.4 years, SD = 4.5), volunteers from the interventional study Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). Plasma CRP (at baseline, 6 and 12 months) and homocysteine (at baseline) concentrations were measured. LGI was defined as having >=2 consecutively CRP readings >3 to 10 mg/L between baseline and 12 months, and HHcy was defined as homocysteine >15 muM/L. IC domains were operationalized as follows: Psychological. Depressive symptoms evaluated by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); Mobility. Assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); Cognitive function. Examined by a Z-score combining four tests; Vitality. Based on hand grip strength. Outcomes were combined into a composite IC Z-score. RESULTS: IC Z-score decreased among groups with no inflammation and LGI after 5 years, but this decrease was more pronounced among the LGI group (unadjusted mean group difference: 0.09, 95%CI: 0.01 to 0.16; p = 0.032). Participants with HHcy also presented IC Z-score decreases over time. Combined conditions provided more pronounced declines, even after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: LGI and HHcy were both related with impairment on the combined IC levels among older adults after a 5-year follow-up. Identifying biomarkers that strongly associate with IC may help to settle strategies aiming to prevent the incidence and slow down the evolution of age-related functional decline and care dependency.
