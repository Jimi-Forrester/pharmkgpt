19997871|t|Humanin and the receptors for humanin.
19997871|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent dementia-causing neurodegenerative disease. Neuronal death is closely linked to the progression of AD-associated dementia. Accumulating evidence has established that a 24-amino-acid bioactive peptide, Humanin, protects neurons from AD-related neuronal death. A series of studies using various murine AD models including familial AD gene-expressing transgenic mice have shown that Humanin is effective against AD-related neuronal dysfunction in vivo. Most recently, it has been shown that Humanin inhibits neuronal cell death and dysfunction by binding to a novel IL-6-receptor-related receptor(s) on the cell surface involving CNTFRalpha, WSX-1, and gp130. These findings suggest that endogenous Humanin [or a Humanin-like substance(s)] may suppress the onset of AD-related dementia by inhibiting both AD-related neuronal cell death and dysfunction.
