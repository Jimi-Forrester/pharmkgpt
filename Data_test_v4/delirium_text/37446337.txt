37446337|a|The introduction of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies against Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of high importance. However, even though treated patients show very little amyloid pathology, there is only a modest effect on the rate of cognitive decline. Although this effect can possibly increase over time, there is still a need for alternative treatments that will improve cognitive function in patients with AD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the triazinetrione ACD856, a novel pan-Trk positive allosteric modulator, in multiple models to address its neuroprotective and potential disease-modifying effects. The pharmacological effect of ACD856 was tested in recombinant cell lines, primary cortical neurons, or animals. We demonstrate that ACD856 enhanced NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, increased the levels of the pre-synaptic protein SNAP25 in PC12 cells, and increased the degree of phosphorylated TrkB in SH-SY5Y cells. In primary cortical neurons, ACD856 led to increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2, showed a neuroprotective effect against amyloid-beta or energy-deprivation-induced neurotoxicity, and increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consequently, administration of ACD856 resulted in a significant increase in BDNF in the brains of 21 months old mice. Furthermore, repeated administration of ACD856 resulted in a sustained anti-depressant effect, which lasted up to seven days, suggesting effects that go beyond merely symptomatic effects. In conclusion, the results confirm ACD856 as a cognitive enhancer, but more importantly, they provide substantial in vitro and in vivo evidence of neuroprotective and long-term effects that contribute to neurotrophic support and increased neuroplasticity. Presumably, the described effects of ACD856 may improve cognition, increase resilience, and promote neurorestorative processes, thereby leading to a healthier brain in patients with AD.
