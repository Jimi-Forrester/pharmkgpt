37788180|a|Emergence delirium (ED) is a significant source of both short- and long-term negative effects in the postoperative pediatric population, most notably following otolaryngology surgeries with an occurrence rate of 17.9%. Gabapentin, a gamma aminobutyric acid agonist, has been used for enhanced recovery in adult patients and for the purpose of decreasing ED in some pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. This secondary analysis examined the effects of preoperative administration of gabapentin on the reduction of postoperative ED in pediatric patients between the ages of 3-18 undergoing elective tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The parent study randomized subjects to receive preoperative gabapentin vs placebo. Our chart review encompassed both objective and subjective measures to identify the incidence of ED. While we found no statistical significance between the treatment and control groups, there was a clinically significant reduction of ED behaviors in the gabapentin group. The limitations included nonstandardized intraoperative medication administration, small sample size, and the lack of a validated tool for documenting behaviors associated with ED in the immediate postoperative period. Based on the results of this analysis, further investigation is warranted into the potential benefit of gabapentin to reduce the incidence of postoperative ED in the pediatric patient.
