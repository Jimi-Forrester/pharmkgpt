39862841|t|Clinical and intracranial electrophysiological signatures of post-operative and post-ictal delirium.
39862841|a|OBJECTIVES: (1) Gain insight into the mechanisms of postoperative delirium (POD). (2) Determine mechanistic overlap with post-ictal delirium (PID). Epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial electrophysiological monitoring can experience both POD and PID, and thus are suitable subjects for these investigations. METHODS: POD was assessed daily after surgery. PID was assessed following seizures. Resting state data were collected following delirium assessments, during a control period, and during sleep. Slow-wave activity (SWA: 1-4 Hz) and resting state functional connectivity were compared between different time points and according to delirium status. RESULTS: POD was present in 6 of 20 participants. Post-operatively, SWA was globally elevated in all participants but highest in POD+ participants. POD+ participants exhibited altered functional connectivity compared to POD-. These differences persisted even after resolution of delirium. PID was present in 7 of 15 participants and was predicted by seizures involving prefrontal cortex. PID+ participants exhibited higher post-ictal SWA versus PID-; no differences in functional connectivity were observed. Post-operative and post-ictal SWA was comparable to sleep in some participants. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SWA may predispose patients to both post-operative and post-ictal delirium and may indicate overlapping mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE: Delirium treatments focused on SWA may be most effective for ameliorating cognitive symptoms.
