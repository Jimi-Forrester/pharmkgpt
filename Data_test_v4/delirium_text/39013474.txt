39013474|t|The Association of Dementia With Incident Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Older Adults.
39013474|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults with dementia commonly receive multiple medications and have higher hospitalization rates, elevating the risk of potentially inappropriate prescribing and in-hospital adverse drug reactions (ADRs). There is limited evidence examining ADRs in older adults with dementia during hospitalization. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the association between dementia and incidence of ADRs during hospitalization and to identify prevalent types of ADRs and medications linked to ADRs. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the SENATOR trial database, which was a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce ADRs in older inpatients with multimorbidity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1537 patients (47.2% females) with a mean age of 78.1 years were recruited from 6 European hospitals. METHODS: Sociodemographic data, functional status, cognitive status, clinical information, and ADR-related outcomes were extracted from the SENATOR database. Inpatients with dementia were identified based on prior International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), dementia diagnosis, receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or a Mini-Mental State Examination score <=24 at admission without concurrent delirium. RESULTS: Among participants, 392 (25.5%) were identified as having dementia. The proportion of patients with probable or certain incident in-hospital ADRs was similar between the groups with and without dementia (22.4% vs 25.4%, P > .05). However, in-hospital rates of probable or certain ADRs from 12 common categories were less frequently identified in patients with dementia compared to those without (19.4% vs 23%, P = .025). Major constipation (6.4% vs 9.9%, P = .03) and acute dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting (2.8% vs 5%, P = .03) were less commonly observed ADRs in patients with dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We did not observe an increased risk of in-hospital ADRs among inpatients with dementia. However, ADRs related to the gastrointestinal tract and identified by subjective symptoms were less frequently identified in this group. This study lays the groundwork for developing new tools for ADR diagnosis for older patients with dementia.
