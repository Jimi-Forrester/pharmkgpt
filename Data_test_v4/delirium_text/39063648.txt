39063648|t|The Current Role of Single-Site Robotic Approach in Liver Resection: A Systematic Review.
39063648|a|BACKGROUND: Liver resection is a critical surgical procedure for treating various hepatic pathologies. Minimally invasive approaches have gradually gained importance, and, in recent years, the introduction of robotic surgery has transformed the surgical landscape, providing potential advantages such as enhanced precision and stable ergonomic vision. Among robotic techniques, the single-site approach has garnered increasing attention due to its potential to minimize surgical trauma and improve cosmetic outcomes. However, the full extent of its utility and efficacy in liver resection has yet to be thoroughly explored. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review to evaluate the current role of the single-site robotic approach in liver resection. A detailed search of PubMed was performed to identify relevant studies published up to January 2024. Eligible studies were critically appraised, and data concerning surgical outcomes, perioperative parameters, and post-operative complications were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Our review synthesizes evidence from six studies, encompassing a total of seven cases undergoing robotic single-site hepatic resection (SSHR) using various versions of the da Vinci  system. Specifically, the procedures included five left lateral segmentectomy, one right hepatectomy, and one caudate lobe resection. We provide a summary of the surgical techniques, indications, selection criteria, and outcomes associated with this approach. CONCLUSION: The single-site robotic approach represents an option among the minimally invasive approaches in liver surgery. However, although the feasibility has been demonstrated, further studies are needed to elucidate its optimal utilization, long-term outcomes, and comparative effectiveness against the other techniques. This systematic review provides valuable insights into the current state of single-site robotic liver resection and underscores the need for continued research in this rapidly evolving field.
