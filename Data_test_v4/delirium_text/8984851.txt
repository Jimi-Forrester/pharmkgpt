8984851|t|[The concept of delirium in Spanish psychiatry (19th-20th century)].
8984851|a|The history of psychiatric knowledge in Spain can be divided into four differentiated periods (up to the eighteenth century; nineteenth century; first third of the twentieth century and the two final thirds). These four periods provide a framework within which theories about delusion can be explored. Spanish psychiatrists have not been very original. Nonetheless, some of them (Sanchis Banus, Lopez Ibor, Martin Santos, Llopis, Valenciano, Sarro or Castilla del Pino) have tried to make personal contributions to the subject of delusion that deserve attention. Their theories (and some others) are reviewed in this paper.
