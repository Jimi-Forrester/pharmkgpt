36017769|t|Mortality and Related Risk Factors of Fragile Hip Fracture.
36017769|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the mortality of patients with fragile hip fractures and assess the death-associated risk factors. METHODS: A total of 690 patients with osteoporotic hip fractures (age, 50-103 years) that were treated from January 2010 to December 2015 were enrolled and followed-up in this study and the clinical data were retrospectively collected. Three months, 1 year, and the total mortality were measured. Mortality-related risk factors were assessed including age, gender, surgery, the duration from injury to operation, pulmonary infection, and the number and type of complications. The mortality of each group was compared by chi-square test or corrected chi-square test for univariate analysis, and the factors with statistically significant mortality difference confirmed by univariate analysis were analyzed by binary logistic multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The 3-month mortality was 7.69%, the 1-year mortality was 15.60%, and the total mortality of the follow-up time was 24.06%. The 1-year and total mortality during the follow-up of the patients were higher in the >75-year-old group than those in the <=75-year-old group (p = 0.000, respectively); were higher in the male patients than that in the female patients (p = 0.042; p = 0.017, respectively); were significantly lower in the operation group than that in the non-operation group (p = 0.000, respectively); were significantly lower in the patients that underwent the operation in <=5 days than the patients that underwent the operation within >5 days (p = 0.008; p = 0.000, respectively); were significantly lower in patients with >2 kinds of combined medical diseases than those with >=2 kinds of chronic diseases (p = 0.000, respectively); were significantly lower in patients receiving anti-osteoporosis treatment than in patients not receiving anti-osteoporosis treatment (p = 0.000, p = 0.002, respectively). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors affecting mortality included advanced age >75-years-old (OR = 5.653, p = 0.000), male (OR = 1.998, p = 0.001), non-surgical treatment (OR = 9.909, p = 0.000), the number of combined medical diseases >=2 (OR = 1.522, p = 0.042), and non-anti-osteoporosis treatment (OR = 1.796, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Age, whether or not surgical treatment was performed, the number of medical diseases, and whether or not anti-osteoporosis treatment was performed were independent risk factors for 3-month and 1-year mortality in patients with fragile hip fractures.
