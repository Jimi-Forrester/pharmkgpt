18525132|a|The prevalence, morphology and pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD), recently termed vascular cognitive disorder (VCD), are a matter of discussion.VaD is suggested in 8-15% of cognitively impaired aged subjects. Its prevalence in autopsy series ranges from 0.03 to 58% (mean 8-15% in Western series, 22-35% in Japan). Neuropathology shows multifocal and/or diffuse lesions, ranging from lacunes and microinfarcts, often involving subcortical and strategically important brain areas (thalamus, frontobasal, limbic system), white matter lesions and hippocampal sclerosis to multi-infarct encephalopathy and diffuse post-ischemic lesions. They result from systemic, cardiac and local large and small vessel disease. Pathogenesis is multifactorial and pathophysiology affects neuronal networks involved in cognition, behavior, execution and memory. Vascular lesions often coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other pathologies. Minor vascular lesions hardly contribute to cognitive decline in full-blown AD, while both mild Alzheimer pathology and small vessel disease interact synergistically. AD pathology is less severe in the presence of vascular lesions. The lesion pattern in "pure" VaD/VCD) related to microangiopathies differs from that in "mixed dementia" (AD + vascular encephalopathy), often associated with large infarcts, suggesting different pathogenesis. Due to the heterogeneity of cerebrovascular pathology and its causative factors, no validated neuropathologic criteria for VaD are currently available, and a large variability across laboratories still exists in morphologic examination procedures and techniques. Further prospective clinico-pathologic studies are needed to validate diagnostic criteria for VaD and to clarify the impact of vascular lesions on cognitive impairment.
