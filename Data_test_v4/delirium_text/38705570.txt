38705570|t|Strategies to dissect microglia-synaptic interactions during aging and in Alzheimer's disease.
38705570|a|Age is the largest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder that causes a progressive and severe dementia. The underlying cause of cognitive deficits seen in AD is thought to be the disconnection of neural circuits that control memory and executive functions. Insight into the mechanisms by which AD diverges from normal aging will require identifying precisely which cellular events are driven by aging and which are impacted by AD-related pathologies. Since microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, are known to have critical roles in the formation and maintenance of neural circuits through synaptic pruning, they are well-positioned to modulate synaptic connectivity in circuits sensitive to aging or AD. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the field and on emerging technologies being employed to elucidate microglia-synaptic interactions in aging and AD. We also discuss the importance of leveraging genetic diversity to study how these interactions are shaped across more realistic contexts. We propose that these approaches will be essential to define specific aging- and disease-relevant trajectories for more personalized therapeutics aimed at reducing the effects of age or AD pathologies on the brain.
