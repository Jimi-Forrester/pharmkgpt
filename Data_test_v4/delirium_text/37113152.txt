37113152|a|Purpose: This study aimed to investigate potential biological mechanisms underlying cognitive function alterations in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients by integrating cortical morphology with peripheral cytokine levels and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and to offer potential insights for the early detection of T2DM-related cognitive impairment. Methods: This study included 16 T2DM patients with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of at least 26 points, as well as 16 healthy controls with normal cognitive function. The participants also completed the digit span test and digit symbol substitution test. Participants' serum levels of Interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and BDNF were also examined. Each subject underwent a high-resolution 3T structural brain MRI scan. Based on the aparc. a2009s atlas, we calculated the cortical thickness, sulcus depth, gyrification index, and fractal dimension for each participant using surface-based morphometry (SBM). Correlation analysis between cognitive measures, serum levels of cytokines and BDNF, and SBM indices were further performed. Results: The levels of IL-4 and BDNF showed significant group differences. In the T2DM group, the sulcus depth exhibited a significant decrease in the left transverse frontopolar gyri and sulci, as well as in the right pole-occipital; the fractal dimension showed a significant increase in the right posterior-dorsal part of the cingulate gyrus; and the gyrification index significantly increased in the left inferior part of the precentral sulcus and right triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between IL-10 levels and the sulcus depth of left transverse frontopolar gyri and sulci; a significant positive correlation between the sulcus depth of the right pole-occipital and the digit span test-forward scores, and a significant negative correlation between the gyrification index of the left inferior part of the precentral sulcus and the digit span test-backward scores among T2DM participants. Conclusion: T2DM patients without cognitive impairment displayed reductions in IL 4 and BDNF levels, as well as significant alterations in their SBM indices, indicating that prior to the emergence of cognitive impairment, the SBM indices, peripheral cytokines, and BDNF may have altered in T2DM patients. IL-10 may lessen inflammation-related brain edema and preserve sulcus depth in T2DM patients through its anti-inflammatory activity.
