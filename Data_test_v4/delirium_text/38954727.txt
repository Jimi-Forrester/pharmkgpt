38954727|t|Exploring the World of Curcumin: Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Applications in Nanoscience and Biology.
38954727|a|Curcumin is a bright yellow naturally occurring polyphenol which is the principal component of turmeric. It is used as herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, and food coloring agent. Over the years, the therapeutic properties of natural product curcumin have gone unexploited but not unnoticed. Curcumin cannot be employed as a drug due to limitations such as low aqueous solubility and limited bioavailability. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations by confining the drug in various confined media to enhance its bioavailability. The biomolecule is emissive and undergoes fundamental excited state processes such as solvation dynamics and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials are also a fast advancing field where curcumin is an intrinsic component necessary for formation of these materials and no longer added as an external free drug. In this review, we will summarise the recent research on the photophysical and photochemical properties of curcumin and its excited state dynamics in various bio-mimicking systems. At the same time we wish to also incorporate the various applications of curcumin, especially in biology. Lastly due to the growing importance of materials science, we will briefly discuss some recent advances on curcumin based biomaterials and nanomaterials.
