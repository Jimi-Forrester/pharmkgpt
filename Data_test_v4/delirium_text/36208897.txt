36208897|t|Spotlight on non-motor symptoms and Covid-19.
36208897|a|The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has profoundly affected the quality of life (QoL) and health of the general population globally over the past 2 years, with a clear impact on people with Parkinson's Disease (PwP, PD). Non-motor symptoms have been widely acknowledged to hold a vital part in the clinical spectrum of PD, and, although often underrecognized, they significantly contribute to patients' and their caregivers' QoL. Up to now, there have been numerous reports of newly emerging or acutely deteriorating non-motor symptoms in PwP who had been infected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), while some of these symptoms, like fatigue, pain, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment, have also been identified as part of the long-COVID syndrome due to their persistent nature. The subjacent mechanisms, mediating the appearance or progression of non-motor symptoms in the context of Covid-19, although probably multifactorial in origin, remain largely unknown. Such mechanisms might be, at least partly, related solely to the viral infection per se or the lifestyle changes imposed during the pandemic, as many of the non-motor symptoms seem to be prevalent even among Covid-19 patients without PD. Here, we summarize the available evidence and implications of Covid-19 in non-motor PD symptoms in the acute and chronic, if applicable, phase of the infection, with a special reference on studies of PwP.
