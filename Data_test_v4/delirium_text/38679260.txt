38679260|a|BACKGROUND: Targeted nanoparticles (NPs) are aimed at improving clinical outcomes by enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Curcumin (CUR)-loaded poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs (CNPs) were produced to demonstrate a prolonged release and successfully embedded into 3D printed sodium alginate (SA)/gelatin (GEL) scaffolds that can dissolve rapidly sublingually. Characterization and in vitro activity of the NPs and scaffolds were evaluated. RESULTS: Based on the in vitro drug release studies, 99.6 % of the encapsulated CUR was released in a controlled manner within 18 days for the CNPs. In vitro cell culture studies showed that all samples exhibited cell viability above 84.2 % and no significant cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells. The samples were analyzed through 2 different pathways by PCR analysis. Real-time PCR results indicated that CNP and CNP-embedded SA/GEL scaffolds (CNPSGS) may show neuroprotective effects by modulating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The gene expression level of beta-catenin slightly increased compared to the gene expression levels of other proteins and enzymes with these treatments. However, the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway was regulated at the same time because of the crosstalk between these 2 pathways. CONCLUSION: CNPSGS might be an effective therapeutic alternative for AD treatment.
