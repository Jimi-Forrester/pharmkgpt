38798505|t|A Novel Explainable AI Method to Assess Associations between Temporal Patterns in Patient Trajectories and Adverse Outcome Risks: Analyzing Fitness as a Risk Factor of ADRD.
38798505|a|We present a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method to assess the associations between the temporal patterns in the patient trajectories recorded in longitudinal clinical data and the adverse outcome risks, through explanations for a type of deep neural network model called Hybrid Value-Aware Transformer (HVAT) model. The HVAT models can learn jointly from longitudinal and non-longitudinal clinical data, and in particular can leverage the time-varying numerical values associated with the clinical codes or concepts within the longitudinal data for outcome prediction. The key component of the XAI method is the definitions of two derived variables, the temporal mean and the temporal slope, which are defined for the clinical concepts with associated time-varying numerical values. The two variables represent the overall level and the rate of change over time, respectively, in the trajectory formed by the values associated with the clinical concept. Two operations on the original values are designed for changing the values of the two derived variables separately. The effects of the two variables on the outcome risks learned by the HVAT model are calculated in terms of impact scores and impacts. Interpretations of the impact scores and impacts as being similar to those of odds ratios are also provided. We applied the XAI method to the study of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Using a retrospective case-control study design, we found that each one-unit increase in the overall CRF level is associated with a 5% reduction in ADRD risk, while each one-unit increase in the changing rate of CRF over time is associated with a 1% reduction. A closer investigation revealed that the association between the changing rate of CRF level and the ADRD risk is nonlinear, or more specifically, approximately piecewise linear along the axis of the changing rate on two pieces: the piece of negative changing rates and the piece of positive changing rates.
