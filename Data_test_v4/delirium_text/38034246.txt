38034246|t|Impetigo Herpetiformis Complicating Pregnancy: A Case Report on a Rare Gestational Dermatosis With Constitutional Symptoms.
38034246|a|Impetigo herpetiformis (IH) is a rare dermatosis that can manifest during the last trimester of pregnancy. It has the potential to cause fatality to both the mother and the fetus. After birth, it often vanishes spontaneously and rapidly. Clinically and histologically, it resembles pustular psoriasis, leading some authors to call it "the pustular psoriasis of pregnancy." Steroids were previously the treatment of choice, but treatment remains challenging. A dermatologist with experience in skin conditions during pregnancy should assess any generalized pustular psoriasis instances. There is a danger of stillbirth when a systemic sickness develops, so both the mother and fetus should be properly watched. A well-known side effect of pregnancy-related generalized pustular psoriasis is maternal sepsis. We report our own experience with a case of a 26-year-old pregnant woman who presented with IH that resolved postpartum.
