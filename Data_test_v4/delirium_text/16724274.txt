16724274|a|1. Recent research demonstrates the critical importance of neuroproteases for the production of peptide neurotransmitters, and for the production of toxic peptides in major neurodegenerative diseases that include Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's diseases. This review describes the strategies utilized to identify the appropriate proteases responsible for producing active peptides for neurotransmission, with application of such approaches for defining protease mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases. 2. Integration of multidisciplinary approaches in neurobiology, biochemistry, chemistry, proteomics, molecular biology, and genetics has been utilized for neuroprotease studies. These investigations have identified secretory vesicle cathepsin L for the production of the enkephalin opioid peptide neurotransmitter and other neuropeptides. Furthermore, new results using these strategies have identified secretory vesicle cathepsin B for the production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the major regulated secretory pathway that provides activity-dependent secretion of Abeta peptides, which accumulate in AD. 3. CNS neuroproteases that participate in peptide neurotransmission and in neurodegenerative diseases represent new candidate drug targets that may be explored in future research for the development of novel therapeutic agents for neurological conditions.
