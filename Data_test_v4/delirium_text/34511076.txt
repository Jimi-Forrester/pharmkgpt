34511076|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (PD), as an acute brain failure, is widely reported as a very common postoperative complication, and it is closely associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, malnutrition is reported as one of the risk factors for PD. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a simple method for nutritional evaluation. However, few studies have discussed the effectiveness of PNI as a nutritional assessment in predicting PD after primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The aim of this study is to investigate potential risk factors including PNI for PD following primary TJA. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 994 patients was performed to identify risk factors associated with PD after primary TJA by using univariate and multivariate analyses. A receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve were applied to evaluate the significant results of the multivariate analysis and the optimal cutoff value (CV). RESULTS: Postoperatively, sixty-seven patients (67/994, 6.7 %) experienced PD. Univariate analysis demonstrated that operative time, duration of anesthesia, age, hypertension, serum albumin, and PNI differed between the PD and non-PD groups (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the preoperative PNI (odds ratio [OR]: 0.908; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.840-0.983; CV: 47.05), age of patients (OR: 1.055; 95 % CI: 1.024-1.087; CV: 73.5 years), and hypertension (OR: 1.798; 95 % CI: 1.047-3.086), were independently associated with PD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A low preoperative PNI associated with malnutrition was demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for PD following primary TJA. Patients with preoperative low PNI should be cautioned and provided with adequate nutritional intervention to reduce postoperative PD.
