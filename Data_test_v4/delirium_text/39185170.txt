39185170|t|Quantitative 3D histochemistry reveals region-specific amyloid-beta reduction by the antidiabetic drug netoglitazone.
39185170|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the extracellular aggregation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in form of plaques. Here, we identify netoglitazone, an antidiabetic compound previously tested in humans, as an Abeta aggregation antagonist. Netoglitazone improved cognition and reduced microglia activity in a mouse model of AD. Using quantitative whole-brain three-dimensional histology (Q3D), we precisely identified brain regions where netoglitazone reduced the number and size of Abeta plaques. We demonstrate the utility of Q3D in preclinical drug evaluation for AD by providing a high-resolution brain-wide view of drug efficacy. Applying Q3D has the potential to improve pre-clinical drug evaluation by providing information that can help identify mechanisms leading to brain region-specific drug efficacy.
