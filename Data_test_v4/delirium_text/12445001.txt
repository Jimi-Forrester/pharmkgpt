12445001|t|Esophageal hernia in dementia: surgeon's role for mixed-type esophageal hernia in an elderly woman with dementia.
12445001|a|The mixed-type esophageal hernia is an indication for operation to prevent stomach volvulus and perforation. However, preventive operation is meaningful depending on the physical status. We encountered an 84-year-old, demented, bed-ridden woman of mixed-type esophageal hernia complicated with severe reflux esophagitis. First, the patient was conservatively treated by intravenous hyperalimentation and H2 blocker but, with onset of delirium, she removed the venous route twice. Subsequently, she was tightly restrained to the bed to avoid removing the line. Ethical deliberation for the patient tightly fixed to the bed and intravenous alimentation for her life prompted us to reconsider hernia operation after discussion with surrogate decision makers. The patient recovered uneventfully after operation, and movement without intravenous route or without any restraints was maintained by oral feeding assisted by gastrostomy feeding. In the coming decade, when senior patients are expected to increase, such operations can be forwarded to respect the patients' quality of life.
