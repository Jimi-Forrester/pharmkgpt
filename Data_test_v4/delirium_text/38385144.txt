38385144|t|Post-intensive care syndrome: Recent advances and future directions.
38385144|a|Post-intensive care syndrome comprises physical, cognitive, and mental impairments in patients treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). It occurs either during the ICU stay or following ICU discharge and is related to the patients' long-term prognosis. The same concept also applies to pediatric patients, and it can greatly affect the mental status of family members. In the 10 years since post-intensive care syndrome was first proposed, research has greatly expanded. Here, we summarize the recent evidence on post-intensive care syndrome regarding its pathophysiology, epidemiology, assessment, risk factors, prevention, and treatments. We highlight new topics, future directions, and strategies to overcome post-intensive care syndrome among people treated in an ICU. Clinical and basic research are still needed to elucidate the mechanistic insights and to discover therapeutic targets and new interventions for post-intensive care syndrome.
