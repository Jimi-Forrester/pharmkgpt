14640055|t|[Cholinergic deficiency syndrome as an indicator for the cholinesterase inhibitors].
14640055|a|Cholinesterase inhibitors are licensed for the treatment of dementia in Alzheimer's disease. In clinical practice, these drugs have little effect on the cognitive symptoms of dementia. Several studies report a beneficial effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on neuropsychiatric symptoms. We hypothesise that symptoms such as the impairment of attention and concentration, anxiety, restlessness and hallucinations, delineate a specific central cholinergic deficiency syndrome. It is postulated that this syndrome crosses boundaries of nosological entities and occurs in various neurodegenerative diseases. Symptoms resulting from cholinergic deficiency might be a much better target for treatment than cognitive deficits.
