35640460|a|Studying the correlation between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites and the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers may offer a window to the alterations of the brain metabolome and unveil potential biological mechanisms underlying AD. In this analysis, 308 CSF metabolites from 338 individuals of Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were included in a principal component analysis (PCA). The resulted principal components (PCs) were tested for association with CSF total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42), and Abeta42/40 ratio using linear regression models. Significant PCs were further tested with other CSF NeuroToolKit (NTK) and imaging biomarkers. Using a Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05, 5 PCs were significantly associated with CSF p-tau and t-tau and 3 PCs were significantly associated with CSF Abeta42. Pathway analysis suggested that these PCS were enriched in 6 pathways, including metabolism of caffeine and nicotinate and nicotinamide. This study provides evidence that CSF metabolites are associated with AD pathology through core AD biomarkers and other NTK markers and suggests potential pathways to follow up in future studies.
