34697549|t|A Clinical Study of the Effect of Estradiol Valerate on Sleep Disorders, Negative Emotions, and Quality of Life in Perimenopausal Women.
34697549|a|In this prospective study, we randomly divided 100 patients with perimenopausal syndrome equally into the control group (n = 50) receiving conventional treatment and the study group (n = 50) receiving estradiol valerate. The indicators observed were endometrial thickness, uterine volume, and the levels of LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and E2 (estradiol) of the patients before and after treatment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Anxiety/Depression Scale (HAMA/HAMD), Kupperman symptom score, and menopause-specific quality of life (MENQOL) were also applied to assess the sleep quality, negative emotions, severity of the condition, and quality of life of all patients, respectively. Our findings were that estradiol valerate is beneficial in improving serum sex hormone levels, sleep disturbances, negative mood, and quality of life in patients with perimenopausal syndrome and that its safety profile is high enough to warrant clinical promotion.
