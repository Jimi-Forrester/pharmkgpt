29225787|t|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: recent developments.
29225787|a|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare prion disorder that has been the subject of both professional and public interest following the identification of variant CJD as a zoonotic disorder. There have been recent advances in diagnostic techniques, including real-time quaking-induced conversion and magnetic resonance imaging brain scan, that have allowed more accurate case recognition in all forms of CJD. Although the epidemic of variant CJD is clearly in decline, prevalence studies suggest that it may be premature to be complacent about concerns for public health.
