35475066|t|A Case of Refractory Delirium Managed by a Multimodal Approach Using Atypical Antipsychotics, Antidepressants, and Benzodiazepines in an ICU Setting.
35475066|a|Delirium is an acute confusional state, most commonly observed in elderly patients admitted to the critical care unit. In most cases, early recognition, avoiding triggering factors and conservative measures are adequate for the management, but sometimes symptoms persist despite adequate medical care, which goes in the favor of refractory delirium. Refractory delirium has no clear-cut definition but it is discussed in some of the case reports and literature as the presence of symptoms despite adequate treatment without impairing consciousness. Management of such refractory symptoms requires careful evaluation to identify the cause and predominant symptoms, which further helps in choosing a better therapeutic regime. It is often difficult to manage such cases and require sedatives and anti-psychotics to reverse the condition. Atypical antipsychotics are now playing a prominent role in the management of refractory delirium, and the selection of a drug that is suitable for the patient profile with negligible side effects is of utmost importance. We are presenting one such case, with multiple causes for his delirium, with a predominant hyperactive state and the refractory symptoms managed by atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines.
