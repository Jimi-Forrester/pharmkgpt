33868957|a|Bacterial resistance is interfering with the action of antibiotics for clinical use in treating pathologies. The search for new substances capable of combating this resistance is necessary. An alternative to the search for these substances is in the extract of medicinal plants. Plathymenia reticulata, plant of the Fabaceae family, is a common tree species from the Brazilian cerrado, and is commonly used in areas of environmental degradation. This species is rich in phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids and tannins, compounds that are associated with various biological effects. A hydroethanolic extract from the bark of Plathymenia reticulata (HEPrB) was produced and then tests were carried out to verify the direct antibacterial activity, the modulatory effect of antibiotics for clinical use and their toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster flies. Through the analysis with UPLC, a wide variety of flavonoids contained in the HEPrB was observed. Direct antibacterial activity was observed for the standard strain of Staphylococcus aureus, however, the extract showed antagonistic activity or no significance in relation to the antibiotics tested in this study. As for toxicity, the HEPrB did not show significant damage in the proposed model. The results emphasize care when associating the consumption of teas with treatments with antibiotics for clinical use.
