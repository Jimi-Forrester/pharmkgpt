35327531|t|Putative Role of the Lung-Brain Axis in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19-Associated Respiratory Failure: A Systematic Review.
35327531|a|The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its related disease caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) has posed a huge threat to the global population, with millions of deaths and the creation of enormous social and healthcare pressure. Several studies have shown that besides respiratory illness, other organs may be damaged as well, including the heart, kidneys, and brain. Current evidence reports a high frequency of neurological manifestations in COVID-19, with significant prognostic implications. Importantly, emerging literature is showing that the virus may spread to the central nervous system through neuronal routes, hitting the brainstem and cardiorespiratory centers, potentially exacerbating the respiratory illness. In this systematic review, we searched public databases for all available evidence and discuss current clinical and pre-clinical data on the relationship between the lung and brain during COVID-19. Acknowledging the involvement of these primordial brain areas in the pathogenesis of the disease may fuel research on the topic and allow the development of new therapeutic strategies.
