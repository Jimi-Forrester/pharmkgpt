37628538|t|Effectiveness of Robot Interventions for Cognitive and Psychological Outcomes among Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment: A Meta-Analysis.
37628538|a|This review was performed to evaluate the effects of robot interventions on cognitive and psychological outcomes among older adults with cognitive impairment. Three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for studies published in English between January 2015 and August 2021. We included studies that involved older adults with cognitive impairment, interventions using robots, outcome measures related to cognitive and psychological status, and randomized controlled trials. Ten studies included in the systematic review, and nine studies derived from these ten articles were included in the meta-analyses. The meta-analyses revealed that robot interventions significantly decreased anxiety and agitation but exerted no significant effects on cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life. The subgroup analyses according to robot types revealed that pet-type robot interventions reduced anxiety and agitation. In addition, subgroup analysis according to the intervention format of robot interventions found that individual intervention was effective for improving agitation, but a group-based intervention was effective for improving depression. We suggest using robot interventions to improve psychological outcomes such as anxiety and agitation; however, further research is needed to determine whether robot interventions affect symptoms such as cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life.
