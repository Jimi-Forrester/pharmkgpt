35505713|t|Intrathecal Administration of Ziconotide as a Potential Treatment for Chronic Migraines.
35505713|a|Migraine is one of the most prevalent and debilitating illnesses globally. There are multitudes of treatment options available for migraines. One of the emerging treatment options for migraine, refractory to conventional treatment modalities, is the intrathecal Ziconotide. Ziconotide (Prialt, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, Ireland) enforces selective block of N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses. Ziconotide is proposed to have efficacy for chronic neuropathic pain, with a favorable lack of tolerance and chemical dependency. Few studies in the literature report the successful resolution of migraine headaches with Ziconotide. The authors report the successful use of intrathecal Ziconotide therapy for chronic refractory migraines.
