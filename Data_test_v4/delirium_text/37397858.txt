37397858|a|Introduction: Modern neurotechnology research employing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms within the so-called "AI for social good" domain contributes to improving the well-being of individuals with a disability. Using digital health technologies, home-based self-diagnostics, or cognitive decline managing approaches with neuro-biomarker feedback may be helpful for older adults to remain independent and improve their wellbeing. We report research results on early-onset dementia neuro-biomarkers to scrutinize cognitive-behavioral intervention management and digital non-pharmacological therapies. Methods: We present an empirical task in the EEG-based passive brain-computer interface application framework to assess working memory decline for forecasting a mild cognitive impairment. The EEG responses are analyzed in a framework of a network neuroscience technique applied to EEG time series for evaluation and to confirm the initial hypothesis of possible ML application modeling mild cognitive impairment prediction. Results: We report findings from a pilot study group in Poland for a cognitive decline prediction. We utilize two emotional working memory tasks by analyzing EEG responses to facial emotions reproduced in short videos. A reminiscent interior image oddball task is also employed to validate the proposed methodology further. Discussion: The proposed three experimental tasks in the current pilot study showcase the critical utilization of artificial intelligence for early-onset dementia prognosis in older adults.
