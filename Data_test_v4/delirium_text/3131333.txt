3131333|t|Alz 50, a monoclonal antibody to Alzheimer's disease antigen, cross-reacts with tau proteins from bovine and normal human brain.
3131333|a|Microtubule-associated protein tau from bovine brain reacted on immunoblots and on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody, Alz 50, which has previously been found to bind to an Alzheimer disease-specific antigen. The apparent affinity of binding of Alz 50 to tau was 2.1 X 10(-9) M on competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and it was in the same range as for Tau-1 (0.5 X 10(-9) M), an antibody raised against purified bovine tau proteins. Immunoblotting of trypsin-digested tau revealed differences between Alz 50 and Tau-1 binding sites. The binding of both antibodies to tau was not affected by prior treatment with phosphatase, indicating that the cross-reactivity of Alz 50 with tau is due to the presence of phosphate-independent epitope. This epitope then differs from phosphate-dependent tau epitopes often shared with other cytoskeletal proteins. Alz 50 and Tau-1 binding sites were present in all isoelectric (pI 6-8) and molecular weight variants of tau. In contrast, phosphate-dependent epitopes recognized by another tau-reactive antibody (NP14) were found mostly in acidic tau variants. Similarly to tau proteins from bovine brain, tau-enriched preparations from normal human brain contained Alz 50 and Tau-1 reactive sites in all isoelectric (pI 6.5-8.5) and molecular weight variants. Our observation of Alz 50 cross-reactivity with tau suggests a relationship between tau and the novel protein identified recently in Alzheimer brains.
