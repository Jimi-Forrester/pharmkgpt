38139084|t|Identification of a Gene Encoding a New Fungal Steroid 7-Hydroxylase and Its Functional Characterization in Pichia pastoris Yeast.
38139084|a|The hydroxylation of steroids in the C7beta position is one of the rare reactions that allow the production of value-added precursors in the synthesis of ursodeoxycholic acid and other pharmaceuticals. Recently, we discovered this activity in the ascomycete Curvularia sp. VKM F-3040. In this study, the novel gene of 7-hydroxylase (P450cur) was identified as being heterologously expressed and functionally characterized in Pichia pastoris. Transcriptome data mining and differential expression analysis revealed that 12 putative genes in Curvularia sp. mycelia significantly increased their expression in response to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The transcriptional level of the most up-regulated cytochrome P450cur gene was increased more than 300-fold. A two-gene construct with a candidate P450cur gene and the gene of its natural redox partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is interconnected by a T2A element, was created. Using this construct, recombinant P. pastoris strains co-expressing fungal P450cur and CPR genes were obtained. The functional activity of the recombinant P450cur was studied in vivo during the bioconversion of androstane steroids. The fungal 7-monooxygenase predominantly catalyzed the 7beta-hydroxylation of androstadienedione (ADD), DHEA, and androstenediol, whereas 1-dehydrotestosterone was hydroxylated by P450cur mainly at the C7-Halpha position. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a recombinant yeast capable of catalyzing the 7alpha/beta-hydroxylation of ADD and DHEA.
