36816550|t|The nomogram to predict the occurrence of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in elderly patients in the intensive care units: A retrospective cohort study.
36816550|a|Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a critical and common problem in elderly patients with sepsis, which is still short of efficient predictive tools. Therefore, this study aims to screen the risk factors and establish a useful predictive nomogram for SAE in elderly patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients and methods: Elderly patients (age >= 65 years) with sepsis were selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database. Data from demographics and laboratory examinations were collected on the first day of admission to the ICU. SAE was defined by two criteria in the presence of sepsis: (1) a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15 or (2) delirium. Differences in demographics and laboratory tests were calculated between SAE and non-SAE groups. Participants were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set without replacement at a ratio of 6:4. A predictive nomogram was constructed in the training set by logistic regression analysis and then validated. The predictive capability of the nomogram was demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curve analysis. Results: A total of 22,361 patients were selected, of which 2,809 patients (12.7%) died in the hospital and 8,290 patients (37.1%) had SAE. In-hospital mortality in the SAE group was higher than that in the non-SAE group (18.8 vs. 8.9%, p < 0.001). Based on the results of logistic regression analysis, a nomogram integrating age, Na+, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, heart rate, and body temperature were constructed. The area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram was 80.2% in the training set and 80.9% in the validation set. Calibration curve analysis showed a good predictive capacity of the nomogram. Conclusion: SAE is an independent risk of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients in the intensive care unit. The nomogram has an excellent predictive capability of SAE and helps in clinical practice.
