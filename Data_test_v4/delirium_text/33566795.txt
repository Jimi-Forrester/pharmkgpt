33566795|t|A 62-Year-Old Man with Acute Alcohol Withdrawal and Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy.
33566795|a|BACKGROUND Stress-induced cardiomyopathy is also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, and left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. Patients may present with chest pain and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes, but without coronary artery occlusion, and a reduced ejection fraction that may undergo spontaneous reversal if the patient receives appropriate hemodynamic support. This is a case report of stress-induced cardiomyopathy associated with alcohol withdrawal in a 62-year-old man. CASE REPORT We present the case of 62-year-old man who came to the emergency room on account of nausea and vomiting after a reduction in the daily intake of alcohol. He had no chest pain or shortness of breath but had new T wave inversions in anterolateral leads on EKG, elevated troponin, and apical wall hypokinesis with ejection fraction 40% on echocardiography. He subsequently developed active symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and was managed with intravenous Lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide. With the improvement in his mental state over the next couple of days, he had a coronary angiogram which showed no coronary disease. He was diagnosed with stress-induced cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to alcohol withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS This report describes a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, that was believed to be associated with acute alcohol withdrawal, with spontaneous improvement in the reduced left ventricular ejection fraction following medical support.
