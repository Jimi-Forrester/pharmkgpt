33860863|a|BACKGROUND: Although iron dyshomeostasis is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis, the relationship between iron deposition and non-motor involvement in PD is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated basal ganglia and extra-basal ganglia system iron contents and their correlation with non-motor symptoms in drug-naive, early-stage PD patients. METHODS: We enrolled 14 drug-naive, early-stage PD patients and 12 age/sex-matched normal controls. All participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to obtain the effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Deep brain structures, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, were delineated using the FSL-FIRST; the substantia nigra, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus were segmented manually. Inter-group differences in R2* and QSM values, as well as their association with clinical parameters of PD, were investigated. RESULTS: Substantia nigra and putamen R2* values were significantly higher in PD patients than in normal controls, despite no significant difference in QSM values. Regarding the non-motor symptom scales, PD sleep scale score negatively correlated with R2* values in the red nucleus and right amygdala, Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Autonomic scores were positively correlated with R2* values in the right amygdala and left hippocampus, and cardiovascular sub-score of Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for PD was positively associated with the QSM value in the left hippocampus. CONCLUSION: In this study, iron content in the extra-basal ganglia system was significantly correlated with non-motor symptoms, especially sleep problems and dysautonomia, even in early-stage PD.
