32341334|a|At present, therapeutic options available for treating schizophrenia are limited to monoamine-based antipsychotic drugs. Recent genome wide association study (GWAS) indicated a close relationship between immune system and schizophrenia. To leverage the GWAS finding for therapeutic strategy, we conducted a mechanism and effect study on application of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) with potent immune-modulatory effect in an animal model useful for the study of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia-relevant behaviors were induced by amphetamine administration (amphetamine-sensitized mice) and the effect of a single intravenous administration of hUC-MSC was examined in the amphetamine-sensitized mice. Schizophrenia-relevant behaviors were assessed by open field test, light/dark box, social interaction test, latent inhibition, prepulse inhibition, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test. Our results indicated that neuroinflammation along with peripheral TNF-alpha elevation is associated with schizophrenia-relevant behaviors in amphetamine-sensitized mice. In addition, hUC-MSC inhibited schizophrenia-relevant and the neuroinflammatory changes. The main mechanism of hUC-MSC was associated with the induction of Treg and production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in periphery. In vitro study revealed that amphetamine did not directly induce a neuroinflammatory reaction, while recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) increased mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, KMO, and IL-1beta in several microglial cell lines. Moreover, recombinant IL-10 (rIL-10) and MSC conditioned media inhibited the inflammatory response in rTNF-alpha-treated microglial cells. Assuming that hUC-MSCs rarely reach the CNS and do not remain in the body for an extended time, these findings suggest that a single hUC-MSC infusion have long-term beneficial effect via regulatory T cell induction and secretion of IL-10 in amphetamine-sensitized mice.
