34455147|a|Removal of moderately oxidized proteins is mainly carried out by the proteasome, while highly modified proteins are no longer degradable. However, in the case of proteins modified by nitration of tyrosine residues to 3-nitrotyrosine (NO2Y), the role of the proteasome remains to be established. For this purpose, degradation assays and mass spectrometry analyses were performed using isolated proteasome and purified fractions of native cytochrome c (Cyt c) and tyrosine nitrated proteoforms (NO2Y74-Cyt c and NO2Y97-Cyt c). While Cyt c treated under mild conditions with hydrogen peroxide was preferentially degraded by the proteasome, NO2Y74- and NO2Y97-Cyt c species did not show an increased degradation rate with respect to native Cyt c. Peptide mapping analysis confirmed a decreased chymotrypsin-like cleavage at C-terminal of NO2Y sites within the protein, with respect to unmodified Y residues. Additionally, studies with the proteasome substrate suc-LLVY-AMC (Y-AMC) and its NO2Y-containing analog, suc-LLVNO2Y-AMC (NO2Y-AMC) were performed, both using isolated 20S-proteasome and astrocytoma cell lysates as the proteasomal source. Comparisons of both substrates showed a significantly decreased proteasome activity towards NO2Y-AMC. Moreover, NO2Y-AMC, but not Y-AMC degradation rates, were largely diminished by increasing the reaction pH, suggesting an inhibitory influence of the additional negative charge contained in NO2Y-AMC secondary to nitration. The mechanism of slowing of proteasome activity in NO2Y-contaning peptides was further substantiated in studies using the phenylalanine and nitro-phenylalanine peptide analog substrates. Finally, degradation rates of Y-AMC and NO2Y-AMC with proteinase K were the same, demonstrating the selective inability of the proteasome to readily cleave at nitrotyrosine sites. Altogether, data indicate that the proteasome has a decreased capability to cleave at C-terminal of NO2Y residues in proteins with respect to the unmodified residues, making this a possible factor that decreases the turnover of oxidized proteins, if they are not unfolded, and facilitating the accumulation of nitrated proteins.
