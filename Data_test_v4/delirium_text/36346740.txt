36346740|t|Delirium as late manifestation of infective endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
36346740|a|More than one-third of the cases of infective endocarditis (IE) occur in older patients. The disease is often characterized by atypical symptoms. The incidence of neurological complications is high and represents a strong independent predictor of severe outcomes and mortality. IE is a rare but serious complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). A persistent delirium as a unique manifestation of post-TAVI IE in an older patient is presented in this clinical case.
