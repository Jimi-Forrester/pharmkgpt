38191694|t|Integrative Multi-omics Analysis to Characterize Herpes Virus Infection Increases the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease.
38191694|a|Evidence suggests that herpes virus infection is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and innate and adaptive immunity plays an important role in the association. Although there have been many studies, the mechanism of the association is still unclear. This study aims to reveal the underlying molecular and immune regulatory network through multi-omics data and provide support for the study of the mechanism of infection and AD in the future. Here, we found that the herpes virus infection significantly increased the risk of AD. Genes associated with the occurrence and development of AD and genetically regulated by herpes virus infection are mainly enrichment in immune-related pathways. The 22 key regulatory genes identified by machine learning are mainly immune genes. They are also significantly related to the infiltration changes of 3 immune cell in AD. Furthermore, many of these genes have previously been reported to be linked, or potentially linked, to the pathological mechanisms of both herpes virus infection and AD. In conclusion, this study contributes to the study of the mechanisms related to herpes virus infection and AD, and indicates that the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity may be an effective strategy for preventing and treating herpes virus infection and AD. Additionally, the identified key regulatory genes, whether previously studied or newly discovered, may serve as valuable targets for prevention and treatment strategies.
