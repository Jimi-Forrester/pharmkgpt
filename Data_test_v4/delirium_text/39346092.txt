39346092|t|Diagnostic test accuracy of screening tools for the detection of neurocognitive disorders in older adults post-trauma: A protocol for a systematic review.
39346092|a|Background: Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), including delirium, cognitive impairment, or dementia are prevalent in up to 39% of older adults in acute care, particularly older trauma patients. Undiagnosed NCDs result in poor outcomes, such as increased incidence of depressive symptoms, longer length of stay, and mortality. Objective: This study aims to identify the diagnostic test accuracy of screening tools for the detection of NCDs in older trauma patients in acute settings. Design: Systematic review protocol. Literature search: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library) will be searched for journal articles. Search terms related to NCDs, delirium and cognitive screening tools, and diagnostic accuracy will be included. Study selection criteria: Cross-sectional, prospective, or retrospective cohort studies of adults aged >=60 post-trauma, in an acute setting, will be included where the study aimed to validate a screening tool for detection of 1) delirium or 2) cognitive impairment, or dementia against a reference standard of a clinical decision, based on standardised diagnostic criteria or a validated tool. Data synthesis: Two review authors will conduct study selection, data extraction, and appraisal. Data will be extracted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) checklist. Studies will be assessed for methodological quality by two independent review authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Narrative summaries will be generated describing risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability. Quantitative synthesis of study findings will be conducted. Conclusion: This systematic review will aim to identify screening tools with the best diagnostic accuracy for detection of 1) delirium and 2) cognitive impairment or dementia in adults aged >=60 post-trauma in acute care settings. Results will inform clinical practice to enhance the probability of patients with NCDs receiving appropriate care and management.
