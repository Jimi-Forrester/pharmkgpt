37129853|a|The RAS-transformed cells utilize macropinocytosis to acquire amino acids to support their uncontrolled growth. However, targeting RAS to inhibit macropinocytosis remains a challenge. Here, we report that gold nanoparticles (GNP) inhibit macropinocytosis by decreasing KRAS activation. Using surface-modified and unmodified GNP, we showed that unmodified GNP specifically sequestered both wild-type and mutant KRAS and inhibited its activation, irrespective of growth factor stimulation, while surface-passivated GNP had no effect. Alteration of KRAS activation is reflected on downstream signaling cascades, macropinocytosis and tumor cell growth in vitro, and two independent preclinical human xenograft models of pancreatic cancer in vivo. The current study demonstrates NP-mediated inhibition of macropinocytosis and KRAS activation and provides translational opportunities to inhibit tumor growth in a number of cancers where activation of KRAS plays a major role.
