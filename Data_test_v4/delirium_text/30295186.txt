30295186|a|The article is an overview of author's data obtained in the framework of the project "The Creation of dipeptide preparations" at the V.V. Zakusov Institute of Pharmacology, Moscow, Russia. Advantages of dipeptides over longer peptides consist in that they are orally active owing to higher stability and ability to penetrate biological barriers due to the presence of specific ATP-dependent transporters in enterocytes and blood-brain barrier. Two original approaches for dipeptide drugs design have been developed. Both of them are based on the idea of a leading role of central dipeptide fragment of the peptide chain beta-turn in the peptide-receptor interaction. The first approach, named "peptide drug-based design" represents the transformation of known nonpeptide drug into its dipeptide topological analog. The latter usually corresponds to a beta-turn of some regulatory peptide. The second approach represents the design of tripeptoide mimetic of the beta-turn of regulatory peptide or protein. The results of the studies, which led to the discovery of endogenous prototypes of the known non-peptide drugs piracetam and sulpiride, are presented herein. The paper discusses the process, based on the abovementioned principles, that was used in designing of nontoxic, orally available, highly effective dipeptide drugs: nootropic noopept, dipeptide analog of piracetam; antipsychotic dilept, neurotensin tripeptoid analog; selective anxiolytic GB-115, tripeptoid analog of CCK-4, and potential neuroprotector GK-2, homodimeric dipeptide analog of NGF.
