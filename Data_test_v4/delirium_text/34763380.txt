34763380|a|OBJECTIVE: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event; patients are routinely admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for initial management. Because complications may be delayed, unplanned ICU readmissions can occur. Therefore, in this study we evaluate the rate of and factors associated with readmission after aSAH and identify if readmission is associated with poor clinical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients receiving surgical or endovascular treatment for aSAH and admitted to the ICU between January 2008 and December 2019. We categorized patients by readmission and analyzed their clinical parameters. RESULTS: Of the 345 patients who transferred to ward-level care after an initial ICU stay (Group 2), 27 (7.3%) were readmitted to the ICU (Group 1). History of hypertension (HTN), initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, modified Fisher grade, and vasospasm therapy during first ICU stay were significantly different between the groups. The most common reason for readmission was delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI; 70.3%; OR 5.545; 95% CI 1.25-24.52; p=0.024). Comorbid HTN (OR 5.311; 95% CI 1.75-16.12; p=0.03) and vasospasm therapy during first ICU stay (OR 7.234; 95% CI 2.41-21.7; p<0.01) also were associated with readmission. Readmitted patients had longer hospital stay and lower GCS scores at discharge (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: DCI was the most common cause of ICU readmission in patients with aSAH. Readmission may indicate clinical deterioration, and patients who are at a high risk for DCI should be monitored to prevent readmission.
