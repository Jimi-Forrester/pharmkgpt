32248245|t|[Study protocol to improve the quality of delirium management in intensive care].
32248245|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in cardiac surgery patients is common and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and hospital stay as well as higher mortality. Protocols may improve outcome. In our cardiac surgery intensive care unit (ICU), patients with delirium have not received standardized treatment so far. HYPOTHESIS: In cardiac surgery ICU patients, standardized delirium management will lead after a 4-week introduction, compared to nonstandardized treatment, to a reduction of delirium duration. METHODS: Prospective before/after study to evaluate a quality improvement project for delirium management over 12 weeks including 140 patients. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (a) >=18 years, (b) consent for research with their data. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: (a) palliative status, (b) present during both the before/after phase, (c) pregnancy, (d) included in a competitive study, or (e) delirium not assessable. The implementation includes the introduction of a protocol with interprofessional training, bedside-teaching, pocket cards, posters, and reminders. The primary outcome is the duration of delirium, assessed four times a day with validated instruments. Secondary outcome measures include delirium incidence, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in ICU and hospital, mortality, nursing/therapeutic interventions, cumulative doses of delirium-related drugs, and complications of delirium for a follow-up of 28 days. Empirical data will be analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is a reduction of the duration and frequency of delirium in cardiac ICU patients and will provide evidence of the effect size of the introduction of a delirium management.
