30225254|t|Synthesis and Evaluation of Biological Activity of New Arylphosphoramidates.
30225254|a|The synthesis of new substituted arylphosphoramidates is performed in two steps through phosphorylation of the corresponding alcohols followed by aminolysis. The formation of the desired phosphoramidates depends on the subsequent addition of the two alcohols with the amine being added at the last step. The products were obtained in 58-95% yields. They were characterized mainly by multinuclear (1H, 13C, 31P, and 19F) NMR and IR spectroscopy. In addition, the antimicrobial and antiacetylcholinesterase activities were evaluated. The results showed acetylcholinesterase activity by some compounds, whilst no significant inhibitory effect against the tested bacterial strains has been recorded.
