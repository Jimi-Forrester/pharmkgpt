36361416|t|Impact of Intermittent Fasting on Metabolic Syndrome and Periodontal Disease-A Suggested Preventive Strategy to Reduce the Public Health Burden.
36361416|a|Metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence continues to climb significantly worldwide in today's ad libitum society. MetS has tremendous societal and economic ramifications, making it imperative to develop effective strategies for preventing and controlling it to alleviate this growing burden. Periodontal disease and MetS are associated with several risk factors. Studies in the past have demonstrated that obesity, cardiovascular illness, and type 2 diabetes mellitus have a negative effect on the severity of the periodontal disease. Patients with metabolic syndrome have elevated serum levels of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. Similar inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein, are increased in patients with severe periodontal disease. Remarkably, intermittent fasting is underpinned by scientific evidence, claiming to be the most effective non-pharmacological, potential therapeutic alternative for combating a wide range of metabolic, inflammatory, and lifestyle-related diseases. Nonetheless, an insufficient investigation has been performed to determine whether intermittent fasting has therapeutic benefits on periodontal inflammation and diseases. Here, we show the interrelationship between metabolic syndrome and periodontal disease and contextualize the beneficial impact of intermittent fasting in modulating the chronic metabolic and periodontal inflammatory response. We also anticipate that this review paves the way for further exploration of intermittent fasting as a unique research paradigm representing a cost-effective alternative strategy to conventional disease management in patients with periodontal diseases and metabolic syndrome which may serve as the foundation for an integrative vision relevant to primary, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.
