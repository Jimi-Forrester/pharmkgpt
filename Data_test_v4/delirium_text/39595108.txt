39595108|t|The Quest for Eternal Youth: Hallmarks of Aging and Rejuvenating Therapeutic Strategies.
39595108|a|The impressive achievements made in the last century in extending the lifespan have led to a significant growth rate of elderly individuals in populations across the world and an exponential increase in the incidence of age-related conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, geroscientists have identified 12 hallmarks of aging (genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, impaired macroautophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, defective intercellular communication, chronic inflammation, and gut dysbiosis), intricately linked among each other, which can be targeted with senolytic or senomorphic drugs, as well as with more aggressive approaches such as cell-based therapies. To date, side effects seriously limit the use of these drugs. However, since rejuvenation is a dream of mankind, future research is expected to improve the tolerability of the available drugs and highlight novel strategies. In the meantime, the medical community, healthcare providers, and society should decide when to start these treatments and how to tailor them individually.
