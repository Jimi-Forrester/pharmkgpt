30339962|a|Although dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a synucleinopathy, it is frequently accompanied by beta amyloid (Abeta) accumulation. Elucidating the relationships of Abeta with gray matter atrophy in DLB may yield insights regarding the contributions of comorbid Alzheimer's disease to its disease progression. Twenty healthy controls and 25 DLB subjects underwent clinical assessment, [18F]-Florbetapir, and 3T magnetic resonance imaging. FreeSurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and PetSurfer was used to quantify [18F]-Florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio. Principal component analysis was used to identify the dominant Abeta component for correlations with regional cortical thickness, hippocampal subfields, and subcortical structures. Relative to healthy controls, the DLB group demonstrated increased Abeta in widespread regions encompassing the frontal and temporoparietal cortices, whereas cortical thinning was restricted to the temporal lobe. Among DLB subjects, the Abeta component was significantly associated with more severe hippocampal and subiculum atrophy. These findings may reflect an early process of superimposed AD-like atrophy in DLB, thereby conferring support for the therapeutic potential of anti-Abeta interventions in people with DLB.
