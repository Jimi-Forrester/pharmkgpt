24646516|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein is diurnally regulated in both the cerebrospinal fluid and blood in healthy adults; circadian amplitudes decrease with aging and the presence of cerebral Abeta deposits. The cause of the Abeta diurnal pattern is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is diurnally regulated, leading to APP product diurnal patterns. APP in the central nervous system is processed either via the beta-pathway (amyloidogenic), generating soluble APP-beta (sAPPbeta) and Abeta, or the alpha-pathway (non-amyloidogenic), releasing soluble APP-alpha (sAPPalpha). To elucidate the potential contributions of APP to the Abeta diurnal pattern and the balance of the alpha- and beta- pathways in APP processing, we measured APP proteolytic products over 36 hours in human cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease participants. We found diurnal patterns in sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, Abeta40, and Abeta42, which diminish with increased age, that support the hypothesis that APP is diurnally regulated in the human central nervous system and thus results in Abeta diurnal patterns. We also found that the four APP metabolites were positively correlated in all participants without cerebral Abeta deposits. This positive correlation suggests that the alpha- and beta- APP pathways are non-competitive under normal physiologic conditions where APP availability may be the limiting factor that determines sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta production. However, in participants with cerebral Abeta deposits, there was no correlation of Abeta to sAPP metabolites, suggesting that normal physiologic regulation of cerebrospinal fluid Abeta is impaired in the presence of amyloidosis. Lastly, we found that the ratio of sAPPbeta to sAPPalpha was significantly higher in participants with cerebral Abeta deposits versus those without deposits. Therefore, the sAPPbeta to sAPPalpha ratio may be a useful biomarker for cerebral amyloidosis.
