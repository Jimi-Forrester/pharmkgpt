37755186|t|Asymmetric Distribution of Plasmalogens and Their Roles-A Mini Review.
37755186|a|Plasmalogens are a unique family of cellular glycerophospholipids that contain a vinyl-ether bond. The synthesis of plasmalogens is initiated in peroxisomes and completed in the endoplasmic reticulum. Plasmalogens are transported to the post-Golgi compartment, including endosomes and plasma membranes, in a manner dependent on ATP, but not vesicular transport. Plasmalogens are preferentially localized in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on P4-type ATPase ATP8B2, that associates with the CDC50 subunit. Plasmalogen biosynthesis is spatiotemporally regulated by a feedback mechanism that senses the amount of plasmalogens in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and controls the stability of fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1), the rate-limiting enzyme for plasmalogen biosynthesis. The physiological consequences of such asymmetric localization and homeostasis of plasmalogens are discussed in this review.
