38589904|a|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease that can cause severe pain, motor dysfunction, and even disability. A growing body of research indicates that gut microbiota and their associated metabolites are key players in maintaining bone health and in the progression of OA. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are a series of active metabolites that widely participate in bone homeostasis. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with outstanding anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, have been demonstrated to ameliorate excessive bone loss during the progression of osteoporosis (OP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the protective effects of GNPs on OA progression are not clear. Here, we observed that GNPs significantly alleviated anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced OA in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. 16S rDNA gene sequencing showed that GNPs changed gut microbial diversity and structure, which manifested as an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia and Lactobacillus. Additionally, GNPs increased levels of SCFAs (such as butyric acid), which could have improved bone destruction by reducing the inflammatory response. Notably, GNPs modulated the dynamic balance of M1/M2 macrophages, and increased the serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. To sum up, our study indicated that GNPs exhibited anti-osteoarthritis effects via modulating the interaction of "microbiota-gut-joint" axis, which might provide promising therapeutic strategies for OA.
