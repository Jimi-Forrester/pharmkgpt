38274662|a|Follicular cysts are a common reproductive disorder in mammals that is usually caused by stress. However, the pathogenesis of follicular cysts in sows remains unclear. To provide new insights into the mechanisms of follicular cyst formation in pigs, we conducted a combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis on theca interna and mural granulosa cells of follicular cysts and mature follicles. We identified 2,533 up-regulated and 1,355 down-regulated genes in follicular cysts, compared with mature follicles. These differentially expressed genes were mainly found in signaling pathways related to tumor formation and cortisol synthesis and secretion as shown by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, which predicted 4,362 upstream regulatory factors. The combined gene expression and pathway analysis identified the following genes as potential biomarkers for porcine follicular cysts: cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 18, L-lactate dehydrogenase, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, fibroblast growth factor 7, integrin binding sialoprotein, interleukin 23 receptor, prolactin receptor, epiregulin, interleukin 1 receptor type II, arginine vasopressin receptor 1A, fibroblast growth factor 10, claudin 7, G Protein Subunit Gamma 3, cholecystokinin B receptor and cytosolic phospholipase A2. Metabolomics analysis found significant differences in 87 metabolites, which were enriched in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, and sphingolipid signaling pathways. These results provide valuable information on the molecular mechanisms of follicular cyst formation, which may facilitate the development of new therapeutics to prevent and treat follicular cysts.
