34945858|t|Risk of Dementia in Patients Who Underwent Surgery under Neuraxial Anesthesia: A Nationwide Cohort Study.
34945858|a|The incidence of dementia in patients with surgery under neuraxial anesthesia and the possibility of surgery under neuraxial anesthesia as a risk factor for dementia were investigated. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study with nationwide, representative cohort sample data of the Korean National Health Insurance Service in South Korea between 1 January 2003, and 31 December 2004. The participants were divided into control (n = 4488) and neuraxial groups (n = 1122) using propensity score matching. After 9 years of follow-up, the corresponding incidences of dementia were 11.5 and 14.8 cases per 1000 person-years. The risk of dementia in the surgery under neuraxial group was 1.44-fold higher (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.17-1.76) than that in the control group. In the subgroup analysis of dementia, the risk of Alzheimer's disease in those who underwent surgery under neuraxial anesthesia was 1.48-fold higher (95%CI, 1.17-1.87) than that in those who did not undergo surgery under anesthesia. Our findings suggest that patients who underwent surgery under neuraxial anesthesia had a higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease than those who did not undergo surgery under neuraxial anesthesia.
