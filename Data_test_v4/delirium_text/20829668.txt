20829668|a|OBJECTIVE: Compare subjective reports of both memory and word-finding deficits to clinical diagnosis and objective neuropsychological testing. BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of aging individuals with cognitive impairments, effective screening measures would improve the likelihood of detection. Subjective reports of symptoms are typically obtained in clinical settings, yet the validity of these reports is relatively unknown. METHODS: Clinical screening for dementia was carried out at an Alzheimer disease center. Dichotomous ratings for memory and word-finding/language problems were given by patients and neurologists. These ratings were compared with 13 neuropsychological measures of word-finding/language and episodic memory. RESULTS: Ratings of memory by both patients and neurologists correlated well with standard neuropsychological measures of memory. However, both the patients' and physicians' ratings of word-finding/language impairments had notably less of a correlation with the relevant neuropsychological measures of word-finding/language. CONCLUSION: Compared with ratings of memory, similar assessments of word-finding/language difficulties were relatively inaccurate, and thus poor predictors of impairment. It is imperative to develop effective screening methods that will help reveal cognitive impairments, as this issue will almost certainly become more pressing given the projected increase in the number of aging individuals and those with dementia.
