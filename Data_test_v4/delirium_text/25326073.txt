25326073|a|BACKGROUND: In addition to the limitations to the health-related quality of life that have been compiled with validated test instruments, a number of former sepsis patients suffer from functional impairments, which are categorized under the terms critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) or critical illness myopathy (CIM), which have been in existence for over 20 years now. CURRENT FOCUS: The issues of delirium during intensive therapy and persistent residual neurocognitive impairments, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and states of depression related to perihospital functional development have increasingly attracted notice. FUTURE: The degree of functional deficits resulting from sepsis and the actual quality of life of those affected may, however, be influenced by taking appropriate rehabilitation measures. However, neither therapeutic rehabilitation standards nor any rehabilitation facilities tailored to the needs of these patients currently exist.
