31177220|t|Locus Coeruleus Degeneration Induces Forebrain Vascular Pathology in a Transgenic Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
31177220|a|Noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neuron loss is a significant feature of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The LC is the primary source of norepinephrine in the forebrain, where it modulates attention and memory in vulnerable cognitive regions such as prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Furthermore, LC-mediated norepinephrine signaling is thought to play a role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance and neurovascular coupling, suggesting that LC degeneration may impact the high comorbidity of cerebrovascular disease and AD. However, the extent to which LC projection system degeneration influences vascular pathology is not fully understood. To address this question in vivo, we stereotactically lesioned LC projection neurons innervating the PFC of six-month-old Tg344-19 AD rats using the noradrenergic immunotoxin, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase IgG-saporin (DBH-sap), or an untargeted control IgG-saporin (IgG-sap). DBH-sap-lesioned animals performed significantly worse than IgG-sap animals on the Barnes maze task in measures of both spatial and working memory. DBH-sap-lesioned rats also displayed increased amyloid and inflammation pathology compared to IgG-sap controls. However, we also discovered prominent parenchymal albumin extravasation with DBH-sap lesions indicative of BBB breakdown. Moreover, microvessel wall-to-lumen ratios were increased in the PFC of DBH-sap compared to IgG-sap rats, suggesting that LC deafferentation results in vascular remodeling. Finally, we noted an early emergence of amyloid angiopathy in the DBH-sap-lesioned Tg344-19 AD rats. Taken together, these data indicate that LC projection system degeneration is a nexus lesion that compromises both vascular and neuronal function in cognitive brain areas during the prodromal stages of AD.
