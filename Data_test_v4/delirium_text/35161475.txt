35161475|t|Epileptic-Net: An Improved Epileptic Seizure Detection System Using Dense Convolutional Block with Attention Network from EEG.
35161475|a|Epilepsy is a complex neurological condition that affects a large number of people worldwide. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain and is widely used in epilepsy diagnosis, but it usually requires manual inspection, which can be hours long, by a neurologist. Several automatic systems have been proposed to detect epilepsy but still have some unsolved issues. In this study, we proposed a dynamic method using a deep learning model (Epileptic-Net) to detect an epileptic seizure. The proposed method is largely heterogeneous and comprised of the dense convolutional blocks (DCB), feature attention modules (FAM), residual blocks (RB), and hypercolumn technique (HT). Firstly, DCB is used to get the discriminative features from the EEG samples. Then, FAM extracts the essential features from the samples. After that, RB learns more vital parts as it entirely uses information in the convolutional layer. Finally, HT retains the efficient local features extracted from the layers situated at the different levels of the model. Its performance has been evaluated on the University of Bonn EEG dataset, divided into five distinct classes. The proposed Epileptic-Net achieves the average accuracy of 99.95% in the two-class classification, 99.98% in the three-class classification, 99.96% in the four-class classification, and 99.96% in classifying the complicated five-class problem. Thus the proposed approach shows more competitive results than the existing model to detect epileptic seizures. We also hope that this method can support experts in achieving objective and reliable results, lowering the misdiagnosis rate, and assisting in decision-making.
