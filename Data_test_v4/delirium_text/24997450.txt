24997450|a|Senile amyloid plaques are one of the diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the severity of clinical symptoms of AD is weakly correlated with the plaque load. AD symptoms severity is reported to be more strongly correlated with the level of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) assemblies. Formation of soluble Abeta assemblies is stimulated by monomeric Abeta accumulation in the brain, which has been related to its faulty cerebral clearance. Studies tend to focus on the neurotoxicity of specific Abeta species. There are relatively few studies investigating toxic effects of Abeta on the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We hypothesized that a soluble Abeta pool more closely resembling the in vivo situation composed of a mixture of Abeta40 monomer and Abeta42 oligomer would exert higher toxicity against hCMEC/D3 cells as an in vitro BBB model than either component alone. We observed that, in addition to a disruptive effect on the endothelial cells integrity due to enhancement of the paracellular permeability of the hCMEC/D3 monolayer, the Abeta mixture significantly decreased monomeric Abeta transport across the cell culture model. Consistent with its effect on Abeta transport, Abeta mixture treatment for 24h resulted in LRP1 down-regulation and RAGE up-regulation in hCMEC/D3 cells. The individual Abeta species separately failed to alter Abeta clearance or the cell-based BBB model integrity. Our study offers, for the first time, evidence that a mixture of soluble Abeta species, at nanomolar concentrations, disrupts endothelial cells integrity and its own transport across an in vitro model of the BBB.
