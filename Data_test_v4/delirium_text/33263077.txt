33263077|a|BACKGROUND: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rare neuropsychiatric condition characterized by distorted visual perceptions, body schema, and experience of time. A global overview of research on AIWS can inform future developments and clinical practice in this field. This bibliometric study aimed to analyze the characteristics of the global research landscape on AIWS. METHODS: Bibliometric data on AIWS related publications published until 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The data were analyzed using statistical and scientometric tools to evaluate the publication trends, key research domains, top contributing journals, institutions, and countries associated with AIWS-related research. RESULTS: A total of 125 published items were analyzed with a mean of 3 authors and 8.15 citations per document. Most articles were published after 2008, in medical journals focused on neuropsychiatric sciences, and most institutions affiliated with AIWS research were based on high-income countries. Major research domains associated with AIWS included visual disturbances, body image, migraine, infections, risk factors, and other clinical correlates. Several overarching domains were identified; however, clinical research on diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AIWS is relatively limited. CONCLUSION: The current research landscape informs a developing trend in AIWS research in selected regions and specialties. Future research should emphasize multidisciplinary and translational investigations on clinical and epidemiological areas through global collaborations that may advance the knowledge and practice on AIWS.
