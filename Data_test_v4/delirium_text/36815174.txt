36815174|a|Background: The development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be associated with an inflammatory process. Inflammatory cytokines may be a surrogate for systemic inflammation leading to worsening neurological function. We aim to investigate the association between cognitive impairment and inflammation by pooling and analyzing the data from previously published studies. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search on MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for prospective longitudinal and cross-sectional studies evaluating the relationship between inflammation and cognitive functions. Results: A total of 79 articles were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled estimates from cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP) [Hedges's g 0.35, 95% CI (0.16, 0.55), p < 0.05], IL-1beta [0.94, 95% CI (-0.04, 1.92), p < 0.05], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [0.46, 95% CI (0.05, 0.88), p < 0.005], TNF alpha [0.22, 95% CI (-0.24, 0.68), p < 0.05], sTNFR-1 [0.74, 95% CI (0.46, 1.02), p < 0.05] in AD compared to controls. Similarly, higher levels of IL-1beta [0.17, 95% CI (0.05, 0.28), p < 0.05], IL-6 [0.13, 95% CI (0.08, 0.18), p < 0.005], TNF alpha [0.28, 95% CI (0.07, 0.49), p < 0.05], sTNFR-1 [0.21, 95% CI (0.05, 0.48), p < 0.05] was also observed in MCI vs. control samples. The data from longitudinal studies suggested that levels of IL-6 significantly increased the risk of cognitive decline [OR = 1.34, 95% CI (1.13, 1.56)]. However, intermediate levels of IL-6 had no significant effect on the final clinical endpoint [OR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.8, 1.32)]. Conclusion: The data from cross-sectional studies suggest a higher level of inflammatory cytokines in AD and MCI as compared to controls. Moreover, data from longitudinal studies suggest that the risk of cognitive deterioration may increase by high IL-6 levels. According to our analysis, CRP, antichymotrypsin (ACT), Albumin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha may not be good surrogates for neurological degeneration over time.
