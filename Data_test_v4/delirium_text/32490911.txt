METHODS: In this study, we evaluated medical and surgical patients admitted to the adult ICU of the Federal University of Parana Hospital de Clinicas, in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, between June of 2017 and January of 2018. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the questionnaires involved the following steps: translation, synthesis, back-translation, revision by an expert panel, approval of the back-translation by the original authors, pretesting, and creation of the final versions. Two researchers applied the Portuguese-language versions in the evaluation of critically ill patients. Interobserver reliability was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% CI. RESULTS: The sample comprised 50 patients, of whom 27 (54%) were women. The mean age was 47.7 +- 17.5 years. The main reason for ICU admission, in 10 patients (20%), was cancer. The interobserver reliability of the questionnaires ranged from good to excellent. For the RCSQ, the ICC was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.90). For SICUQ domains 1-5 (sleep quality and daytime sleepiness), the ICC was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.55-0.86), whereas it was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76-0.92) for SICUQ domains 6 and 7 (causes of sleep disruption). CONCLUSIONS: The cross-culturally adapted, Portuguese-language versions of the RCSQ and SICUQ appear to have good interobserver reliability.
