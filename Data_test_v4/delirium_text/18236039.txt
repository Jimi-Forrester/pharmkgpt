18236039|t|Smart optical probes for near-infrared fluorescence imaging of Alzheimer's disease pathology.
18236039|a|PURPOSE: Near-infrared fluorescent probes for amyloid-beta (Abeta) are an exciting option for molecular imaging in Alzheimer's disease research and may translate to clinical diagnostics. However, Abeta-targeted optical probes often suffer from poor specificity and slow clearance from the brain. We are designing smart optical probes that emit characteristic fluorescence signal only when bound to Abeta. METHODS: We synthesized a family of dyes and tested Abeta-binding sensitivity with fluorescence spectroscopy and tissue-staining. RESULTS: Select compounds exhibited Abeta-dependent changes in fluorescence quantum yield, lifetime, and emission spectra that may be imaged microscopically or in vivo using new lifetime and spectral fluorescence imaging techniques. CONCLUSION: Smart optical probes that turn on when bound to Abeta will improve amyloid detection and may enable quantitative molecular imaging in vivo.
