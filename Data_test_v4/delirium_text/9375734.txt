9375734|t|Amyloidosis: a review of recent diagnostic and therapeutic developments.
9375734|a|Amyloid deposition is associated with a diverse range of disorders that includes Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes mellitus and dialysis arthropathy. Although less common, systemic AA and AL amyloidosis remain important because effective treatments have increasingly become available. The pathology in all forms of amyloidosis involves the extracellular deposition of protein as characteristic fibrillar aggregates which interfere with tissue structure and function. Amyloid fibrils are derived from different unrelated proteins in the different forms of the disease but share many common properties, including the capacity to bind the normal plasma protein serum amyloid P component (SAP). This is the basis for our development of radiolabelled SAP as a nuclear medicine tracer for the diagnosis and quantitative monitoring of amyloid. Serial studies have shown that the deposits are far from inert but are actually turned over quite rapidly in many patients. The treatment of amyloidosis involves supportive measures whilst every effort is made to reduce the supply of the respective fibril precursor protein. Under favourable circumstances further amyloid deposition will be prevented. existing deposits will regress and improvement of organ function will occur. Since this strategy is not always possible or may fail, new approaches to inhibit fibril formation and promote regression of amyloid are being pursued.
