16175554|a|The study of dopaminergic influences on acetylcholine release is especially useful for the understanding of a wide range of brain functions and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and drug addiction. These disorders are characterized by a neurochemical imbalance of a variety of neurotransmitter systems, including the dopamine and acetylcholine systems. Dopamine modulates acetylcholine levels in the brain by binding to dopamine receptors located directly on cholinergic cells. The dopamine D5 receptor, a D1-class receptor subtype, potentiates acetylcholine release and has been investigated as a possible substrate underlying a variety of brain functions and clinical disorders. This receptor subtype, therefore, may prove to be a putative target for pharmacotherapeutic strategies and cognitive-behavioral treatments aimed at treating a variety of neurological disorders. The present study investigated whether cholinergic cells in the dopamine targeted areas of the cerebral cortex, striatum, basal forebrain, and diencephalon express the dopamine D5 receptor. These receptors were localized on cholinergic neurons with dual labeling immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence procedures using antibodies directed against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the dopamine D5 receptor. Results from this study support previous findings indicating that striatal cholinergic interneurons express the dopamine D5 receptor. In addition, cholinergic neurons in other critical brain areas also show dopamine D5 receptor expression. Dopamine D5 receptors were localized on the somata, dendrites, and axons of cholinergic cells in each of the brain areas examined. These findings support the functional importance of the dopamine D5 receptor in the modulation of acetylcholine release throughout the brain.
