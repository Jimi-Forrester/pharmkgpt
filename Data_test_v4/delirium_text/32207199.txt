32207199|t|Extracellular Matrix Proteins Involved in Alzheimer's Disease.
32207199|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and characterized by cognitive and memory impairments. Emerging evidence suggests that the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain plays an important role in the etiology of AD. It has been detected that the levels of ECM proteins have changed in the brains of AD patients and animal models. Some ECM components, for example, elastin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are considered to promote the upregulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins. In addition, collagen VI and laminin are shown to have interactions with Abeta peptides, which might lead to the clearance of those peptides. Thus, ECM proteins are involved in both amyloidosis and neuroprotection in the AD process. However, the molecular mechanism of neuronal ECM proteins on the pathophysiology of AD remains elusive. More investigation of ECM proteins with AD pathogenesis is needed, and this may lead to novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for AD.
