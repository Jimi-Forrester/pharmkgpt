39796582|t|DAG-MAG-BetaHB: A Novel Ketone Diester Modulates NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation in Microglial Cells in Response to Beta-Amyloid and Low Glucose AD-like Conditions.
39796582|a|BACKGROUND: A neuroinflammatory disease such as Alzheimer's disease, presents a significant challenge in neurotherapeutics, particularly due to the complex etiology and allostatic factors, referred to as CNS stressors, that accelerate the development and progression of the disease. These CNS stressors include cerebral hypo-glucose metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impairment of neuronal autophagy, hypoxic insults and neuroinflammation. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of DAG-MAG-BetaHB, a novel ketone diester, in mitigating these risk factors by sustaining therapeutic ketosis, independent of conventional metabolic pathways. METHODS: We evaluated the intestinal absorption of DAG-MAG-BetaHB and the metabolic impact in human microglial cells. Utilizing the HMC3 human microglia cell line, we examined the compound's effect on cellular viability, Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels, and key metabolic enzymes under hypoglycemia. Additionally, we assessed the impact of DAG-AG-BetaHB on inflammasome activation, mitochondrial activity, ROS levels, inflammation and phagocytic rates. RESULTS: DAG-MAG-BetaHB showed a high rate of intestinal absorption and no cytotoxic effect. In vitro, DAG-MAG-BetaHB enhanced cell viability, preserved morphological integrity, and maintained elevated Acetyl-CoA and ATP levels under hypoglycemic conditions. DAG-MAG-BetaHB increased the activity of BDH1 and SCOT, indicating ATP production via a ketolytic pathway. DAG-MAG-BetaHB showed remarkable resilience against low glucose condition by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, DAG-MAG-BetaHB emerges as a promising treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions. It enhances cellular health under varying metabolic states and exhibits neuroprotective properties against low glucose conditions. These attributes indicate its potential as an effective component in managing neuroinflammatory diseases, addressing their complex progression.
