25434514|a|Frailty syndrome is defined as extreme stress vulnerability and decreased potential to adapt. The elderly and chronically ill patients are affected mostly. This condition increases the risk of adverse health outcomes as infections, falls, delirium, institutionalization, progression of comorbidities and mortality. The pathophysiological mechanism is a complex immune and neuroendocrine dysregulation. According to the phenotype model, frailty presents when three of the followings occur: weakness, exhaustion, slowness, weight loss and decreased activity, while cumulative model counts the number of health deficits. Aging, frailty, dementia and depression are independent clinical entities; they may present separately but may also potentiate each other. Hence most of the frailty scales assess the physical, mental and social dimensions as well. Mild or moderate frailty is potentially reversible with an individualised caring plan. Given short, easy-to-use screening tools, risk groups can be identified in the primary care and referred to a specialised team for further treatment. Here the authors summarise the literature of a re-discovered, current clinical phenomena, frailty syndrome, focusing on the practical issues in primary care.
