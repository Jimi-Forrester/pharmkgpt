39399864|a|Here we first review the limited available literature addressing the current landscape of specialist assessment services for dementia and cognitive decline and the preparedness for new amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease across the Western Pacific region. Considering the scarcity of literature, as national representatives of Western Pacific nations we were then guided by the World Health Organization's Global Action Plan on Dementia to provide country-specific reviews. As a whole, we highlight that the existing diverse socioeconomic and cultural landscape across the region poses unique challenges, including varying access to services and marked differences among countries in their preparedness for upcoming amyloid-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, there is an urgent call for intergovernmental collaboration and investment across the Western Pacific to ensure that for all nations, citizens living with dementia and cognitive decline have access to effective and equitable methods of diagnosis, treatment and care.
