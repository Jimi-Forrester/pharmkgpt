39079393|t|Unlocking the potential of higher-molecular-weight 5-HT7R ligands: Synthesis, affinity, and ADMET examination.
39079393|a|An increasing number of drugs introduced to the market and numerous repositories of compounds with confirmed activity have posed the need to revalidate the state-of-the-art rules that determine the ranges of properties the compounds should possess to become future drugs. In this study, we designed a series of two chemotypes of aryl-piperazine hydantoin ligands of 5-HT7R, an attractive target in search for innovative CNS drugs, with higher molecular weight (close to or over 500). Consequently, 14 new compounds were synthesised and screened for their receptor activity accompanied by extensive docking studies to evaluate the observed structure-activity/properties relationships. The ADMET characterisation in terms of the biological membrane permeability, metabolic stability, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and protein plasma binding of the obtained compounds was carried out in vitro. The outcome of these studies constituted the basis for the comprehensive challenge of computational tools for ADMET properties prediction. All the compounds possessed high affinity to the 5-HT7R (Ki below 250 nM for all analysed structures) with good selectivity over 5-HT6R and varying affinity towards 5-HT2AR, 5-HT1AR and D2R. For the best compounds of this study, the expression profile of genes associated with neurodegeneration, anti-oxidant response and anti-inflammatory function was determined, and the survival of the cells (SH-SY5Y as an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease) was evaluated. One 5-HT7R agent (32) was characterised by a very promising ADMET profile, i.e. good membrane permeability, low hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity, and high metabolic stability with the simultaneous high rate of plasma protein binding and high selectivity over other GPCRs considered, together with satisfying gene expression profile modulations and neural cell survival. Such encouraging properties make it a good candidate for further testing and optimisation as a potential agent in the treatment of CNS-related disorders.
