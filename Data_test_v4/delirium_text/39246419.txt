39246419|t|Experiences of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia family caregivers on Reddit communities: A topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
39246419|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a spectrum of disorders characterized by cognitive decline, which pose significant challenges for both affected individuals and their caregivers. Previous literature has focused on patient family surveys which do not always capture the breadth of authentic experiences of the caregiver. Online social media platforms provide a space for individuals to share their experiences and obtain advice toward caring for those with ADRD. This study leverages Reddit, a platform frequented by caregivers seeking advice for caring for a family member with advice for ADRD. To identify the topics of discussion or advice that most caregivers seek and sought after, we employed structured topic modeling techniques such as BERTopic to analyze the content of these posts and use an intertopic distance map to discern the variation in themes across different Reddit categories. In addition, we analyze the sentiment of the Reddit postings using Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner to deduce the degree of negative, positive, and neutral sentiment of the discussion posts. Our findings reveal that the topics that caregivers most frequently discuss and seek advice for were related to caregiver stories, community support, and concerns ADRD. Specifically, we aimed to reproduce an organic Reddit search of caregiving of abuse on family member, financial struggles, symptoms of hallucinations, and repetition in ADRD family members. These results underscore the importance of online communities for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted experiences and challenges faced by ADRD caregivers.
