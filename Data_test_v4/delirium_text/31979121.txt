31979121|t|Effects of A Personalized Intervention Program on the Biochemical and Hematological Profile in Community Dwelling Old Adults-The AGA@4life Intervention Model.
31979121|a|Aging is a social and economic challenge of the highest importance and a multidisciplinary intervention seems to be a promising approach for improving the quality of life of elderly individuals. This project was designed aimed at promoting an active and healthy aging through the implementation of an intervention program based on the comprehensive geriatric assessment model (AGA@4life), focused on promoting health and wellbeing, independence and autonomy, mobility, and social inclusion. A non-randomized interventional study was designed to evaluate the effect of only a dietetic and nutritional approach (control group (CG)) and the combination of a tailored exercise program and a dietetic and nutritional approach (intervention group (IG)) in the biochemical and hematological profile of older adults in the framework of AGA@4life. The 34 participants enrolled, aged 65 years or over, were subject to a thorough baseline (T0) multidisciplinary diagnostic evaluation, including the gathering of clinical information and a battery of biochemical and hematological determinations, and reevaluated after eight weeks of intervention (T1). Between T0 and T1, an increase in albumin and total proteins serum levels were observed in both groups (p < 0.01); the hematological profile in CG and IG showed an increase in red cell count and hemoglobin (p < 0.05). In IG, an increase of HDL cholesterol (p < 0.001) and a decrease of triglycerides (p = 0.001) were still observed. The AGA@4life multidisciplinary intervention improved the hematological and biochemical profile of old adults, potentially contributing to delay the development of several aging comorbidities and increase the quality of life of participants.
