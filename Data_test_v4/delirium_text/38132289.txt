38132289|t|The Role of the Intestinal Microbiome in Multiple Sclerosis-Lessons to Be Learned from Hippocrates.
38132289|a|Based on recent advances in research of chronic inflammatory conditions, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests a close correlation between the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract and the physiologic activity of the immune system. This raises the idea that disturbances of the GI ecosystem contribute to the unfolding of chronic diseases including neurodegenerative pathologies. Here, we overview our current understanding on the putative interaction between the gut microbiota and the immune system from the aspect of multiple sclerosis, one of the autoimmune conditions accompanied by severe chronic neuroinflammation that affects millions of people worldwide.
