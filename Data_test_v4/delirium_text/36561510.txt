36561510|a|Objectives: Surgery of the thyroid takes place in a body part with complicated anatomy and several vital physiologic functions. Thyroidectomy is rarely associated with mortality but can be followed by significant complications, (i.e. hypoparathyroidism, hemorrhage, upper airway obstruction, laryngeal nerve injuries and thyrotoxic storm). This review aims to indicate surgical tips and techniques to sustain a low level of complications. Content: MEDLINE database (PubMed) platform was used as a search engine and the articles related to the topic were selected using the keywords combination "thyroid surgery and complications". Summary and Outlook: The most common complication of total thyroidectomy with an occurrence ranging between 0.5 and 65% is hypoparathyroidism. Damage to recurrent laryngeal nerves can be temporary or permanent, unilateral or bilateral; bilateral lesion is associated with severe episodes of breathlessness. Thus, intraoperative monitoring of nerve function is essential to prevent damage. Iotan addition, hematoma formation can lead to breathing difficulties due to airway obstruction; preventive hemostasis during surgery is essential. The surgeon must have a complete anatomical understanding of not only the normal anatomy of the central visceral compartment of the neck, but also the common variations of the laryngeal nerves and parathyroid glands in order to keep the complication rate at a very low level.
