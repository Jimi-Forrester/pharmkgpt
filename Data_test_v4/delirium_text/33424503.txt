33424503|a|OBJECTIVE: Ketamine is commonly used as an anesthetic and analgesic agent for procedural sedation, but there is little evidence on its current use as a prolonged continuous infusion in the PICU. We sought to analyze the use of ketamine as a prolonged infusion in critically ill children, its indications, dosages, efficacy, and safety. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of patients receiving ketamine for >=24 hours in the period 2017-2018 in our tertiary care center. Data on concomitant treatments pre and 24 hours post ketamine introduction and adverse events were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients included, 78% received ketamine as an adjuvant of analgosedation, 18% as an adjuvant of bronchospasm therapy, and 4% as an antiepileptic treatment. The median infusion duration was 103 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 58-159; range, 24-287), with median dosages between 15 (IQR, 10-20; range, 5-47) and 30 (IQR, 20-50; range, 10-100) mcg/kg/min. At 24 hours of ketamine infusion, dosages/kg/hr of opioids significantly decreased (p < 0.001), and 81% of patients had no increases in dosages of concomitant analgosedation. For 27% of patients with bronchospasm, the salbutamol infusions were lowered at 24 hours after ketamine introduction. Electroencephalograms of epileptic patients (n = 2) showed resolution of status epilepticus after ketamine administration. Adverse events most likely related to ketamine were hypertension (n = 1), hypersalivation (n = 1), and delirium (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine can be considered a worthy strategy for the analgosedation of difficult-to-sedate patients. Its use for prolonged sedation allows the sparing of opioids. Its efficacy in patients with bronchospasm or status epilepticus still needs to be investigated.
