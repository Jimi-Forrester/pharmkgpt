35775694|a|PURPOSE: We retrospectively analysed patients' dental and periodontal status according to the presence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the effects of NCDs on periodontal treatment outcomes. Factors influencing disease recurrence were investigated using decision tree analysis. METHODS: We analysed the records of patients who visited the Department of Periodontology, Pusan National University Dental Hospital from June 2014 to October 2019. As baseline subjects, 1,362 patients with periodontitis and who underwent full-mouth periodontal examinations before periodontal treatment were selected. Among them, 321 patients who underwent periodontal examinations after the completion of periodontal treatment and 143 who continued to participate in regular maintenance were followed-up. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of patients had a NCD. Patients without NCDs had more residual teeth and lower sum of the number of total decayed, missing, filled teeths (DMFT) scores. There was no difference in periodontal status according to NCD status. Patients with a NCD showed significant changes in the plaque index after periodontal treatment. The decision tree model analysis demonstrated that osteoporosis affected the recurrence of periodontitis. CONCLUSIONS: The number of residual teeth and DMFT index differed according to the presence of NCDs. Patients with osteoporosis require particular attention to prevent periodontitis recurrence.
