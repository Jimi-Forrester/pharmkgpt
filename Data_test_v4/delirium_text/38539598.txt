38539598|t|The Constrained Disorder Principle May Account for Consciousness.
38539598|a|There is still controversy surrounding the definition and mechanisms of consciousness. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) defines complex systems by their dynamic borders, limiting their inherent disorder. In line with the CDP, the brain exhibits a disorder bounded by dynamic borders essential for proper function, efficient energy use, and life support under continuous perturbations. The brain's inherent variability contributes to its adaptability and flexibility. Neuronal signal variability challenges the association of brain structures with consciousness and methods for assessing consciousness. The present paper discusses some theories about consciousness, emphasizing their failure to explain the brain's variability. This paper describes how the CDP accounts for consciousness's variability, complexity, entropy, and uncertainty. Using newly developed second-generation artificial intelligence systems, we describe how CDP-based platforms may improve disorders of consciousness (DoC) by accounting for consciousness variability, complexity, entropy, and uncertainty. This platform could be used to improve response to current interventions and develop new therapeutic regimens for patients with DoC in future studies.
