28840123|t|Serum Butyrylcholinesterase Activity: A Biomarker for Parkinson's Disease and Related Dementia.
28840123|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aim to determine changes of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity in PD patients and related dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive PD patients and healthy controls were included and clinical data were collected. Fast serum BChE activity was determined and compared between healthy controls and PD patients. Independent risk factors were performed for BChE activity, PD, and related dementia. The relationship between BChE activity and disease severity was also evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained to explore serum BChE activity in distinguishing PD patients and related dementia. RESULTS: Serum BChE activity mainly independently correlated with gender, albumin, triglyceride, body mass index, and PD. Serum BChE activity decreased in PD patients compared with healthy controls. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off point was 6864.08 IU/L for distinguishing PD patients, and the sensitivity and specificity values were 61.8% and 72.1%. It inversely correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score. BChE activity decreased in PD-related dementia compared with those without dementia. The sensitivity and specificity values were 70.6% and 76.3%, respectively, with an optimal cut-off point of 6550.00 IU/L. CONCLUSIONS: Serum BChE activity can be regarded as a biomarker for PD and related dementia.
