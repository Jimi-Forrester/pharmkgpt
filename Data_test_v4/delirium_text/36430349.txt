36430349|t|Crosslinked Structure of Polyacrylic Acid Affects Pulmonary Fibrogenicity in Rats.
36430349|a|We conducted intratracheal instillations of polyacrylic acid (PAA) with crosslinking and non-crosslinking into rats in order to examine what kinds of physicochemical characteristics of acrylic-acid-based polymers affect responses in the lung. F344 rats were intratracheally exposed to similar molecular weights of crosslinked PAA (CL-PAA) (degree of crosslinking: ~0.1%) and non-crosslinked PAA (Non-CL-PAA) at low and high doses. Rats were sacrificed at 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-exposure. Both PAAs caused increases in neutrophil influx, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractants (CINC) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the lung tissue from 3 days to 6 months following instillation. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the BALF was higher in the CL-PAA-exposed groups. Histopathological findings of the lungs demonstrated that the extensive fibrotic changes caused by CL-PAA were also greater than those in exposure to the Non-CL- PAA during the observation period. CL-PAA has more fibrogenicity of the lung, suggesting that crosslinking may be one of the physicochemical characteristic factors of PAA-induced lung disorder.
