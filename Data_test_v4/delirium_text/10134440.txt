10134440|t|Genetic testing: an economic and contractarian analysis.
10134440|a|Medical researchers are rapidly identifying the genetic causes of many diseases. Genes that increase the risk of contracting Alzheimer's, colon and breast cancer, Huntington's, cystic fibrosis and numerous other diseases have been identified. Genetic tests can reveal an individual's probable health status many years in advance of sickness. Many fear that this will lead to 'genetic discrimination' in the employment and health insurance markets. Solutions such as consent laws are impractical and create adverse selection problems. A new form of insurance, genetic insurance, can eliminate these problems and allow everyone to be insured.
