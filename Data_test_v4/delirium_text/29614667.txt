29614667|t|Leisure-Time Physical Activity and the Risk of Incident Dementia: The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
29614667|a|We conducted a prospective cohort study derived from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We investigated if leisure-time physical activity among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was associated with a decreased risk of developing dementia. 280 persons aged>=70 years (median 81 years, 165 males) with MCI and available data from neurologic evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and questionnaire-based physical activity assessment, were followed for a median of 3 years to the outcomes of incident dementia or censoring variables. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses with age as a time scale and adjusted for sex, education, medical comorbidity, depression, and APOE e4 status. Moderate intensity midlife physical activity among MCI participants was significantly associated with a decreased risk of incident dementia (HR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.98). There was a non-significant trend for a decreased risk of dementia for light and vigorous intensity midlife physical activity, as well as light and moderate intensity late-life physical activity. In conclusion, we observed that physical activity may be associated with a reduced risk of dementia among individuals with MCI. Furthermore, intensity and timing of physical activity may be important factors when investigating this association.
