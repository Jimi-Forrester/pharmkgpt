36958392|t|Person with Heart Failure and Care Partner Dyads: Current Knowledge, Challenges, and Future Directions: State-of-the-Art Review.
36958392|a|Over the past decade, there has been substantial growth in heart failure (HF) research that focuses on persons with HF and their care partners (family members or other close friends that provide unpaid support) as an interdependent team, or "care dyad." In this state-of-the-art review, we use a dyadic lens to identify and summarize current research on HF care dyads, from qualitative studies, to non-experimental quantitative studies, to randomized-controlled trials. Although much work has been done, this literature is younger and less well-developed than care dyad literatures from other conditions (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer's disease). We discuss the substantial challenges and limitations in this body of work, with an eye towards addressing common issues that impact rigor. We also look towards future directions, and discuss the promise dyadic research holds for improving patient, care partner, and relationship health.
