39819912|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a neuropathological syndrome that is associated with several negative outcomes. Nursing home residents are vulnerable to developing delirium. Valid prevalence data and associated factors are not yet available for Germany. Therefore, the aim of the prevalence study of the DeliA project (Delirium in Nursing Homes) is to assess the prevalence of delirium and its associated factors in 750 nursing home residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Trained registered nurses from each participating nursing home will collect the data in a multicentre cross-sectional study. The inclusion criteria for residents are valid informed consent, age >=65 years and sufficient language skills. The exclusion criteria are aphasia, coma, deafness or end-of-life status. The 4 'A's Test will be used as the primary measurement. Delirium motor subtypes will be determined using the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale. Covariables for associated factors, including functional impairments, pain, cognitive status and nutritional status, are assessed through standardised measurements. Moreover, data such as prescribed drugs or medical diagnosis, hearing impairment or falls will be assessed from the nursing records. Furthermore, the Drug Burden Index will be calculated, and associated factors will be determined using a logistic regression model. The period for data collection in participating nursing homes is planned for 2 consecutive weeks in April 2024. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Witten/Herdecke University (no. 82/2023). Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. REGISTRATION: https://osf.io/xkfvh/ (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/XKFVH).
