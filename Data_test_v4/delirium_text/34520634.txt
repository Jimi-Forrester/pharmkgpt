34520634|a|This study explores the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor and diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS). The analysis of reduced total macular volume and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thinning are shown. The severity of these defects increases as MS progresses, reflecting the progressive degeneration of nerve fibers and retinal ganglion cells. The OCT parameters are noninvasive, sensitive indicators that can be used to assess the progression of neurodegeneration and inflammation in MS.
