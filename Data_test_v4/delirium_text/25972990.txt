25972990|t|In silico study of peptide inhibitors against BACE 1.
25972990|a|Peptides are increasingly used as inhibitors of various disease specific targets. Several naturally occurring and synthetically developed peptides are undergoing clinical trials. Our work explores the possibility of reusing the non-expressing DNA sequences to predict potential drug-target specific peptides. Recently, we experimentally demonstrated the artificial synthesis of novel proteins from non-coding regions of Escherichia coli genome. In this study, a library of synthetic peptides (Synpeps) was constructed from 2500 intergenic E. coli sequences and screened against Beta-secretase 1 protein, a known drug target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Secondary and tertiary protein structure predictions followed by protein-protein docking studies were performed to identify the most promising enzyme inhibitors. Interacting residues and favorable binding poses of lead peptide inhibitors were studied. Though initial results are encouraging, experimental validation is required in future to develop efficient target specific inhibitors against AD.
