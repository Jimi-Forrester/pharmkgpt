26836191|a|The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is the best-known genetic risk factor for developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to neuroimaging studies, the APOE e4 allele is associated with localized altered brain function. However, in long-range circuitry, APOE e4 allele-related alterations in functional communication between hemispheres have rarely been directly investigated. We examined the alteration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between inter-hemispheric homotopic regions in cognitively intact, elderly APOE e4 carriers. The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity method was used to assess the inter-hemispheric RSFC. The current study included 13 cognitively intact, elderly APOE e4 carriers (with at least one copy of APOE e4 allele) and 22 well-matched e3 homozygotes. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted, and subsequently, the correlation between the differential inter-hemispheric RSFC and cognitive ability was analyzed. Compared with e3 homozygotes, APOE e4 carriers showed decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC in the bilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) and orbital frontal cortex (OFC). Moreover, in APOE e4 carriers, the inter-hemispheric RSFC of the MTL correlated with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Logical Memory (WMS-LM) (immediate and delayed performance, r = 0.64, p <  0.05; r = 0.65, p <  0.05, respectively), and the inter-hemispheric RSFC of the OFC correlated with the WMS-LM delayed performance (r = 0.71, p <  0.05). In our study, the presence of the APOE e4 allele was linked with decreased inter-hemispheric RSFC, which was attributed to memory performance in carriers.
