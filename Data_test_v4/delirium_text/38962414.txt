38962414|a|As the Japanese population continues to age steadily, the number of older adults requiring healthcare has increased. Evidence demonstrates that hospitalization for acute care has a negative impact on the health outcomes of older adults. Frail older adults tend to have multifactorial conditions collectively known as "geriatric syndromes." When those with these premorbid conditions are hospitalized for acute care, they tend to develop new problems such as delirium and new functional impairments. Adverse consequences of hospitalization include the risk of loss of functional independence and chronic disability. In 2019, the new concept of "hospital-associated complications" (HACs) was proposed to describe these new problems. HACs comprise five conditions: hospital-associated falls, delirium, functional decline, incontinence, and pressure injuries. This review discusses the important issues of HACs in relation to their classification, prevalence, risk factors, prevention, and management in older adults hospitalized for acute care. Robust prevention and management are imperative to address the serious consequences and escalating medical costs associated with HACs, and a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach is key to achieving this goal. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the cornerstone of geriatric medicine and offers a holistic approach involving multidisciplinary and multidimensional assessments. Considerable evidence is accumulating regarding how CGA and coordinated care can improve the prognosis of hospitalized older adults. Further research is needed to understand the occurrence of HACs in this population and to develop effective preventive measures.
