38020997|a|Introduction: Incidental durotomy (ID) is an intraoperative event associated to prolonged bed rest and hospital stay, antibiotic use, higher patient dissatisfaction, and leg pain among other complications of its postoperative course. Several repair techniques and postsurgical care have been proposed for its management. This study was designed to develop an agreed protocol in cases of ID among Orthopaedic Surgeons (OS) and Neurosurgeons (NS) integrated into a Spinal Surgery Unit. Research question: Incidental durotomies management protocol. Materials and methods: From 997 eligible cases operated in Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain) from April 2018 to March 2022, demographic, clinical, surgical and postoperative data was collected for statistical analysis from the morbidity and mortality database, with 79 identified IDs. Redo procedures were significantly associated to OS, and cervical and anterior/lateral approaches to NS, both groups were not comparable. Results: ID occurred in 7.9% of cases, more frequently after the lockdown (p=0.03), in females (p=0.04), during posterior approaches (p=0.003), and less frequently in the cervical spine (p=0.009). IDs were linked to postoperative infections (p< 0.001) and nerve root damage (p< 0.001). Patients without ID evolved more satisfactorily during the postoperative period (p=0.002), and those with CSF leak (20/79) spent on bed rest more than twice the time as those without (p<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression showed strong association between posterior approaches and ID, between complicated postoperative courses and ID. Discussion and conclusions: ID is linked to an adverse postoperative recovery, and it should be primarily repaired under microscope, with early mobilization of patients after surgery.
