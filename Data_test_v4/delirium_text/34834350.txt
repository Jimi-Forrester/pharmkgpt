34834350|t|Neuroinflammation as a Therapeutic Target in Retinitis Pigmentosa and Quercetin as Its Potential Modulator.
34834350|a|The retina is a multilayer neuronal tissue located in the back of the eye that transduces the environmental light into a neural impulse. Many eye diseases caused by endogenous or exogenous harm lead to retina degeneration with neuroinflammation being a major hallmark of these pathologies. One of the most prevalent retinopathies is retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a clinically and genetically heterogeneous hereditary disorder that causes a decline in vision and eventually blindness. Most RP cases are related to mutations in the rod visual receptor, rhodopsin. The mutant protein triggers inflammatory reactions resulting in the activation of microglia to clear degenerating photoreceptor cells. However, sustained insult caused by the abnormal genetic background exacerbates the inflammatory response and increases oxidative stress in the retina, leading to a decline in rod photoreceptors followed by cone photoreceptors. Thus, inhibition of inflammation in RP has received attention and has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, pharmacological modulation of the retinal inflammatory response in combination with rhodopsin small molecule chaperones would likely be a more advantageous therapeutic approach to combat RP. Flavonoids, which exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and modulate the stability and folding of rod opsin, could be a valid option in developing treatment strategies against RP.
