36408389|t|MS-based glycomics: An analytical tool to assess nervous system diseases.
36408389|a|Neurological diseases affect millions of peopleochemistryorldwide and are continuously increasing due to the globe's aging population. Such diseases affect the nervous system and are characterized by a progressive decline in brain function and progressive cognitive impairment, decreasing the quality of life for those with the disease as well as for their families and loved ones. The increased burden of nervous system diseases demands a deeper insight into the biomolecular mechanisms at work during disease development in order to improve clinical diagnosis and drug design. Recently, evidence has related glycosylation to nervous system diseases. Glycosylation is a vital post-translational modification that mediates many biological functions, and aberrant glycosylation has been associated with a variety of diseases. Thus, the investigation of glycosylation in neurological diseases could provide novel biomarkers and information for disease pathology. During the last decades, many techniques have been developed for facilitation of reliable and efficient glycomic analysis. Among these, mass spectrometry (MS) is considered the most powerful tool for glycan analysis due to its high resolution, high sensitivity, and the ability to acquire adequate structural information for glycan identification. Along with MS, a variety of approaches and strategies are employed to enhance the MS-based identification and quantitation of glycans in neurological samples. Here, we review the advanced glycomic tools used in nervous system disease studies, including separation techniques prior to MS, fragmentation techniques in MS, and corresponding strategies. The glycan markers in common clinical nervous system diseases discovered by utilizing such MS-based glycomic tools are also summarized and discussed.
