37371113|t|Cell-Penetrating Peptides as Valuable Tools for Nose-to-Brain Delivery of Biological Drugs.
37371113|a|Due to their high specificity toward the target and their low toxicity, biological drugs have been successfully employed in a wide range of therapeutic areas. It is yet to be mentioned that biologics exhibit unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, are susceptible to degradation by endogenous enzymes, and cannot penetrate biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (i.e., the major impediment to reaching the central nervous system (CNS)). Attempts to overcome these issues have been made by exploiting the intracerebroventricular and intrathecal routes of administration. The invasiveness and impracticality of these procedures has, however, prompted the development of novel drug delivery strategies including the intranasal route of administration. This represents a non-invasive way to achieve the CNS, reducing systemic exposure. Nonetheless, biotherapeutics strive to penetrate the nasal epithelium, raising the possibility that direct delivery to the nervous system may not be straightforward. To maximize the advantages of the intranasal route, new approaches have been proposed including the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and CPP-functionalized nanosystems. This review aims at describing the most impactful attempts in using CPPs as carriers for the nose-to-brain delivery of biologics by analyzing their positive and negative aspects.
