38944767|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. This review discusses current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, their limitations, and potential prospects. The feasibility of comprehensive approach for AD therapy is considered in contrast to the classical method in the development of therapeutic strategy. Leu-Ile, Glu-Trp, Lys-Glu, Gly-Pro, Glu-Asp-Arg, Lys-Glu-Asp, Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro short peptides are described as multitarget agents with a wide range of activity.
