23445702|a|The Comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention, which integrates psychological and educational intervention, is a program to improve self-efficacy, self-regulation, self-care, body mass index and quality of life of the patients with coronary heart disease during early stages following hospitalization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Program affecting psychological factors including self-efficacy, self-regulation, self-care, quality of life (QoL), and body mass index (BMI). This study was a quasi-experimental research with a repeated one group design. Eighty patients with coronary artery disease were recruited from either the Medicine or Surgical Ward at the Phramongkutklao Hospital where the patients joined the Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, which included attending exercising practice and receiving face-to-face counseling while being admitted to the hospital. Telephone counseling was thereafter performed one week after being discharged from the hospital, followed by undergoing individual or group counseling at the Cardiac Rehabilitation Clinic the following week. The follow-up period was performed within six weeks after hospitalization. Data was collected on two occasions before discharging from the hospital (pretest) and six weeks after (post-test) by using the self-efficacy, self-regulation, and self-care questionnaires, as well as the Short Form(SF) -36 (Thai version). The results indicated that by six weeks, 50%, 58.80%, 46.20%, and 72.50% of patients, respectively, had experienced increases with self-efficacy, self-regulation, self-care, and quality of life scores, while 12.50% of patients had decreased their body mass index in comparison with the pretest score. From the paired t-test, the self-efficacy, self-regulation and quality of life scores were statistically significant, having increased to the p<0.01 level; self-care was statistically significant, having increased to the p<0.05 level along with body mass index, which was statistically significant having experienced a decrease to the p<0.01 level.
