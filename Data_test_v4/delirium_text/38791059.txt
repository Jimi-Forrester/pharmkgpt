38791059|a|Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia worldwide, lacks effective disease-modifying therapies despite significant research efforts. Passive anti-amyloid immunotherapies represent a promising avenue for Alzheimer's disease treatment by targeting the amyloid-beta peptide, a key pathological hallmark of the disease. This approach utilizes monoclonal antibodies designed to specifically bind amyloid beta, facilitating its clearance from the brain. This review offers an original and critical analysis of anti-amyloid immunotherapies by exploring several aspects. Firstly, the mechanisms of action of these therapies are reviewed, focusing on their ability to promote Abeta degradation and enhance its efflux from the central nervous system. Subsequently, the extensive history of clinical trials involving anti-amyloid antibodies is presented, from initial efforts using first-generation molecules leading to mixed results to recent clinically approved drugs. Along with undeniable progress, the authors also highlight the pitfalls of this approach to offer a balanced perspective on this topic. Finally, based on its potential and limitations, the future directions of this promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease are emphasized.
