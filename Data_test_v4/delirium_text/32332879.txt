32332879|a|Stroke and subsequent cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a frequently occurring disease that can have serious consequences in the absence of timely intervention. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in association with microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can influence gene expression. However, whether circRNAs have a role in cerebral I/R injury pathogenesis, especially soon after onset, is unclear. In this study, we used the SD rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke to examine the role of circRNAs in cerebral I/R injury. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to compare the expression levels of circRNAs in cerebral cortex tissue from MCAO rats during the occlusion-reperfusion latency period 3 hours after I/R injury with those in control cerebral cortices. Our sequencing results revealed that expression levels of 44 circRNAs were significantly altered after I/R, with 16 and 28 circRNAs showing significant up- and down-regulation, respectively, relative to levels in control cortex. We extended these results in vitro in primary cultured neuron cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) using qRT-PCR to show that levels of circ-camk4 were increased in OGD/R neurons relative to control neurons. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that several miRNAs could be associated with circ-camk4 and this prediction was confirmed in a RNA pull-down assay. KEGG analysis to predict pathways that involve circ-camk4 included the glutamatergic synapse pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and apoptosis signaling pathways, all of which are known to be involved in brain injury after I/R. Our results also demonstrate that levels of the human homolog to circ-camk4 (hsa-circ-camk4) are elevated in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to OGD/R treatment. Overexpression of hsa-circ-camk4 in SH-SY5Y cells significantly increased the rate of cell death after OGD/R, suggesting that circ-camk4 may play a key role in progression of cerebral I/R injury.
