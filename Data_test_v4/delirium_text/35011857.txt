35011857|t|Association between Nafamostat Mesylate and In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Observational Study.
35011857|a|Nafamostat mesylate may be effective against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is not known whether its use is associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in clinical practice. We conducted a retrospective observational study to evaluate the effect of nafamostat mesylate in patients with COVID-19 using the Medical Data Vision Co. Ltd. hospital-based database in Japan. We compared patients with COVID-19 who were (n = 121) and were not (n = 15,738) administered nafamostat mesylate within 2 days of admission between January and December 2020. We conducted a 1:4 propensity score matching with multiple imputations for smoking status and body mass index and combined the 20 imputed propensity score-matched datasets to obtain the adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital mortality. Crude in-hospital mortality was 13.2% (16/121) and 5.0% (790/15,738), respectively. In the propensity score-matched analysis with multiple imputations, the adjusted odds ratio (use vs. no use of nafamostat mesylate) for in-hospital mortality was 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-2.64; p = 0.52). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The results of this retrospective observational study did not support an association between nafamostat mesylate and improved in-hospital outcomes in patients with COVID-19, although further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to assess the generalizability of our findings.
