31634873|t|Berberine: A Traditional Natural Product With Novel Biological Activities.
31634873|a|CONTEXT: Having been used for thousands of years to treat gastrointestinal diseases, the natural isoquinoline alkaloid, berberine, has exhibited a wide spectrum of biochemical and pharmacological effects in studies of recent years. OBJECTIVE: The review intended to examine the many novel bioactivities of berberine, including antidiabetic, anticancer, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerotic actions. DESIGN: The research team searched the MEDLINE database using PubMed, using different keyword combinations, including berberine AND diabetes, berberine AND cancer, berberine AND (neuron OR brain), berberine AND inflammation, and "berberine AND atherosclerosis to find studies evaluating the various effects exerted berberine. CONCLUSION: Berberine is a promising multipotent agent to combat diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other diseases.
