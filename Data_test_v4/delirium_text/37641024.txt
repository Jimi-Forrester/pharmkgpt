37641024|a|INTRODUCTION: Talaromycosis is a common invasive fungal disease in patients with HIV. However, its association with bone destruction is unusual in AIDS patients with talaromycosis. CASE PRESENTATION: This report covers the case of a 38-year-old male AIDS patient coinfected with Talaromyces marneffei and Salmonella. The case, which involved bone destruction, was identified via metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Following treatment with a combination of amphotericin B and piperacillin-tazobactam, the patient's elbow motion noticeably improved. Imaging findings revealed that the progression of bony destruction had halted. CONCLUSION: Bone damage due to Talaromyces marneffei infection is infrequent in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, healthcare professionals must be vigilant for potential bone lesions associated with this type of infection. Prompt diagnosis and antimicrobial treatment are crucial.
