38478096|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a motor disorder resulting from dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra caused by age, genetics, and environment. The disease severely impacts a patient's quality of life and can even be life-threatening. The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is a member of the HCN1-4 gene family and is widely expressed in basal ganglia nuclei. The hyperpolarization-activated current mediated by the HCN channel has a distinct impact on neuronal excitability and rhythmic activity associated with PD pathogenesis, as it affects the firing activity, including both firing rate and firing pattern, of neurons in the basal ganglia nuclei. This review aims to comprehensively understand the characteristics of HCN channels by summarizing their regulatory role in neuronal firing activity of the basal ganglia nuclei. Furthermore, the distribution and characteristics of HCN channels in each nucleus of the basal ganglia group and their effect on PD symptoms through modulating neuronal electrical activity are discussed. Since the roles of the substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata, as well as globus pallidus externus and internus, are distinct in the basal ganglia circuit, they are individually described. Lastly, this investigation briefly highlights that the HCN channel expressed on microglia plays a role in the pathological process of PD by affecting the neuroinflammatory response.
