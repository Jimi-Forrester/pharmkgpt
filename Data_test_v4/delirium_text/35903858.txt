35903858|t|Outcomes of complex discharge planning in older adults with complex needs: a scoping review.
35903858|a|In this scoping review, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated multidisciplinary team discharge planning and identify common outcomes among older adults with complex needs, focusing on a safe transition from the hospital to the community. We performed a literature search for relevant articles using seven electronic databases and agreed search terms. Only articles published in English were included. In total, 23,772 articles were identified, with 27 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. A preponderance of patients aged >=65 years and women was inferred based on population demographics. Initiatives on complex discharge planning were noted across most Western countries. Common outcomes of complex discharge planning were functionality (n = 11) including frailty (n = 4), quality of life (n = 11), and patient-centered factors including psychosocial needs (n = 9). Various outcomes from complex discharge planning initiatives and pathways were explored in this scoping review. None of the selected studies covered all nine domains of outcome assessment. Further research is needed involving follow-up studies after complex discharge planning interventions to assess their true effectiveness or value.
