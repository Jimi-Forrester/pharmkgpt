38456419|t|Effects of Sex and Western Diet on Spatial Lipidomic Profiles for the Hippocampus, Cortex, and Corpus Callosum in Mice Using MALDI MSI.
38456419|a|Diet is inextricably linked to human health and biological functionality. Reduced cognitive function among other health issues has been correlated with a western diet (WD) in mouse models, indicating that increases in neurodegeneration could be fueled in part by a poor diet. In this study, we use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) to spatially map the lipidomic profiles of male and female mice that were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose WD for a period of 7 weeks. Our findings concluded that the cortex and corpus callosum showed significant lipid variation by WD in female mice, while there was little to no variation in the hippocampus, regardless of sex. On the other hand, lipid profiles were significantly affected by sex in all regions. Overall, 83 lipids were putatively identified in the mouse brain; among them, HexCer(40:1;O3) and PE(34:0) were found to have the largest statistical difference based on diet for female mice in the cortex and corpus callosum, respectively. Additional lipid changes are noted and can serve as a metric for understanding the brain's metabolomic response to changes in diet, particularly as it relates to disease.
