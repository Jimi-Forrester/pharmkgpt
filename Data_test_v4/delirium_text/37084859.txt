37084859|t|Discoveries and future significance of research into amyloid-beta/alpha7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) interactions.
37084859|a|Initiated by findings that Alzheimer's disease is associated with a profound loss of cholinergic markers in human brain, decades of studies have examined the interactions between specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and amyloid-beta [derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved to yield variable isoforms of amyloid-beta]. We review the evolving understanding of amyloid-beta's roles in Alzheimer's disease and pioneering studies that highlighted a role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in mediating important aspects of amyloid-beta's effects. This review also surveys the current state of research into amyloid-beta / nicotinic acetylcholine receptor interactions. The field has reached an exciting point in which common themes are emerging from the wide range of prior research and a range of accessible, relevant model systems are available to drive further progress. We highlight exciting new areas of inquiry and persistent challenges that need to be considered while conducting this research. Studies of amyloid-beta and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor populations that it interacts with provide opportunities for innovative basic and translational scientific breakthroughs related to nicotinic receptor biology, Alzheimer's disease, and cholinergic contributions to cognition more broadly.
