36938340|t|Neuro-leptospirosis - A batty diagnostic enigma.
36938340|a|Leptospirosis is an important, worldwide zoonotic, with a high incidence in warm-climate and tropical countries. Leptospirosis has a broad spectrum of manifestations, from a non-specific febrile illness to severe disease with multi-organ involvement. Transmission typically occurs following exposure to urine from infected animals, in particular domesticated animals such as rodents and cattle. Leptospira species have been identified in bats, however bat-human transmission is uncertain, and bat-associated leptospirosis in humans is seldom reported. We report a unique case of severe neuro-leptospirosis resulting from bat exposure with an unusual manifestation of a non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, and the diagnostic challenges it presented.
