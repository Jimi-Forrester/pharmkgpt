35698260|a|OBJECTIVES: Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are materials that can be used for autologous stem cell therapy. We screened mtDNA mutations in iPSCs and iPSC-derived neuronal cells from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, we investigated whether the mutations could affect mitochondrial function and deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in differentiated neuronal cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mtDNA mutations were measured and compared among iPSCs and iPSC-derived neuronal cells. The selected iPSCs carrying mtDNA mutations were subcloned, and then their growth rate and neuronal differentiation pattern were analyzed. The differentiated cells were measured for mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, as well as deposition of Abeta. RESULTS: Most iPSCs from subjects with AD harbored >=1 mtDNA mutations, and the number of mutations was significantly higher than that from umbilical cord blood. About 35% and 40% of mutations in iPSCs were shared with isogenic iPSCs and their differentiated neuronal precursor cells, respectively, with similar or different heteroplasmy. Furthermore, the mutations in clonal iPSCs were stable during extended culture and neuronal differentiation. Finally, mtDNA mutations could induce a growth advantage with higher viability and proliferation, lower mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, as well as increased Abeta deposition. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that mtDNA mutations in patients with AD could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and accelerated Abeta deposition. Therefore, early screening for mtDNA mutations in iPSC lines would be essential for developing autologous cell therapy or drug screening for patients with AD.
