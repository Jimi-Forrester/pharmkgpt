20490313|a|Superoxide anion is the first generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) after oxygen enters living cells. It was once considered to be highly deleterious to cell functions and aging. Therefore, antioxidants were suggested to prevent aging and degenerative diseases. However, superoxide signaling has been shown in many physiological responses such as transcriptional regulation, protein activation, bioenergy output, cell proliferation and apoptosis. The uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a family of mitochondrial anion-carrier proteins located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and are considered to reduce the generation of superoxide anion through the mitochondrial mild uncoupling. UCPs are important in prevention of mitochondrial excessive generation of ROS, transfer of mitochondrial substrates, mitochondrial calcium uniport and regulation of thermogenesis. Superoxide anion and uncoupling proteins are linked to Alzheimer's disease in mitochondria. Simultaneous disorders of superoxide and uncoupling proteins create the conditions for neuronal oxidative damages. On the one hand, sustained oxidative damage causes neuronal apoptosis and eventually, accumulated neuronal apoptosis, leading to exacerbations of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, our study has shown that UCP2 and UCP4 have important impact on mitochondrial calcium concentration of nerve cells, suggesting that their abnormal expression may involve in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
