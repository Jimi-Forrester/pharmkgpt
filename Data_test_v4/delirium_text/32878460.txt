32878460|t|Overdosing on iron: Elevated iron and degenerative brain disorders.
32878460|a|IMPACT STATEMENT: Brain degenerative disorders, which include some neurodevelopmental disorders and age-associated diseases, cause debilitating neurological deficits and are generally fatal. A large body of emerging evidence indicates that iron accumulation in neurons within specific regions of the brain plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many of these disorders. Iron homeostasis is a highly complex and incompletely understood process involving a large number of regulatory molecules. Our review provides a description of what is known about how iron is obtained by the body and brain and how defects in the homeostatic processes could contribute to the development of brain diseases, focusing on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as four other disorders belonging to a class of inherited conditions referred to as neurodegeneration based on iron accumulation (NBIA) disorders. A description of potential therapeutic approaches being tested for each of these different disorders is provided.
