18778193|a|Neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and their debilitating effects pose a major problem as their incidence increases. Although clinical management of neurodegenerative diseases usually involves symptomatic treatment, Colostrinin() (CLN), which has efficacy in counteracting neural degradation and in stimulating neural growth, might prove to be a more effective means to deal with the causes of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence for the clinical efficacy of CLN is discussed and recent data examined showing the remarkable ability of CLN to reduce oxidative stress, prevent beta-amyloid aggregation and prolong the lifespan in a laboratory model of premature ageing. An increasingly important application for CLN has been as a nutraceutical product for use in the early stages of cognitive decline in humans, with licensed use in North America and Australia, and now in Europe. It might also be of considerable utility as a veterinary nutraceutical for companion animals.
