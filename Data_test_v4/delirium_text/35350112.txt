35350112|t|Awake Plastic Surgery Procedures: The Use of a Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet to Improve Patient Experience.
35350112|a|Background: Awake plastic surgery performed under minimal sedation has advantages including patient preference, affordability, and easier recovery compared to when performed under deeper sedation. Commonly used oral analgesics may not be adequate for awake procedures resulting in moderate to severe pain. Sufentanil sublingual tablet (SST) 30 mcg has been shown to provide timely analgesia with a safety profile appropriate for minimal-sedation settings. Objectives: To examine perioperative outcomes in patients who underwent awake plastic surgery with local anesthesia and SST 30 mcg for pain control. Methods: This study was a prospective single-group cohort study conducted at a single plastic surgery center. SST 30 mcg was administered approximately 30 minutes prior to the procedure. Outcome measures included the number of patients with adverse events, the number of patients requiring medications in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and recovery time. Results: Among the 31 patients, the most common procedures were liposuction (71%), facelift (10%), and blepharoplasty (6%). The mean (+- standard error [SE]) procedural duration was 81 +- 9 minutes. No vital sign instability or oxygen desaturation was observed. Three patients (10%) experienced nausea, only one of which required treatment with oral ondansetron 4 mg in the PACU. One patient (3%) experienced dizziness that did not require treatment. No patients required opioids or other analgesics in the PACU for pain. The mean (+-SE) recovery time was 15 +- 4 minutes. Conclusions: Awake plastic surgery can be performed using SST 30 mcg with minimal side effects and a rapid recovery time. Level of Evidence 4:
