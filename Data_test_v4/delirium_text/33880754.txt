33880754|t|The therapeutic potential of GLP-1 receptor biased agonism.
33880754|a|Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective treatments for type 2 diabetes as they stimulate insulin release and promote weight loss through appetite suppression. Their main side effect is nausea. All approved GLP-1 agonists are full agonists across multiple signalling pathways. However, selective engagement with specific intracellular effectors, or biased agonism, has been touted as a means to improve GLP-1 agonists therapeutic efficacy. In this review, I critically examine how GLP-1 receptor-mediated intracellular signalling is linked to physiological responses and discuss the implications of recent studies investigating the metabolic effects of biased GLP-1 agonists. Overall, there is little conclusive evidence that beneficial and adverse effects of GLP-1 agonists are attributable to distinct, nonoverlapping signalling pathways. Instead, G protein-biased GLP-1 agonists appear to achieve enhanced anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy by avoiding GLP-1 receptor desensitisation and downregulation, partly via reduced beta-arrestin recruitment. This effect seemingly applies more to insulin release than to appetite regulation and nausea, possible reasons for which are discussed. At present, most evidence derives from cellular and animal studies, and more human data are required to determine whether this approach represents a genuine therapeutic advance.
