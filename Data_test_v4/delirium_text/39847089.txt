39847089|a|Seizure is a relatively common neurological consequence after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH). This study aimed to investigate risk factors of early, late, and overall seizures in patients with SICH. Retrospective analysis was performed on all patients with SICH who completed two years of follow-up. The variables collected were obtained from demographic, clinical, radiographic and treatment data, in-hospital complications, and follow-up results. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were used to identify risk factors for post-hemorrhagic stroke seizure. Of 400 SICH patients recruited, 30 (7.5%) and 40 (10%) developed early and late seizures during the 2-year follow-up period, respectively. In the final result of the multivariate analysis, factors associated with the occurrence of the early seizure included lobar location of hematoma (p = 0.018), and GCS <= 12 on initial clinical presentation (p = 0.007). Factors associated with the occurrence of the late seizure included lobar location of hematoma (p = 0.001), volume of hematoma greater than 10 ml (p = 0.009), and midline shift on initial cranial CT (p = 0.036). Risk factors of the overall seizure after SICH included lobar location of hematoma (p < 0.001), volume of hematoma greater than 10 ml (p < 0.001), and craniotomy with evacuation of hematoma (p = 0.007). Furthermore, seizure was also associated with a poor functional outcome 2 years after the onset of SICH. Several factors associated with the appearance of post-ICH seizures were revealed. In patients with increased risk of post-SICH seizures, appropriate surveillance and management of seizures should be carried out.
