35985478|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common surgical complication in elderly patients. As frailty is a relatively novel concept, its clinical significance for POD has seldom been examined. This study aimed to investigate the association between frailty and POD in aged cancer patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery in Taiwan. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 345 consecutive patients aged >=65 years with newly diagnosed cancer who underwent elective abdominal surgery between 2016 and 2018. Frailty assessment was performed using the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). POD was assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method from postoperative day 1 until discharge. Patients were allocated into fit and frail groups. RESULTS: POD occurred in 19 (5.5%) of 345 patients. POD incidence was 1.6%, 3.1%, 4.8%, 11.5%, and 10.0% in patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4+ frail conditions, respectively, which presented a positive linear correlation among patients with an increased number of frail conditions and POD incidence. Based on CGA, 159 (46.1%) and 186 (53.9%) patients were allocated to fit and frail groups, respectively. POD incidence was 2.5% and 8.1% for the fit and frail groups, respectively. Frailty status was an independent risk factor for POD occurrence in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study identified frailty as an independent risk factor for POD in aged Taiwanese cancer patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Given the high prevalence of frailty among older cancer patients, preoperative assessment is important to identify high risk of POD and to improve the quality of postoperative care.
