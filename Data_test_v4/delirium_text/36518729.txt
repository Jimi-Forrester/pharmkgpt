36518729|t|Scheduled, Simultaneous Dosing of Pregabalin, Celecoxib, and Acetaminophen Markedly Reduces or Eliminates Opioid Use After ACL Reconstruction Using Allograft or Hamstring Tendon Autograft: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
36518729|a|Background: Opioid analgesics continue to be prescribed after ambulatory surgery despite untoward adverse effects, risk of overdose, and association with substance use disorder. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to investigate the use of a novel system to provide scheduled and simultaneous dosing of acetaminophen, celecoxib, and pregabalin after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It was hypothesized that this system would markedly reduce pain and opioid use compared with existing best practice. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Included were 100 patients scheduled for elective, primary ACLR using allograft or hamstring tendon autograft. Selection criteria included age between 18 and 65 years and weight between 65 and 120 kg. Exclusion criteria were a known allergy to any drug used in the study or the use of opioid analgesics before surgery. Patients in the intervention group received a blister pack with scheduled, simultaneous doses of acetaminophen, celecoxib, and pregabalin; patients were also given oxycodone 5 mg as needed for breakthrough pain. Patients in the control group were prescribed ibuprofen and oxycodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg as needed for pain. The primary outcome measure was pain. Secondary outcomes were nausea, itching, and daily oxycodone use. Patients were asked to quantify their average pain at rest, nausea, and itching on an 11-point verbal scale (from 0 to 10). These data were recorded for 6 days during daily telephone contacts with patients after hospital discharge. Results: Cumulative results for 6 days showed significantly lower values in the intervention group compared with the control group for pain (median [interquartile range], 28 [14-35] vs 35 [28-41], respectively; P = .009) and oxycodone use (median [interquartile range] number of tablets, 0 [0-2] vs 8 [1.25-16], respectively; P < .001). Based on these data, the upper tolerance limits for the number of oxycodone tablets required by 90% of patients in the intervention and control groups were 8 tablets and 30 tablets, respectively. Cumulative results for nausea and itching were also significantly lower for the intervention group. Most patients in the intervention group used no opioids during recovery. Conclusion: Simultaneous dosing of 3 nonopioid analgesics resulted in reduced postoperative pain and markedly lower opioid use. Registration: NCT04015908 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).
