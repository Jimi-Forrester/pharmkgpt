9275188|t|Compromised mitochondrial function leads to increased cytosolic calcium and to activation of MAP kinases.
9275188|a|We have investigated in rat pheochromacytoma PC12 cells the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP). This treatment slowly decreases ATP levels to 30% of control, whereas the internal calcium level rises very rapidly to 250% of control, derived from internal stores. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 increases gradually, starting after 5 min of treatment, to reach a maximum at 30 min; the kinase activity reaches 250% when measured after 1 hr of treatment. The drop in ATP levels is slower still. Comparison of the time courses of the rapid rise in cytosolic calcium with the slower increase in ERK1 and ERK2 activation suggests one or more intermediate stages in this pathway. Chelation of cytosolic calcium with dimethyl bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid abolished the FCCP-stimulated rise in internal calcium, as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation and the activation of the ERKs. Surprisingly, caffeine, which releases calcium from different internal stores, did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation and did not activate the ERKs. The FCCP effect on calcium storage may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer disease, which might result in ineffective buffering of cytosolic calcium that leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and subsequent protein phosphorylations.
