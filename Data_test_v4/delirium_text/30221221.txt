30221221|a|U1 small ribonucleoproteins demonstrate proteopathy in Alzheimer's disease, and their inhibition modulates the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We sought to determine whether this effect on the APP expression is a universal result of different kinds of RNA splicing inhibitions. We treated cells with two chemical RNA splicing inhibitors: isoginkgetin (IGK) and spliceostatin A (SSA), in which SSA reduced the APP expression, whereas IGK substantially increased it. The following western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the APP expression under the IGK treatment has distinct protein forms, but the total mRNA level was nearly unchanged despite a slight switch within its three major transcripts. Further analysis revealed that the APP-increasing effect of IGK depended on protein translation and might involve inhibition in the degradation system. By immunocytochemistry, the APP likely redistributed from Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells treated with IGK. When compared to the well-characterized ER-to-Golgi transport inhibitor brefeldin A, IGK showed similar APP expression patterns on the western blot. In summary, we not only determined the diverse effects of RNA splicing inhibition on the APP expression but also found the additional function of IGK on protein subcellular traffic.
