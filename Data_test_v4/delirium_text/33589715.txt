33589715|a|Sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC (sRCC) is associated with a poor prognosis, necessitating more aggressive management than RCC without sarcomatoid components (nsRCC). Since suspected renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors are not routinely biopsied for histologic evaluation, there is a clinical need for a non-invasive method to detect sarcomatoid differentiation pre-operatively. We utilized unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) and supervised Learning Vector Quantizer (LVQ) machine learning to classify RCC tumors on T2-weighted, non-contrast T1-weighted fat-saturated, contrast-enhanced arterial-phase T1-weighted fat-saturated, and contrast-enhanced venous-phase T1-weighted fat-saturated MRI images. The SOM was trained on 8 nsRCC and 8 sRCC tumors, and used to compute Activation Maps for each training, validation (3 nsRCC and 3 sRCC), and test (5 nsRCC and 5 sRCC) tumor. The LVQ classifier was trained and optimized on Activation Maps from the 22 training and validation cohort tumors, and tested on Activation Maps of the 10 unseen test tumors. In this preliminary study, the SOM-LVQ model achieved a hold-out testing accuracy of 70% in the task of identifying sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC on standard multiparameter MRI (mpMRI) images. We have demonstrated a combined SOM-LVQ machine learning approach that is suitable for analysis of limited mpMRI datasets for the task of differential diagnosis.
