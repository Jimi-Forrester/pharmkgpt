35756896|a|Background: COVID-19's after-effects among survivors are of increased concern. The cognitive aftermath of COVID-19 virus infection was underrated. This study aimed to identify and compare the cognitive impairment (CI) and its correlates among COVID-19 survivors and control subjects. A total of 85 adults who survived COVID-19 virus infection and an equal number of control subjects (matched for age, sex, education, and socioeconomic level) were included in this study. They were recruited from Zagazig University Hospitals, Sharkia Province, Egypt. All subjects were interviewed utilizing a semistructured demographic and clinical checklist, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results: More than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced CI (compared to only 8% of control subjects). Individuals who survived COVID-19 virus infection were more likely to have impairments in visuo-executive functions (OR: 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5), attention (OR: 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7), language (OR: 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5), delayed recall (OR: 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6), and total MoCA Scores (OR: 0.1, 95% CI 0.04-0.2). Among COVID-19 survivors, those who experienced CI were likely to be older (OR: 1.1, 95% CI 1.03-1.2), and of low-to-moderate education (OR: 4.9, 95% CI 1.6-15.1). Conclusions: CI was prevalent among COVID-19 survivors. The visuo-executive functions, attention, language, and delayed recall were the most affected domains. Older age and lower educational level predicted CI in COVID-19 survivors.
