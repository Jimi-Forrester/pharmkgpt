30192871|a|Extensive research strongly suggests that amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates in the brain have a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Pathological Abeta deposition is likely due to an altered balance between overproduction and elimination. Rodent studies have suggested that the liver has a major role in Abeta degradation. It is possible alterations of liver function could affect brain Abeta levels through changes in blood Abeta concentration. In this study, we hypothesized hepatic Abeta degradation to be impaired in AD subjects. To test our hypothesis, an Abeta degradation assay was developed using synthetic fluorescein-labeled Abeta40 and Abeta42 spiked into human liver homogenates. Abeta degradation rates were lower in AD-derived homogenates as compared with those from non-demented (ND) control subjects, even after accounting for such covariates as age, sex, and APOE genotype. The protein expression of potential Abeta-degrading enzymes were also examined. Neprilysin levels were not different in AD liver samples, while cathepsin D and insulin-degrading enzyme were significantly altered in AD subjects. The results support the possibility that impaired hepatic Abeta degradation could be a factor contributing to increased brain Abeta accumulation and AD.
