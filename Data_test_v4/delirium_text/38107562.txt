38107562|a|Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase widely expressed in various tissues and organs. Unlike other kinases, GSK-3 is active under resting conditions and is inactivated upon stimulation. In mammals, GSK-3 includes GSK-3 alpha and GSK-3beta isoforms encoded by two homologous genes, namely, GSK3A and GSK3B. GSK-3beta is essential for the control of glucose metabolism, signal transduction, and tissue homeostasis. As more than 100 known proteins have been identified as GSK-3beta substrates, it is sometimes referred to as a moonlighting kinase. Previous studies have elucidated the regulation modes of GSK-3beta. GSK-3beta is involved in almost all aspects of brain functions, such as neuronal morphology, synapse formation, neuroinflammation, and neurological disorders. Recently, several comparatively specific small molecules have facilitated the chemical manipulation of this enzyme within cellular systems, leading to the discovery of novel inhibitors for GSK-3beta. Despite these advancements, the therapeutic significance of GSK-3beta as a drug target is still complicated by uncertainties surrounding the potential of inhibitors to stimulate tumorigenesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate mechanisms of this enzyme and evaluates the existing evidence regarding the therapeutic potential of GSK-3beta in brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, and glioblastoma.
