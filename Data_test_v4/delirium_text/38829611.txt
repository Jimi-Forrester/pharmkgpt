38829611|a|Diurnal bruxism (teeth grinding) is known as a symptom of neurocognitive disorders. However, the scientific basis regarding underlying mechanisms, influencing factors and treatment options is still scarce and large knowledge gaps exist. According to Kwak et al. (2009) the prevalence of diurnal bruxism in Alzheimer's patients is 4%. Our review and case report of a patient with Alzheimer's disease and diurnal bruxism supports the hypothesis that bruxism in neurocognitive disorders is a direct consequence of disturbed neurotransmitter balances. With their inhibitory and activating effects, the interaction of neurotransmitters is very complex and numerous medications have the potency to influence these balances directly or indirectly. Due to progressively reduced compliance and a complex disease pattern, therapeutic measures are difficult to implement in patients with neurocognitive disorders and bruxism. Further- more, good cooperation between dentists and general practitioners is also of high importance.
