33215894|t|Associated Factors With Acute Transfusion Reaction From Hospital Online Reporting Events: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
33215894|a|OBJECTIVES: In our hospital's hemovigilance system, a Wi-Fi-based vital signs monitor that automatically transmits data to ensure patient safety has been implemented. We derived the potential clinical characteristics for subsequent association of acute transfusion reactions (ATRs) using the hospital information system database. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed multiple factors to identify the possible associations between clinical factors and developing ATRs. The following data were collected: recipient's pretransfusion and posttransfusion vital signs, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and presence of ATRs. RESULTS: In all, 44,691 events were analyzed. Of these, ATR events occurred in 1586 (3.5%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that leukopenia (<5x10/muL) before transfusion was shown a statistically associated with developing mild ATRs (odds ratio [OR] = 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68-3.35, P < 0.001). The association between elevated body temperature (forehead temperature > 37.5 C) and moderate ATRs was significant (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.22-1.98, P < 0.001). In addition, the association between high diastolic pressure (>90 mm Hg) and severe ATRs was significant (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.06-2.99, P = 0.03). Therefore, evaluated patient's status such as vital signs before transfusion is very important. In addition, every hospital should established a complete hemovigilance program focus on effectively reporting and real-time monitoring ATRs to improve transfusion patient safety. CONCLUSIONS: Vital signs monitoring and leukocyte counts before transfusion were significantly associated with the subsequent risk of ATRs. When patients with elevated body temperature, leukopenia, and high diastolic pressure who are scheduled to receive transfusion, clinicians should be aware of increasing the risk of ATRs in these patients.
