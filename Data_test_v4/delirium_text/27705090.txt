27705090|t|Spontaneous confabulations in amnestic-mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease: a new (yet old) atypical variant?
27705090|a|Confabulation may be present in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but usually it is not a primary feature of either its typical or atypical variants. In this report, we describe the case of an AD patient who showed an unusual and enduring neuropsychiatric phenotype characterized by early and prominent spontaneous confabulation. Surprisingly, such atypical AD presentation bears a striking resemblance to presbyophrenia, a subtype of dementia which was described at the beginning of the twentieth century and then sank into oblivion. In discussion, we speculate on the "return" of presbyophrenia as an unrecognized neuropsychiatric variant of AD and its possible neuroanatomical substrates.
