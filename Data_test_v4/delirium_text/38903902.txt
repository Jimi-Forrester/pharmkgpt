38903902|a|Background: Recent evidence suggests that anosognosia or unawareness of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) may be explained by a disconnection between brain regions involved in accessing and monitoring information regarding self and others. It has been demonstrated that AD patients with anosognosia have reduced connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and that anosognosia in people with prodromal AD is positively associated with bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting a possible role of this region in mechanisms of awareness in the early phase of disease. We hypothesized that anosognosia in AD is associated with an imbalance between the activity of large-scale resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks, in particular the DMN, the salience network (SN), and the frontoparietal network (FPN). Methods: Sixty patients with MCI and AD dementia underwent fMRI and neuropsychological assessment including the Anosognosia Questionnaire Dementia (AQ-D), a measure of anosognosia based on a discrepancy score between patient's and carer's judgments. After having applied Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to resting fMRI data we performed: (i) correlations between the AQ-D score and functional connectivity in the DMN, SN, and FPN, and (ii) comparisons between aware and unaware patients of the DMN, SN, and FPN functional connectivity. Results: We found that anosognosia was associated with (i) weak functional connectivity within the DMN, in posterior and middle cingulate cortex particularly, (ii) strong functional connectivity within the SN in ACC, and between the SN and basal ganglia, and (iii) a heterogenous effect concerning the functional connectivity of the FPN, with a weak connectivity between the FPN and PCC, and a strong connectivity between the FPN and ACC. The observed effects were controlled for differences in severity of cognitive impairment and age. Conclusion: Anosognosia in the AD continuum is associated with a dysregulation of the functional connectivity of three large-scale networks, namely the DMN, SN, and FPN.
