37385414|a|Delirium is an acute brain dysfunction. As one of the common psychiatric disorders in ICU, it can seriously affect the prognosis of patients. Hormones are important messenger substances found in the human body that help to regulate and maintain the function and metabolism of various tissues and organs. They are also one of the most commonly used drugs in clinical practice. Recent evidences suggest that aberrant swings in cortisol and non-cortisol hormones might induce severe cognitive impairment, eventually leading to delirium. However, the role of hormones in the pathogenesis of delirium still remains controversial. This article reviews the recent research on risk factors of delirium and the association between several types of hormones and cognitive dysfunction. These mechanisms are expected to offer novel ideas and clinical relevance for the treatment and prevention of delirium.
