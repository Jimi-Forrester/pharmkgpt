30859738|a|AIMS: Although converging evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies indicates Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ischemic stroke (IS) are related, the genetic basis underlying their links is less well characterized. Traditional SNP-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have failed to uncover shared susceptibility variants of AD and IS. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether pleiotropic genes existed between AD and IS to account for their phenotypic association, although this was not reported in previous studies. METHODS: Taking advantage of large-scale GWAS summary statistics of AD (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls) and IS (10,307 IS cases and 19,326 controls), we performed gene-based analysis implemented in VEGAS2 and Fisher's meta-analysis of the set of overlapped genes of nominal significance in both diseases. Subsequently, gene expression analysis in AD- or IS-associated expression datasets was conducted to explore the transcriptional alterations of pleiotropic genes identified. RESULTS: 16 AD-IS pleiotropic genes surpassed the cutoff for Bonferroni-corrected significance. Notably, MS4A4A and TREM2, two established AD-susceptibility genes showed remarkable alterations in the spleens and brains afflicted by IS, respectively. Among the prioritized genes identified by virtue of literature-based knowledge, most are immune-relevant genes (EPHA1, MS4A4A, UBE2L3 and TREM2), implicating crucial roles of the immune system in the pathogenesis of AD and IS. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that AD and IS had shared disease-associated genes offered mechanistic insights into their common pathogenesis, predominantly involving the immune system. More importantly, our findings have important implications for future research directions, which are encouraged to verify the involvement of these candidates in AD and IS and interpret the exact molecular mechanisms of action.
