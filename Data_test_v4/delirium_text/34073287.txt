34073287|t|The Moringin/alpha-CD Pretreatment Induces Neuroprotection in an In Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease: A Transcriptomic Study.
34073287|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the most common form of senile dementia. Autophagy and mitophagy are cellular processes that play a key role in the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau phosphorylation. As a consequence, impairment of these processes leads to the progression of AD. Thus, interest is growing in the search for new natural compounds, such as Moringin (MOR), with neuroprotective, anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties that could be used for AD prevention. However, MOR appears to be poorly soluble and stable in water. To increase its solubility MOR was conjugated with alpha-cyclodextrin (MOR/alpha-CD). In this work, it was evaluated if MOR/alpha-CD pretreatment was able to exert neuroprotective effects in an AD in vitro model through the evaluation of the transcriptional profile by next-generation sequencing (NGS). To induce the AD model, retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to Abeta1-42. The MOR/alpha-CD pretreatment reduced the expression of the genes which encode proteins involved in senescence, autophagy, and mitophagy processes. Additionally, MOR/alpha-CD was able to induce neuronal remodeling modulating the axon guidance, principally downregulating the Slit/Robo signaling pathway. Noteworthy, MOR/alpha-CD, modulating these important pathways, may induce neuronal protection against Abeta1-42 toxicity as demonstrated also by the reduction of cleaved caspase 3. These data indicated that MOR/alpha-CD could attenuate the progression of the disease and promote neuronal repair.
