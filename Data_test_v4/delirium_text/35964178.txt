35964178|a|BACKGROUND: Tripeptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP), a component of casein hydrolysates, has effective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. Brain angiotensin II enzyme activates the NADPH oxidase complex via angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) and enhances oxidative stress injury. ACE inhibitors improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models and previous clinical trials. Thus, although undetermined, MKP may be effective against pathological amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation-induced cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate the potential of MKP as a pharmaceutical against AD by examining MKP's effect on cognitive function and molecular changes in the brain using double transgenic (APP/PS1) mice. METHODS: Experimental procedures were conducted in APP/PS1 mice (n = 38) with a C57BL/6 background. A novel object recognition test was used to evaluate recognition memory. ELISA was used to measure insoluble Abeta40, Abeta42, and TNF-alpha levels in brain tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis allowed the assessment of glial cell activation in MKP-treated APP/PS1 mice. RESULTS: The novel object recognition test revealed that MKP-treated APP/PS1 mice showed significant improvement in recognition memory. ELISA of brain tissue showed that MKP significantly reduced insoluble Abeta40, Abeta42, and TNF-alpha levels. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated the suppression of the marker for microglia and reactive astrocytes in MKP-treated APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we consider that MKP could ameliorate pathological Abeta accumulation-induced cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest that MKP potentially contributes to preventing cognitive decline in AD.
