18587287|a|The development of dementia in Alzheimer's disease is known to be influenced by various factors. The research was carried out on 16 patients with a probable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), who were first evaluated with MMSE. The patients were then divided according to gender, age, and the progress of the illness into two equal groups. The first group of patients was assigned an additional cognitive therapy for improving cognitive abilities alongside regular treatment while the second group was assigned only regular treatment. After 6 months the patients were re-evaluated using MMSE. The results show a statistically significant difference in cognitive abilities between the two groups with regard to the pre-therapy results. The results of the research are consistent with the results of other researches which imply a slower decrease in cognitive abilities in AD patients who are mentally active.
