39003275|a|Dental calculus severely affects the oral health of humans and animal pets. Calculus deposition affects the gingival appearance and causes inflammation. Failure to remove dental calculus from the dentition results in oral diseases such as periodontitis. Apart from adversely affecting oral health, some systemic diseases are closely related to dental calculus deposition. Hence, identifying the mechanisms of dental calculus formation helps protect oral and systemic health. A plethora of biological and physicochemical factors contribute to the physiological equilibrium in the oral cavity. Bacteria are an important part of the equation. Calculus formation commences when the bacterial equilibrium is broken. Bacteria accumulate locally and form biofilms on the tooth surface. The bacteria promote increases in local calcium and phosphorus concentrations, which triggers biomineralization and the development of dental calculus. Current treatments only help to relieve the symptoms caused by calculus deposition. These symptoms are prone to relapse if calculus removal is not under control. There is a need for a treatment regime that combines short-term and long-term goals in addressing calculus formation. The present review introduces the mechanisms of dental calculus formation, influencing factors, and the relationship between dental calculus and several systemic diseases. This is followed by the presentation of a conceptual solution for improving existing treatment strategies and minimizing recurrence.
