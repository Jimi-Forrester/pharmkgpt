34294005|a|Psychosis is frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it is associated with a worse disease course. AD psychosis may represent a distinct AD phenotype, though its specific neurobiological underpinnings have yet to be identified. This study investigated neural underpinnings of AD psychosis using surface-based-morphometry.Data from 32 AD patients, 17 with psychosis (AD-P) and 15 without were analyzed. Average cortical complexity (fractal dimension, FD) was estimated for each theoretically motivated ROI and patient. First, we compared regional FD in AD-P and AD patients. Then we calculated the correlation coefficients between FD and the severity of misidentification and paranoid psychotic symptoms. AD-P showed decreased FD in ventral-visual-stream compared to AD, suggesting that perceptual processes might be pivotal in psychosis. A negative correlation was found between misidentification severity and FD in the entorhinal cortex suggesting that misidentification may be specifically associated with alterations in regions involved in high-level perceptual and contextualization processes.
