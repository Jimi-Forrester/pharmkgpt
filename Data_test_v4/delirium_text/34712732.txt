34712732|t|The Association between Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction and Cerebral Oximetry during Geriatric Orthopedic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Study.
34712732|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to disorders affecting orientation, attention, perception, consciousness, and judgment that develop after geriatric orthopedic surgery. Cerebral blood oxygen saturation detection is a way to diagnose cerebral oxygen supply during operation. At present, more and more applications are used for early diagnosis of postoperative cognitive function. Therefore, the present study is to analyze the relationship between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and cerebral blood oxygen saturation in elderly orthopedic patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 90 elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery in our hospital. According to the postoperative cognitive dysfunction, they were divided into POCD group (N = 45) and no-POCD (N = 45) group. The cognitive and psychological function and cerebral blood oxygen saturation were analyzed before and 3 months after the operation. Finally, the indicators of cognitive psychological function and the indicators of cerebral blood oxygen saturation are correlated and analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, patients with cognitive dysfunction at 3 months after surgery time below preoperative rScO2, time below a 10% decrease from preoperative rScO2, CDL preoperative, minimum rScO2 value, and maximum rScO2 value have significant changes. The results of the correlation analysis found that there is also a significant correlation between the postoperative cognitive and psychological function of the patient and the cerebral blood oxygen saturation at 3 weeks after the operation. CONCLUSION: In elderly orthopedic patients, there is a significant relationship between cerebral blood oxygen saturation detection and cognitive function 3 months after surgery.
