36509429|t|NRF2 and the Moirai: Life and Death Decisions on Cell Fates.
36509429|a|Significance: The transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) plays an important role as a master regulator of the cellular defense system by activating transcriptional programs of NRF2 target genes encoding multiple enzymes related to cellular redox balance and xenobiotic detoxication. Comprehensive transcriptional analyses continue to reveal an ever-broadening range of NRF2 target genes, demonstrating the sophistication and diversification of NRF2 biological signatures beyond its canonical cytoprotective roles. Recent Advances: Accumulating evidence indicates that NRF2 has a strong association with the regulation of cell fates by influencing key processes of cellular transitions in the three major phases of the life cycle of the cell (i.e., cell birth, cell differentiation, and cell death). The molecular integration of NRF2 signaling into this regulatory program occurs through a wide range of NRF2 target genes encompassing canonical functions and those manipulating cell fate pathways. Critical Issues: A singular focus on NRF2 signaling for dissecting its actions limits in-depth understanding of its intersection with the molecular machinery of cell fate determinations. Compensatory responses of downstream pathways governed by NRF2 executed by a variety of transcription factors and multifactorial signaling crosstalk require further exploration. Future Directions: Further investigations using optimized in vivo models and active engagement of overarching approaches to probe the interplay of widespread pathways are needed to study the properties and capabilities of NRF2 signaling as a part of a large network within the cell fate regulatory domain.
