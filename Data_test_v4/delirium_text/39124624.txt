39124624|t|Case Series of First Microinvasive Fully Endoscopic Use of a New Mitral Prosthesis.
39124624|a|The use of bioprostheses is increasing in younger patients, but it is associated with the risk of later valve deterioration, especially in the mitral position. A new bioprosthesis for mitral valve replacement offers possible longer-term durability and improved hemodynamics. Objectives: Here, we report the implantation of the novel Edwards MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) through microinvasive fully endoscopic access as an innovative surgical approach based on a series of twelve patients. Methods: Contrast-based ECG gated CT was preoperatively performed in all patients to determine the intravascular calcifications and vascular parameters, as well as to assess noticeable problems during the operation. CT software for cardiac interventions (3Mensio Medical Imaging BV) was used to simulate surgical prostheses digitally inside the native annulus. With this, a digital LVOT and neo LVOT was created, and the difference between the valve prostheses was measured. Implantation of the MITRIS RESILIA valve was performed in 12 patients according to the instructions for use through microinvasive access in a fully endoscopic fashion using 3D visualization. Results: The mean patient age was 56.50 years, and 7/12 (58.33%) were redo procedures. All patients survived the first 30 days after the procedure, the mean aortic cross-clamp time was 40.17 +- 13.72 min. and mean postoperative transvalvular gradient was 4.45 +- 1.74 mmHg. The neo LVOT in the CT-based simulation was measured with an average area of 414.98 +- 88.69 mm2. The average difference between the LVOT and neo LVOT area was 65.35 +- 34.99 mm2. There was no case of paravalvular leakage or obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Conclusions: The novel MITRIS RESILIA valve is a promising new bioprosthesis for mitral valve replacement that offers improved features as compared to other prostheses. The ease of implantation is increased by this prosthesis by the improved pliability of the sewing cuff and the inward folding of the struts, which was confirmed by short operative times in our series.
