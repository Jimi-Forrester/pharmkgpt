37550778|t|Beta to theta power ratio in EEG periodic components as a potential biomarker in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia.
37550778|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is associated with electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities including in the power ratio of beta to theta frequencies. EEG studies in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been less consistent in identifying such abnormalities. One potential reason is not excluding the EEG aperiodic components, which are less associated with cognition than the periodic components. Here, we investigate whether aperiodic and periodic EEG components are disrupted differently in AD or MCI vs. healthy control (HC) individuals and whether a periodic based beta/theta ratio differentiates better MCI from AD and HC groups than a ratio based on the full spectrum. METHODS: Data were collected from 44 HC (mean age (SD) = 69.1 (5.3)), 114 MCI (mean age (SD) = 72.2 (7.5)), and 41 AD (mean age (SD) = 75.7 (6.5)) participants. Aperiodic and periodic components and full spectrum EEG were compared among the three groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves obtained via logistic regression classifications were used to distinguish the groups. Last, we explored the relationships between cognitive performance and the beta/theta ratios based on the full or periodic spectrum. RESULTS: Aperiodic EEG components did not differ among the three groups. In contrast, AD participants showed an increase in full spectrum and periodic relative powers for delta, theta, and gamma and a decrease for beta when compared to HC or MCI participants. As predicted, MCI group differed from HC participants on the periodic based beta/theta ratio (Bonferroni corrected p-value = 0.036) measured over the occipital region. Classifiers based on beta/theta power ratio in EEG periodic components distinguished AD from HC and MCI participants, and outperformed classifiers based on beta/theta power ratio in full spectrum EEG. Beta/theta ratios were comparable in their association with cognition. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a full spectrum EEG analysis, a periodic-based analysis shows that MCI individuals are different on beta/theta ratio when compared to healthy individuals. Focusing on periodic components in EEG studies with or without other biological markers of neurodegenerative diseases could result in more reliable findings to separate MCI from healthy aging, which would be valuable for designing preventative interventions.
