36672652|t|The Molecular Pharmacology of Phloretin: Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Action.
36672652|a|The isolation of phlorizin from the bark of an apple tree in 1835 led to a flurry of research on its inhibitory effect on glucose transporters in the intestine and kidney. Using phlorizin as a prototype drug, antidiabetic agents with more selective inhibitory activity towards glucose transport at the kidney have subsequently been developed. In contrast, its hydrolysis product in the body, phloretin, which is also found in the apple plant, has weak antidiabetic properties. Phloretin, however, displays a range of pharmacological effects including antibacterial, anticancer, and cellular and organ protective properties both in vitro and in vivo. In this communication, the molecular basis of its anti-inflammatory mechanisms that attribute to its pharmacological effects is scrutinised. These include inhibiting the signalling pathways of inflammatory mediators' expression that support its suppressive effect in immune cells overactivation, obesity-induced inflammation, arthritis, endothelial, myocardial, hepatic, renal and lung injury, and inflammation in the gut, skin, and nervous system, among others.
