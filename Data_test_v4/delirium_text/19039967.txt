Therefore, we investigated optimal doses of fentanyl by PCEA in management of postoperative pain after gynecological surgery in the elderly. METHODS: We investigated the pain at rest using 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) on the 1st day and 2nd day after the operations. Patients were divided into two groups ; one was well-controlled group (WC group, VAS < 20 mm) and the other was poorly-controlled group (PC group, VAS > or =20 mm). In two groups, we retrospectively compared doses of fentanyl in PCEA, number of demand-PCEA, postoperative nausea as well as vomiting, and delirium during 48 hrs after the operations. RESULTS: The mean age in WC group was significantly higher than that in PC group. The total dosage of epidural fentanyl did not differ significantly between the groups. In WC group fentanyl of 0.172 microg x kg(-1) hr(-1) was given, and fentanyl 0.197 microg x kg(-1) x hr(-1) in PC group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that fentanyl 0.172 microg x kg(-1) x 1 hr(-1) by PCEA was the most appropriate dose for alleviation of postoperative pain after gynecological surgery in the elderly.
