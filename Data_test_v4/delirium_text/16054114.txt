16054114|a|Apolipoprotein E (apo E), a plasma protein involved both in the metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides, particularly in nervous tissue, has been associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. It has been shown that apo E increased the production of nitric oxide (NO) from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM); this effect could represent an important link between tissue redox balance and inflammation, since inflammation and oxidative stress are involved in chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, it has been evidenced that an overproduction of NO in the central nervous system (CNS) may play a key role in aging and that the glial cells (microglials cells and probably astrocytes) are able to form consistent amounts of NO through the induction of a nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) isoform so-called inducible or inflammatory. This report was performed in order to elucidate the effects produced by lipoproteins from control subjects, AD patients and first degree relatives (offspring) on human astrocyte cells after a short incubation. Peroxynitrite and NO production and NOS expression in cultured astrocytes were measured. We observed a decreased NO production after incubation with both LDL and HDL and an increased peroxynitrite production. As it concerns NOS expression, densitometric analysis of bands indicated that iNOS protein levels were significantly higher in the cells incubated with both AD lipoproteins and offspring lipoproteins compared to cells incubated with control lipoproteins. These findings suggest the possibility to identify in NO pathway a precocious marker of AD.
