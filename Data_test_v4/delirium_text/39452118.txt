39452118|t|Exercise Promotes Hippocampal Neurogenesis in T2DM Mice via Irisin/TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB-Mediated Neuroinflammation Pathway.
39452118|a|Neuroinflammation is a major feature of type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM), adversely affecting hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the precise mechanism is not fully understood, and therapeutic approaches are currently lacking. Therefore, we determined the effects of exercise on neuroinflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis in T2DM mice, with a specific focus on understanding the role of the irisin and related cascade pathways in modulating the beneficial effects of exercise in these processes. Ten-week exercise significantly decreased T2DM-induced inflammation levels and markedly promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. However, these positive effects were reversed by 10 weeks of treatment with cyclo RGDyk, an inhibitor of irisin receptor signaling. Additionally, exercise helped reduce the M1 phenotype polarization of hippocampal microglia in diabetic mice; this effect could be reversed with cyclo RGDyk treatment. Moreover, exercise markedly increased the levels of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/irisin protein while decreasing the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) in the hippocampus of T2DM mice. However, blocking irisin receptor signaling counteracted the down-regulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB in diabetic mice undergoing exercise intervention. Conclusively, exercise appears to be effective in reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis and memory in diabetes mice. The positive effects are involved in the participation of the irisin/TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, highlighting the potential of exercise in the management of diabetic-induced cognitive decline.
