35088486|t|Nurses' perspective about the Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in upper secondary schools: A focus group study.
35088486|a|WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes with a pathogenic perspective are implemented worldwide for different participants and contexts. These interventions can promote the medicalization and psychiatrization movement of human suffering. Training programmes should teach about mental health nursing problems rather than disorders. However, there seem to be no studies describing these healthier interventions targeting adolescents in upper secondary schools. Nurses can explore these interventions and target them towards these participants and contexts. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The perspective of nurses on the characteristics of Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in Portuguese upper secondary schools is reported. Experts recognize that the nurses who perform these interventions must have personal, pedagogical and mental health competencies. Therefore, mental health nurses may be considered. The components of mental health literacy, mental health nursing problems and a dynamic first aid plan can be taught using different classroom training strategies. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The role of mental health nurses in promoting health literacy is highlighted. They have the opportunity to lead multidisciplinary teams in using these healthier training programmes. These expert opinions can shape the planning, implementation and evaluation of these interventions. In turn, training programmes can promote the identification, assistance and/or adequate and timely referral of people with mental health nursing problems. ABSTRACT: Introduction Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes performed by nurses can empower adolescents to aid people with mental health problems. There do not appear to be any studies that describe these healthier interventions aimed at adolescents in upper secondary schools. The development of these educational interventions benefits from the input of their participants and facilitators. Aim To explore the perspective of nurses about Mental Health First Aid Training Programmes for adolescents in upper secondary schools. Method A qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study was conducted. Data were collected from seven mental health nurses during two focus group sessions. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results Twelve themes were identified around nine main areas: facilitators, intervention foci, outcomes assessment methods, process assessment methods, participants, implementation context, duration and frequency, intervention methods and strategies, and contents. Discussion Mental health nurses can regularly perform these classroom interventions to improve the mental health competencies of adolescents. Various educational methods can facilitate learning related to mental health literacy components, mental health nursing problems and the first aid plan. Valid and appropriate assessment methods enhance a good representation of these interventions. Implications for Practice This evidence can guide the creation and modelling of these first aid training programmes.
