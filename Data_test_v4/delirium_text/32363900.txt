32363900|t|Phenolic lipids as unique bioactive compounds: a comprehensive review on their multifunctional activity toward the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
32363900|a|Phenolic lipids are multifunctional compounds which play an important biological role in the body. Their unique biologic functionality stems from their strong amphiphilic character which allows them to be incorporated in erythrocytes. Through membrane incorporation, these compounds exert their biological effects on neurons which are not modulated by hydrophilic compounds. These bioactive compounds are present in nature as secondary plant metabolites, and consequently their availability is limited, for dietary and medical purposes. In this review, the pathways and mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease will be described. In addition, the modulatory effects of phenolic lipids on these pathways and a list of several synthetic, semi synthetic and natural sources of phenolic lipids will be examined as having the potential to prevent or combat Alzheimer's disease.
