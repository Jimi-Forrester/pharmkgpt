33935041|a|Brain disease is known to cause irrevocable and fatal loss of biological function once damaged. One of various causes of its development is damage to neuron cells caused by hyperactivated microglia, which function as immune cells in brain. Among the genes expressed in microglia stimulated by various antigens, annexin A1 (ANXA1) is expressed in the early phase of the inflammatory response and plays an important role in controlling the immune response. In this study, we assessed whether ANXA1 can be a therapeutic target gene for the initial reduction of the immune response induced by microglia to minimize neuronal damage. To address this, mouse-origin microglial cells were stimulated to mimic an immune response by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The LPS treatment caused activation of ANXA1 gene and expression of inflammatory cytokines. To assess the biological function in microglia by the downregulation of ANXA1 gene, cells were treated with short hairpin RNA-ANXA1. Downregulated ANXA1 affected the function of mitochondria in the microglia and showed reduced neuronal damage when compared to the control group in the co-culture system. Taken together, our results showed that ANXA1 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.
