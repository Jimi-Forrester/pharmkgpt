30546389|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurocognitive disorder. Although both amyloid beta peptide deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the AD brain have been established as pathological hallmarks of the disease, many other factors contribute in a complex manner to the pathogenesis of AD before clinical symptoms of the disease become apparent. Longitudinal pathophysiological processes cause patients' brains to exist in a state of chronic neuroinflammation, with glial cells acting as key regulators of the neuroinflammatory state. However, the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms of glial function underlying AD pathogenesis remain elusive. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that peripheral inflammatory conditions affect glial cells in the brain through a process of neuroimmune communication. Such disease complexities make it difficult for the pathogenesis of AD to be understood, and impede the development of effective therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Relevant AD animal models are thus likely to serve as a key resource to overcome many of these issues. Furthermore, as the pathogenesis of AD might be linked to conditions both within the brain as well as peripherally, it might become necessary for AD to be studied as a whole-body disorder. The present review aimed to summarize insights regarding current AD research, and share perspectives for understanding glial function in the context of the pathogenesis of AD.
