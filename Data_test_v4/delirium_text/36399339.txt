36399339|t|Trends in Use of Oral Anticoagulants in Older Adults With Newly Diagnosed Atrial Fibrillation, 2010-2020.
36399339|a|Importance: Undertreatment of older adults with atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation therapy is an important practice gap. It has been posited that the availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) would improve oral anticoagulant (OAC) initiation in older adults with atrial fibrillation given their superior safety profile compared with warfarin. Objectives: To systematically examine trends in OAC initiation and nonadherence in older adults with atrial fibrillation and coexisting geriatric conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study uses administrative claims data from Optum's Clinformatics Data Mart from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. Participants included beneficiaries of Medicare Advantage plans aged 65 years and older with atrial fibrillation and elevated risk of ischemic stroke. Data analysis was performed from October 2021 to October 2022. Exposures: Coexisting dementia, frailty, and anemia. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were OAC initiation within 12 months after the first diagnosis of atrial fibrillation per year and nonadherence with OAC per year (defined as <80% of proportion of days covered among patients newly started on OAC in each year). Results: There were 21 603 to 51 236 patients per year (total for 2010-2020, 381 488 patients) in the OAC-eligible incident AF cohort (mean [SD] age, 77.2 [6.1] to 77.4 [6.8] years; 13 871 [51.8%] to 22 901 [49.8%] women). OAC initiation within 12 months after incident AF increased from 20.2% (5405 of 26 782 patients) in 2010 to 32.9% (7111 of 21 603 patients) in 2020. DOAC uptake increased from 1.1% (291 of 26 782 patients) to 30.9% (6678 of 21 603 patients), and warfarin initiation decreased from 19.1% (5114 of 26 782 patients) to 2.0% (436 of 21 603 patients). Older age (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.98), dementia (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.55-0.58), frailty (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72-0.76), and anemia (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.74-0.77) were associated with lower odds of OAC initiation. During the study period, the median (IQR) proportion of days covered increased from 77.6% (41.0%-96.4%) to 90.2% (57.4%-98.6%), and OAC nonadherence decreased from 52.2% (2290 of 4389 patients) to 39.0% (3434 of 8798 patients). Conclusions and Relevance: Since the introduction of DOACs, OAC initiation in older adults with has improved but remained suboptimal in 2020. Additional strategies are needed to improve stroke prophylaxis in all older adults with atrial fibrillation including those with coexisting dementia, frailty, and anemia.
