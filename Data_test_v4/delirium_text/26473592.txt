26473592|t|Associations of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders With Presenting Problems and Outcomes in Older Adults' Emergency Department Visits.
26473592|a|OBJECTIVES: The increasing prevalence of mental health and/or substance use disorders in older adults is a significant public health issue affecting their health, health care use, and health care outcomes. These disorders are especially prevalent in emergency department (ED) visits. This study examined the effect of mental health and substance use disorders on older adults' ED presenting problems and outcomes. METHODS: Data were from the publicly available 2012 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample data set (unweighted n = 5,344,743 visits by the 65+ years age group). We used binary logistic regression analysis to test relationships between mental health and substance use disorders and suicide attempts, falls, and other injuries and multinomial logistic regression analysis to test relationships between the disorders and ED outcomes of death, hospital admission, transfer to institutional care, home health care, leaving against medical advice (AMA), or other or unknown destinations, as opposed to routine care. RESULTS: Of ED visits by older adults, 5.1% involved anxiety disorders, 7.1% involved mood disorders, 10.45% involved delirium/dementia, 1.4% involved alcohol use disorders, and 0.6% involved drug use disorders; 0.2% were suicide-related, 12.0% involved falls, and 10.2% involved other injuries. Mental health and substance use disorders had large-to-medium effects on suicide attempts. Both dementia and delirium and alcohol use disorders had a small effect on falls. Drug use disorders had a small effect on other injuries. Anxiety disorder had a small effect on the risk of death in the ED or in the hospital, relative to routine care. Suicide attempts and drug use disorders had a medium effect on hospital admission. Suicide attempts had a large effect, delirium and dementia and other mental disorders had medium effects, and mood disorder had a small effect on the risk of transfer to another facility. Delirium and dementia, suicide attempts, and drug use disorders had small effects on the risk of discharge with home health care. Alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders had a small effect on the risk of leaving AMA. Finally, suicide attempts had a medium effect on the risk of other outcomes and unknown destinations. CONCLUSIONS: Late-life mental health and substance use disorders are significant risk factors for both intentional self-harm and unintentional injuries that bring older adults to the ED and contribute to ED dispositions and outcomes that involve more intensive and longer-term health care services. The findings underscore the importance of detection and treatment of these disorders among older adults before they end up in the ED.
