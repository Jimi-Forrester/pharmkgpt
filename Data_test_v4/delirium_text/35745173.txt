35745173|t|Non-Linear Association between Folate/Vitamin B12 Status and Cognitive Function in Older Adults.
35745173|a|Although folate and vitamin B12 status have long been implicated in cognitive function, there is no consensus on the threshold of folate and vitamin B12 for assessing their impacts on cognition. The goal of this study was to detail the association between folate and vitamin B12 with cognitive performance. We analyzed cross-sectional data of older adults (>=60 y; n = 2204) from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys) cohort from 2011-2014. The restricted cubic spline model was used for describing the associations between serum total folate, RBC folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and vitamin B12 and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word Learning (CERAD-WL) and Delayed Recall (CERAD-DR) tests, the Animal Fluency (AF) test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), respectively. Older adults with a different folate and vitamin B12 status were clustered by artificial intelligence unsupervised learning. The statistically significant non-linear relationships between the markers of folate or vitamin B12 status and cognitive function were found after adjustments for potential confounders. Inverse U-shaped associations between folate/vitamin B12 status and cognitive function were observed, and the estimated breakpoint was described. No statistically significant interaction between vitamin B12 and folate status on cognitive function was observed in the current models. In addition, based on the biochemical examination of these four markers, older adults could be assigned into three clusters representing relatively low, medium, and high folate/vitamin B12 status with significantly different scores on the CERAD-DR and DSST. Low or high folate and vitamin B12 status affected selective domains of cognition, and was associated with suboptimal cognitive test outcomes.
