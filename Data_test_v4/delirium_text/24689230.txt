24689230|a|Many studies have shown that chronic inflammation occurs in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is well known that long-term administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can alleviate the cognitive decline of AD patient and elderly. Several inflammatory cytokines produced in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) are closely related to inflammatory diseases. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) and cyclooxygenases (COXs) play a crucial role in the AA network, the products eicosanoids have an important impact on the progression of AD. Although there are many arguments and conflicting evidence, currently LOXs and COXs are still the hot topics in the research on AD pathogenesis and drug development. Here, we review the progress in research on COXs and LOXs, including their actions on CNS and their association with AD, and explore the feasibility of LOXs and COXs as targets for the drugs to prevent and/or treat AD.
