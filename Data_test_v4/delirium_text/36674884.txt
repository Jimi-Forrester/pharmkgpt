36674884|t|Spotlight on P2X7 Receptor PET Imaging: A Bright Target or a Failing Star?
36674884|a|The homotrimeric P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is expressed by virtually all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system and plays a crucial role in various pathophysiological processes such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, neuropathic pain and cancer. Consequently, the P2X7R is considered a promising target for therapy and diagnosis. As the development of tracers comes hand-in-hand with the development of potent and selective receptor ligands, there is a rising number of PET tracers available in preclinical and clinical studies. This review analyzes the development of P2X7R positron emission tomography (PET) tracers and their potential in various PET imaging applications.
