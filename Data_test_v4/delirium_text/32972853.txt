32972853|a|OBJECTIVE: to assess the epidemiology and features of de novo surgical diseases in patients admitted with COVID-19, and their impact on patients and healthcare system. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gastrointestinal involvement has been described in COVID-19; however, no clear figures of incidence, epidemiology and economic impact exist for de-novo surgical diseases in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This is a prospective study including all patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR, between 1 March and 15 May 2020 at two Tertiary Hospitals. Patients with known surgical disease at admission were excluded. Sub-analyses were performed with a consecutive group of COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, who did not require surgical consultation. RESULTS: Ten out of 3089 COVID-19 positive patients (0.32%) required surgical consultation. Among those admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) incidence was 1.9%. Mortality was 40% in patients requiring immediate surgery and 20% in those suitable for conservative management. The overall median length of stay (LOS) of patients admitted to ICU was longer in those requiring surgical consultation compared with those who did not (51.5 vs 25 days, p = 0.0042). Patients requiring surgical consultation and treatment for de-novo surgical disease had longer median ICU-LOS (31.5 vs 12 days, p = 0.0004). A median of two post-surgical complications were registered for each patient undergoing surgery. Complication-associated costs were as high as 38,962 USD per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of de-novo surgical diseases is low in COVID-19, but it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Future studies should elucidate the mechanism underlying the condition and identify strategies to prevent the need for surgery.
