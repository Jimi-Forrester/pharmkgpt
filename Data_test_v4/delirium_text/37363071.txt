37363071|t|Predictors of Food Insecurity and Childhood Hunger in the Bronx During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
37363071|a|Using a community-based participatory research approach, we conducted a survey of 218 food pantry recipients in the south Bronx to determine predictors of food insecurity and childhood hunger. In adjusted multiple regression models, statistically significant risk factors for food insecurity included: having one or more children and not having health insurance. Statistically significant protectors against childhood hunger were: having a graduate degree, having health insurance and Spanish being spoken at home. Experiencing depression symptoms was positively associated with both food insecurity and childhood hunger. Frequency of food pantry use was not significantly associated with either food insecurity nor childhood hunger. This study suggests that targeting families with multiple children and without insurance will best help to promote food security among residents of the south Bronx. Social policy implications related to food security and benefit provision through the COVID-19 pandemic are also provided.
