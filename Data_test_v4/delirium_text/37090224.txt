37090224|t|Severe alcohol withdrawal in an adolescent male.
37090224|a|Ethanol remains one of the most frequently abused agents by adolescents, exceeding all others except for vaping nicotine, and use is rising. With increased ethanol use comes a greater risk for dependence and potential for alcohol withdrawal syndromes (AWS). Pediatric AWS is extremely rare and poorly characterized in the literature. Pediatric acute care practitioners may have limited exposure to AWS. We report the case of a 16-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who presented with mild AWS and progressed rapidly to delirium tremens. His withdrawal was initially refractory to high dose benzodiazepine therapy but responded well to phenobarbital. This case highlights how rapidly and dangerously AWS can progress if not aggressively treated. Given the rise in adolescent alcohol use and potential for life threatening symptoms, practitioners, especially in acute care specialties such as emergency medicine, critical care, and hospital medicine, would benefit from additional familiarity with AWS diagnoses and management strategies.
