33083703|t|Retrospective Analysis of Gabapentin for Alcohol Withdrawal in the Hospital Setting: The Mayo Clinic Experience.
33083703|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose gabapentin taper protocol for alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients admitted to the hospital from January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2018, for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Based on the treatment that patients received, they were divided into the gabapentin, benzodiazepine, and combination treatment groups. The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as time from admission to either discharge or 36 hours with Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score less than 10. Inverse probability of treatment weight was used to account for differences in baseline characteristics between groups. RESULTS: A total of 443 patients met criteria for inclusion (128, 253, and 62 patients in the gabapentin, benzodiazepine, and combination groups, respectively). Baseline characteristics were similar among all groups. The median gabapentin group length of stay was 4.0 hours shorter than the benzodiazepine group (P=.012). Maximum CIWA score was 2.2 points lower in the gabapentin group (P=.003). No statistical differences were noted among safety outcomes, including incidence of seizure, intensive care unit transfer, or delirium tremens. Results were not statistically altered by inverse probability of treatment weight analysis. CONCLUSION: A fixed-dose gabapentin taper protocol appears to be an effective and safe alternative to CIWA-driven benzodiazepines in patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, though further research is necessary to define the potential subpopulations that benefit most.
