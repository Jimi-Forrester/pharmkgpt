1292743|a|A case-control study was conducted to examine factors relating to discontinuation of domiciliary care for the bedridden elderly in Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo. Cases were bedridden residents aged 65 years and over who had abandoned home care and applied for admission to live in a special nursing home for the aged between April and September in 1990 after being recipients of welfare allowances for disabled elderly. Controls were bedridden residents who continued to be given home care and matched to cases by sex, age and beginning month of the receiving of allowances. Among 50 cases and 94 controls interviewed, we obtained responses from 31 cases (62%) and 60 controls (64%). The main results were as follows: 1. During the home-care period, ADL (activities of daily living) of cases, especially walking ability, deteriorated more severely than in controls. Night delirium also appeared more frequently in cases. 2. The primary caregivers of cases were older than those of controls. Remarkable differences between cases and controls were observed in the family structure, the number of family members and the number of sub-caregivers. Cases tended to live alone or live with a spouse only, and with smaller number of family members and caregivers. 3. Case lived more frequently in houses with small numbers of rooms and without rooms of their own. 4. As regards utilization of domiciliary care services, cases used dispatch of home helpers more frequently and used day services less frequently.
