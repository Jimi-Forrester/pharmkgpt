32455603|t|Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease by A Metabolomics-Based Laboratory-Developed Test (LDT).
32455603|a|A laboratory-developed test (LDT) is a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used in the same laboratory (i.e., an in-house test). In this study, a metabolomics-based LDT was developed. This test involves a blood plasma preparation, direct-infusion mass spectrometry analysis with a high-resolution mass spectrometer, alignment and normalization of mass peaks using original algorithms, metabolite annotation by a biochemical context-driven algorithm, detection of overrepresented metabolic pathways and results in a visualization in the form of a pathway names cloud. The LDT was applied to detect early stage Parkinson's disease (PD)-the diagnosis of which currently requires great effort due to the lack of available laboratory tests. In a case-control study (n = 56), the LDT revealed a statistically sound pattern in the PD-relevant pathways. Usage of the LDT for individuals confirmed its ability to reveal this pattern and thus diagnose PD at the early-stage (1-2.5 stages, according to Hoehn and Yahr scale). The detection of this pattern by LDT could diagnose PD with a specificity of 64%, sensitivity of 86% and an accuracy of 75%. Thus, this LDT can be used for further widespread testing.
