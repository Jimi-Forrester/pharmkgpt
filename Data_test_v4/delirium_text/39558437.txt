39558437|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke delirium affects between 24% and 43% of patients, and negatively impacts patient outcomes. Recently, research attention has been on preventive interventions for delirium, with melatonin receptor agonists and orexin receptor antagonists reported to be effective in preventing delirium in intensive care unit patients. However, the efficacy of these agents in preventing post-stroke delirium remain unclear. This study examined the efficacy of ramelteon, suvorexant, and lemborexant in preventing post-stroke delirium symptoms in patients with stroke. METHODS: A retrospective survey of medical records was conducted for patients with stroke aged > 75 years at Kyoto University Hospital from October 2021 to March 2023. Patients who received ramelteon, suvorexant, or lemborexant on admission and the following day were classified into the consecutive administration group, whereas those who did not were classified into the non-consecutive administration group. The primary outcome was an increase in the number of positive items in the delirium screening tool over 7 days. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 33 and 71 were in the consecutive and non-consecutive administration groups, respectively. Fewer patients in the consecutive administration group had an increase in the number of positive items than in the other group (6% vs. 21%). Patients in the consecutive administration group significantly less often had an increase in the number of positive items in the delirium screening tool (P = 0.05; hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.75). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that early administration of a melatonin receptor agonist or orexin receptor antagonists may effectively prevent post-stroke delirium in older patients.
