37503525|t|Post liver transplantation delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU-7 scale: A cohort analysis.
37503525|a|Background: We applied the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)-Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-7 delirium scale to patients who underwent liver transplant (LT). Methods: Retrospective cohort including patients who underwent LT for cirrhosis admitted to the ICU from June 2013 to June 2016 at the University of Alberta Hospital, Canada. Delirium was assessed using the CAM-ICU-7 scale (0-7 points) twice daily on days one and 3 post LT, with the highest score being considered. Primary endpoint was hospital mortality. Results: Among all patients, 101/150 (67.3%) were men and mean age was 52.4 (SD 11.8) years. On days 1 and 3 post LT, mean CAM-ICU-7 scores were 1.8 (SD 1.3) and 1.6 (SD 1.8), respectively. Therefore, on days 1 and 3 post LT, 38/150 (25.3%) and 26/95 (27.4%) patients had delirium. While delirium on day 3 post LT was associated with higher hospital mortality (11.5% versus 0%; p = 0.019), it was not associated with length-of-hospital stay (29.2 versus 34.4 days; p = 0.36). Following adjustment for APACHEII score, delirium on day 3 post LT was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.89 [95% CI 1.02-3.50]). Following adjustment for Glasgow Coma Scale and mechanical ventilation, serum creatinine was associated with higher odds of delirium on day 3 post LT (aOR 2.02 [95% CI 1.08-3.77]). Conclusions: Using the CAM-ICU-7 scale, delirium was diagnosed in a fourth of patients who underwent LT. Delirium on day 3 post LT was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality.
