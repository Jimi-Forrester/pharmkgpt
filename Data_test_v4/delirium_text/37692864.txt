37692864|t|Leukostasis With Isolated Central Nervous System Involvement in Chronic Phase of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.
37692864|a|Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematologic malignancy with unique significance to the field of hematology and oncology, specifically due to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). CML often presents with nonspecific symptoms, and the quality of life in patients with CML has drastically improved as a result of TKIs. However, complications of CML including the risk of transforming into life-threatening blast crises continue to exist. Further, as most patients are asymptomatic in the chronic phase, patients often present with serious complications associated with noncompliance to TKIs. For example, central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of CML have been reported, both as the initial presentation of undiagnosed CML and as known complication of uncontrolled CML. Hyperleukocytosis is a manifestation of uncontrolled CML and leukostasis is a complication, occurring in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we present a rare case of leukostasis in a patient with known CML presenting on computed tomography (CT) as intracranial masses in the chronic phase. Our goal is to discuss this rare case of leukostasis in adult CML and describe its management.
