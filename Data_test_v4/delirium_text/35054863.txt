35054863|t|Hypoxia Inhibits Subretinal Inflammation Resolution Thrombospondin-1 Dependently.
35054863|a|Hypoxia is potentially one of the essential triggers in the pathogenesis of wet age-related macular degeneration (wetAMD), characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) which is driven by the accumulation of subretinal mononuclear phagocytes (MP) that include monocyte-derived cells. Here we show that systemic hypoxia (10% O2) increased subretinal MP infiltration and inhibited inflammation resolution after laser-induced subretinal injury in vivo. Accordingly, hypoxic (2% O2) human monocytes (Mo) resisted elimination by RPE cells in co-culture. In Mos from hypoxic mice, Thrombospondin 1 mRNA (Thbs1) was most downregulated compared to normoxic animals and hypoxia repressed Thbs-1 expression in human monocytes in vitro. Hypoxic ambient air inhibited MP clearance during the resolution phase of laser-injury in wildtype animals, but had no effect on the exaggerated subretinal MP infiltration observed in normoxic Thbs1-/--mice. Recombinant Thrombospondin 1 protein (TSP-1) completely reversed the pathogenic effect of hypoxia in Thbs1-/--mice, and accelerated inflammation resolution and inhibited CNV in wildtype mice. Together, our results demonstrate that systemic hypoxia disturbs TSP-1-dependent subretinal immune suppression and promotes pathogenic subretinal inflammation and can be therapeutically countered by local recombinant TSP-1.
