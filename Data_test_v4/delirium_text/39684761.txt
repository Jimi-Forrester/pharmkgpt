39684761|t|Structures of Oligomeric States of Tau Protein, Amyloid-beta, alpha-Synuclein and Prion Protein Implicated in Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and Prionopathies.
39684761|a|In this review, we focus on the biophysical and structural aspects of the oligomeric states of physiologically intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides tau, amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein and partly disordered prion protein and their isolations from animal models and human brains. These protein states may be the most toxic agents in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. It was shown that oligomers are important players in the aggregation cascade of these proteins. The structural information about these structural states has been provided by methods such as solution and solid-state NMR, cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry, AFM, TEM, etc., as well as from hybrid structural biology approaches combining experiments with computational modelling and simulations. The reliable structural models of these protein states may provide valuable information for future drug design and therapies.
