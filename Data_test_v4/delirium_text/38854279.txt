38854279|t|A Rare Case of Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma of the Muscle in a Young Male Presenting as Necrotizing Myofasciitis.
38854279|a|Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) involving skeletal muscle is generally found to be a secondary metastasis and extremely rarely as a primary site of malignancy. Furthermore, in HIV patients, an increased incidence of lymphomas may be identified within the first six months of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation unmasked by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We illustrate an extremely rare instance of NHL of the skeletal muscle in a young immunocompromised male with HIV/AIDS presenting as necrotizing myofasciitis complicated by compartment syndrome and hemodialysis-refractory type B lactic acidosis. A young Hispanic male with AIDS was admitted for acute left thigh pain and was soon found to have abscess formation with compartment syndrome requiring thigh fasciotomy. During the course of the ICU stay, the patient's clinical status acutely worsened with sepsis-induced multiorgan failure, including acute renal and acute liver failure requiring N-acetylcysteine and severe refractory metabolic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy. Repeat imaging demonstrated diffuse myonecrosis. Left thigh muscle biopsy confirmed aggressive NHL of skeletal muscle. Despite months of arduous medical management in ICU, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with concurrent high-dose prednisone for the vented patient, and intermittent curves of improvement, our patient succumbed to the nature of the disease and subsequently died from severe sepsis from the immunocompromised state. Interestingly, our patient's initial CD4 count was 1, which improved to 96 after five months of HAART, raising concerns for IRIS lymphoma. Given such rapid improvement with chemotherapy, the possibility of IRIS-related lymphoma, and the surprising dearth of data for chemotherapy use in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, more research is needed in these topics to better approach such complicated patients.
