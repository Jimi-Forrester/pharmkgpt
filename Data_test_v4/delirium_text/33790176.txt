33790176|t|[Analysis of Delirium in Patients with Malignant Tumor in Palliative Care Unit].
33790176|a|BACKGROUND: Since delirium has various adverse effects in patients with malignant tumors, it is important to eliminate the cause. We investigated delirium in patients with malignant tumors. METHOD: Seventy seven malignant tumor patients who admitted to palliative care unit from May 2015 to March 2016 were subjected to a retrospective analysis of delirium. RESULTS: Delirium was present in 17 patients(22.1%)on admission, and in 38 patients(49.4%)before discharge. After hospitalization, delirium improved without relapse in 5 patients(29%)and the onset of delirium was avoided in 34 patients(57%). Factors of delirium at admission were nausea and day/night reversal, factors of delirium at discharge were dementia, pain, and day/night reversal. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we investigated the causes and course of delirium in patients with malignant tumors.
