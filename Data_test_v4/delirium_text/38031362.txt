38031362|a|Fractal patterns have been shown to change in resting- and task-state blood oxygen level-dependent signals in bipolar disorder patients. However, fractal characteristics of brain blood oxygen level-dependent signals when responding to external emotional stimuli in pediatric bipolar disorder remain unclear. Blood oxygen level-dependent signals of 20 PBD-I patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were extracted while performing an emotional Go-Nogo task. Neural responses relevant to the task and Hurst exponent of the blood oxygen level-dependent signals were assessed. Correlations between clinical indices and Hurst exponent were estimated. Significantly increased activations were found in regions covering the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, insula, and subcortical nuclei in PBD-I patients compared to healthy controls in contrast of emotional versus neutral distractors. PBD-I patients exhibited higher Hurst exponent in regions that involved in action control, such as superior frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and insula, with Hurst exponent of frontal orbital gyrus correlated with onset age. The present study exhibited overactivation, increased self-similarity and decreased complexity in cortical regions during emotional Go-Nogo task in patients relative to healthy controls, which provides evidence of an altered emotional modulation of cognitive control in pediatric bipolar disorder patients. Hurst exponent may be a fractal biomarker of neural activity in pediatric bipolar disorder.
