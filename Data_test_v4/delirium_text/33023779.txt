33023779|t|Contribution of homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in VWA2 to Alzheimer's disease.
33023779|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia with early (<=65 years) and late (>65 years) onset ages in familial and sporadic patients. Causal mutations in 3 autosomal dominant Alzheimer genes, i.e. amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), explain only 5%-10% of early-onset patients leaving the majority of patients genetically unresolved. To discover potential missing genetics, we used whole genome sequencing data of 17 early-onset patients with well-documented clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In the discovery group, the mean onset age was 55.71 +- 6.83 years (range 37-65). Six patients had a brain autopsy and neuropathology confirmed Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of the genetic data identified in one patient a homozygous p.V366M missense mutation in the Von Willebrand factor A domain containing 2 gene (VWA2). Resequencing of the VWA2 coding region in an Alzheimer's disease patient cohort from Flanders-Belgium (n = 1148), including 152 early and 996 late onset patients, identified additional homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in 1 early and 3 late-onset patients. Allele-sharing analysis identified common haplotypes among the compound heterozygous VWA2 mutation carriers, suggesting shared ancestors. Overall, we identified 5 patient carriers of homozygous or compound heterozygous missense mutations (5/1165; 0.43 %), 2 in early (2/169; 1.18 %) and 3 in late-onset (3/996; 0.30 %) patients. The frequencies of the homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in patients are higher than expected from the frequencies calculated based on their combined single alleles. None of the homozygous/compound heterozygous missense mutation carriers had a family history of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in VWA2 might contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease in sporadic patients.
