33360509|t|The Incidence and Mortality Ratio of Ischemic Cerebrovascular Accidents in COVID-19 Cases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
33360509|a|OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily known as a respiratory illness; however, a wide variety of symptoms and complications of the central nervous system (CNS), such as ischemic cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) have been reported. Hereby, we provide a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature, investigating the incidence of ischemic CVA and the mortality due to it in the setting of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our search databases included Google Scholar, MEDLINE via PubMed, and Scopus. We searched the databases up to July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases, while the secondary outcomes were the ratio of mortality in these cases. Standard meta-analysis methods used to measure the pooled incidence and mortality rates of ischemic CVA in COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: After excluding studies with reasons, only 20 articles were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis, and 17 studies were evaluated quantitatively in our meta-analysis. Included studies reported a pooled average incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA, ranging from 1.3% to 2.3%. Mortality in patients of ischemic CVA to all COVID-19 cases was 0.5%, ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%. The mortality rate of patients with CVA to those who suffered from COVID-19 infection and ischemic CVA simultaneously was 29.2% ranging from 21.6% to 38.2%. Overall, the heterogeneity of the studies was high. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a pooled incidence of 1.7% for ischemic CVA in the setting of COVID-19 infection, with a mortality rate of 29.2% amongst the COVID-19 patients who are suffering ischemic CVA.
