28399492|a|INTRODUCTION: Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited, inflammatory viral thyroid disease which presents with neck pain, usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. On the other hand, thyroid storm is a clinical condition of severe sudden hyperthyroidism accompanied by physiologic de-compensation. We presented a 29-year-old male with features of subacute thyroiditis and thyroid storm who is the third reported case managed by steroid, beta-blocker and analgesics. CONCLUSION: subacute thyroiditis may present with thyrotoxic crisis which respond dramatically to corticosteroid therapy.
