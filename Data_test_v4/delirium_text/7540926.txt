7540926|a|Most of the neurons in the subcortical white matter of the adult cerebrum are remnants of the transient subplate cortex which appears during early cortical development. The peptidergic neurons in the subcortical white matter, beneath the striate cortex were examined qualitatively and qualitatively with immunohistochemistry for substance P, cholecystokinin, somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in seven control patients and eight patients with Alzheimer's disease. The different peptidergic subcortical neurons still persisted in normal aging. In Alzheimer's disease, however, the substance P- and somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons were decreased in numbers and showed degenerative changes.
