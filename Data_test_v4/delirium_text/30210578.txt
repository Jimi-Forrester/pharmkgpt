30210578|t|Insights into the Shc Family of Adaptor Proteins.
30210578|a|The Shc family of adaptor proteins is a group of proteins that lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead, Shc proteins possess various domains that allow them to recruit different signalling molecules. Shc proteins help to transduce an extracellular signal into an intracellular signal, which is then translated into a biological response. The Shc family of adaptor proteins share the same structural topography, CH2-PTB-CH1-SH2, which is more than an isoform of Shc family proteins; this structure, which includes multiple domains, allows for the posttranslational modification of Shc proteins and increases the functional diversity of Shc proteins. The deregulation of Shc proteins has been linked to different disease conditions, including cancer and Alzheimer's, which indicates their key roles in cellular functions. Accordingly, a question might arise as to whether Shc proteins could be targeted therapeutically to correct their disturbance. To answer this question, thorough knowledge must be acquired; herein, we aim to shed light on the Shc family of adaptor proteins to understand their intracellular role in normal and disease states, which later might be applied to connote mechanisms to reverse the disease state.
