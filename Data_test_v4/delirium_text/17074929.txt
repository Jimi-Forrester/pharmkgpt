17074929|t|A role for IRF3-dependent RXRalpha repression in hepatotoxicity associated with viral infections.
17074929|a|Viral infections and antiviral responses have been linked to several metabolic diseases, including Reye's syndrome, which is aspirin-induced hepatotoxicity in the context of a viral infection. We identify an interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent but type I interferon-independent pathway that strongly inhibits the expression of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) and suppresses the induction of its downstream target genes, including those involved in hepatic detoxification. Activation of IRF3 by viral infection in vivo greatly enhances bile acid- and aspirin-induced hepatotoxicity. Our results provide a critical link between the innate immune response and host metabolism, identifying IRF3-mediated down-regulation of RXRalpha as a molecular mechanism for pathogen-associated metabolic diseases.
