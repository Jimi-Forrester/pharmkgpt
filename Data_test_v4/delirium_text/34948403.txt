34948403|t|LE-MDCAP: A Computational Model to Prioritize Causal miRNA-Disease Associations.
34948403|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with various complex human diseases and some miRNAs can be directly involved in the mechanisms of disease. Identifying disease-causative miRNAs can provide novel insight in disease pathogenesis from a miRNA perspective and facilitate disease treatment. To date, various computational models have been developed to predict general miRNA-disease associations, but few models are available to further prioritize causal miRNA-disease associations from non-causal associations. Therefore, in this study, we constructed a Levenshtein-Distance-Enhanced miRNA-disease Causal Association Predictor (LE-MDCAP), to predict potential causal miRNA-disease associations. Specifically, Levenshtein distance matrixes covering the sequence, expression and functional miRNA similarities were introduced to enhance the previous Gaussian interaction profile kernel-based similarity matrix. LE-MDCAP integrated miRNA similarity matrices, disease semantic similarity matrix and known causal miRNA-disease associations to make predictions. For regular causal vs. non-disease association discrimination task, LF-MDCAP achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.911 and 0.906 in 10-fold cross-validation and independent test, respectively. More importantly, LE-MDCAP prominently outperformed the previous MDCAP model in distinguishing causal versus non-causal miRNA-disease associations (AUROC 0.820 vs. 0.695). Case studies performed on diabetic retinopathy and hsa-mir-361 also validated the accuracy of our model. In summary, LE-MDCAP could be useful for screening causal miRNA-disease associations from general miRNA-disease associations.
