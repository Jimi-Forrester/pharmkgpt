38822493|a|AIM: To determine the frequency of sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) in the intensive care unit and its effect on nurse workload. DESIGN: A cross-sectional and correlational design was used. METHODS: The study was conducted with 158 patients in the adult intensive care unit of a hospital between October 28 and July 28, 2022. Data analysis included frequency, chi-squared/fisher's exact test, independent samples t-test, correlation analysis, simple and multiple linear regression analyses. The study adhered to the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Sepsis was detected in 12.7% of the patients, delirium in 39.9%, and SAD in 10.1%. SAD was more common in males (19%) and 56.3% of the patients were admitted to the unit from the emergency department. Patients developing SAD had significantly higher age and mean sequential organ failure evaluation, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II, and C-reactive protein and lactate scores, but their Glasgow Coma Scale scores were significantly low. There was a moderate positive relationship between the patients' Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and the presence of SAD. The most common source of infection in patients diagnosed with SAD was bloodstream infection (44.4%). SAD significantly increased nurse workload and average care time (1.8 h) and it explained 22.8% of the total variance in nurse workload. Additionally, the use of antibiotics, vasopressors and invasive mechanical ventilation significantly increased nurse workload. CONCLUSION: In the study, in patients who developed SAD increased nurse workload and average care time significantly. Preventive nursing approaches and effective management of SAD can reduce the rate of development of SAD and nurse workload. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: It is important to work with routine screening, prevention and patient-nurse ratio appropriate to the workload for SAD.
