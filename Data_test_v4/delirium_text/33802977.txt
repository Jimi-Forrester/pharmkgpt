33802977|t|Salt Sensation and Regulation.
33802977|a|Taste sensation and regulation are highly conserved in insects and mammals. Research conducted over recent decades has yielded major advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the taste sensors for a variety of taste sensations and the processes underlying regulation of ingestion depending on our internal state. Salt (NaCl) is an essential ingested nutrient. The regulation of internal sodium concentrations for physiological processes, including neuronal activity, fluid volume, acid-base balance, and muscle contraction, are extremely important issues in animal health. Both mammals and flies detect low and high NaCl concentrations as attractive and aversive tastants, respectively. These attractive or aversive behaviors can be modulated by the internal nutrient state. However, the differential encoding of the tastes underlying low and high salt concentrations in the brain remain unclear. In this review, we discuss the current view of taste sensation and modulation in the brain with an emphasis on recent advances in this field. This work presents new questions that include but are not limited to, "How do the fly's neuronal circuits process this complex salt code?" and "Why do high concentrations of salt induce a negative valence only when the need for salt is low?" A better understanding of regulation of salt homeostasis could improve our understanding of why our brains enjoy salty food so much.
