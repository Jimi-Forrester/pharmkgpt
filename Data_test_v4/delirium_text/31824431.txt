31824431|t|Adiponectin Knockout Mice Display Cognitive and Synaptic Deficits.
31824431|a|Adiponectin is an adipokine that has recently been under investigation for potential neuroprotective effects in various brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and depression. Adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) are found throughout various brain regions, including the hippocampus. However, the role of these receptors in synaptic and cognitive function is not clear. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to evaluate synaptic and cognitive function in the absence of adiponectin. The current study utilized 12-month-old adiponectin knockout (APN-KO) mice and age-matched controls to study cognitive and hippocampal synaptic alterations. We determined that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are present in the synaptosome, with AdipoR2 displaying increased presynaptic vs. postsynaptic localization, whereas AdipoR1 was enriched in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic fractions. APN-KO mice displayed cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition (NOR) and Y-maze tests. This was mirrored by deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampal Schaefer collateral pathway in APN-KO mice. APN-KO mice also displayed a reduction in basal synaptic transmission and an increase in presynaptic release probability. Deficits in LTP were rescued through hippocampal slice incubation with the adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon, indicating that acute alterations in adiponectin receptor signaling influence synaptic function. Along with the deficits in LTP, altered levels of key presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission were observed in APN-KO mice. Taken together, these results indicate that adiponectin is an important regulator of cognition and synaptic function in the hippocampus. Future studies should examine the role of specific adiponectin receptors in synaptic processes.
