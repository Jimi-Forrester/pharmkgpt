11133078|t|Benzylidene ketal derivatives as M2 muscarinic receptor antagonists.
11133078|a|Benzylidene ketal derivatives were investigated as selective M2 receptor antagonists for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Compound 10 was discovered to have subnanomolar M2 receptor affinity and 100-fold selectivity against other muscarinic receptors. Also, 10 demonstrated in vivo efficacy in rodent models of muscarinic activity and cognition.
