7803971|t|Hallucinations following cardiac surgery in a paediatric intensive care unit.
7803971|a|Abnormal behaviour as a result of benzodiezapine withdrawal has been reported in children in intensive care. Other causes of abnormal behaviour may be as a result of intensive care unit (ICU) psychosis or delirium. ICU psychosis in adults is well documented but is rarely reported in children, hence this report on a child who suffered hallucinations after cardiac surgery, and discussion on possible causes and the need for greater awareness of this possible complication.
