36287422|a|PURPOSE: The objective of this research was to obtain the speech and language therapists' point of view about the use of therapeutic lying as a communication strategy in dementia care. METHODS: The present research was a quantitative, qualitative, and descriptive cross-sectional study. Data was collected through an online survey with multiple choices and open answer questions. RESULTS: The quantitative results indicated that the majority of the speech and language therapists have already used therapeutic lying as a communicative strategy and wish to learn more about it, considering the technique as relatively valid, ethical and adequate. The qualitative results indicated the reasons for the usage of the technique: to reassure the patient in case of agitation; to encourage engagement in therapy; to avoid stress-related to memory loss; to manage difficulty or refusal to eat; to manage difficulty or refusal for drug treatment; to prevent patients from leaving the building; to manage delirium, confusion and/or paranoia; to ensure safety; and for use when other strategies do not work. CONCLUSION: The majority of speech and language therapists use therapeutic lying in their clinical practice, taking into consideration the best interest of the person with dementia, although professionals recognize their lack of knowledge on the subject. They have considered the communication strategy as relatively ethical, valid and adequate. The article calls attention to the necessity of education and guidelines for speech and language therapists in the use of therapeutic lying among people with dementia.
