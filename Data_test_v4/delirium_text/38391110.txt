38391110|t|Left ventricular hypertrophy as a risk factor for accelerated brain aging: Results from the Study of Health in Pomerania.
38391110|a|Previous studies provided evidence for the importance of cardiac structure abnormalities, in particular greater left ventricular (LV) mass, for brain aging, but longitudinal studies are lacking to date. We included 926 individuals (median age 48 years; 53% women) from the TREND cohort of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) without reduced ejection fraction or a history of myocardial infarction. LV mass index (LVMI) was determined by echocardiography at baseline. Brain morphometric measurements were derived from magnetic resonance images at baseline and 7-year follow-up. Direct effects of baseline LVMI on brain morphometry at follow-up were estimated using linear regression models with adjustment for baseline brain morphometry. At baseline, median LVMI was 40 g/m2.7 and 241 individuals (26%) met the criterion of LV hypertrophy. After correction for multiple testing, baseline LVMI was directly associated with reduced global cortical thickness and increased cortical brain age at follow-up independent from hypertension and blood pressure. Exposure-outcome relations were nonlinear and significantly stronger in the upper half of the exposure distribution. Specifically, an increase in baseline LVMI from the 50% quantile to the 95% quantile was associated additional 2.7 years (95% confidence interval = [1.5 years, 3.8 years]) of cortical brain age at follow-up. Additional regional analyses yielded bilateral effects on multiple frontal cortical regions. Our findings highlight the role of cardiac structure in brain aging. LVMI constitutes an easily measurable marker that might help to identify persons at risk for cognitive impairment and dementia.
