Owing to its heterogeneity and potential risk of Alzheimer's disease, baseline biomarkers to predict cognitive decline are important. In the present study, we developed a home-based cognitive test (HCT) to monitor cognitive changes regularly without visiting hospitals. This study aims to compare cognitive and biomarker trajectories during a 48-month period between amyloid positive SCD and amyloid negative SCD subjects. METHODS: Data will be collected from a prospective observational cohort study conducted in South Korea. Eighty participants with SCD aged >= 60 years are eligible for the study. All participants undergo annual neuropsychological tests and neurological examinations, bi-annual brain MRI scans and plasma amyloid markers, and baseline florbetaben Positron Emission Tomography scans. The amyloid burden and regional volumes will be measured. Cognitive and biomarker changes will be compared between the amyloid-positive SCD and amyloid negative SCD groups. Validation would be performed to assess reliability and feasibility of HCT. CONCLUSIONS: This study would suggest a perspective on SCD in terms of cognitive and biomarker trajectories. Baseline characteristics and biomarker status might affect faster cognitive decline and future biomarker trajectories. In addition, HCT could be an alternative option of in-person neuropsychological tests to track cognitive changes without visiting hospitals.
