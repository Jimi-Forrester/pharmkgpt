36831886|t|Neurological Consequences of Pulmonary Emboli in COVID-19 Patients: A Study of Incidence and Outcomes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
36831886|a|Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a significant consequence that is becoming more common in COVID-19 patients. The current study sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors for PE in a study population of COVID-19 patients, as well as the relationship between PE and neurological sequelae. The research also sought to analyze the consistency of neurological examination and imaging techniques in detecting neurological problems. The research comprised a total of 63 individuals with COVID-19. The incidence of PE in the study group was 9.5% for smokers, 23.8% for obese patients, 33.3% for hypertensive patients, and 19% for diabetic patients, according to the findings. After adjusting for possible confounders such as age, gender, BMI, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, a logistic regression analysis indicated that the probabilities of having neurological complications were 3.5 times greater in individuals who had PE. In conclusion, the present study highlights the high incidence of PE among patients with COVID-19 and the association between PE and neurological complications. The study also emphasizes the importance of a thorough neurological examination and imaging studies in the detection of neurological complications in patients with PE.
