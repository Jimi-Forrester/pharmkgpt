36673134|t|The Clinical Impact of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) Test in Hospitalized Patients with Suspected Sepsis: A Multicenter Prospective Study.
36673134|a|Background: Metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has the potential to detect pathogens rapidly. We aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of mNGS in hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis and evaluate its role in guiding antimicrobial therapy. Methods: A multicenter, prospective cohort study was performed. We enrolled patients with suspected sepsis, collected clinical characteristics and blood samples, and recorded the 30-day survival. Diagnostic efficacy of mNGS test and blood culture was compared, and the clinical impact of mNGS on antibiotic regimen modification was analyzed. Results: A total of 277 patients were enrolled, and 162 were diagnosed with sepsis. The mortality was 44.8% (121/270). The mNGS test exhibited shorter turn-out time (27.0 (26.0, 29.0) vs. 96.0 (72.0, 140.3) hours, p < 0.001) and higher sensitivity (90.5% vs. 36.0%, p < 0.001) compared with blood culture, especially for fungal infections. The mNGS test showed better performance for patients with mild symptoms, prior antibiotic use, and early stage of infection than blood culture, and was capable of guiding antibiotic regimen modification and improving prognosis. Higher reads of pathogens detected by mNGS were related to 30-day mortality (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Blood mNGS testing might be helpful for early etiological diagnosis of patients with suspected sepsis, guiding the antibiotic regimen modification and improving prognosis.
