18683150|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene (LRP) 766C/T polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Xinjiang Uygurs and Hans populations. METHODS: Those included in the study were > or = 50 years of age and of either Xinjiang Uygur or Han descents. Two hundred and nine individuals had AD and 220 were healthy controls. They were recruited according to ADRDA-NINCDS criteriaiThe polymorphisms of the LRP gene were determined by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The case-control analysis was adopted to analyze the frequencies of genotypes and alleles. RESULTS: (1) The distribution of genotypes or alleles of LRP gene had significant differences between the AD group and the control group in both the Xinjiang Uygurs and Hans populations (P < 0.05). (2) The frequencies of genotypes and alleles were significantly different between the Han AD and Han control group (P < 0.05). (3) The frequencies of genotypes and alleles in those > or = 65 years were significantly different from that in others (P < 0.05). There was a significant increase of AD in the C allele carriers (OR=1.98, P < 0.05). (4) The frequencies of the CC genotype and C allele in female AD patients were higher than that in female controls (P < 0.05), and the C allele carriers had significant increase of AD (OR=2.927, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The LRP 766C/T polymorphisms were significantly different between the Chinese Xinjiang Uygur and Han populations. The LRP 766C/T polymorphisms might be associated with AD in the Han population, in females and those of > or = 65 years old.
