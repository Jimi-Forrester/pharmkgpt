37094374|t|Family Presence May Reduce Postoperative Delirium After Spinal Surgery.
37094374|a|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Delirium is associated with worse outcomes, but there is a gap in literature identifying nurse-led interventions to reduce delirium in postoperative (postop) surgical spine patients. Because family presence has been associated with a variety of beneficial effects, we aimed to examine whether family presence in the spine intensive care unit (ICU) during the night after surgery was associated with less confusion or delirium on postop day 1. METHODS: This is a prospective nonrandomized pilot clinical trial with pragmatic sampling. Group designation was assigned by natural history. The family-present group was designated as patients for whom a family member remained present during the first night after surgery. The unaccompanied group was designated as patients who did not have a family member stay the night. Data include the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, the 4AT (Alertness, Attention, Abbreviated mental test, and Acute change) score, and confusion measured with the orientation item on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Baseline data were collected after admission to the spine ICU and compared with the same data collected in the morning of postop day 1. RESULTS: At baseline, 5 of 16 patients in the family-present group (31.3%) had at least 1 incidence of delirium or confusion. Similarly, 6 of 14 patients in the unaccompanied group (42.9%) had at least 1 incidence of delirium or confusion. There was a clinically relevant, but not statistically significant, reduction in postop day 1 delirium or confusion comparing the family-present (6.3%) and unaccompanied (21.4%) groups ( P = .23). CONCLUSION: Family presence may reduce delirium and confusion for patients after spine surgery. The results support continued research into examining nurse-led interventions to reduce delirium and improve outcomes for this population.
