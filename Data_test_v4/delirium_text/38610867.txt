38610867|t|Platelet Dynamics in Neurodegenerative Disorders: Investigating the Role of Platelets in Neurological Pathology.
38610867|a|Background: Neurological disorders, particularly those associated with aging, pose significant challenges in early diagnosis and treatment. The identification of specific biomarkers, such as platelets (PLTs), has emerged as a promising strategy for early detection and intervention in neurological health. This systematic review aims to explore the intricate relationship between PLT dynamics and neurological health, focusing on their potential role in cognitive functions and the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders. Methods: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search strategy was employed in the PubMed and Scholar databases to identify studies on the role of PLTs in neurological disorders published from 2013 to 2023. The search criteria included studies focusing on PLTs as biomarkers in neurological disorders, their dynamics, and their potential in monitoring disease progression and therapy effectiveness. Results: The systematic review included 104 studies, revealing PLTs as crucial biomarkers in neurocognitive disorders, acting as inflammatory mediators. The findings suggest that PLTs share common features with altered neurons, which could be utilised for monitoring disease progression and evaluating the effectiveness of treatments. PLTs are identified as significant biomarkers for detecting neurological disorders in their early stages and understanding the pathological events leading to neuronal death. Conclusions: The systematic review underscores the critical role of PLTs in neurological disorders, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of disease progression. However, it also emphasises the need for further research to solidify the use of PLTs in neurological disorders, aiming to enhance early diagnosis and intervention strategies.
