28978180|a|Risk factors of cardiovascular diseases have long been implicated as risk factors for carcinogenesis, but clear explanations for their association have not been presented. In this article, fundamental concepts from carcinogenesis, microvascular hemodynamics, and immunity are collectively reviewed and analyzed in context of the known features of vascular ageing effects, in formulating a theory that suggests reduced microvascular immunity as an important driving factor for carcinogenesis. Furthermore, scientific, preclinical, and clinical evidence that support this new theory are presented in an interdisciplinary manner, offering new explanations to previously unanswered factors that impact cancer risks and its treatment outcome such as chronic drug use, temperature, stress and exercise effects among others. Forward-looking topics discussing the implications of this new idea to cancer immunotherapeutics are also discussed.
