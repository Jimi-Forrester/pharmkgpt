37469651|t|Rare genetic causes of meningitis and encephalitis.
37469651|a|Differential diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis is often very challenging because it cannot be determined based on symptoms, and the diseases have various causes. This article explains rare genetic causes of meningitis and encephalitis. Autoinflammatory disorders include cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, familial Mediterranean fever, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome. Furthermore, other genetic disorders, such as complement factor I deficiency, phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class T mutation, and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, can present as meningitis and encephalitis.
