9206910|t|[Transthoracic-transabdominal resection of esophageal carcinoma].
9206910|a|54 patients suffering from esophageal cancer have been treated in a period from 1990 to 1994. In 29 cases curative resection was possible, corresponding to a resection rate of 54%. Average age of resected patients was 62 years. According to pTNM-classification the stages T1 and T2 amounted to 45%, T3 and T4 to 55%. Lymphatic node metastases were discovered with an incidence of 55%. In patients treated conservatively more unfavourable stage distributions and increased rates of lymphatic node metastasis were shown. Transthoracal-transabdominal esophageal resection was preferred as curative management. Lethality amounted to 13.8%. In 3 of 4 lethal cases after resection autopsy confirmed absence of tumor. Lethal complications were two respiratory insufficiencies, one suture line dehiscence and one alcoholic delirium. Survival rates were calculated by life-table-method. We consider the transthoracal-transabdominal esophageal resection as an acceptable therapeutic option in esophageal cancer offering a real chance of enduring curing.
