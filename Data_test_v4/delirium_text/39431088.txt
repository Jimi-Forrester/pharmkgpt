39431088|t|Optical Monitoring of Labile Zinc inside Metastatic Cells with Plasmonic Chemonanosensors.
39431088|a|We report the development and characterization of an optical nanosensor for the detection of labile zinc in biological environments. The readout is based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering promoted by a Raman reporter conjugated to the inner plasmonic cavity of hollow silica nanocapsules. We quantify Zn2+ by obtaining the ratio between a Zn2+-sensitive band and a Zn2+-insensitive band. The Raman reporter measures within the range from 10-5 to 10-11 M and exhibits a limit of detection of 10-11.72 M. The nanosensor discriminates between intracellular and extracellular Zn2+ concentrations.
