31821351|t|RBM3 and CIRP expressions in targeted temperature management treated cardiac arrest patients-A prospective single center study.
31821351|a|BACKGROUND: Management of cardiac arrest patients includes active body temperature control and strict prevention of fever to avoid further neurological damage. Cold-shock proteins RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3) and cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) expressions are induced in vitro in response to hypothermia and play a key role in hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. OBJECTIVE: To measure gene expressions of RBM3, CIRP, and inflammatory biomarkers in whole blood samples from targeted temperature management (TTM)-treated post-cardiac arrest patients for the potential application as clinical biomarkers for the efficacy of TTM treatment. METHODS: A prospective single center trial with the inclusion of 22 cardiac arrest patients who were treated with TTM (33 C for 24 hours) after ROSC was performed. RBM3, CIRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expressions were quantified by RT-qPCR. Serum RBM3 protein concentration was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: RBM3 mRNA expression was significantly induced in post-cardiac arrest patients in response to TTM. RBM3 mRNA was increased 2.2-fold compared to before TTM. A similar expression kinetic of 1.4-fold increase was observed for CIRP mRNA, but did not reached significancy. Serum RBM3 protein was not increased in response to TTM. IL-6 and MCP-1 expression peaked after ROSC and then significantly decreased. iNOS expression was significantly increased 24h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and TTM. CONCLUSIONS: RBM3 is temperature regulated in patients treated with TTM after CA and ROSC. RBM3 is a possible biomarker candidate to ensure the efficacy of TTM treatment in post-cardiac arrest patients and its pharmacological induction could be a potential future intervention strategy that warrants further research.
