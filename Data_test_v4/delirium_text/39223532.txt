39223532|a|BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to examine the burden of schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease/dementia, and stroke on caregivers and non-caregivers in Japan. This study also aimed to provide a comparative landscape on the burden of caregiving for each disorder. METHODS: The Japan National Health and Wellness Survey database, 2016 and 2018 was used in this study. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), work productivity, and health care utilization were assessed using a self-administered, Internet-based questionnaire. The burden of caregiving experienced by each group of caregivers was compared with background-matched non-caregivers (controls) as well as with caregivers of patients with each disorder. RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease/dementia, or stroke had lower HRQoL, higher healthcare costs and work productivity impairment than non-caregivers. Furthermore, caregivers of patients with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression had lower HRQoL and work productivity than caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease/dementia and stroke. In addition, according to the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA), caregivers of patients with schizophrenia and depression were more inclined to perceive a loss in physical strength and financial burden to the same extent as their self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a substantial caregiving burden among caregivers of patients with psychiatric and neurological diseases in Japan. The caregiver burden of psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia and depression) was greater than that of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease/dementia and stroke), suggesting a need to provide support to caregivers of patients with psychiatric disorders to be better able to care for their patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: None.
