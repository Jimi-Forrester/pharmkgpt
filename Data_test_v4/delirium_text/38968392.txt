38968392|a|Objective: Routine health care visits offer the opportunity to screen older adults for symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many women see their gynecologist as their primary health care provider. Given this unique relationship, the Women's Preventive Services Initiative and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology advocate for integrated care of women at all ages. It is well-established that women are at increased risk for AD, and memory screening of older women should be paramount in this effort. Research is needed to determine the feasibility and value of memory screening among older women at the well-woman visit. Materials and Methods: Women aged 60 and above completed a 5-item subjective memory screener at their well-woman visit at the Columbia University Integrated Women's Health Program. Women who endorsed any item were considered to have a positive screen and were given the option to pursue clinical evaluation. Rates of positive screens, item endorsement, and referral preferences were examined. Results: Of the 530 women approached, 521 agreed to complete the screener. Of those, 17.5% (n = 91) were classified as positive. The most frequently endorsed item was difficulty with memory or thinking compared with others the same age. Among women with positive screens, 57.5% were interested in pursuing clinical referrals to a memory specialist. Conclusion: Results support the feasibility and potential value of including subjective memory screening as part of a comprehensive well-woman program. Early identification of memory loss will enable investigation into the cause of memory symptoms and longitudinal monitoring of cognitive change.
