38783701|a|Background: Compliance with guidelines regarding monitoring of metabolic adverse effects induced by antipsychotics has been consistently low. We characterised and evaluated the quality of institutional quality improvement (QI) interventions designed to address disparities between guidelines and real-world practices. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of these interventions on the screening and management of metabolic risks for inpatients receiving treatment with antipsychotic medications. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of institutional QI intervention studies aimed at improving antipsychotic-associated metabolic risk monitoring in hospitalised mental disease patients. Relevant studies were identified through searches conducted in the Embase and PubMed databases, as well as by reviewing previous reviews and meta-analyses. Quantitative analyses were performed, calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the impact of QI programmes on guideline adherence in clinical practice. Results: We identified 12 intervention studies (n = 10 128 and n = 2667 patients in the pre-and post-intervention groups, respectively) and included them in our meta-analysis. QI interventions demonstrated effectiveness in bridging the guideline-practice gap in monitoring antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects, as supported by the ORs and 95% CIs for post-intervention monitoring of plasma glucose, lipids, and blood pressure (BP) vs the pre-intervention period being OR = 6.90 (95% CI = 1.51-31.48), OR = 5.39 (95% CI = 4.01-7.24), and OR = 4.81 (95% CI = 1.23-18.79), respectively. Only 33.3% (4/12) of studies reported screening rates for all four metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, lipids, weight/body mass index (BMI), and BP). The median rates for metabolic screening of plasma glucose, lipids, and BP increased from 51.0-80.0%, 28.7-66.7%, and 91.7-95.8%, respectively. Up to 66.7% (8/12) of intervention studies lacked follow-up measures to treat or manage identified risks in hospitalised psychiatric patients, such as patient referrals, prescription of medications, and switching of antipsychotics. The odds of monitoring weight/BMI and glucose were greatest when QI programmes involved the participation of multidisciplinary health care professionals and patients, yielding OR = 3.35 (95% CI = 2.45-4.59) and OR = 57.51 (95% CI = 24.11-137.21), respectively. Conclusions: Institutional QI interventions were effective in enhancing monitoring practices in alignment with established guidelines for metabolic risk screening among hospitalised patients with mental disorders maintained on antipsychotic medications. Future institutional QI programmes should incorporate multidisciplinary strategies involving patient engagement and extend their focus beyond screening to incorporate follow-up risk management strategies once risks have been identified.
