21678945|t|Structures and stabilities of Fe2+/3+ complexes relevant to Alzheimer's disease: an ab initio study.
21678945|a|Iron is one of the most abundant metals found in senile plaques of post mortem patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, the interaction mode between iron ions and beta-amyloid peptide as well as their precise affinity is unknown. In this study we apply ab initio computational methodology to calculate binding energies of Fe(2+/3+) with the His13-His14 sequence of Abeta, as well as other important ligands such as His6 and Tyr10. Calculations were carried out at the "MP2/6-311+G(2df,2p)"//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory and solvent effects included by the IEFPCM procedure. Several reaction paths for the binding of imidazole, phenol, and the His13-His14 fragment (modeled by N-(2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl)-3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propanamide) were sequentially explored. The results show that the most stable complexes containing His13-His14 and phenolate of Tyr10 are the pentacoordinated [Fe(2+)(O-HisHis)(PhO(-))(H(2)O)](+) and [Fe(3+)(N-HisHis)(PhO(-))(H(2)O)](+) compounds and that simultaneous coordination of tyrosine and His13-His14 to Fe(2+/3+) is thermodynamically favorable in water at physiological pH. Computed Raman spectra confirm the conclusion obtained by Miura et al. (  Biochemistry     2000  ,   39  ,   7024  ) that tyrosine is coordinated to Fe(3+) but do not exclude coordination of imidazoles. Finally, calculations of standard reduction potentials indicate that phenol coordination reduces the redox activity of the iron/Abeta complexes.
