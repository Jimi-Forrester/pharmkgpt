30213841|t|An Abeta42 variant that inhibits intra- and extracellular amyloid aggregation and enhances cell viability.
30213841|a|Aggregation and accumulation of the 42-residue amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42) in the extracellular matrix and within neuronal cells is considered a major cause of neuronal cell cytotoxicity and death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Therefore, molecules that bind to Abeta42 and prevent its aggregation are therapeutically promising as AD treatment. Here, we show that a non-self-aggregating Abeta42 variant carrying two surface mutations, F19S and L34P (Abeta42DM), inhibits wild-type Abeta42 aggregation and significantly reduces Abeta42-mediated cell cytotoxicity. In addition, Abeta42DM inhibits the uptake and internalization of extracellularly added pre-formed Abeta42 aggregates into cells. This was the case in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells co-expressing Abeta42 and Abeta42DM or following pre-treatment of cells with extracellular soluble forms of the two peptides, even at high Abeta42 to Abeta42DM molar ratios. In cells, Abeta42DM associates with Abeta42, while in vitro, the two soluble recombinant peptides exhibit nano-molar binding affinity. Importantly, Abeta42DM potently suppresses Abeta42 amyloid aggregation in vitro, as demonstrated by thioflavin T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy for detecting amyloid fibrils. Overall, we present a new approach for inhibiting Abeta42 fibril formation both within and outside cells. Accordingly, Abeta42DM should be evaluated in vivo for potential use as a therapeutic lead for treating AD.
