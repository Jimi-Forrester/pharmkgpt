31453129|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aging-dependent activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) has been suggested to be important in the onset of dementia. To discover novel therapeutic Kampo medicines for dementia, we examined the effects of orengedokuto (OGT; huang lian jiedu tang) and san'oshashinto (SST; san huang xie xin tang) on memory deficits and GSK-3beta activity in senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The object recognition test (ORT) and conditioned fear memory test (CFT) were employed to elucidate short-term working memory and long-term fear memory. The activity of GSK-3beta and the phosphorylation of related molecules were measured using a kinase assay and Western blotting. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: OGT and SST attenuated memory deficits in SAMP8 in ORT, but not in CFT. In ex vivo experiments, cortical GSK-3beta activity was significantly stronger in SAMP8 than in SAMR1. The enhanced cortical GSK-3beta activity in SAMP8 was accompanied by a significant increase in the level of phosphorylated collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), an important factor that is involved in the regulation of microtubule stability. OGT and SST attenuated not only increases in cortical GSK-3beta activity, but also the levels of phosphorylated CRMP2 in SAMP8. In vitro experiments, flavonoids contained in these kampo medicines, inhibited GSK-3beta activity in concentration-dependent manners. These results suggest that OGT and SST prevent aging-induced short-term working memory deficits by inhibiting aging-dependent elevations in the cortical GSK-3beta activity and subsequent CRMP2 phosphorylation.
