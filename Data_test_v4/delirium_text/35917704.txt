35917704|a|Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), have become severe health concern worldwide. The treatment of the CNS diseases is of great challenges due largely to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). On the one hand, BBB protects brain from the harmful exogenous molecules via inhibiting their entry into the brain. On the other hand, it also hampers the transport of therapeutic drugs into the brain, resulting in the difficulties in treating the CNS diseases. In the past decades, nanoparticles-based drug delivery systems have shown great potentials in overcoming the BBB owing to their unique physicochemical properties, such as small size and specific morphology. In addition, functionalization of nanomaterials confers these nanocarriers controlled drug release features and targeting capacities. These properties make nanocarriers the potent delivery systems for treating the CNS disorders. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in nanoparticles-based systems for the CNS delivery, including the conventional and innovative systems. The prerequisites, drawbacks and challenges of nanocarriers (such as protein corona formation) in the CNS delivery are also discussed.
