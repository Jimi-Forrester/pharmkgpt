38610712|t|Normal-Tension Glaucoma and Potential Clinical Links to Alzheimer's Disease.
38610712|a|Glaucoma is a group of optic neuropathies and the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. Normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) is a subtype of glaucoma that is characterized by a typical pattern of peripheral retinal loss, in which the patient's intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered within the normal range (<21 mmHg). Currently, the only targetable risk factor for glaucoma is lowering IOP, and patients with NTG continue to experience visual field loss after IOP-lowering treatments. This demonstrates the need for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of NTG and underlying mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Recent studies have found significant connections between NTG and cerebral manifestations, suggesting NTG as a neurodegenerative disease beyond the eye. Gaining a better understanding of NTG can potentially provide new Alzheimer's Disease diagnostics capabilities. This review identifies the epidemiology, current biomarkers, altered fluid dynamics, and cerebral and ocular manifestations to examine connections and discrepancies between the mechanisms of NTG and Alzheimer's Disease.
