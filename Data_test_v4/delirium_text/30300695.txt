30300695|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive loss of neurons which often results in deterioration of memory and cognitive function. The development of AD is highly associated with the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid beta (Abeta) induces neurotoxicity and contributes to the development of AD. Recent evidences also highlighted the importance of neuroglobin (Ngb) in ameliorating AD. This study assessed the ability of fucosterol, a phytosterol found in brown alga, in protecting SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Its effects on the mRNA levels of APP and Ngb as well as the intracellular Abeta levels were also determined in Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to fucosterol prior to Abeta treatment. The effect on apoptosis was determined using Annexin V FITC staining and mRNA expression was studied using RT-PCR. Flow cytometry confirmed the protective effects of fucosterol on SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with fucosterol increased the Ngb mRNA levels but reduced the levels of APP mRNA and intracellular Abeta in Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells. These observations demonstrated the protective properties of fucosterol against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells.
