14649718|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the age-related deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) 40/42 peptide aggregates in vulnerable brain regions. Multiple levels of evidence implicate a central role for A beta in the pathophysiology of AD. A beta is generated by the regulated cleavage of a = 700 amino acid A beta precursor protein (betaAPP). Full-length betaAPP can undergo proteolytic cleavage either within the A beta domain to generate secreted sbetaAPP alpha or at the N-terminal and C-terminal domain(s) of A beta to generate amyloidogenic A beta peptides. Several epidemiological studies have reported that estrogen replacement therapy protects against the development of AD in postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to elucidate the antioxidant neuroprotective mechanism of Bombusae concretio Salicea (BC). BC was effective protectants against oxidative glutamate toxicity in the murine neuroblastoma cells (N2a) and human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-MC). BC exhibited similar protective properties against oxidative glutamate toxicity and H2O2 toxicity. BC exhibited an antioxidant activity at approximately 20 microg/ml. BC of 5 microg/ml was ineffective in preventing the oxidative modification of LDL. The half-maximal effective concentration for BC was 16 microg/ml. These results suggested that BC supplementation in elderly men may be protective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report here that treatment with BC increases the secretion of the nonamyloidogenic APP fragment, sbetaAPP alpha and decreases the secretion of A beta peptides from N2a cells and rat primary cerebrocortical neurons. These results raise the possibility that BC supplementation in elderly men may be protective in the treatment of AD.
