39072364|t|Applying Spatial Metabolomics To Investigate Age- and Drug-Induced Neurochemical Changes.
39072364|a|In an era when population aging is increasing the burden of neurodegenerative conditions, deciphering the mechanisms underlying brain senescence is more important than ever. Here, we present a spatial metabolomics analysis of age-induced neurochemical alterations in the mouse brain using negative ionization mode mass spectrometry imaging. The age-dependent effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine were simultaneously examined. For ultrahigh mass resolution analysis, we utilized a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometer. To complement this, a trapped ion mobility spectrometry time-of-flight analyzer provided high speed and lateral resolution. The chosen approach facilitated the detection and identification of a wide range of metabolites, from amino acids to sphingolipids. We reported significant, age-dependent alterations in brain lipids which were most evident for sulfatides and lysophosphatidic acids. Sulfatide species, which are mainly localized to white matter, either increased or decreased with age, depending on the carbon chain length and hydroxylation stage. Lysophosphatidic acids were found to decrease with age in the detailed cortical and hippocampal subregions. An age-dependent increase in the glutamine/glutamate ratio, an indicator of glia-neuron interconnection and neurotoxicity, was detected after tacrine administration. The presented metabolic mapping approach was able to provide visualizations of the lipid signaling and neurotransmission alterations induced by early aging and can thus be beneficial to further elucidating age-related neurochemical pathways.
