31092130|a|This article explores the pragmatic sensibilities that are implicit in idioms of distress among family caregivers for Alzheimer's disease in Teotitlan del Valle, a rural Zapotec-speaking community in Oaxaca, Mexico. Through analysis of caregivers' perceptions of progressive memory loss and related etiological understandings, this article emphasizes the pragmatism inherent to local health perspectives. In so doing, the article revisits Nichter's earliest formulation of idioms of distress as providing an alternative epistemological framework to appreciate how illness is varyingly understood. Such a framework is useful for understanding how idioms of distress are not aimed towards attaining accuracy about what illness is in an objective sense, but rather put into focus how such descriptions are both constitutive of-and themselves pragmatic responses to-broader social circumstances. This article concludes with a consideration of how idioms of distress empower individuals as agents of action.
