18566600|t|Abeta40 promotes neuronal cell fate in neural progenitor cells.
18566600|a|Sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and then gamma- secretase gives rise to Abeta(1-40) (Abeta40), a major species of Abeta (beta-amyloid) produced by neurons under physiological conditions. Abeta(1-42) (Abeta42), a minor species of Abeta, is also produced by a similar but less understood mechanism of the gamma-secretase. The physiological functions of these Abeta species remain to be defined. In this report, we demonstrate that freshly prepared soluble Abeta40 significantly promotes neurogenesis in primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs). First, Abeta40 increases neuronal markers as determined by NeuN expression and Tuj1 promoter activity, differing from Abeta42, which induces astrocyte markers in NPCs. Second, Abeta40 induces neuronal differentiation at the end of S-phase in the cell cycle. Third, Abeta40 promotes NPC entry into S-phase, playing a role in NPC self-renewal. Interestingly, Abeta40 does not significantly increase apoptotic indexes such as DNA condensation and DNA fragmentation. In addition, Abeta40 does not augment caspase-3 activation in NeuN(+) or nestin(+) cells. Collectively, this report provides strong evidence that Abeta40 is a neurogenic factor and suggests that the debilitated function of Abeta40 in neurogenesis may account for the shortage of neurons in Alzheimer's disease.
