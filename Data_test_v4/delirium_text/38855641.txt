38855641|a|Background: The current biomarker-supported diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hindered by invasiveness and cost issues. This study aimed to address these challenges by utilizing portable electroencephalography (EEG). We propose a novel, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for identifying AD, using a sample of patients with biomarker-verified AD, to facilitate early and accessible disease screening. Methods: This study included 35 patients with biomarker-verified AD, confirmed via cerebrospinal fluid sampling, and 35 age- and sex-balanced healthy volunteers (HVs). All participants underwent portable EEG recordings, focusing on 2-minute resting-state EEG epochs with closed eyes state. EEG recordings were transformed into scalogram images, which were analyzed using "vision Transformer(ViT)," a cutting-edge deep learning model, to differentiate patients from HVs. Results: The application of ViT to the scalogram images derived from portable EEG data demonstrated a significant capability to distinguish between patients with biomarker-verified AD and HVs. The method achieved an accuracy of 73%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80, indicating robust performance in identifying AD pathology using neurophysiological measures. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential of portable EEG combined with advanced deep learning techniques as a transformative tool for screening of biomarker-verified AD. This study not only contributes to the neurophysiological understanding of AD but also opens new avenues for the development of accessible and non-invasive diagnostic methods. The proposed approach paves the way for future clinical applications, offering a promising solution to the limitations of advanced diagnostic practices for dementia.
