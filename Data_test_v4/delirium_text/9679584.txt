9679584|t|[Prediction of survival of terminally ill cancer patients--a prospective study].
9679584|a|Planning effective palliative care requires accurate estimation of survival. A prospective study was performed on 150 hospice inpatients to identify prognostic factors in terminally ill cancer patients. By univariate analysis, eleven factors were found to be significantly associated with shortened survival: poor performance status, dyspnea at rest, death rattle, appetite loss, dysphagia, dry mouth, general malaise, edema, stomatitis, fever, and delirium. Multiple regression analysis showed that five factors were independent predictors of survival: performance status, dyspnea at rest, appetite loss, edema, and delirium. We discussed current problems and future directions of survival prediction for terminally ill cancer patients.
