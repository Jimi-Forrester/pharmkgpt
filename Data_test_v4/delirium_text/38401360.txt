38401360|t|Hybrid pharmacophore design and synthesis of donepezil-inspired aurone derivative salts as multifunctional acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
38401360|a|Flavonoids, a ubiquitous group of plant polyphenols, are well-known for their beneficial effects on human health. Their phenylchromane skeletons have structural similarities to donepezil [the US FDA-approved drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD)]. The objective of this study was to design and synthesize valuable agents derived from flavonoids for relieving the symptoms of AD. A variety of flavonoid derivative salts incorporating benzylpyridinium units were synthesized and several of them remarkedly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in vitro. Additionally, aurone derivative salts protected against cell death resulting from t-BHP exposure in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and slightly promoted neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, they potently suppressed the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of donepezil-inspired aurone derivative salts as multipotent candidates for AD.
