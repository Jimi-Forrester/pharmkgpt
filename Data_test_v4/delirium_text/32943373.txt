32943373|a|BACKGROUND: Evaluation of patients with acute decompensated heart failure includes symptom review, biomarker measurement and comorbidity assessment. Early objective evaluation of functional status is generally not performed. AIM: To investigate whether a simple low-impact functional assessment and measurement of sarcopenia would be safe, feasible and predictive of hospital length of stay and all-cause 30-day hospital readmission. METHODS: We administered 3-minute bicycle ergometry and hand grip strength tests at admission and discharge to patients for whom a decision to admit for heart failure management was made in the emergency department. Associations were examined between test results and length of stay and 30-day readmission. Exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome, hypoxia, end-stage renal disease, dementia/delirium and inability to sit at bedside. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the visual analogue scale for dyspnoea were administered at admission, the visual analogue scale at discharge and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12 at 30 days. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled: 58% were female; the mean age was 66.2+-12.5 years; 24% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Bicycle ergometry variables did not correlate with outcomes. Change in handgrip strength correlated with readmission, but not after adjustment (rpartial=0.14; P=0.35). Total diuretic dose correlated with length of stay; only discharge visual analogue scale and baseline lung disease had significant adjusted correlations with readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Functional assessment in the emergency department of patients admitted for heart failure did not predict outcomes. However, the prognostic value of these assessments for decision-making about disposition (admission or discharge) may still be warranted.
