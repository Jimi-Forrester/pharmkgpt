38559925|t|Curcumin-Conjugated PAMAM Dendrimers of Two Generations: Comparative Analysis of Physiochemical Properties Using Adriatic Topological Indices.
38559925|a|Curcumin (C21H20O6) is a polyphenol found in the plant Curcuma longa. Even though it possesses many pharmacological effects, owing to its limited intestinal absorption, solubility, and oral bioavailability, it is more often used as a health supplement than as a lead chemical. The poly(amido)amine (PAMAM) dendrimer (nanostructure) is utilized to enhance the stability and targeted delivery of drugs. Recently, curcumin was conjugated with the PAMAM dendrimer and analyzed for its photostability. Further investigation into the physiochemical characteristics of different generations can facilitate curcumins' targeted delivery for many diseases, including cancer. However, many of these conjugates' physiochemical properties are not available in databases since they have not been explored theoretically or experimentally. In this article, QSAR/QSPR (quantitative structure-activity relationship/quantitative structure-property relationship) analysis of physiochemical properties was carried out for component structures, which produced encouraging results. Hence, 16 discrete adriatic topological indices and their associated entropy measures were evaluated to theoretically predict a few physiochemical properties of the conjugated structure. The predictions will aid the chemist in drug designing.
