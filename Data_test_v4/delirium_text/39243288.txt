39243288|a|INTRODUCTION: Hospitalised patients are at increased risk of poor sleep quality which can negatively impact on recovery and quality of life. This study aimed to assess sleep quality in hospitalised patients and explore the factors associated with poor sleep. METHODS: Prospective data were collected from 84 respiratory ward inpatients at time of discharge using a Likert scale questionnaire on contributing factors to sleep quality. Differences between groups reporting good and poor quality sleep were recorded. RESULTS: Most participants (77%) described inpatient sleep quality to be worse or much worse compared to their home environment. Noise (39%), checking of vital signs (33%) and light (24%) were most frequently identified as factors disrupting sleep. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that men (OR 2.8, CI 1.1-7.4, p = 0.037) and those in shared rooms (OR 3.9, CI 1.4-10.9, p = 0.009) were more likely to be affected by noise. Younger patients (OR 0.92, CI 0.88-0.96, p < 0.001) and those in shared rooms (OR 8.5 CI 1.9-37.9, p < 0.001) were more likely to be affected by light. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a high proportion of hospitalised respiratory patients on a medical ward reported poorer sleep quality compared to home due to operational interruptions and noise. Age, gender and room type further modified the sleep disruption. Future research should focus on whether strategies to reduce interruptions and noise will improve sleep quality and clinical outcomes.
