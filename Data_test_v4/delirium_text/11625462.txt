11625462|a|Van Gogh was during his last years exposed to several potentially toxic substances such as; bromides, lead, camphor and terpene oils in absinthe liquor. All of them produce signs of toxicity which are similar to the symptoms known from van Gogh's attacks of illness; hallucinations, confusion, delirium, convulsions and agitation. However, the many interpretations of van Gogh's illness and state of mind have in most cases not taken into account the possible influence of toxic chemicals.
