37645746|a|The direct causes of neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other dementias, are not known. Here we identify serum amyloid P component (SAP), a constitutive plasma protein normally excluded from the brain, as a potential drug target. After meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies, comprising 44,288 participants, cis -Mendelian randomization showed that genes responsible for higher plasma SAP values are significantly associated with AD, Lewy body dementia and plasma tau concentration. These genetic findings are consistent with experimental evidence of SAP neurotoxicity and the strong, independent association of neocortex SAP content with dementia at death. Depletion of SAP from the blood and from the brain, as is provided by the safe, well tolerated, experimental drug, miridesap, may therefore contribute to treatment of neurodegeneration.
