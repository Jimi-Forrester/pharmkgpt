29562521|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two aberrant structures: namely senile plaques, composed of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), and neurofibrillary tangles, composed of tau protein. In this regard, Abeta and tau protein have been widely studied in research efforts aiming to find a therapy for AD. Abeta and tau pathologies do not always overlap. The precursor of Abeta is expressed in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas tau is mainly a neuronal protein. Since AD is a disease of the CNS, it has been proposed that Abeta may initiate the disease process, with tau being the executor. In this review, we will focus on future studies of tau pathology, although we will comment on new beginnings for AD, as other molecules other than Abeta and tau may be involved in the onset of dementia.
