34865397|a|Objective: To analyze the related factors that affect the one-year mortality in elderly patients following hip fracture surgery. Methods: The clinical data of the elderly patients who needed a surgery for hip fracture in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2017 to April 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the inclusion criteria of the study, 489 cases were included. Then the information of patients including age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, type of fracture, Braden score at admission, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, length of hospital stay, type of anesthesia, whole blood cells analysis were collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate the factors related to one-year mortality of patients. Results: After excluding 39 patients, 450 patients were finally included. Patients in this cohort study had a mortality rate of 3.33% (15/450) at 1 month, 7.78% (35/450) at half a year, and 10.89% (49/450) at 1 year after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that age, sex, ASA score, type of fracture, Charlson comorbidity index, Braden score at admission, type of analgesia, preoperative hemoglobin concentration, preoperative albumin concentration, postoperative delirium of high activity correlated with one-year mortality after surgery. Further, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age>80 years old (HR=2.32, 95%CI: 1.11-4.85, P=0.025), Charlson comorbidity index >= 3 (HR=3.24, 95%CI:1.75-6.03, P<0.001), Braden score at admission <=16 (HR=1.93, 95%CI:1.03-3.57, P=0.040) and postoperative delirium of high activity (HR=2.49, 95%CI:1.16-5.35, P=0.019) were risk factors for one-year mortality. Conclusions: The current study indicates that one-year mortality rate of elderly patients following hip fracture surgery is 10.89%. Meanwhile, age>80 years, Charlson comorbidity index >= 3, Braden score at admission <= 16, postoperative delirium of high activity are risk factors for one-year mortality.
