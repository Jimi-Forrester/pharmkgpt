23659704|t|Delirium and cardiac surgery: progress - and more questions.
23659704|a|Post-operative delirium is a common and dangerous complication of cardiac surgery. Many risk factors for delirium have been identified, but its pathogenesis remains largely elusive. A study by Kazmierski and colleagues investigates a more recently considered risk factor for delirium: perturbations in the hypothalamic pituitary axis and depression. This and further work may help define novel prevention and treatment strategies for delirium.
