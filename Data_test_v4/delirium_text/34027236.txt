34027236|a|Evidence suggests that increased level/aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides initiate neurodegeneration and subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). At present, there is no effective treatment for AD. In this study, we reported the effects of gold nanoparticles surface-functionalized with a plant-based amino acid mimosine (Mimo-AuNPs), which is found to cross the blood-brain barrier, on the Abeta fibrillization process and toxicity. Thioflavin T kinetic assays, fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy data showed that Mimo-AuNPs were able to suppress the spontaneous and seed-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation. Spectroscopic studies, molecular docking and biochemical analyses further revealed that Mimo-AuNPs stabilize Abeta1-42 to remain in its monomeric state by interacting with the hydrophobic domain of Abeta1-42 (i.e., Lys16 to Ala21) there by preventing a conformational shift towards the beta-sheet structure. Additionally, Mimo-AuNPs were found to trigger the disassembly of matured Abeta1-42 fibers and increased neuronal viability by reducing phosphorylation of tau protein and the production of oxyradicals. Collectively, these results reveal that the surface-functionalization of gold nanoparticles with mimosine can attenuate Abeta fibrillization and neuronal toxicity. Thus, we propose Mimo-AuNPs may be used as a potential treatment strategy towards AD-related pathologies.
