28798235|t|Atomic-resolution map of the interactions between an amyloid inhibitor protein and amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the monomer and protofibril states.
28798235|a|Self-association of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and serves as a general prototype for amyloid formation. A key endogenous inhibitor of Abeta self-association is human serum albumin (HSA), which binds ~90% of plasma Abeta. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which HSA binds Abeta monomers and protofibrils is not fully understood. Here, using dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR and relaxation experiments complemented by morphological characterization, we mapped the HSA-Abeta interactions at atomic resolution by examining the effects of HSA on Abeta monomers and soluble high-molecular weight oligomeric protofibrils. We found that HSA binds both monomeric and protofibrillar Abeta, but the affinity of HSA for Abeta monomers is lower than for Abeta protofibrils (Kd values are submillimolar rather than micromolar) yet physiologically relevant because of the ~0.6-0.7 mm plasma HSA concentration. In both Abeta protofibrils and monomers, HSA targets key Abeta self-recognition sites spanning the beta strands found in cross-beta protofibril structures, leading to a net switch from direct to tethered contacts between the monomeric Abeta and the protofibril surface. These HSA-Abeta interactions are isoform-specific, because the HSA affinity of Abeta monomers is lower for Abeta(1-42) than for Abeta(1-40). In addition, the HSA-induced perturbations of the monomer/protofibrils pseudo-equilibrium extend to the C-terminal residues in the Abeta(1-42) isoform but not in Abeta(1-40). These results provide an unprecedented view of how albumin interacts with Abeta and illustrate the potential of dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR in mapping the interactions between amyloid-inhibitory proteins and amyloidogenic peptides.
