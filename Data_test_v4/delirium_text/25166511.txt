25166511|t|Non-SMC condensin I complex, subunit D2 gene polymorphisms are associated with Parkinson's disease: a Han Chinese study.
25166511|a|Previous studies have indicated that non-SMC condensin I complex, subunit D2 (NCAPD2), an important protein in chromosome condensation, gene polymorphisms are associated with Alzheimer's disease. But no study has shown the relationship between NCAPD2 polymorphisms and Parkinson's disease. Here, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the relationship between NCAPD2 polymorphisms and the risk of Parkinson's disease in a Han Chinese population. Two single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) of NCAPD2 (rs7311174 and rs2072374) showed significant p values (p = 0.046 and p = 0.043, respectively) in 265 patients and 267 controls. Further analysis showed an effect of age and gender on the relationship between the two SNPs and the risk for Parkinson's disease. The A allele of rs7311174 and the T allele of rs2072374 were protective in the male patients (p = 0.016 and p = 0.019, respectively). The frequencies of the T allele of rs7311174 and the C allele of rs2072374 were significantly associated with late-onset Parkinson's disease (p = 0.048 and p = 0.044, respectively). This research demonstrates a positive relationship between the NCAPD2 gene and the risk for Parkinson's disease in a Han Chinese population and provides a potential genetic marker for sporadic Parkinson's disease.
