35187165|t|Value of Postoperative Serum Albumin to Predict Postoperative Complication Severity in Spinal Tuberculosis.
35187165|a|BACKGROUND: Many complications occur after surgery in patients with spinal tuberculosis (STB); however, the severity varies in different patients. The complications' severity is evaluated from grades I to V by the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC), and grade V is the most severe. Most complications are mild, and only severe complications are life threatening, and thus, it is important to identify severe complications in patients with STB. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors of postoperative complication severity in patients with STB. METHODS: Between January 2012 and May 2021, a retrospective study included 188 patients that underwent STB debridement surgery. The patients were divided into three groups based on postoperative complication severity. Clinical characteristics measured included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities of diabetes mellitus and pulmonary tuberculosis, alcohol use and smoking history, course of disease, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative serum albumin, preoperative lymphocytes, preoperative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), surgical approach, operating time, blood loss during surgery, postoperative hemoglobin, and postoperative serum albumin. The clinical characteristics of patients with STB who developed postoperative complications were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 188 patients suffered at least one postoperative complication; 77, 91, and 20 patients experienced grade I, II, and III-IV complications, respectively. In the univariate analysis, sex, diabetes mellitus, postoperative hemoglobin, and postoperative albumin are statistically significant. In the multivariable analysis, postoperative albumin (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.861, P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor of the postoperative complication severity in patients with STB. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the optimal cutoff values for postoperative albumin were 32 g/L (sensitivity: 0.571, specificity: 0.714, area under the ROC curve: 0.680) and 30 g/L (sensitivity: 0.649, specificity: 0.800, area under the ROC curve: 0.697) for grade II and grade III-IV complications, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative albumin is an independent risk factor for postoperative complication severity in patients with STB. The improvement of postoperative albumin levels may reduce the risk of severe complications in patients with STB.
