15760650|t|The regulation of beta-secretase by cholesterol and statins in Alzheimer's disease.
15760650|a|Epidemiologists have found a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people taking statins (cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors). We have reported previously that, in cell culture, lovastatin decreases the output of beta-amyloid, a peptide that is toxic to neurones, and is reputably the prime cause of neurodegeneration seen in AD. This report probes the mechanism of statin protection further by finding out how the protease beta-secretase, that releases beta-amyloid from its precursor protein, behaves under changed cholesterol levels induced by statins. We found that, with high cellular cholesterol levels, there is a decrease in glycosylation of mature oligosaccharides in beta-secretase, whereas in the presence of lovastatin, glycosylation progresses further. Moreover, lovastatin does not inhibit beta-secretase in vitro. Thus, the cholesterol and statin effects are due to changes in cellular targeting induced by changed cholesterol gradients. Some of these changes are mimicked by the action of U18666A, a cholesterol-transport inhibitor that produces a defect in cells seen in patients with Neimann Pick's disorder.
