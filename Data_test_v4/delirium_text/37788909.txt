37788909|t|Causal links of alpha-thalassemia indices and cardiometabolic traits and diabetes: MR study.
37788909|a|Our study aimed to investigate if genetic variants around 16p13.3's HBA1 locus, associated with erythrocyte indices and HbA1c levels, predict alpha-thalassemia-related erythrocyte indices, cardiometabolic traits, and diabetes risk in Taiwanese individuals. We analyzed Taiwan Biobank data, including whole-genome sequencing from 1,493 participants and genotyping arrays from 129,542 individuals. First, we performed regional association analysis using whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic variants significantly associated with erythrocyte indices, confirming their linkage disequilibrium with the alpha0 thalassemia --SEA deletion mutation, a common cause of alpha-thalassemia in Southeast Asian populations. Deletion mutation sequencing further validated these variants' association with alpha-thalassemia. Subsequently, we analyzed genotyping array data, revealing associations between specific genetic variants and cardiometabolic traits, including lipid profiles, HbA1c levels, bilirubin levels, and diabetes risk. Using Mendelian randomization, we established causal relationships between alpha-thalassemia-related erythrocyte indices and cardiometabolic traits, elucidating their role in diabetes susceptibility. Our findings highlight genetic variants around the alpha-globin genes as surrogate markers for common alpha-thalassemia mutations in Taiwan, emphasizing the causal links between alpha-thalassemia-related erythrocyte indices, cardiometabolic traits, and heightened diabetes risk.
