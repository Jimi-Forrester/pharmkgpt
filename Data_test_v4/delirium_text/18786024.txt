18786024|a|PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to survey nurse practitioners (NPs) to determine their comfort level with knowledge about caring for individuals aged 65 years and older and to obtain their input on enhancing geriatric content in the educational preparation of advanced practice nurses who provide care to older adults but are not specialists in gerontology. DATA SOURCES: The sample consisted of 500 randomly selected NPs who were certified to practice in New York State. The Geriatric Curriculum Survey designed by the researchers was based on the 47 "Older Adult Care" competencies developed by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. The survey was mailed to the subjects along with a stamped self-addressed envelope to facilitate its return. Two hundred and twenty-two surveys (44%) were returned. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the respondents were comfortable with their assessment skill knowledge of individuals aged 65 years and older in all areas except those related to cultural/ethnic items. Over half of the respondents were only "somewhat comfortable" with knowledge of management of Alzheimer's disease, delirium, dementia, neurological problems, polypharmacy, and sleep issues. Finally, respondents were asked to rate their knowledge comfort level on topics relevant to physical and psychosocial issues of individuals aged 65 years and older. The majority of respondents only felt "somewhat comfortable" with their knowledge on all but one of the nine items in this category. Health promotion and disease prevention was the only item that over 50% of the respondents felt "very knowledgeable" about. Ninety-five percent indicated they would be better prepared to care for individuals aged 65 years and older if a didactic course in geriatrics was required in their program of study. Seventy percent indicated they would consider taking an online course in geriatrics. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Based on the results of this study, an online, four-credit geriatric-focused course "Issues in Geriatric Management" was developed. The course is required in the acute care and adult NP programs. Eventually, this course will be offered as continuing education credit for practicing NPs. The offering of a course focused on geriatrics will help to better prepare NPs to care for the growing number of elderly in this country.
