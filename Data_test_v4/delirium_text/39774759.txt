39774759|a|AIMS: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) have beneficial effects on the heart. Associations between ChEI-use and reduced mortality and cardiovascular events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been shown. Whether these associations exist in those with both heart failure (HF) and AD is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: A propensity score (PS) matched cohort with patients with HF and AD was obtained through linking registers for cognitive/dementia disorders, comorbidities, drug prescription, and death, in Sweden, to analyze associations between ChEI-use and risk of mortality or hospitalization for HF, stroke, or myocardial infarction, were examined.In 455 patients with and 455 without ChEI treatment, ChEI use was associated with reductions of mortality and hospitalization due to HF by 21% (0,79; CI 0.66-0.96) and 47% (0,53; CI 0.38-0.75) respectively. Donepezil and galantamine but not rivastigmine were associated with lower risk of death compared to non-users. Donepezil was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to HF compared to non-users. There was no significant difference in hospitalization for bradycardia, AV block or implantation of pacemaker between ChEI use and non-use. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in persons with HF and AD, treatment with ChEIs is associated with improved survival and a decreased risk of hospital care for HF but results due to type of ChEI vary.
