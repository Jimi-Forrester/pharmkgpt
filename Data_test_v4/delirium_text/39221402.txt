39221402|t|Navigating Prevention: A Systematic Review of Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease in High-Risk and Affected Individuals.
39221402|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a widespread cause of dementia globally, and its prevalence is increasing due to the aging population. Two key pathologies typically identify this neurodegenerative disease process: the accumulation of amyloid plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau. Diagnosis relies on the patient's clinical presentation meeting specific criteria, along with the use of fluid and imaging biomarkers. The current treatment focuses on addressing symptoms, with ongoing trials aiming to decrease the production and overall impact of brain pathology. Here, we explore various methods to minimize the risks of AD in patients and individuals at high risk of developing it. To address this, we carefully selected 10 articles that discuss various prevention methods used today to promote brain health, including diets that are believed to have neuroprotective properties. The study findings emphasize the importance of further strengthening the evidence and conducting larger randomized controlled trials to gain a better understanding of the potential benefits for individuals at high risk of developing AD, as well as those already diagnosed with it.
