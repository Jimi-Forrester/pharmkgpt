12030277|t|Vitamin B12 deficiency, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and epidermal growth factor: a novel function for vitamin B12?
12030277|a|Vitamin B12 deficiency was recently shown to be associated with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and decreased levels of epidermal growth factor in both rats and humans. These findings suggest a novel pathogenetic mechanism underlying the neuropathology of vitamin B12 deficiency. They may also explain putative relationships between vitamin B12 deficiency and certain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS.
