34180416|t|Widespread Reduced Density of Noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus Axons in the App Knock-In Mouse Model of Amyloid-beta Amyloidosis.
34180416|a|BACKGROUND: The locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem nucleus comprising noradrenergic neurons, is one of the earliest regions affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in the cortex in AD is thought to exacerbate the age-related loss of LC neurons, which may lead to cortical tau pathology. However, mechanisms underlying LC neurodegeneration remain elusive. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aimed to examine how noradrenergic neurons are affected by cortical Abeta pathology in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in mice. METHODS: The density of noradrenergic axons in LC-innervated regions and the LC neuron number were analyzed by an immunohistochemical method. To explore the potential mechanisms for LC degeneration, we also examined the occurrence of tau pathology in LC neurons, the association of reactive gliosis with LC neurons, and impaired trophic support in the brains of AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. RESULTS: We observed a significant reduction in the density of noradrenergic axons from the LC in aged AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice without neuron loss or tau pathology, which was not limited to areas near Abeta plaques. However, none of the factors known to be related to the maintenance of LC neurons (i.e., somatostatin/somatostatin receptor 2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin-3) were significantly reduced in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cortical Abeta pathology induces noradrenergic neurodegeneration, and further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms will reveal effective therapeutics to halt AD progression.
