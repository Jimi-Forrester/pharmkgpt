35537597|a|The ubiquity of cognitive deficits and early onset Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome (DS) has focused much DS iPSC-based research on neuron degeneration and regeneration. Despite reports of elevated oxidative stress in DS brains, few studies assess the impact of this oxidative burden on iPSC differentiation. Here, we evaluate cellular specific redox differences in DS and euploid iPSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during critical intermediate stages of differentiation. Despite successful generation of NPCs, our results indicate accelerated neuroectodermal differentiation of DS iPSCs compared to isogenic, euploid controls. Specifically, DS embryoid bodies (EBs) and neural rosettes prematurely develop with distinct morphological differences from controls. Additionally, we observed developmental stage-specific alterations in mitochondrial superoxide production and SOD1/2 abundance, coupled with modulations in thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin isoforms. Disruption of intracellular redox state and its associated signaling has the potential to disrupt cellular differentiation and development in DS lending to DS-specific phenotypes.
