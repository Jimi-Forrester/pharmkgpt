36083516|t|Brief Report: Intracellular Cystatin B Levels Are Altered in HIV-Infected Participants With Respect to Neurocognitive Status and Antiretroviral Therapy.
36083516|a|ABSTRACT: With advances in HIV treatment, people with HIV (PWH) are living longer but experience aging-related comorbidities, including cognitive deficits, at higher rates than the general population. Previous studies have shown alterations in lysosomal proteins in blood from PWH with severe dementia. However, these markers have not been evaluated in PWH with milder neurocognitive impairment. We sought to determine whether levels of the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (CatB) and its endogenous inhibitor cystatin B (CysB) were altered in PWH with neurocognitive impairment and whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) further influenced these levels. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from the tenofovir arm of a multicenter clinical trial in which ART-naive, HIV+ participants received treatment for 48 weeks (ACTG A5303, NCT01400412). PWH were divided by neurocognitive status (eg, with or without neurocognitive impairment) before ART initiation. Intracellular levels of CatB and CysB were measured in T cells and monocytes by means of flow cytometry. Levels of CysB were significantly decreased in both CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells after 48 weeks of ART in HIV+ participants without neurocognitive impairment but not in participants with neurocognitive impairment. Levels of CysB were increased in CD14 + monocytes from the participants with neurocognitive impairment after ART. Levels of CysB and CatB positively correlated regardless of HIV, neurocognitive status, or exposure to ART. These findings suggest that CysB has the potential to provide mechanistic insight into HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders or provide a molecular target for systemic monitoring or treatment of neurocognitive impairment in the context of ART and should be investigated further.
