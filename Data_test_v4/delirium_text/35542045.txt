35542045|t|Dapsone is an anticatalysis for Alzheimer's disease exacerbation.
35542045|a|Brain inflammation generally accelerates neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's disease (AD) triggers an innate immune response by activating a cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. Our study investigated patients with leprosy and AD. They were treated with dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, DDS) as a neuroinflammasome competitor and cGAS/STING pathway inhibitor. Four groups were defined: Treatment (T) 1: DDS prescribed AD diagnosed, T 2: DDS prescribed AD undiagnosed, T 3 DDS unprescribed AD diagnosed, and T 4: DDS unprescribed AD undiagnosed. Dapsone effects on AD can be clearly distinguished according to dapsone presence or absence. T1:T3 proved that the incidence of AD was significantly reduced by dapsone. T2:T3 proved that the prevalence of AD was significantly high without dapsone. T1:T4 proved that the prevalence decreased when taking dapsone. Our study demonstrates that dapsone can prevent AD exacerbation and may represent a preventive therapeutic option for exacerbated AD.
