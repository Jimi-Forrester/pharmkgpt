34959050|t|Reorganization of rich clubs in functional brain networks of dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.
34959050|a|The purpose of this study was to reveal the patterns of reorganization of rich club organization in brain functional networks in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study found that the rich club node shifts from sensory/somatomotor network to fronto-parietal network in DLB. For AD, the rich club nodes switch between the temporal lobe with obvious structural atrophy and the frontal lobe, parietal lobe and cerebellum with relatively preserved structure and function. In addition, compared with healthy controls, rich club connectivity was enhanced in the DLB and AD groups. The connection strength of DLB patients was related to cognitive assessment. In conclusion, we revealed the different functional reorganization patterns of DLB and AD. The conversion and redistribution of rich club members may play a causal role in disease-specific outcomes. It may be used as a potential biomarker to provide more accurate prevention and treatment strategies.
