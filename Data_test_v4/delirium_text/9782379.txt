9782379|a|The use of cell-targeted ferrofluid in the characterization of modifications of cell membranes is reviewed. Maghemite ferrofluid was synthesized by the Massart method, complexed with dimercaptosuccinic acid (FF). Cell targeting by FF was developed by coupling FF to various biological effectors such as antibodies, lectins, etc, which enabled magnetic cell sorting. Modifications in erythrocyte membranes were studied using FF bound to recombinant human annexin V (AnxFF) which is very sensitive, compared to other Anx-based reagents, in the early detection of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposition on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Thus PS exposition on mouse RBC was detected already after a 24-h storage at 4 degrees C and, transiently, 24 h after their infection by Plasmodium parasites, at which time the parasites are still confined to the liver, thus leading to the recruitment of young RBC and the accumulation of a species, intermediate between reticulocytes and erythrocytes, and the actual RBC target of plasmodial invasion. AnxFF revealed PS exposition on RBC from sickle cell anemia patients, following various inflammations and already after 20 days of human blood storage under blood bank conditions. Such a sensitive detection should be similar to that of macrophages which recognize exposed PS on cells and bring about the latter's elimination from the circulation. AnxFF binding determination was combined with that of cell electrophoretic mobility, glycerol resistance and filterability to characterize RBC membrane modifications in Alzheimer's disease patients which suggested a continuous damage and regeneration in RBC of these patients. A logistic analysis suggested that several three-parameter combinations could permit diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with up to 95% accuracy. THP1 cells and macrophages, derived themselves by incubation with retinoic acid, were bound to FF and placed in a radio frequency alternating magnetic field. Magnetocytolysis was associated with FF attachment to the cells without damage to non-bound cells and without heating of the surrounding solution.
