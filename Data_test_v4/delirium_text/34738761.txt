34738761|a|Delirium is common in community-dwelling as well as in hospitalized older persons aged 75 years and older. Often underdiagnosed, delirium is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Screening (with CAM and 3D-CAM) and identification of older people at increased risk for delirium is essential to enhance non-pharmacological preventative measures and monitor their evolution to allowing an early diagnosis. Screening instruments are currently available, such as the CAM and 3D-CAM. Pharmacological treatment is proposed only in situations where the patients endanger him-herself or other persons. In patients without previously known cognitive impairment, a cognitive assessment is mandated within the next 6 to 12 months period following the delirium episode.
