36316311|t|Advances in regenerative medicine applications of tetrahedral framework nucleic acid-based nanomaterials: an expert consensus recommendation.
36316311|a|With the emergence of DNA nanotechnology in the 1980s, self-assembled DNA nanostructures have attracted considerable attention worldwide due to their inherent biocompatibility, unsurpassed programmability, and versatile functions. Especially promising nanostructures are tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs), first proposed by Turberfield with the use of a one-step annealing approach. Benefiting from their various merits, such as simple synthesis, high reproducibility, structural stability, cellular internalization, tissue permeability, and editable functionality, tFNAs have been widely applied in the biomedical field as three-dimensional DNA nanomaterials. Surprisingly, tFNAs exhibit positive effects on cellular biological behaviors and tissue regeneration, which may be used to treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases. According to their intended application and carrying capacity, tFNAs could carry functional nucleic acids or therapeutic molecules through extended sequences, sticky-end hybridization, intercalation, and encapsulation based on the Watson and Crick principle. Additionally, dynamic tFNAs also have potential applications in controlled and targeted therapies. This review summarized the latest progress in pure/modified/dynamic tFNAs and demonstrated their regenerative medicine applications. These applications include promoting the regeneration of the bone, cartilage, nerve, skin, vasculature, or muscle and treating diseases such as bone defects, neurological disorders, joint-related inflammatory diseases, periodontitis, and immune diseases.
