36307908|a|Recent reports suggest that persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and its recurrent reactivation could instigate the formation of proteinaceous plaques in the brain: a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, a major genetic risk factor of AD, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE), could also influence the outcome of EBV infection in an individual. The ApoE is believed to influence the proteinaceous plaque clearance from the brain, and its defective functioning could result in the aggregate deposition. The persistent presence of EBV infection in a genetically predisposed individual could create a perfect recipe for severe neurodegenerative consequences. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the possible interactions between ApoE and various EBV proteins using computational tools. Our results showed possibly stable de-novo interactions between the C-terminal domain of ApoE3 and EBV proteins: EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) and BamHI Z fragment leftward open reading frame-1 (BZLF1). The EBNA1 protein of EBV plays a crucial role in establishing latency and replication of the virus. Whereas BZLF1 is involved in the lytic replication cycle. The proposed interaction of EBV proteins at the ligand-binding site of ApoE3 on CTD could interfere with- its capability to sequester amyloid fragments and, hence their clearance from the brain giving rise to AD pathology. This study provides a new outlook on EBV's underexplored role in AD development and paves the way for novel avenues of investigation which could further our understanding of AD pathogenesis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
