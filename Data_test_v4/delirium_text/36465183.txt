36465183|t|Melatonin as an Antioxidant Agent in Stroke: An Updated Review.
36465183|a|Stroke is a devastating disease associated with high mortality and disability worldwide, and is generally classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic, which share certain similar pathophysiological processes. Oxidative stress is a critical factor involved in stroke-induced injury, which not only directly damages brain tissue, but also enhances a series of pathological signaling cascades, contributing to inflammation, brain edema, and neuronal death. To alleviate these serious secondary brain injuries, neuroprotective agents targeting oxidative stress inhibition may serve as a promising treatment strategy. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, and has various properties, such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, circadian rhythm modulation, and promotion of tissue regeneration. Numerous animal experiments studying stroke have confirmed that melatonin exerts considerable neuroprotective effects, partially via anti-oxidative stress. In this review, we introduce the possible role of melatonin as an antioxidant in the treatment of stroke based on the latest published studies of animal experiments and clinical research.
