23225923|a|BACKGROUND: Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgery increases arterial pressures, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study, we investigated the efficacy of gabapentin premedication to provide perioperative hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients, of either sex (18-65 years of age) undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to two groups of 30 patients each. Patients of group G received oral gabapentin 900 mg 2 h before induction of anesthesia, while patients in group P received placebo at the same time. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure in patients of group G were significantly lower (P < 0.05) after tracheal intubation and pneumoperitoneum and remained lower, as compared to group P, throughout the pneumoperitoneum. Similarly, heart rate in group G was significantly lower (P < 0.05) after tracheal intubation and pneumoperitoneum and remained lower, in comparison to group P, throughout the peumoperitoneum. Intravenous labetalol was required, to control intraoperative hypertension, in 33.3% (10 out of 30) patients in group P. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin premedication provided perioperative hemodynamic stability during laparoscopic surgery.
