34849584|t|Ndufs4 knockout mouse models of Leigh syndrome: pathophysiology and intervention.
34849584|a|Mitochondria are small cellular constituents that generate cellular energy (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Dysfunction of these organelles is linked to a heterogeneous group of multisystemic disorders, including diabetes, cancer, ageing-related pathologies and rare mitochondrial diseases. With respect to the latter, mutations in subunit-encoding genes and assembly factors of the first OXPHOS complex (complex I) induce isolated complex I deficiency and Leigh syndrome. This syndrome is an early-onset, often fatal, encephalopathy with a variable clinical presentation and poor prognosis due to the lack of effective intervention strategies. Mutations in the nuclear DNA-encoded NDUFS4 gene, encoding the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4 (NDUFS4) of complex I, induce 'mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type 1' (MC1DN1) and Leigh syndrome in paediatric patients. A variety of (tissue-specific) Ndufs4 knockout mouse models were developed to study the Leigh syndrome pathomechanism and intervention testing. Here, we review and discuss the role of complex I and NDUFS4 mutations in human mitochondrial disease, and review how the analysis of Ndufs4 knockout mouse models has generated new insights into the MC1ND1/Leigh syndrome pathomechanism and its therapeutic targeting.
