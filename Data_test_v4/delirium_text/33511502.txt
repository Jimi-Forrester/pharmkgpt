33511502|a|In light of previous results, we assessed whether liposomes functionalized with ApoE-derived peptide (mApoE) and phosphatidic acid (PA) (mApoE-PA-LIP) impacted on intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamics in cultured human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), as an in vitro human blood-brain barrier (BBB) model, and in cultured astrocytes. mApoE-PA-LIP pre-treatment actively increased both the duration and the area under the curve (A.U.C) of the ATP-evoked Ca2+ waves in cultured hCMEC/D3 cells as well as in cultured astrocytes. mApoE-PA-LIP increased the ATP-evoked intracellular Ca2+ waves even under 0 [Ca2+]e conditions, thus indicating that the increased intracellular Ca2+ response to ATP is mainly due to endogenous Ca2+ release. Indeed, when Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity was blocked by cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), the extracellular application of ATP failed to trigger any intracellular Ca2+ waves, indicating that metabotropic purinergic receptors (P2Y) are mainly involved in the mApoE-PA-LIP-induced increase of the Ca2+ wave triggered by ATP. In conclusion, mApoE-PA-LIP modulate intracellular Ca2+ dynamics evoked by ATP when SERCA is active through inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent (InsP3) endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. Considering that P2Y receptors represent important pharmacological targets to treat cognitive dysfunctions, and that P2Y receptors have neuroprotective effects in neuroinflammatory processes, the enhancement of purinergic signaling provided by mApoE-PA-LIP could counteract Abeta-induced vasoconstriction and reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Our obtained results could give an additional support to promote mApoE-PA-LIP as effective therapeutic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
