26402416|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term suicide risk in individuals with no, one or more mental disorders. METHOD: In the Lundby Study, involving a total population of 3563 subjects, mental health and suicide risk were monitored over 54-64 years. RESULTS: The long-term suicide risk in subjects with no, one, or more mental disorders was 0.3%, 3.4% and 6.2% respectively. For individuals with only depression, the risk was 6.0%, only alcohol use disorder 4.7%, and only psychosis 3.1%. However, when individuals had additional disorders, the suicide risks were 6.6%, 9.4% and 10.4% respectively. Each diagnosis per se was significantly related to increased risk of suicide. Men had a higher suicide risk in depression than women. Men who had alcohol use disorder in addition to depression showed a very high risk of suicide, 16.2%. CONCLUSION: Long-term suicide risk was increased for depression, alcohol use disorder, and psychosis per se. For the latter two the diagnosis alone there may be a lower risk than previously estimated when there is no additional diagnosis. In men, depression in addition to alcohol use disorder should be treated vigorously in the work to prevent suicide.
