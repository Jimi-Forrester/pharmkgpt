33061376|t|The Advances of Ceria Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications in Orthopaedics.
33061376|a|The ongoing biomedical nanotechnology has intrigued increasingly intense interests in cerium oxide nanoparticles, ceria nanoparticles or nano-ceria (CeO2-NPs). Their remarkable vacancy-oxygen defect (VO) facilitates the redox process and catalytic activity. The verification has illustrated that CeO2-NPs, a nanozyme based on inorganic nanoparticles, can achieve the anti-inflammatory effect, cancer resistance, and angiogenesis. Also, they can well complement other materials in tissue engineering (TE). Pertinent to the properties of CeO2-NPs and the pragmatic biosynthesis methods, this review will emphasize the recent application of CeO2-NPs to orthopedic biomedicine, in particular, the bone tissue engineering (BTE). The presentation, assessment, and outlook of the orthopedic potential and shortcomings of CeO2-NPs in this review expect to provide reference values for the future research and development of therapeutic agents based on CeO2-NPs.
