28426725|t|Dynamic regulation of Pin1 expression and function during zebrafish development.
28426725|a|The prolyl isomerase Pin1 plays a key role in the modulation of proline-directed phosphorylation signaling by inducing local conformational changes in phosphorylated protein substrates. Extensive studies showed different roles for Pin1 in physiological processes and pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still several unanswered questions regarding its biological role. Notably, despite evidences from cultured cells showing that Pin1 expression and activity may be regulated by different mechanisms, little is known on their relevance in vivo. Using Danio rerio (zebrafish) as a vertebrate model organism we showed that pin1 expression is regulated during embryogenesis to achieve specific mRNA and protein distribution patterns. Moreover, we found different subcellular distribution in particular stages and cell types and we extended the study of Pin1 expression to the adult zebrafish brain. The analysis of Pin1 overexpression showed alterations on zebrafish development and the presence of p53-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, our results suggest that specific mechanisms are operated in different cell types to regulate Pin1 function.
