39027435|a|Sepsis is a syndrome that causes dysfunction of multiple organs due to the host's uncontrolled response to infection and is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in intensive care units worldwide. Surviving patients are often left with acute brain injury and long-term cognitive impairment, known as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). In recent years, researchers have directed their focus towards the pathogenesis of SAE. However, due to the complexity of its development, there remains a lack of effective treatment measures that arise as a serious issue affecting the prognosis of sepsis patients. Further research on the possible causes of SAE aims to provide clinicians with potential therapeutic targets and help develop targeted prevention strategies. This paper aims to review recent research on the pathogenesis of SAE, in order to enhance our understanding of this syndrome.
