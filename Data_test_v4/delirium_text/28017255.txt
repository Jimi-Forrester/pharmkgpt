28017255|a|BACKGROUND: To determine the effects of Type 2 diabetes (DM2) on levels of brain amyloidosis and cognition in a community-dwelling cohort of nondemented elderly individuals. METHODS: 33 subjects (16 DM2, 17 nondiabetic) were prospectively recruited. Subjects underwent a PET scan using the amyloid tracer, Pittsburgh Compound B, and a neuropsychological evaluation. Associations between DM2, brain amyloidosis, and cognition were assessed using multivariate regressions, adjusting for age and APOE4 status. RESULTS: DM2 subjects had lower global cognitive function (p=0.018), as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. There was no difference in brain amyloidosis between groups (p=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Community-dwelling, nondemented individuals with DM2 had greater cognitive deficits, which do not appear to be mediated by brain amyloidosis. Further studies exploring potential mediators of these cognitive deficits should be performed.
