36640914|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative illnesses that impair individual life & increase the demand for caregivers with no available curative medication right now. Therefore, there is a growing concern about employing herbal medicine to limit AD progression & improve patients' life quality, thus potentiating its add-on therapy. In addition, herbs are cost-effective & accessible with nearly no side effects. In the same vein, our study aimed to investigate the potency of Echinacea purpurea (EP) flower extracts to ameliorate the neurodegenerative effect of Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in a rat model. Moreover, mechanistic studies, including impact on the cholinesterase activity, redox status, inflammatory mediators, behavior performance, glucose level & histopathology, were carried on. Our results showed that 250 mg/kg of Aqueous (AQ) & Alcoholic (AL) extracts of EP inhibited cholinesterase, restored oxidative balance, down-regulated IL-6 & TNF-alpha cytokines & improved behavior performance in vivo that was reflected in the brain picture by decreasing neuronal degeneration & amyloid plaques in cerebral cortex & hippocampus. The potency of both extracts was compared to reference drugs & AlCl3 positive control group. The AQ extract showed greater potency against COX-1, COX-2 & alpha-amylase in vitro, while the AL extract was more potent against cholinesterase in vitro, inflammatory cytokines, behavior & pathological improvement in vivo. Conclusively EP overcame AlCl3-induced neurobehavioral toxicity in the rat model via different pathways, which support its regular administration to postpone progressive neural damage in AD patients.
