36901896|a|Mild thiamine deficiency aggravates Zn accumulation in cholinergic neurons. It leads to the augmentation of Zn toxicity by its interaction with the enzymes of energy metabolism. Within this study, we tested the effect of Zn on microglial cells cultivated in a thiamine-deficient medium, containing 0.003 mmol/L of thiamine vs. 0.009 mmol/L in a control medium. In such conditions, a subtoxic 0.10 mmol/L Zn concentration caused non-significant alterations in the survival and energy metabolism of N9 microglial cells. Both activities of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the acetyl-CoA level were not decreased in these culture conditions. Amprolium augmented thiamine pyrophosphate deficits in N9 cells. This led to an increase in the intracellular accumulation of free Zn and partially aggravated its toxicity. There was differential sensitivity of neuronal and glial cells to thiamine-deficiency-Zn-evoked toxicity. The co-culture of neuronal SN56 with microglial N9 cells reduced the thiamine-deficiency-Zn-evoked inhibition of acetyl-CoA metabolism and restored the viability of the former. The differential sensitivity of SN56 and N9 cells to borderline thiamine deficiency combined with marginal Zn excess may result from the strong inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase in neuronal cells and no inhibition of this enzyme in the glial ones. Therefore, ThDP supplementation can make any brain cell more resistant to Zn excess.
