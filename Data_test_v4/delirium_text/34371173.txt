34371173|a|Growing evidence indicates that overexpression of the microRNA-34 (miR-34) family in the brain may play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis by targeting and downregulating genes associated with neuronal survival, synapse formation and plasticity, Abeta clearance, mitochondrial function, antioxidant defense system, and energy metabolism. Additionally, elevated levels of the miR-34 family in the liver and pancreas promote the development of metabolic syndromes (MetS), such as diabetes and obesity. Importantly, MetS represent a well-documented risk factor for sporadic AD. This review focuses on the recent findings regarding the role of the miR-34 family in the pathogenesis of AD and MetS, and proposes miR-34 as a potential molecular link between both disorders. A comprehensive understanding of the functional roles of miR-34 family in the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of AD brains may lead to the discovery of a breakthrough treatment strategy for this disease.
