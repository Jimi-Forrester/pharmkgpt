36567302|t|Progress in Polymeric Micelles as Viable Wagons for Brain Targeting.
36567302|a|Polymeric micelles have opened up new horizons for improving drug delivery to brain particularly due to their small size, long circulation time, good stability and targetability. They are used to treat a variety of brain conditions, including glioblastoma, migraine, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other conditions linked to the brain. Micelles are currently underutilised in brain targeting despite having several benefits and spanning a wide variety of brain illnesses. Since most medications are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, scientists are continuously working to discover efficient solutions to the problems. The most pressing issue was thought to be the viability and difficulties of translating micelles into the therapeutic setting. This review describes the role of micellar delivery system in brain diseases treatment along with their route of administration and outcomes. The review also discusses the current state of patents and clinical trials in the relevant fields and their potential future applications.
