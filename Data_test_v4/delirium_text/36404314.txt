36404314|t|Adverse outcomes after non-hepatic surgeries in patients with alcoholic liver diseases: a propensity-score matched study.
36404314|a|BACKGROUND: The influence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) on the postoperative outcomes is not completely understood. Our purpose is to evaluate the complications and mortality after nonhepatic surgeries in patients with ALD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study included adults aged 20 years and older who underwent nonhepatic elective surgeries using data of Taiwan's National Health Insurance, 2008-2013. Using a propensity-score matching procedure, we selected surgical patients with ALD (n = 26,802); or surgical patients without ALD (n = 26,802) for comparison. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality associated with ALD. RESULTS: Patients with ALD had higher risks of acute renal failure (OR 2.74, 95% CI 2.28-3.28), postoperative bleeding (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.34-2.01), stroke (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.34-1.70) septicemia (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.36-1.58), pneumonia (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.29-1.58), and in-hospital mortality (OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.24-3.11) than non-ALD patients. Patients with ALD also had longer hospital stays and higher medical expenditures after nonhepatic surgical procedures than the non-ALD patients. Compared with patients without ALD, patients with ALD who had jaundice (OR 4.82, 95% CI 3.68-6.32), ascites (OR 4.57, 95% CI 3.64-5.74), hepatic coma (OR 4.41, 95% CI 3.44-5.67), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 3.84, 95% CI 3.09-4.79), and alcohol dependence syndrome (OR 3.07, 95% CI 2.39-3.94) were more likely to have increased postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Surgical patients with ALD had more adverse events and a risk of in-hospital mortality after nonhepatic surgeries that was approximately 2.6-fold higher than that for non-ALD patients. These findings suggest the urgent need to revise the protocols for peri-operative care for this population.
