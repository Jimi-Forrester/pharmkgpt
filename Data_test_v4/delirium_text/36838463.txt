36838463|t|Legionella pneumophila Infections during a 7-Year Retrospective Analysis (2016-2022): Epidemiological, Clinical Features and Outcomes in Patients with Legionnaires' Disease.
36838463|a|Legionella pneumophila (LP) is one of the main causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in Europe and its fifth bacterial cause in Italy (4.9%). We conducted a seven year retrospective analysis of LP infection serogroup 1 in Asti, Piedmont, between 2016 and 2022. Patients were included if they tested positive for the Legionella urinary antigen. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were analyzed to describe the risk factors for mortality. Fifty patients with LD were collected, mainly male, with a median age of 69 years. The main comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases (50%), pulmonary diseases (26%), and neurological diseases (12%). The most common clinical presentations were fever, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptoms. Older age (p = 0.004), underlying cardiovascular diseases (p = 0.009), late diagnosis at admission (p = 0.035), and neurological symptoms at diagnosis (p = 0.046) were more common in the non-survivor group. Moreover, a septic-shock presentation or the need for non-invasive ventilation at admission were associated with a higher mortality. No considerable differences in the biochemical data were found between the two groups except for the median neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and PCT value. We did not find any differences in mortality related to the choice of antibiotic regimen. Differences in outcome were associated with the median duration of treatment (p =< 0.001) but not to the choice of antibiotic regimen (mainly levofloxacin or azithromycin). In conclusion, early individuation of the wide spectrum of clinical characteristics of LP infection such as respiratory, cardiac, and neurological manifestations of the patient's comorbidities, and significant biochemical data should help clinicians flag high risk patients and potentially improve their outcome.
