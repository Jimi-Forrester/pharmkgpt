31026331|a|The current study aimed to evaluate the multidimensional effects of an interdisciplinary care team in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 129 patients with AD were randomly assigned to an interdisciplinary care group (n = 69) or usual care group (n = 60). Behavioral and psychological symptoms of patients with AD were measured during a 6-month treatment period. No differences were found in the baseline characteristics between the interdisciplinary care and usual care groups. Compared to usual care, interdisciplinary care greatly increased patients' activities of daily living (ADL) scores when measured at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.001). Findings provide evidence that an interdisciplinary care team approach is beneficial in improving ADL performance; thus, an interdisciplinary care team should be implemented in the care arrangements for patients with AD.
