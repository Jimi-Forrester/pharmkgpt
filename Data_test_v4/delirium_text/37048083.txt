37048083|t|Highlighting In Vitro the Role of Brain-like Endothelial Cells on the Maturation and Metabolism of Brain Pericytes by SWATH Proteomics.
37048083|a|Within the neurovascular unit, brain pericytes (BPs) are of major importance for the induction and maintenance of the properties of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) carried by the brain microvessel endothelial cells (ECs). Throughout barriergenesis, ECs take advantage of soluble elements or contact with BPs to maintain BBB integrity and the regulation of their cellular homeostasis. However, very few studies have focused on the role of ECs in the maturation of BPs. The aim of this study is to shed light on the proteome of BPs solocultured (hBP-solo) or cocultured with ECs (hBP-coc) to model the human BBB in a non-contact manner. We first generated protein libraries for each condition and identified 2233 proteins in hBP-solo versus 2492 in hBP-coc and 2035 common proteins. We performed a quantification of the enriched proteins in each condition by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH) analysis. We found 51 proteins enriched in hBP-solo related to cell proliferation, contractility, adhesion and extracellular matrix element production, a protein pattern related to an immature cell. In contrast, 90 proteins are enriched in hBP-coc associated with a reduction in contractile activities as observed in vivo in 'mature' BPs, and a significant gain in different metabolic functions, particularly related to mitochondrial activities and sterol metabolism. This study highlights that BPs take advantage of ECs during barriergenesis to make a metabolic switch in favor of BBB homeostasis in vitro.
