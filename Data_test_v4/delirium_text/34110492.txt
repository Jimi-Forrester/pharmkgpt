34110492|a|This review honors Kurt Jellinger on his 90th birthday as one of the most outstanding neuropathologists, who has contributed immensely to neuroscience due to his vast experience and collection of excellently documented autopsy cases. Two of his many insightful reports are highlighted here. One report focuses on the pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating diseases and investigates the neuropathology in autopsy tissue of a patient, who developed an MS-like disease after repeated treatment with lyophilized bovine brain cells in 1958. More than 60 years later, after reinvestigation of the historic samples in 2015 and subsequent mRNA isolation, next generation sequencing and reconstruction of the antibody, we succeeded in identifying myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) as the target antigen and provided the missing element between the pathomechanisms in classic EAE animal models and transfer of this disease process into humans. A second significant example of Kurt Jellinger's contribution to neuroscience was a report on the role of MS in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which found that AD pathology is present to the same extent in demyelinated and non-demyelinated cortical areas in MS and the incidence for AD pathology in elderly MS patients is comparable to the normal-aging population. This indicates that chronic inflammation in the MS cortex alone does not significantly predispose to the development of cortical AD pathology. These and other findings were only possible due to the broad collection of extremely well-defined material established by Kurt Jellinger, which ultimately continues to contribute to translational neuroscience, even decades later.
