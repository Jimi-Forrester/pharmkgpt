39339756|t|Whole Plant Extracts for Neurocognitive Disorders: A Narrative Review of Neuropsychological and Preclinical Studies.
39339756|a|The incidence of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's Disease, characterized by a progressive cognitive decline, is rising worldwide. Despite the considerable efforts to unveil the neuropsychological bases of these diseases, there is still an unmet medical need for effective therapies against cognitive deficits. In recent years, increasing laboratory evidence indicates the potential of phytotherapy as an integrative aid to improve cognitive functions. In this review, we describe the data of plant whole extracts or single compounds' efficacy on validated preclinical models and neuropsychological tests, aiming to correlate brain mechanisms underlying rodent behavioral responses to human findings. After a search of the literature, the overview was limited to the following plants: Dioscorea batatas, Ginkgo biloba, Melissa officinalis, Nigella sativa, Olea europaea, Panax ginseng, Punica granatum, and Vitis vinifera. Results showed significant improvements in different cognitive functions, such as learning and memory or visuospatial abilities, in both humans and rodents. However, despite promising laboratory evidence, clinical translation has been dampened by a limited pharmacological characterization of the single bioactive components of the herbal products. Depicting the contribution of the single phytochemicals to the phytocomplex's pharmacological efficacy could enable the comprehension of their potential synergistic activity, leading to phytotherapy inclusion in the existing therapeutic package against cognitive decline.
