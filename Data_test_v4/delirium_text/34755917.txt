The study aim was to understand how mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic has affected quality of life, mood, and cognitive performance of older adults with cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive-observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with cognitive impairment attending to online cognitive training sessions. MEASUREMENTS: Participants have completed by themselves Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease scale (QOL-AD), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Test your Memory (TYM), and an attention and executive task created by our institution. Same assessments were done at the beginning of the lockdown and 7 months later. RESULTS: Fifty-one adults were included. An increase in BDI-II score (p = 0.049) and worse performance in one of the executive attention tests (p = 0.012) have been found. No significant differences in QOL-AD, TYM, verbal fluency, or memory tests total scores have been observed. Reviewing scales subitems, differences in changes in sleep habits (p = 0.021), energy level decrease (p = 0.004), worse subjective record of memory capacity (p = 0.028), and decrease in ability to do housework (p = 0.007) have been shown. In those who lived alone, BDI and TYM higher scores in BDI-II (p = 0.030) (p = 0.022) have been found. CONCLUSION: Mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic was associated with worsening of mood, some quality-of-life variables, and decrease in attention in older adults with cognitive impairment in Argentina.
