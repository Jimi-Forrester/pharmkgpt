20827383|t|AICD Overexpression in Neuro 2A Cells Regulates Expression of PTCH1 and TRPC5.
20827383|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP), implicated in Alzheimer's disease, is a transmembrane protein of undetermined function. APP is cleaved by gamma-secretase that releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) in the cytoplasm. In vitro and in vivo studies have implicated the role of AICD in cell signaling and transcriptional regulation of Gsk3beta, KAI1, BACE1, EGFR, and other proteins. In this study, by overexpressing AICD in mouse neuroblastoma cell lines, we have demonstrated the alteration in the expressions of two proteins, patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), a receptor for sonic hedgehog signaling, and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 5 (TRPC5), a component of receptor-activated nonselective calcium permeant cation channel. Our results indicate the possibility of regulation by AICD in developmental processes as well as in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis at the transcription level.
