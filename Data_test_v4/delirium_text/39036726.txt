39036726|t|A Qualitative Study of Emergency Department Delirium Prevention Initiatives.
39036726|a|Background: Delirium is a serious but preventable syndrome of acute brain failure. It affects 15% of patients presenting to emergency care and up to half of hospitalized patients. The emergency department (ED) often represents the entry point for hospital care for older adults and as such is an important site for delirium prevention. Objective: We sought to characterize delirium prevention initiatives in EDs in the United States and Canada. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with 16 ED administrators representing 14 EDs with delirium prevention initiatives. We used a combined deductive-inductive approach to code responses about involved staff, target patient population, and delirium prevention activities. Results: ED delirium prevention initiatives were largely driven by bedside nurses and occurred on an ad hoc basis, rather than systematically. Due to resource limitations, three EDs targeted older adults with high-risk conditions for delirium, rather than all patients age 65 and over. The most common delirium prevention interventions were offering assistive sensory devices (hearing amplifiers, reading glasses), having a toileting protocol, and offering patients food and drink. Conclusions: As minimal evidence exists about effective ED delirium prevention practices, low-cost and low-risk activities outlined by study participants are reasonable to use to improve patient experience and staff satisfaction.
