35054231|t|Salivary Exosome Proteomics and Bioinformatics Analysis in 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-Induced Oral Cancer with Radiation Therapy-A Syrian Golden Hamster Model.
35054231|a|Exosomes carry cellular proteins and contain molecules that can be potential biomarkers of diseases. This study used a Syrian golden hamster model of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced oral squamous cell carcinoma with radiation therapy to exclude the confounding factors that may affect outcomes in clinical studies, and re-examine the role of exosomes during tumorigenesis. We used data-dependent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analyses and found unique proteins present (desmocollin-2) or absent (Glucagon-cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway-related proteins) in the salivary exosomes of the pre-radiation DMBA-treated group (PreD). Comparing our data to other studies, salivary exosomes in the PreD group were found carrying proteins that the tumor mass does not express and lacking the proteins needed during tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemistry staining showed p53 expression but a negative apoptotic signal in the PreD tumor tissue. We thus suggest that inhibition of desmocollin-2 expression in tumor tissue may impede the activation of cell apoptosis. However, both the origin of the salivary exosomes and main role of the salivary exosome proteins should be clarified in future studies.
