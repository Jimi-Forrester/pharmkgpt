18298652|a|The development of small molecules to modulate caspase activity offers a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of apoptosis-related and inflammatory diseases. Caspases are key mediators of apoptosis and inflammation; deregulation of their activation or expression can lead to the development of conditions such as neurodegenerative and autoinflammatory disorders. This review details the different caspase-associated disorders while focusing on caspase-1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy. Problems facing the development of effective and safe caspase therapeutics will also be addressed.
