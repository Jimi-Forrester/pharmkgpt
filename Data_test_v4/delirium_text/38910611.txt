38910611|t|Exploring Taurine's Potential in Alzheimer's Treatment: A Comprehensive Review.
38910611|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the predominant neurodegenerative disorders, often culminating in dementia. Taurine, an endogenous amino acid, holds pivotal regulatory functions within the physiological milieu. Emerging evidence suggests that taurine may confer protection against the onset and progression of AD through diverse mechanistic pathways. This systematic review aims to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted role of taurine in Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective is to assess taurine's potential as a preventative and therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's, based on studies from 2004 to 2022. A rigorous search strategy was implemented, targeting English-language articles accessible in full text. Eligible studies were meticulously sourced from renowned databases including PubMed, PubMed Central, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, and Medline Plus. Inclusion criteria were limited to studies explicitly investigating the role of taurine in Alzheimer's disease. Our review encompasses a wealth of experimental studies conducted on murine models, collectively indicating taurine's capacity to ameliorate symptomatic presentations of Alzheimer's disease. Encouraged by these promising preclinical findings, the imperative for clinical trials in human subjects emerges. Taurine emerges as a prospective agent, offering potential mitigation of the cognitive and memory-related debility synonymous with Alzheimer's disease. This systematic review delineates a compelling body of evidence underscoring the putative neuroprotective role of taurine in Alzheimer's disease. However, it is incumbent upon the scientific community to bridge the translational gap through robust clinical investigations. Such endeavors hold promise in revolutionizing the therapeutic landscape for individuals grappling with the formidable challenges posed by Alzheimer's disease.
