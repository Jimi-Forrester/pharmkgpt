24097913|t|Combination of inhaled corticosteroid and bronchodilator-induced delirium in an elderly patient with lung disease.
24097913|a|Steroid psychosis has been well described with oral glucocorticoids, however, our search of the literature did not identify an association between delirium and the combination of inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting beta-agonists. We describe the occurrence of delirium with the combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid and bronchodilator. An elderly male described confusion and hallucinations within 1 week after initiation of budesonide/formoterol for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The combination inhaler was discontinued with resolution of symptoms. Several weeks later, the patient was hospitalized and restarted on the combination inhaler. The patient was alert and oriented on admission, however, confusion and hallucinations progressed throughout his hospital stay. The combination inhaler was discontinued and his confusion and hallucinations resolved by discharge. The temporal relationship of these events and a probable Naranjo association allows for reasonable assumption that the use of the budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler caused or contributed to the occurrences of delirium in this elderly patient. The onset of delirium was likely due to the systemic absorption of the glucocorticoid from lung deposition, complicated in an individual with several predisposing risk factors for delirium. Health care providers should be aware of this potential adverse drug reaction when prescribing inhaled medications to older patients at risk for delirium.
