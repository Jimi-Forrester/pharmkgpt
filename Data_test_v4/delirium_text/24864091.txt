24864091|a|Putrescine plays a very important role in the regulation of division, differentiation and maturation of cells as well as apoptosis. As the polycationic molecule it stabilizes the structure of DNA and participates in the functioning of cell membranes. It is able to interact with series of ion channels and has affinity for many receptors. The article presents the participation of putrescine in the metabolism of iron and mechanism of its transport across biological membranes. Especially important for the homeostasis of putrescine has ornithine decarboxylase and availability of its substrate--ornithine. Affecting to this enzyme is the simplest and widely used method of controlling the concentration of putrescine. For this purpose its inhibitor-eflornithine is applied. There was also a number of other enzymes involved in the metabolism of putrescine that was presented. Current information about the clinical relevance of putrescine in infertility, embryonic development, hirsutism, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prevention of metastases and hemostasis was also described. These processes were presented, in which putrescine plays a major role and focused on the latest reports. Attention was drawn to the situations where it has beneficial effects and those in which it is the cause of the pathology. Some of the cited reports are in phase of speculation on the possible use of it, but a significant part is already confirmed and used in clinical practice. The facts presented in this article show how great is the meaning of putrescine and how important role this simple specimen plays in the metabolic processes of living organisms.
