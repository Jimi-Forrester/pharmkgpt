36008987|a|Piperidine pharmacophore-containing compounds have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against a range of diseases and are now being investigated in cancer. A series of 3-chloro-3-methyl-2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-ones, compounds (I-V) were designed and synthesized for their evaluation as a potential anti-cancer agent. Compounds II and IV reduced the growth of numerous hematological cancer cell lines while simultaneously increasing the mRNA expression of apoptosis-promoting genes, p53 and Bax. Molecular docking analyses confirmed that compounds can bind to 6FS1, 6FSO (myeloma), 6TJU (leukemia), 5N21, and 1OLL (NKTL). Computational ADMET research confirmed the essential physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and drug-like characteristics of compounds (I-V). The results revealed that these compounds interact efficiently with active site residues and that compounds (II) and (V) can be further evaluated as potential therapeutic candidates.
