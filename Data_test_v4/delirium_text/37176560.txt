37176560|a|INTRODUCTION: Hemodialysis patients are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, but the pattern of affected cognitive domains is still undetermined. Little is also known about the symptoms of depression and anxiety in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 74 consecutive adult patients undergoing hemodialysis. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Addenbrooke Cognitive Test III. In addition, all patients were screened for symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: The mean age of hemodialysis patients was 65.69 +- 14 years. Among the patients, there were 27% and 31% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and suspected dementia, respectively. In the group of patients with suspected dementia, all cognitive functions had significantly lower values compared to these functions in incognitively unimpaired and mild cognitive impairment patients. The most impaired domain was verbal fluency, which reflects impairments in executive function. Depression and anxiety symptoms were observed in 28% and 22% of patients, respectively. Patients with anxiety symptoms had higher levels of endogenous creatinine, parathyroid hormone, and hemoglobin, as well as decreased creatinine clearance, being younger and less educated. No factors contributing to the occurrence of depressive symptoms were found. CONCLUSION: Cognitive dysfunction is a significant problem in hemodialysis patients. Our study showed that the prevalence of cognitive impairment and depression and anxiety symptoms in hemodialysis patients was high. The domain of executive functions was most affected. Furthermore, creatinine, parathyroid hormone, hemoglobin levels, creatinine clearance, and education affected the anxiety scale score.
