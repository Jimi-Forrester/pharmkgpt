37083766|a|Endotracheal intubation can be associated with certain complications in certain group of patients. However, the relationship between endotracheal intubation and postoperative complications is unclear in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). This study evaluated the relationship between endotracheal intubation and postoperative complications in non-cardiothoracic and non-obstetric surgery patients with PHTN. A secondhand analysis of non-cardiothoracic, non-obstetric procedures was performed on patients with PHTN between 2007 and 2013 in a hospital at the University of Washington. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios to estimate the association between anesthesia and 30-day postoperative complications. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA), smoking, hypertension, and open surgical approach. A total of 573 patients were included in this study, and the mean age was 60.3; 54% were male. In a multivariate regression model for patients with non-cardiothoracic, non-obstetric surgery combined with PHTN, the risk of 30-day postoperative complications was higher in the tracheal intubation group than in patients with non-intubated anesthesia after adjusting for potential covariates (adjusted odds ratio = 2.47; 95% CI, 1.28-4.78). However, there was no significant difference in postoperative mortality between these groups. Statistical analysis showed no interaction between the variables of tracheal intubation and 30-day postoperative complications. In this study, we found that tracheal intubation anesthesia is associated with increased risk of 30-day postoperative complications in PHTN patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic, non-obstetric surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.
