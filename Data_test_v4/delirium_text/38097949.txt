38097949|a|BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common chronic condition. Its chronic nature may affect the pattern of medication use. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, associated factors, and patterns of polypharmacy and medication use among GERD patients in southwestern Iran. METHODS: We used data from the Pars Cohort Study. We classified drugs using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. The Lexicomp  database was used to assess potential drug-drug interactions. Multivariable Poisson regression was applied. Adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 9262 participants were included. Among 2,325 patients with GERD, age-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy was 9.5% (95% CI: 7.5%, 11.6%) in males, and 19.3% (95% CI: 17.2%, 21.4%) in females. The PR of experiencing Polypharmacy by GERD patients compared to non-GERD patients was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.61, 2.05%). Multimorbidity (PR: 3.33; CI: 2.66, 4.15), gender (PR: 1.68; CI: 1.30, 2.18), and metabolic syndrome (PR: 1.77; CI: 1.45, 2.15) were associated with polypharmacy among GERD patients. Drugs for acid-related disorders were the most common used drugs among men, women and elders. We found that 13.9%, 4.2%, and 1.1% of GERD patients had type C, D and X drug interactions, respectively. CONCLUSION: GERD is correlated with a higher prevalence of polypharmacy. Among GERD patients, females, those with multi-morbidities, and those with metabolic syndrome may be affected more by polypharmacy. Considering the fairly high rate of interactions identified, a review of the medication list is essential when approaching GERD patients, and physicians must check for medications that may worsen GERD.
