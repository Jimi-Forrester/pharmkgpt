36983327|a|Significant changes in the microstructure of the brain cause dementia and other mental declines associated with aging and disease. Although research has established a connection between oral health and dementia, the underlying pathologic mechanisms are still unknown. AIM: Our aim was to evaluate dentures' impact on the cognitive state of geriatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 108 individuals seeking treatment at the Faculty of Dental Medicine in Iasi, Romania, participated in the study, which ran from May 2022 to October 2022. Cognitive dysfunction was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. The acquired data were analyzed with IBM SPSS 26.0, and the p-value was set at 0.05. RESULTS: The average value of the MMSE score was 21.81 +- 3.872. Differences between groups of wearer/non-wearer subjects were statistically significant for most of the questions in the questionnaire. Linear regression analysis showed that individuals with a high MMSE score have prosthodontic treatment. A decrease in the MMSE score is associated with a decrease in masticatory efficiency (B = 1.513, p = 0.268). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that tooth loss is associated with worse cognitive performance. It is thus conceivable that the necessary effects can be achieved by increasing the efforts dedicated to preventing tooth loss in the adult population.
