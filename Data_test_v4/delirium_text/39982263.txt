39982263|t|Long-Term Insomnia Treatment with Benzodiazepines and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.
39982263|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Benzodiazepines are the most widely used pharmacological class in the treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders. Some literature suggests that the chronic use of benzodiazepines is associated with the development of cognitive decline. This review aims to evaluate the use of benzodiazepines and its association with the development of Alzheimer's disease. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Protocols followed the PRISMA-P 2020 methodology, and, after the analysis of the included studies, a narrative synthesis of the results was carried out. Only two cohort studies were identified that met defined eligibility criteria. In the retrospective study, a significant risk of developing Alzheimer's disease after treatment with benzodiazepines was found. In the prospective study, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was not associated with treatment with benzodiazepines. Results suggest that only the largest study presented a significant risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Given the scarce scientific evidence found, it is concluded that further research on this topic is necessary.
