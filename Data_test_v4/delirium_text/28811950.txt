28811950|t|Autoscopic Hallucination in Alcohol Dependence Syndrome: A Rare or Missed Phenomenon?
28811950|a|Autoscopic phenomenon, a psychic illusionary duplication of one's own self, has been the subject of interest in the literature and science for years. It has been reported in various diseases of the central nervous system but with an unknown mechanism. Hallucinations are a common presentation in alcohol dependence syndrome during delirium tremens and as induced disorder. However, autoscopic hallucination has been rarely reported in the cases of alcohol dependence. We present a case of a 40-year-old man who experienced autoscopic hallucination during the withdrawal state of alcohol. He was successfully treated with detoxification and an antipsychotic medication and was doing well. The case highlights the need for strong suspicion and exploration of the autoscopic hallucination and autoscopic phenomenon in general in cases of alcohol dependence syndrome.
