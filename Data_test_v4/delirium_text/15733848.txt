15733848|a|Tau is the major antigenic component of neurofibrillary pathology in tauopathy, including Alzheimer's disease. Although conversion of soluble tau to an insoluble polymerized fibrillar form is a key factor in the pathogenesis of tauopathy, the mechanism of the change is unclear and no inhibitors of fibril formation are available. Monoclonal antibodies against the 1st or 2nd repeat of the microtubule binding domain, but not the C-terminal 16 residues, completely inhibited tau aggregation into PHF. Furthermore, they did not inhibit tau-induced tubulin assembly. Thus, they are useful to investigate tau protein conversion and will be useful therapeutic lead materials.
