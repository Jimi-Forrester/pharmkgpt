36104367|a|To compare cognitive function in patients with diabetes mellitus type-2 (T2DM) both with and without diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). To analyse the relationship between mood and sleep disorders, quality of life and cognitive function in patients with DNP. Cross-sectional study conducted in patients with T2DM and neuropathy. The presence of DNP, cognitive function, mood status, sleep quality, health-related quality of life, pain intensity and phenotype of pain were measured. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A total of 149 patients (71 with DNP) were included. Patients with and without DNP presented similar scores on the TYM (41.46; SD = 6.70 vs. 41.97; SD = 5.50) and those with DNP had a slightly higher frequency of cognitive impairment (TYM score <= 41: 40.8% vs. 43.6%). The patients without DNP performed better in the verbal fluency dimension (mean = 3.53; SD = 0.98 vs. mean = 3.82; SD = 0.66). Being older (B = - 0.258) and under treatment with insulin (B = - 2.919) were related with greater cognitive impairment. Obesity (OR = 17.277) and a longer duration of diabetes (OR = 1.317) were also related to greater risk of cognitive impairment. Impaired cognitive function in patients with DNP is more related to T2DM factors than pain factors. The presence of depression and a worse quality of life were related to a greater risk of cognitive impairment. Identifying and controlling these factors should be an essential intervention for maintaining the cognitive function in patients with T2DM and DNP.
