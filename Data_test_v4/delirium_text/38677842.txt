38677842|t|A highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent probe for detecting HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity change based on FRET/TICT mechanism.
38677842|a|BACKGROUND: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a significant gas signaling molecule in organisms, and viscosity is a crucial parameter of the cellular microenvironment. They are both involved in regulating many physiological processes in the human body. However, abnormalities in SO2 and viscosity levels are associated with various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, neurological disorders, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Hence, it is essential to explore novel and efficient fluorescent probes for simultaneously monitoring SO2 and viscosity in organisms. RESULTS: We selected quinolinium salt with good stability, high fluorescence intensity, good solubility and low cytotoxicity as the fluorophore and developed a highly sensitive ratiometric probe QQD to identify SO2 and viscosity changes based on Forster resonance energy transfer/twisted intramolecular charge transfer (FRET/TICT) mechanism. Excitingly, compared with other probes for SO2 detection, QQD not only identified HSO3-/SO32- with a large Stokes shift (218 nm), low detection limit (1.87 muM), good selectivity, high energy transfer efficiency (92 %) and wide recognition range (1.87-200 muM), but also identified viscosity with a 26-fold fluorescence enhancement and good linearity. Crucially, QQD was applied to detect HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity in actual water and food samples. In addition, QQD had low toxicity and good photostability for imaging HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity in cells. These results confirmed the feasibility and reliability of QQD for HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity imaging and environmental detection. SIGNIFICANCE: We reported a unique ratiometric probe QQD for detecting HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity based on the quinolinium skeleton. In addition to detecting HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity change in actual water and food samples, QQD could also monitor the variations of HSO3-/SO32- and viscosity in cells, which provided an experimental basis for further exploration of the role of SO2 derivatives and viscosity in biological systems.
