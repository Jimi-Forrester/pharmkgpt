38012707|a|BACKGROUND: The secretome of mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from the amniotic membrane (hAMSCs) has been extensively studied for its in vitro immunomodulatory activity as well as for the treatment of several preclinical models of immune-related disorders. The bioactive molecules within the hAMSCs secretome are capable of modulating the immune response and thus contribute to stimulating regenerative processes. At present, only a few studies have attempted to define the composition of the secretome, and several approaches, including multi-omics, are underway in an attempt to precisely define its composition and possibly identify key factors responsible for the therapeutic effect. METHODS: In this study, we characterized the protein composition of the hAMSCs secretome by a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) digestion and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Data were processed for gene ontology classification and functional protein interaction analysis by bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of the hAMSCs secretome resulted in the identification of 1521 total proteins, including 662 unique elements. A number of 157 elements, corresponding to 23.7%, were found as repeatedly characterizing the hAMSCs secretome, and those that resulted as significantly over-represented were involved in immunomodulation, hemostasis, development and remodeling of the extracellular matrix molecular pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our characterization enriches the landscape of hAMSCs with new information that could enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying the therapeutic efficacy of the hAMSCs secretome while also providing a basis for its therapeutic translation.
