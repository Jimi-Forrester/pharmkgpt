26715588|t|Conversion of mild cognitive impairment patients in Alzheimer's disease: prognostic value of Alpha3/Alpha2 electroencephalographic rhythms power ratio.
26715588|a|INTRODUCTION: The increase in electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio has been demonstrated as a biomarker characteristic of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Seventy-four adult subjects with MCI underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, EEG recording, and high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This group has been evaluated after a three years follow-up. Twenty-seven of these subjects underwent perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) evaluation also. Increasing alpha3/alpha2 power ratio, was computed for each subject. Differences in EEG markers, cortical thickness, brain perfusion among the groups were estimated. RESULTS: In the higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio group, greater memory impairment was correlated with greater cortical atrophy and lower perfusional rate in the temporo-parietal cortex. After a follow-up of three years, these patients converted in AD. CONCLUSION: High EEG upper/low alpha power ratio was associated with cortical thinning and lower perfusion in the temporo-parietal lobe. Moreover, atrophy and lower perfusion rate were both significantly correlated with memory impairment in MCI subjects. The increase of EEG upper/low alpha frequency power ratio could be useful for identifying individuals at risk for progression to AD dementia and may be of value in the clinical context.
