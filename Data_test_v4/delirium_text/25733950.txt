25733950|t|Pursuit of the "truth" about mental illness: the significance of findings in neuropsychiatric research, and lessons from the past.
25733950|a|Technology in genetics and brain imaging has advanced so rapidly that it is difficult to be knowledgeable about all the new tools being used in the pursuit of progress toward understanding and treating mental illness. While findings from new studies remain promising, caution is needed with regard to their current applicability to clinical use, both to predict who is likely to become ill and who is likely to respond to medication. A perspective on the past, using schizophrenia as an example, illustrates important findings that were published, had much visibility, and caused a flurry of new related studies, but then slowly disappeared, either to be abandoned as an artifact of the assay or study design, an epiphenomenon, or as simply nonreplicated findings not leading to further progress. Remembering that good science is "the pursuit of the truth" and not joining the latest "bandwagon fad" of "believers" is an important principle to adhere to when participating in the politics of science.
