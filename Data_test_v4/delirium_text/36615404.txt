36615404|t|Neurotransmitters Regulation and Food Intake: The Role of Dietary Sources in Neurotransmission.
36615404|a|Neurotransmitters (NTs) are biologically active chemicals, which mediate the electrochemical transmission between neurons. NTs control numerous organic functions particularly crucial for life, including movement, emotional responses, and the physical ability to feel pleasure and pain. These molecules are synthesized from simple, very common precursors. Many types of NTs have both excitatory and inhibitory effects. Neurotransmitters' imbalance can cause many diseases and disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, depression, insomnia, increased anxiety, memory loss, etc. Natural food sources containing NTs and/or their precursors would be a potential option to help maintain the balance of NTs to prevent brain and psychiatric disorders. The level of NTs could be influenced, therefore, by targeting dietary habits and nutritional regimens. The progressive implementation of nutritional approaches in clinical practice has made it necessary to infer more about some of the nutritional NTs in neuropsychiatry. However, the importance of the intake of nutritional NTs requires further understanding, since there are no prior significant studies about their bioavailability, clinical significance, and effects on nerve cells. Interventional strategies supported by evidence should be encouraged.
