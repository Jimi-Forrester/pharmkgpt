31762684|a|It is known that thiamine deficiency may lead to Alzheimer's diseases in humans. The present study has thus been conducted to understand the role of thiamine deficiency with respect to alteration in the peripheral blood of Swiss albino mice. For this purpose, adult Swiss albino mice (6-8 week old) were divided into three groups. The first group was control; the second (group II) and the third group (group III) were made thiamine deficient for 08 and 10 days respectively. Thiamine deficiency was induced in mice by injecting pyrithiamine (5 microg/10 g bwt) and feeding a thiamine deficient diet. The erythrocytes, leukocytes count, hemoglobin, hematocrit value, mass cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin in blood of mice were determined by hematoanalyzer. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) level was also determined in serum of treated and non-treated groups. A significant reduction in leukocyte and erythrocyte count was observed in both the thiamine deficient groups as compared to control. Levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit value were also declined in the thiamine deficient groups. Enhancement in mass cell volume (MCV) level and decline in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) levels were observed in both thiamine deficient groups with respect to control. Inter-group comparison of all parameters also showed a significant value at p<0.01. In comparison with the control group, elevation in MDA and decline in GSH level was observed in both thiamine deficient groups which were statistically significant. These data indicate that thiamine deficiency leads to significant alterations in the hematological parameters as well as in MDA and GSH level.
