35810128|t|Olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19: pathology and long-term implications for brain health.
35810128|a|Decreased smell function is related to brain health, future mortality, and quality of life. Most people inflicted with the SARS-CoV-2 virus evidence some measurable smell dysfunction during its acute phase, although many are unaware of the loss. Long-term deficits occur in up to 30% of COVID-19 cases, although total anosmia is relatively rare. This review explores what is presently known about the nature and pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including reversible inflammation within the olfactory cleft, downregulation of olfactory receptor proteins, and long-lasting peripheral and central damage to olfactory structures. It also addresses the question as to whether long-term smell loss might increase the likelihood of future development of cognitive and neurological deficits.
