35883043|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies revealed inconsistent results regarding association between migraine and cognitive impairment. In addition, previous studies found inconsistent results regarding the association between migraine and risk of dementia. Thus, the study aimed to make a meta-analysis exploring comparison result in different types of cognitive function between migraine patients and non-migraine subjects. In addition, meta-analysis was made to explore the association between migraine and risk of dementia. METHODS: Articles published before June 2022 were searched in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, EBSCO, PROQUEST, ScienceDirect and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Results were computed using STATA 12.0 software. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed lower general cognitive function and language function in migraine group, compared to no migraine group (general cognitive function: standard mean difference (SMD) = - 0.40, 95% CI = - 0.66 to - 0.15; language: SMD = - 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 0.27 to - 0.00), whereas the study showed no significant difference in visuospatial function, attention, executive function and memory between migraine group and no migraine group (visuospatial function: SMD = - 0.23, 95% CI = - 0.53 to 0.08; attention: SMD = - 0.01, 95% CI = - 0.10 to 0.08; executive function: SMD = - 0.05, 95% CI = - 0.16 to 0.05; memory: SMD = - 0.14, 95% CI = - 0.30 to 0.03). In addition, the meta-analysis showed a significant association between migraine and risk of dementia (odds ratio (OR)/relative risk (RR) = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.52). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the meta-analysis demonstrated lower general cognitive function and language function in migraine. In addition, migraine is associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia, VaD and AD. These results suggest a significant association between migraine and cognitive impairment. Because of the association between migraine and cognitive impairment, neurological physician should be vigilant and effectively intervene in migraineurs with high risk factors of cognitive impairment to prevent the development of cognitive impairment.
