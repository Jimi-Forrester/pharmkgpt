36705010|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dementia is a syndrome with several possible pathologies. To date, definitive methods for diagnosis and treatment of sub-types of dementia have not been established. Emerging evidence suggests that exosomes can provide important information for the diagnosis and treatment of several subtypes of dementia. This article reviews recent studies on the application of exosomes in dementia. RECENT FINDINGS: Exosomes are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) through transporting toxic proteins such as amyloid beta (Abeta), tau, and alpha-synuclein. Exosomal microRNAs (miR) and proteins reflect the disease state, and therefore, exosomes can be used as diagnostic markers for diseases such as AD, PD, Huntington's disease (HD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been shown to ameliorate disease pathology, and improve cognitive function in AD, PD, and VAD. SUMMARY: Recent studies have shown that exosomes could be novel diagnostic agents for dementia because they contain molecules that could be potential biomarker candidates indicative of the type and stage of dementia. Therapeutic application of exosomes in dementia has revealed that exosomes only, or exosomes loaded with an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), ameliorate disease phenotype of dementia. Further work is needed to exploit this potential.
