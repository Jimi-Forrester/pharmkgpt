12426149|a|The beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is a principal component of insoluble amyloid plaques that are characteristic neuropathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD). The amyloid peptide also exists as a normal soluble protein that undergoes a pathogenic transition to an aggregated, fibrous form. This transition can be affected by extraneous proteinaceous elements and nonproteinaceous elements such as copper ions, which may promote aggregation and/or stabilization of the fibrils. Copper has been found in abnormally high concentrations in amyloid plaques and AD-affected neuropil, and copper-selective chelators have been shown to dissolve Abeta peptide from postmortem brain specimens. Although Cu(2+) is an essential element for life and the function of numerous enzymes is basic to neurobiology, free or incorrectly bound Cu(2+) can also catalyze generation of the most damaging radicals, such as hydroxyl radical, giving a chemical modification of the protein, alternations in protein structure and solubility, and oxidative damage to surrounding tissue.
