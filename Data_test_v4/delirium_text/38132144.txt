38132144|a|The greatest risk factor for neurodegeneration is the aging of the multiple cell types of human CNS, among which microglia are important because they are the "sentinels" of internal and external perturbations and have long lifespans. We aim to emphasize microglial signatures in physiologic brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic literature search of all published articles about microglial senescence in human healthy aging and AD was performed, searching for PubMed and Scopus online databases. Among 1947 articles screened, a total of 289 articles were assessed for full-text eligibility. Microglial transcriptomic, phenotypic, and neuropathological profiles were analyzed comprising healthy aging and AD. Our review highlights that studies on animal models only partially clarify what happens in humans. Human and mice microglia are hugely heterogeneous. Like a two-sided coin, microglia can be protective or harmful, depending on the context. Brain health depends upon a balance between the actions and reactions of microglia maintaining brain homeostasis in cooperation with other cell types (especially astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). During aging, accumulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction weaken microglia leading to dystrophic/senescent, otherwise over-reactive, phenotype-enhancing neurodegenerative phenomena. Microglia are crucial for managing Abeta, pTAU, and damaged synapses, being pivotal in AD pathogenesis.
