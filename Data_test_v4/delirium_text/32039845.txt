32039845|a|Increased amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation associated with abnormal autophagy-lysosomal activity and nutrient kinase dysregulation are common features in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Recent studies have identified PRKAG2 and TIPRL genes that control nutrient kinase regulated autophagy, and here we determined if their expression is altered in postmortem AD brains. Gene and protein expression of TIPRL were unchanged. However, gene expression of PRKAG2 was increased 3-fold and its protein levels positively correlated with Abeta accumulation in the AD brain. In summary, our findings suggest that increased PRKAG2 is an important contributing factor to Abeta accumulation in the AD brain.
