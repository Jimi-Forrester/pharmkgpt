30816619|t|Geriatric assessment and 1-year mortality in older patients with cancer in the head and neck region: A cohort study.
30816619|a|BACKGROUND: The aim is to describe the association of functional capacity and cognitive functioning with 1-year mortality in older patients with cancer in the head and neck region. METHODS: We performed a cohort study in which all patients aged 70 years and older received a geriatric screening before treatment. Main outcome was 1-year mortality. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were included. Median age was 78.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72.3-84.5), 25% were cognitive impaired, 40% were malnourished, and 28.4% used a walking device. Overall, 1-year mortality was 42.3%. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 4.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-13.67), malnutrition (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.19-5.16), and using a walking device (HR, 2.80; 95% CI 1.13-6.93) were associated with higher mortality risk, independent of stage and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: In older patients with head and neck cancer, the mortality rates are high. Nutritional status and mobility are determinants of 1-year mortality, independent of tumor stage, age, and comorbidity.
