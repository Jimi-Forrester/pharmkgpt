32816935|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infection of which we still have much to learn. Microvascular and macrovascular complications are increasingly recognised as being among the drivers of morbidity and mortality in patients with this condition. Here we present a case of a woman with COVID-19 who suffered massive and bilateral middle cerebral artery strokes, which presented as reduced consciousness several days into admission. Clinicians need to be aware of possible causes of reduced consciousness in COVID-19 patients, particularly as delirium appears to be a common complication, and revisit working diagnoses if the clinical picture does not fully fit. Studies into both anticoagulation and the management of stroke in the context of COVID-19 are urgently needed to help inform future practice.
