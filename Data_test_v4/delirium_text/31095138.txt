31095138|t|Synchronous screening of multiplexed biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease by a length-encoded aerolysin nanopore-integrated triple-helix molecular switch.
31095138|a|Herein, we developed a versatile strategy for the synchronous screening of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by incorporating the high-resolution discrimination of an aerolysin nanopore to length-encoded oligonucleotides and the signal transduction of a triple-helix molecular switch (TMS). This assay is adapted to quantitatively compare multiplexed targets of very different native contents without tedious chemical labelling.
