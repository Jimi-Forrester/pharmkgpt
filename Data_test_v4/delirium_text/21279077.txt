21279077|t|Alzheimer's disease: a current review.
21279077|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function from a previously established level, and is the most common cause of all the dementias. While the exact etiology remains to be determined, there are several theories about possible genetic, immunological, biochemical and viral causes. Clinical diagnosis is by exclusion of other established causes of dementia and requires a careful history, physical examination and, often, psychological testing. Definitive diagnosis is made at post-mortem, although some cases show none of the histological hallmarks such as neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques. There is no effective preventive or therapeutic treatment. Symptomatic management includes pharmacotherapy, socialization, support for the patient and his family and, ultimately, institutionalization. Patients are best managed by an interdisciplinary team using community resources.
