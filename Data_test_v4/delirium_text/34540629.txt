34540629|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain control after cardiac surgery is usually based on Opioids. These drugs are associated with side effects, and the use of drugs with fewer side effects is important for analgesia. Dexmedetomidine and paracetamol have fewer side effects than opioids. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the adding paracetamol to dexmedetomidine continuous infusion pump for pain management after adult cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this study, 100 patients were divided into two groups. One group received a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine and paracetamol (DP), and the other received dexmedetomidine (D). These two groups were evaluated for MAP, HR, and the need for prescribing opioids before and after extubation. Also, duration of intubation and pain before extubation and 36 hours after every 4 hours. RESULTS: Patients in the DP group had lower mean MAP and HR during intubation period than the D group and needed fewer opioids and doses of opioids in addition to drug study infusion pre- (P = 0.001) and post-extubation (P = 0.001 and P = 0.022, respectively). The DP group patients were extubated earlier (P = 0.001). After extubation, the DP group had less pain than the D group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that adding paracetamol to the dexmedetomidine infusion pump can provide better analgesia.
