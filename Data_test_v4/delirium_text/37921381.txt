The aim of this paper was to investigate whether baseline disability to perform basic activities of daily living (BADL) was an independent prognostic factor for death after the index visit to the ED during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether it had a different impact on patients with and without diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of the EDEN-Covid (Emergency Department and Elder Needs during COVID) cohort was carried out, consisting of all patients aged >=65 years seen in 52 Spanish EDs selected by chance during 7 consecutive days (30/3/2020 to 5/4/2020). Demographic, clinical, functional, mental and social variables were analyzed. Dependence was categorized with the Barthel index (BI) as independent (BI=100), mild-moderate dependence (100>BI>60) and severe-total dependence (BI<60), and their crude and adjusted association was evaluated with mortality at 30, 180 and 365 days using COX proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of 9,770 enrolled patients with a mean age of 79 years, 51% were men, 6,305 (64.53%) were independent, 2,340 (24%) had mild-moderate dependence, and 1,125 (11.5%) severe-total dependence. The number of deaths at 30 days in these three groups was 500 (7.9%), 521 (22.3%) and 378 (33.6%), respectively; at 180 days it was 757 (12%), 725 (30.9%) and 526 (46.8%); and at 365 days 954 (15.1%), 891 (38.1%) and 611 (54.3%). In relation to independent patients, the adjusted risks (hazard ratio) of dying within 30 days associated with mild-moderate and severe-total dependency were 1.91 (95% CI: 1.66-2.19) and 2.51. (2.11-2.98); at 180 days they were 1.88 (1.68-2.11) and 2.64 (2.28-3.05); and at 365 days they were 1.82 (1.64-2.02) and 2.47 (2.17-2.82). This negative impact of dependency on mortality was greater in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 (p interaction at 30, 180 and 365 days of 0.36, 0.05 and 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The functional dependence of older patients who attend Spanish EDs during the first wave of the pandemic is associated with mortality at 30, 180 and 365 days, and this risk is significantly higher in patients treated for COVID-19.
