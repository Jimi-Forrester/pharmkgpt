38023152|t|CD147: an integral and potential molecule to abrogate hallmarks of cancer.
38023152|a|CD147 also known as EMMPRIN, basigin, and HAb18G, is a single-chain type I transmembrane protein shown to be overexpressed in aggressive human cancers of CNS, head and neck, breasts, lungs, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skin, hematological, and musculoskeletal. In these malignancies, the molecule is integral to the diverse but complimentary hallmarks of cancer: it is pivotal in cancerous proliferative signaling, growth propagation, cellular survival, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, invasion, and metastasis. CD147 also has regulatory functions in cancer-enabling characteristics such as DNA damage response (DDR) and immune evasion. These neoplastic functions of CD147 are executed through numerous and sometimes overlapping molecular pathways: it transduces signals from upstream molecules or ligands such as cyclophilin A (CyPA), CD98, and S100A9; activates a repertoire of downstream molecules and pathways including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2,3,9, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1/2alpha, PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1alpha, and ATM/ATR/p53; and also functions as an indispensable chaperone or regulator to monocarboxylate, fatty acid, and amino acid transporters. Interestingly, induced loss of functions to CD147 prevents and reverses the acquired hallmarks of cancer in neoplastic diseases. Silencing of Cd147 also alleviates known resistance to chemoradiotherapy exhibited by malignant tumors like carcinomas of the breast, lung, pancreas, liver, gastric, colon, ovary, cervix, prostate, urinary bladder, glioblastoma, and melanoma. Targeting CD147 antigen in chimeric and induced-chimeric antigen T cell or antibody therapies is also shown to be safer and more effective. Moreover, incorporating anti-CD147 monoclonal antibodies in chemoradiotherapy, oncolytic viral therapy, and oncolytic virus-based-gene therapies increases effectiveness and reduces on and off-target toxicity. This study advocates the expedition and expansion by further exploiting the evidence acquired from the experimental studies that modulate CD147 functions in hallmarks of cancer and cancer-enabling features and strive to translate them into clinical practice to alleviate the emergency and propagation of cancer, as well as the associated clinical and social consequences.
