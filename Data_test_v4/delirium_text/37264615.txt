37264615|t|Electroencephalographic (EEG) Biomarkers in Genetic Neurodevelopmental Disorders.
37264615|a|Collectively, neurodevelopmental disorders are highly prevalent, but more than a third of neurodevelopmental disorders have an identifiable genetic etiology, each of which is individually rare. The genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are often involved in early brain development, neuronal signaling, or synaptic plasticity. Novel treatments for many genetic neurodevelopmental disorders are being developed, but disease-relevant clinical outcome assessments and biomarkers are limited. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising noninvasive potential biomarker of brain function. It has been used extensively in epileptic disorders, but its application in neurodevelopmental disorders needs further investigation. In this review, we explore the use of EEG in 3 of the most prevalent genetic neurodevelopmental disorders-Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, and fragile X syndrome. Quantitative analyses of EEGs, such as power spectral analysis or measures of connectivity, can quantify EEG signatures seen on qualitative review and potentially correlate with phenotypes. In both Angelman syndrome and Rett syndrome, increased delta power on spectral analysis has correlated with clinical markers of disease severity including developmental disability and seizure burden, whereas spectral power analysis on EEG in fragile X syndrome tends to demonstrate abnormalities in gamma power. Further studies are needed to establish reliable relationships between quantitative EEG biomarkers and clinical phenotypes in rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders.
