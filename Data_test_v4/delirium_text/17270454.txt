17270454|a|We aimed to determine plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (sPECAM-1) as surrogate markers for endothelial cell activation in clinically diagnosed patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=260), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=39) and non-demented controls (n=34). Plasma sICAM-1 and sPECAM-1 were higher and CSF sVCAM-1 were lower in AD and DLB patients than in controls (p<0.001). DLB patients had higher CSF sICAM-1, but lower CSF sVCAM-1 (p<0.001). No difference in ACE levels was found between the dementia groups and controls. In controls and AD patients CSF sICAM and sVCAM-1 strongly correlated with each other and with blood barrier permeability whereas in DLB group these correlations were weaker. The observed patterns in adhesion molecules may reflect distinctions in the pathophysiological basis of their generation in dementia patients.
