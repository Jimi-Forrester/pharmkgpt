36356902|a|The poisonous metalloid arsenite induces widespread misfolding and aggregation of nascent proteins in vivo, and this mode of toxic action might underlie its suspected role in the pathology of certain protein misfolding diseases. Evolutionarily conserved protein quality-control systems protect cells against arsenite-mediated proteotoxicity, and herein, we systematically assessed the contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the autophagy-vacuole pathway, and chaperone-mediated disaggregation to the clearance of arsenite-induced protein aggregates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is the main pathway that clears aggregates formed during arsenite stress and that cells depend on this pathway for optimal growth. The autophagy-vacuole pathway and chaperone-mediated disaggregation both contribute to clearance, but their roles appear less prominent than the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our in vitro assays with purified components of the yeast disaggregating machinery demonstrated that chaperone binding to aggregates formed in the presence of arsenite is impaired. Hsp104 and Hsp70 chaperone activity was unaffected by arsenite, suggesting that this metalloid influences aggregate structure, making them less accessible for chaperone-mediated disaggregation. We further show that the defect in chaperone-mediated refolding of a model protein was abrogated in a cysteine-free version of the substrate, suggesting that arsenite directly modifies cysteines in non-native target proteins. In conclusion, our study sheds novel light on the differential contributions of protein quality-control systems to aggregate clearance and cell proliferation and extends our understanding of how these systems operate during arsenite stress.
