36306393|a|BACKGROUND: Although antipsychotics are commonly used for delirium, their adverse effects are a serious concern in light of extrapyramidal symptoms and cardiovascular disturbances. In clinical practice, sedative antidepressants are frequently used as an alternative treatment for delirium; however, there is scarce evidence. Thus, we conducted a retrospective chart review to examine the use and effectiveness of trazodone and mianserin for delirium. METHODS: Patients who were admitted to a university hospital during 4 years and received either trazodone or mianserin on a regular schedule as monotherapy for the treatment of delirium were included. The rates of and times to the improvement of delirium were compared. RESULTS: Among 3971 patients who developed delirium, 379 (9.5%) and 341 (8.6%) patients received trazodone and mianserin on a regular schedule; 52 and 46 patients met the eligibility criteria (ie, monotherapy) for trazodone and mianserin, respectively. The percentages of patients 65 years or older were 86.5% (n = 45) for trazodone and 89.1% (n = 41) for mianserin. The rates of the improvement of delirium were 63.5% for trazodone and 50.0% for mianserin. Times to the improvement of delirium were 5.3 days (95% confidence interval, 3.2-7.4 days) for trazodone and 9.3 days (95% confidence interval, 5.3-13.3 days) for mianserin. There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes between the 2 groups ( P = 0.17 and P = 0.13, respectively). CONCLUSION: Considering potentially serious, sometimes lethal, adverse effects of antipsychotics, sedative antidepressants such as trazodone and mianserin may be a treatment option for delirium, especially in the elderly.
