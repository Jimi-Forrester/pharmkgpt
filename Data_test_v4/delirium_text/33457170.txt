33457170|a|The emerging SARS-CoV-2 viral disease (COVID-19) has caused a global health alert due to its high rate of infection and mortality in individuals with chronic cardiovascular comorbidities, in addition to generating complex clinical conditions. This has forced the scientific community to explore different strategies that allow combating this viral infection as well as treating life-threatening systemic effect of the infection on the individual. In this work, we have reviewed the most recent scientific evidence to provide a comprehensive panorama regarding the biotechnological strategies that have been proposed to combat this new viral infection. We have focused our analysis on vaccine production, nanotechnology applications, repurposing of know drugs for unrelated pathologies, and the search for bioactive molecules obtained from natural products. The goals include safely use as potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments, based on in silico and in vivo studies, including clinical trials around the world for the correct and timely diagnosis of the infection. This review aims to highlight the development of new ideas that can decrease the time lines for research output and improve research quality while at the same time, keeping in mind the efficacy and safety aspects of these potential biotechnological strategies.
