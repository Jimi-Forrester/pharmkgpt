38053545|t|A glance through the effects of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and cytokines on Alzheimer's disease.
38053545|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Unfortunately, despite numerous studies, an effective treatment for AD has not yet been established. There is remarkable evidence indicating that the innate immune mechanism and adaptive immune response play significant roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Several studies have reported changes in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in AD patients. This mini-review article discusses the potential contribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reactivity to amyloid beta (Abeta) protein in individuals with AD. Moreover, this mini-review examines the potential associations between T cells, heme oxygenase (HO), and impaired mitochondria in the context of AD. While current mathematical models of AD have not extensively addressed the inclusion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, there exist models that can be extended to consider AD as an autoimmune disease involving these T cell types. Additionally, the mini-review covers recent research that has investigated the utilization of machine learning models, considering the impact of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
