37786484|t|Clinical Features of Patients With Hematological Malignancies Treated at the Palliative Care Unit.
37786484|a|Background: In Japan, the number of patients with aggressive hematological malignancies (PHMs) admitted at the palliative care unit (PCU) in their end-of-life (EOL) stage was fewer than that of patients with solid tumors due to several reasons. The assessment of patient characteristics and the methods of survival prediction among PHMs in the EOL stage are warranted. Objectives: This study aimed to identify the current medical status and the method of survival prediction among PHMs treated at the PCU. Setting/Subjects/Measurements: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 25 PHMs treated at our PCU between January 2017 and December 2020. The association between survival time and the palliative prognostic score (PAP) and palliative prognostic index (PPI) was analyzed. Results: The average age of the PHMs was higher than that of patients with lung cancer as a control. The median survival time of the PHMs was shorter than the control group. Most PHMs could not receive standard chemotherapy, and the most common cause of death was disease-related organ failure. Significant associations were observed between the survival time and each PAP/PPI value in patients with malignant lymphoma, but not in those with leukemia. Conclusion: The PHMs in the PCU had a lower median survival time than the control group. These results were induced by the result of patient selection to avoid treatment-related severe toxicity. The survival prediction using the PAP and PPI was less accurate in patients with leukemia.
