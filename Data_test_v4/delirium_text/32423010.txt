32423010|t|Histidine: A Systematic Review on Metabolism and Physiological Effects in Human and Different Animal Species.
32423010|a|Histidine is an essential amino acid (EAA) in mammals, fish, and poultry. We aim to give an overview of the metabolism and physiological effects of histidine in humans and different animal species through a systematic review following the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). In humans, dietary histidine may be associated with factors that improve metabolic syndrome and has an effect on ion absorption. In rats, histidine supplementation increases food intake. It also provides neuroprotection at an early stage and could protect against epileptic seizures. In chickens, histidine is particularly important as a limiting factor for carnosine synthesis, which has strong anti-oxidant effects. In fish, dietary histidine may be one of the most important factors in preventing cataracts. In ruminants, histidine is a limiting factor for milk protein synthesis and could be the first limiting AA for growth. In excess, histidine supplementation can be responsible for eating and memory disorders in humans and can induce growth retardation and metabolic dysfunction in most species. To conclude, the requirements for histidine, like for other EAA, have been derived from growth and AA composition in tissues and also have specific metabolic roles depending on species and dietary levels.
