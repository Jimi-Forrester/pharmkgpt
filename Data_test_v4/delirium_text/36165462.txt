Yet so far, research on entorhinal cortex is still limited. Here, we provided the first single-nucleus transcriptomic map of primate entorhinal cortex aging. Our result revealed that synapse signaling, neurogenesis, cellular homeostasis, and inflammation-related genes and pathways changed in a cell-type-specific manner with age. Moreover, among the 7 identified cell types, we highlighted the neuronal lineage that was most affected by aging. By integrating multiple datasets, we found entorhinal cortex aging was closely related to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, particularly for AD. The expression levels of APP and MAPT, which generate beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, were increased in most aged entorhinal cortex cell types. In addition, we found that neuronal lineage in the aged entorhinal cortex is more prone to AD and identified a subpopulation of excitatory neurons that are most highly associated with AD. Altogether, this study provides a comprehensive cellular and molecular atlas of the primate entorhinal cortex at single-cell resolution and provides new insights into potential therapeutic targets against age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
