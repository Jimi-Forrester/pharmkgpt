10961435|a|Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely symptomatic and improve cognition. Only a single trial of selegiline and vitamin E has been demonstrated to delay progression of the time to clinically important endpoints in this disease. Effective treatments currently under development are designed to either slow the rate of progression or delay the time of onset. Classes of agents currently being investigated include: antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, growth factors, hormones, and drugs designed to prevent the deposition or enhance the removal of amyloid. In addition to trials designed to slow the rate of progression, several primary prevention trials have already been initiated. Finally, a series of trials designed to prevent the development of AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment have been initiated.
