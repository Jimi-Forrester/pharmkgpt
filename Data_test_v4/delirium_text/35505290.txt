35505290|t|Effect of individually tailored nutritional counselling on protein and energy intake among older people receiving home care at risk of or having malnutrition: a non-randomised intervention study.
35505290|a|BACKGROUND: With ageing, food intake may decrease and lead to an insufficient nutrient intake causing protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) which is associated with adverse health effects and increased mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of individually tailored dietary counseling focused on protein intake among home care clients with PEM or at risk of developing PEM. The secondary aim was to study the intake of energy and other nutrients. METHODS: This intervention study is part of the non-randomised population-based multidisciplinary Nutrition, Oral Health and Medication study (NutOrMed study). The intervention group comprised 112 and the control group 87 home care clients (>=75 years) with PEM or risk of PEM. PEM was defined by Mini Nutritional Assessment score < 24 and/or plasma albumin < 35 g/L. The nutrients intake was assessed from 24-hour dietary recall at the baseline and after the six-month intervention. The intervention consisted of an individually tailored dietary counseling; the persons were instructed to increase their food intake with protein and energy dense food items, the number of meals and consumption of protein-, energy- and nutrient-rich snacks for six months. RESULTS: After the six-month nutritional intervention, the mean change in protein intake increased 0.04 g/kgBW (95% CI 0.05 to 0.2), fibre 0.8 g (95% CI 0.2 to 4.3), vitamin D 8.5 mug (95% CI 0.7 to 4.4), E 0.6 mg (95% CI 0.4 to 2.2), B12 0.7 mug (95% CI 0.02 to 2.6), folate 8.7 mug (95% CI 1.5 to 46.5), iron 0.4 mg 95% CI 0.6 to 2.4), and zinc 0.5 mg (95% CI 0.6 to 2.2) in the intervention group compared with the control group. The proportion of those receiving less than 1.0 g/kg/BW protein decreased from 67 to 51% in the intervention group and from 84 to 76% in the control group. Among home care clients with a cognitive decline (MMSE< 18), protein intake increased in the intervention group by 0.2 g/kg/BW (p = 0.048) but there was no change in the control group. CONCLUSION: An individual tailored nutritional intervention improves the intake of protein and other nutrients among vulnerable home care clients with PEM or its risk and in persons with cognitive decline.
