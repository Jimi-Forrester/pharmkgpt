31650012|t|Latent class analysis identifies functional decline with Amsterdam IADL in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
31650012|a|INTRODUCTION: Trials in Alzheimer's disease (AD) now include participants at the earliest stages to prevent further decline. However, the lack of tools sensitive to subtle functional changes in early-stage AD hinders the development of new therapies as it is difficult to prove their clinical relevance. METHODS: We assessed functional changes over three years in 289 elderly memory complainers from the Investigation of Alzheimer's Predictors in subjective memory complainers cohort using the Amsterdam Instrumental-Activities-of-Daily-Living questionnaire (A-IADL-Q). RESULTS: No overall functional decline related to AD imaging markers was evidenced. However, five distinct classes of A-IADL-Q trajectories were identified. The largest class (212 [73.4%]) had stable A-IADL-Q scores over 3 years. A second group (23 [8.0%]) showed a persistent functional decline, higher amyloid load (P = .0005), and lower education (P = .0392). DISCUSSION: The A-IADL-Q identified a subtle functional decline in asymptomatic at-risk AD individuals. This could have important implications in the field of early intervention in AD.
