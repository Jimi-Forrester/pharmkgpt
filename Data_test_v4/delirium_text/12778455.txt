12778455|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between the apolipoprotein E(apoE) promoter -427C/T polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a Chinese Han population in Shanghai. METHODS: The apoE promoter -427C/T polymorphism in 104 AD cases and 110 healthy subjects was detected using polymerase chain reaction method and restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping technique. The differences in polymorphic distribution between the two groups were tested, and odds ratio was computed. RESULTS: No differences in apoE -427C/T genotypic distribution were observed between AD cases and controls (P>0.05). Even after stratification according to apoE epsilon 4 stratum, there was not any polymorphic distribution difference when epsilon 4 carriers or non epsilon 4 carriers were compared with controls (P>0.05). The association between AD and apoE epsilon 4 appeared in the TT group(OR=3.94,95%, CI:22067038, chi-square=21.48, P<0.05), but not in CT or CC group. CONCLUSION: ApoE -427C/T polymorphism was not a susceptibility factor for AD in this Han population in Shanghai.
