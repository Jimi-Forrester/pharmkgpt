29791461|t|A discrete mathematical model for the aggregation of beta-Amyloid.
29791461|a|Dementia associated with the Alzheimer's disease is thought to be correlated with the conversion of the beta - Amyloid (Abeta) peptides from soluble monomers to aggregated oligomers and insoluble fibrils. We present a discrete-time mathematical model for the aggregation of Abeta monomers into oligomers using concepts from chemical kinetics and population dynamics. Conditions for the stability and instability of the equilibria of the model are established. A formula for the number of monomers that is required for producing oligomers is also given. This may provide compound designers a mechanism to inhibit the Abeta aggregation.
