23154387|t|The Ca2+/Mn2+ ion-pump PMR1 links elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) levels to alpha-synuclein toxicity in Parkinson's disease models.
23154387|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, which arises from a yet elusive concurrence between genetic and environmental factors. The protein alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn), the principle toxic effector in PD, has been shown to interfere with neuronal Ca(2+) fluxes, arguing for an involvement of deregulated Ca(2+) homeostasis in this neuronal demise. Here, we identify the Golgi-resident Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) ATPase PMR1 (plasma membrane-related Ca(2+)-ATPase 1) as a phylogenetically conserved mediator of alphaSyn-driven changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Expression of alphaSyn in yeast resulted in elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and increased cell death, both of which could be inhibited by deletion of PMR1. Accordingly, absence of PMR1 prevented alphaSyn-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons in nematodes and flies. In addition, alphaSyn failed to compromise locomotion and survival of flies when PMR1 was absent. In conclusion, the alphaSyn-driven rise of cytosolic Ca(2+) levels is pivotal for its cytotoxicity and requires PMR1.
