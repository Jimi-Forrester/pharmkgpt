35531241|a|Silver nanoparticles are well received in the cosmeceutical industry due to their broad spectrum of pharmacology applications. Research on the therapeutic properties exhibited by silver nanoparticles revealed that the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties are the main attraction in the establishment of nanocosmeceutical products whereby their mechanisms of action are reviewed in this paper. In addition, studies on other uses of silver nanoparticles acknowledged that the particles act as antifungal agents in nail polishes and pigments in coloured beauty products such as lipsticks and eye shadows. Despite the extensive use of silver nanoparticles in the cosmetic line, there are still limited resources on the mechanism of actions and the effect of the particles on the bio-functionality of the body. The safety of silver nanoparticles could be comprehended from their skin penetration ability and toxicity to the human body in which it could be justified that both features are mainly influenced by the morphology of the particles and the method of application. This article summarizes exclusively on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, the biomedical mechanisms and applications as well the limitations with respect to skin penetration ability and toxicity effects which will contribute significantly to the vast research on the association of nanotechnology and cosmetics.
