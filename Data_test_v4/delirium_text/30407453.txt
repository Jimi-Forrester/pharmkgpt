30407453|a|BACKGROUND: Dementias are rarely considered to be a main cause of death; therefore there are only few studies on Alzheimer's mortality covering long periods. OBJECTIVE: To describe mortality from Alzheimer's disease in Mexico for the period from 1980 to 2014. METHOD: Cross-sectional study where, with official mortality data in Mexico according to codes 331.0 and G30, respectively, of the 9th and 10th revisions of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, crude and standardized Alzheimer's disease mortality rates were obtained, both nationally and by states. RESULTS: From almost being inexistent, deaths from Alzheimer's disease went to a rate of 65.12 per 1000 females and 43.66 per 1000 males in the 2010-2014 five-year period. Throughout the study period, the age group with highest mortality rates for this cause were those older than 80 years, with 0.29 per 100,000 population in 1980-1984 and 55.02 in 100,000 in the 2010-2014 period. The region with the highest mortality was the northwest, with rates higher than 2.28 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from Alzheimer's disease is a public health problem in Mexico with a growing trend, especially among women and older adults. Early diagnostic measures and opportune treatment are required in primary care in order to reduce this problem.
