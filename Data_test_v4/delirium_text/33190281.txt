33190281|t|Alcohol Use Disorder is Associated with Upregulation of MicroRNA-34a and MicroRNA-34c in Hippocampal Postmortem Tissue.
33190281|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate epigenetic mechanisms potentially involved in the cognitive decline associated with chronic alcohol intake, we evaluated the expressions of three micro-RNAs (miR-34a, -34b, and -34c) highly expressed in the hippocampus and involved in neuronal physiology and pathology. MiR-34a participates in functioning and survival of mature neurons; miR-34b is associated with Alzheimer-like disorders; and miR-34c is implicated in the memory impairment of Alzheimer disease in rodents and humans. METHODS: A total of 69 cases were selected from the Biobank for Aging Studies and categorized according to the absence (n = 50) or presence (n = 19) of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Cases presenting with neuropathological diagnoses of dementias were excluded. Total RNA was extracted from hippocampal paraffinized slices, complementary DNA was synthesized from miRs, and RT-qPCR was performed with TaqMan  assays. RESULTS: Higher expressions of miR-34a and miR-34c, but not of miR-34b, were found in the group with AUD in comparison with the group without AUD after adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, body mass index, presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and physical inactivity). CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal upregulation of miR-34a and miR-34c may be involved in the cognitive decline associated with chronic alcohol consumption.
