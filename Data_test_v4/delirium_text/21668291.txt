21668291|t|Structural dynamics of the DeltaE22 (Osaka) familial Alzheimer's disease-linked amyloid beta-protein.
21668291|a|A familial form of Alzheimer disease recently was described in a kindred in Osaka, Japan. This kindred possesses an amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) precursor mutation within the Abeta coding region that results in the deletion of Glu22 (DeltaE22). We report here results of studies of [DeltaE22]Abeta40 and [DeltaE22]Abeta42 that sought to elucidate the conformational dynamics, oligomerization behavior, fibril formation kinetics, fibril morphology, and fibril stability of these mutant peptides. Both [DeltaE22]Abeta peptides had extraordinary beta-sheet formation propensities. The [DeltaE22]Abeta40 mutant formed beta-sheet secondary structure elements  400-fold faster. Studies of beta-sheet stability in the presence of fluorinated alcohol cosolvents or high pH revealed that the DeltaE22 mutation substantially increased stability, producing a rank order of [DeltaE22]Abeta42 >>Abeta42 > [DeltaE22]Abeta40 > Abeta40. The mutation facilitated formation of oligomers by [DeltaE22]Abeta42 (dodecamers and octadecamers) that were not observed with Abeta42. Both Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides formed nebulous globular and small string-like structures immediately upon solvation from lyophilizates, whereas short protofibrillar and fibrillar structures were evident immediately in the DeltaE22 samples. Determination of the critical concentration for fibril formation for the [DeltaE22]Abeta peptides showed it to be  1/2 that of the wild type homologues, demonstrating that the mutations causes a modest increase in fibril stability. The magnitude of this increase, when considered in the context of the extraordinary increase in beta-sheet propensity for the DeltaE22 peptides, suggests that the primary biophysical effect of the mutation is to accelerate conformational changes in the peptide monomer that facilitate oligomerization and higher-order assembly.
