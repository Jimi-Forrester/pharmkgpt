39760610|t|Identifying Challenges Related to the Management of Comorbidities in People with Dementia in Residential Care: Expert Delphi Consensus Exercise.
39760610|a|Improving early detection, management, and treatment of comorbid conditions to dementia in residential care could slow down cognitive and functional decline, and increase residents' quality of life. We conducted a Delphi study comprising three rounds (two surveys and an interview) to identify the most difficult dementia comorbidities to deal with in residential care and related issues. Participants were 15 UK-based experts including academics, residential care workers, geriatricians, and neuropsychologists. In the first-round of the Delphi, experts mentioned 15 comorbid health conditions to dementia and 19 issues. In the following rounds of the Delphi mental illnesses, delirium, and sensory impairments were identified as the most difficult comorbidities to dementia to deal with. Medication management, symptom management, shortage of staff, lack of training among staff, and limited resources from the broader healthcare system were identified as the most difficult issues when dealing with dementia comorbidities.
