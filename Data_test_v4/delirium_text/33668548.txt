33668548|t|Is There an Oncological Benefit of Performing Bilateral Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Patients with Penile Cancer and Inguinal Lymph Node Metastasis?
33668548|a|We aim to review the literature for studies investigating the oncological outcomes of patients with penile cancer (PC) undergoing bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in the presence of inguinal lymph node metastasis (LNM) who are at risk of harboring pelvic metastasis. A search of English language literature was performed using the PubMed-MEDLINE database up to 3 December 2020 to identify articles addressing bilateral PLND in PC patients. Eight articles investigating bilateral PLND met our inclusion criteria. Patients with pelvic LNM have a dismal prognosis and, therefore, PLND has an important role in both the staging and treatment of PC patients. Ipsilateral PLND is recommended in the presence of >=2 positive inguinal nodes and/or extranodal extension (ENE). Significant survival improvements were observed with a higher pelvic lymph node yield, in patients with pN2 disease, and in men treated with bilateral PLND as opposed to ipsilateral PLND. Nevertheless, the role of bilateral PLND for unilateral inguinal LNM remains unclear. Although the EAU guidelines state that pelvic nodal disease does not occur without ipsilateral inguinal LNM, metastatic spread from one inguinal side to the contralateral pelvic side has been reported in a number of studies. Further studies are needed to clarify the disseminative pattern of LNM, in order to establish PLND templates according to patients' risk profiles and to investigate the benefit of performing bilateral PLND for unilateral inguinal disease.
