22396894|t|NF-kappaB in Aging and Disease.
22396894|a|Stochastic damage to cellular macromolecules and organelles is thought to be a driving force behind aging and associated degenerative changes. However, stress response pathways activated by this damage may also contribute to aging. The IKK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway has been proposed to be one of the key mediators of aging. It is activated by genotoxic, oxidative, and inflammatory stresses and regulates expression of cytokines, growth factors, and genes that regulate apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell senescence, and inflammation. Transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB is increased in a variety of tissues with aging and is associated with numerous age-related degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, diabetes and osteoporosis. In mouse models, inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to delayed onset of age-related symptoms and pathologies. In addition, NF-kappaB activation is linked with many of the known lifespan regulators including insulin/IGF-1, FOXO, SIRT, mTOR, and DNA damage. Thus NF-kappaB represents a possible therapeutic target for extending mammalian healthspan.
