39778970|t|Updated Appropriate Use Criteria for Amyloid and Tau PET: A Report from the Alzheimer's Association and Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Workgroup.
39778970|a|The Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to update appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. Methods: The workgroup identified key research questions that guided a systematic literature review on clinical amyloid/tau PET. Building on this review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each scenario by consensus as "rarely appropriate," "uncertain," or "appropriate." Ratings were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone modalities. Results: For amyloid PET, 7 scenarios were rated as appropriate, 2 as uncertain, and 8 as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, 5 scenarios were rated as appropriate, 6 as uncertain, and 6 as rarely appropriate. Conclusion: AUC for amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for clinical use of these technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
