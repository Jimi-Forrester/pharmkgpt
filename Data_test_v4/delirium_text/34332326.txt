34332326|a|Postoperative delirium (POD), a syndrome of confusion and inattention, frequently occurs after anesthesia and surgery. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays key roles in executive functions and cognitive controls. However, the neuropathogenesis of POD in the PFC remains largely unknown. We investigated whether anesthesia and surgery induced neurofunctional changes in the mouse PFC. After laparotomy was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, PFC neuronal activities were compared at the synaptic level using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. A battery of behavioral tests measuring natural and learned behaviors, and effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine were also examined. In the anesthesia/surgery group showing changes in natural and learned behaviors, the frequency of excitatory synaptic responses in PFC pyramidal neurons was decreased after the surgery without any changes in the response kinetics. On the other hand, neuronal intrinsic properties and inhibitory synaptic responses were not changed. In the anesthesia/surgery group administered intraoperative dexmedetomidine, the excitatory synaptic transmission and the behaviors were not altered. These results suggest that anesthesia and surgery induce a functional reduction selectively in the PFC excitatory synaptic transmission, and intraoperative dexmedetomidine inhibits the plastic change in the PFC excitatory synaptic input.
