39585059|a|Background. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. It has been suggested that the factors that cause pathologic changes and lead to the development of AD may also include changes in certain neuropeptides. The implication of the neuropeptide (NPY) in the pathogenesis of AD and its potential therapeutic role is possible due to the following properties: involvement in adult neurogenesis, regulatory effects on the immune system, the inhibition of potential-dependent Ca2+ channels, and the reduction in glutamate excitotoxicity. The aim of our review was to summarize recent data on the role of NPY in AD development and to explore its potential as a biomarker and a possible therapeutic target. Materials and methods. We performed a systematic review of studies, for which we search using the keywords "Alzheimer's disease and neuropeptide Y", "Alzheimer's disease and NPY", "AD and NPY", "Neuropeptide Y and Neurodegenerative disease". Nineteen articles were included in the review. Results. The NPY levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma have been found to be reduced or unchanged in AD patients; however, these findings need to be confirmed in more recent studies. Data obtained in transgenic animal models support the role of NPY in AD pathogenesis. The neuroprotective effects of NPY have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in AD models. Conclusion. The findings may open new possibilities for using NPY as a diagnostic marker to detect AD at earlier stages of the disease or as a potential therapeutic target due to its neuroprotective properties.
