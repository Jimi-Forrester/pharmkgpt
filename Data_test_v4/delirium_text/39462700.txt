39462700|a|Multiple studies over the last decade have established that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are associated with changes in the gut microbiome. These alterations in organismal composition result in changes in the abundances of functions encoded by the microbial community, including metabolic capabilities, which likely impact host disease mechanisms. Gut microbes access dietary components and other molecules made by the host and produce metabolites that can enter circulation and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In recent years, several microbial metabolites have been associated with or have been shown to influence host pathways relevant to ADRD pathology. These include short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, tryptophan derivatives (such as kynurenine, serotonin, tryptamine, and indoles), and trimethylamine/trimethylamine N-oxide. Notably, some of these metabolites cross the BBB and can have various effects on the brain, including modulating the release of neurotransmitters and neuronal function, inducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and impacting synaptic function. Microbial metabolites can also impact the central nervous system through immune, enteroendocrine, and enteric nervous system pathways, these perturbations in turn impact the gut barrier function and peripheral immune responses, as well as the BBB integrity, neuronal homeostasis and neurogenesis, and glial cell maturation and activation. This review examines the evidence supporting the notion that ADRD is influenced by gut microbiota and its metabolites. The potential therapeutic advantages of microbial metabolites for preventing and treating ADRD are also discussed, highlighting their potential role in developing new treatments.
