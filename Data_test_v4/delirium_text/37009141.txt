37009141|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: It is known that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain could regulate cognitive functions as well as blood pressure. Inhibition of RAS for the improvement of cognitive function may be a new strategy, but studies so far have mostly reported on the effects of RAS inhibition by drugs, and there is no research on cognitive improvement through RAS inhibition of food ingredients. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of curcumin on blood pressure and cognitive function and its related mechanism in spontaneously hypertensive rat/Izm (SHR/Izm). MATERIALS/METHODS: Six-week-old SHR/Izm rats were divided into 5 groups: control group (CON), scopolamine group (SCO, drug for inducing cognitive deficits), positive control (SCO and tacrine [TAC]), curcumin 100 group (CUR100, SCO + Cur 100 mg/kg), and curcumin 200 group (CUR200, SCO + Cur 200 mg/kg). Changes in blood pressure, RAS, cholinergic system, and cognitive function were compared before and after cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The SCO group showed increased blood pressure and significantly reduced cognitive function based on the y-maze and passive avoidance test. Curcumin treatments significantly improved blood pressure and cognitive function compared with the SCO group. In both the CUR100 and CUR200 groups, the mRNA expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type1 (AT1), as well as the concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) in brain tissue were significantly decreased. The mRNA expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and acetylcholine (ACh) content was significantly increased, compared with the SCO group. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of curcumin improved blood pressure and cognitive function in SCO-induced hypertensive mice, indicating that the cholinergic system was improved by suppressing RAS and AT1 receptor expression and increasing the mAChR expression.
