29303784|a|Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is characterised by hypofunction of acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter in the distinct region of brain. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that metabolises the ACh at synaptic cleft resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Medicinal plants have been used to treat numerous ailments and improve human health from ancient time. A traditional system of medicine is long recognised for its effective management of neurological disorders. The present review confers the scope of some common medicinal plants with a special focus on AChE-mediated central nervous system complications especially Alzheimer's disease. Literature suggests that medicinal plants reduce neuronal dysfunctions by reducing AChE activity in different brain regions. In some instances, activation of AChE activity by medicinal plants also showed therapeutic potential. In conclusion, medicinal plants have a wide scope and possess therapeutic potential to efficiently manage neurological disorders associated with AChE dysregulation.
