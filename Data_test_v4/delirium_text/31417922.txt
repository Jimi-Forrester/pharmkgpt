31417922|t|New treatment modalities in Alzheimer's disease.
31417922|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a major public health challenge without an effective treatment to prevent or stop it. Routinely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine seem to slow disease progression only to a limited extend. Therefore, many investigations on new drugs and other treatment modalities are ongoing in close association with increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease. Here, we review the studies about the new treatment modalities in AD with a classification based on their main targets, specifically pathologic structures of the disease, amyloid and tau, neural network dysfunction with special interest to the regulation of gamma oscillations, and attempts for the restoration of neural tissue via regenerative medicine. Additionally, we describe the evolving modalities related to gut microbiota, modulation, microglial function, and glucose metabolism.
