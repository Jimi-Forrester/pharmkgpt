This study aimed to determine whether ultrasound measurements of the rectus abdominis (RA) and biceps brachii (BB) could predict frailty in patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale in adults aged >=60 years. Ultrasound measurements of the rectus abdominis, BB, and quadriceps femoris muscles, along with thigh circumference measurements, were obtained before surgery. The predictive ability of the unadjusted and BMI- and body surface area (BSA)-adjusted measurements were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) values. Postoperative outcomes, such as admission to the intensive care unit or skilled nursing facility, delirium, falls, re-hospitalization, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 148 patients. BB thickness provided a fair prediction of frailty. Average measurements of both BB adjusted for BMI (0.708, 95% CI 0.602-0.814; P<0.001), and BSA (0.708, 95% CI 0.598-0.817; P<0.001) had the highest AUC values. RA muscle measurements could not discriminate frailty. The BMI-adjusted measurements for: right quadriceps femoris thickness (AUC 0.614, 95% CI 0.503-0.725; P=0.044), left thigh circumference (AUC 0.648, 95% CI 0.528-0.769; P=0.016), and average thigh circumference (AUC 0.630, 95% CI 0.511-0.750; P=0.033) had statistically significant but poor AUC values. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ultrasound measurements of the bilateral BB can fairly predict frailty in patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty.
