33006250|t|Nitrogen-Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots: A Potent Scavenger and Detector Targeting Alzheimer's beta-Amyloid Plaques.
33006250|a|The fibrillization and deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) are recognized to be the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which signify the need for the effective detection and inhibition of Abeta accumulation. Development of multifunctional agents that can inhibit Abeta aggregation, rapidly disaggregate fibrils, and image aggregates is one of the effective strategies to treat and diagnose AD. Herein, the multifunctionality of nitrogen-doped carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) targeting Abeta aggregation is reported. CPDs inhibit the fibrillization of Abeta monomers and rapidly disintegrate Abeta fibrils by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with Abeta in a time scale of seconds to minutes. Moreover, the interactions make CPDs label Abeta fibrils and emit enhanced red fluorescence by the binding, so CPDs can be used for in vivo imaging of the amyloids in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 as an AD model. Importantly, CPDs are demonstrated to scavenge the in vivo amyloid plaques and to promote the lifespan extension of CL2006 strain by alleviating the Abeta-triggered toxicity. Taken together, the multifunctional CPDs show an exciting prospect for further investigations in Abeta-targeted AD treatment and diagnosis, and this study provides new insight into the development of carbon materials in AD theranostics.
