38860069|t|Functional Outcomes After the Sacrifice of Mandibular Condyle Using Fibula Free Flap for Immediate Surgical Reconstruction.
38860069|a|Introduction Head and neck cancer with mandibular invasion often necessitates composite resection, leading to defects requiring reconstruction. Microvascular fibula free flap (FFF) surgery is a common approach for this purpose. In this study, we focus on our experience with condyle sacrifice, emphasizing treatment outcomes and functional results. Additionally, we highlight a contemporary perspective by discussing surgical techniques and radiographic outcomes based on a 3D analysis of neo-condyle placement on CT imaging. Methods We studied 23 patients who had undergone segmental mandibulectomy requiring FFF reconstruction between 2009 and 2020. These were all performed by the same surgeon (M.M.) at an academic tertiary care center. Twenty-three reconstructions included condyle sacrifice. Retrospective chart review was performed with a focus on treatment, functional outcomes, and surgical technique. Results A total of 23 patients were included in the study group (13 females and 10 males) with a mean age of 58.1 years. The most common surgical indication was for oncologic purposes (n=9; 39.1%). Twenty (87%) patients required tracheostomy, and all were decannulated. In terms of surgical complications, two (8.7%) patients had a degree of arterial insufficiency and two (8.7%) developed delayed infections. The average inpatient stay was 5.61 days, with a subsequent average clinic follow-up after 16.9 days. CT or MRI imaging was available for 21 (91.3%) patients, showing 14 (66.7%) neo-condyles within the glenoid fossa. Fifteen (71.4%) patients had some element of anterior displacement (average=6.27 mm), and seven (33.3%) patients had a component of lateral displacement (average=2.23 mm). Three (13%) patients died during the follow-up period. Eighteen (90%) of the surviving patients returned to an oral diet within an average of 24.9 days. All patients returned to normal interincisal distance by 12 months. All FFFs, with and without complications, remained viable. Conclusion We achieved favorable oral function outcomes in the majority of our patients. Intriguingly, although radiographic evidence revealed anterior and/or lateral displacement of the neo-condyle, there was no observed correlation with the resumption of oral diet, trismus, or crossbite among these patients.
