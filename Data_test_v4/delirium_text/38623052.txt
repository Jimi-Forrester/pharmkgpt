38623052|t|Understanding the Modulatory Role of E2012 on the gamma-Secretase-Substrate Interaction.
38623052|a|Allosteric modulation plays a critical role in enzyme functionality and requires a deep understanding of the interactions between the active and allosteric sites. gamma-Secretase (GS) is a key therapeutic target in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), through its role in the synthesis of amyloid beta peptides that accumulate in AD patients. This study explores the structure and dynamic effects of GS modulation by E2012 binding, employing well-tempered metadynamics and conventional molecular dynamics simulations across three binding scenarios: (1) GS enzyme with and without L458 inhibitor, (2) the GS-substrate complex together with the modulator E2012 in two different binding modes, and (3) E2012 interacting with a C99 substrate fragment. Our findings reveal that the presence of L458 induces conformational changes that contribute to stabilization of the GS enzyme dynamics, previously reported as a key factor that allowed the resolution of the cryo-EM structure and the enhanced binding of E2012. Furthermore, we identified the most favorable binding site for E2012 within the GS-substrate complex, uncovering significant modulatory effects and a complex network of interactions that influence the position of the substrate for catalysis. In addition, we explore a potential substrate-modulator binding before the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The insights gained from our study emphasize the importance of these interactions in the development of potential therapeutic interventions that target the functionality of the GS enzyme in AD.
