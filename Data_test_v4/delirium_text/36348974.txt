Methods: The AMYPRED study (NCT04828122) recruited 133 subjects with an established amyloid beta (Abeta) biomarker (66 Abeta+, 67 Abeta-) and clinical status (71 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 62 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or mild AD). Daily story recall tasks were administered via smartphones and analyzed with an AI system to predict MCI/mild AD and Abeta positivity. Results: Eighty-six percent of participants (115/133) completed remote assessments. The AI system predicted MCI/mild AD (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.85, +-0.07) but not Abeta (AUC = 0.62 +-0.11) in the full sample, and predicted Abeta in clinical subsamples (MCI/mild AD: AUC = 0.78 +-0.14; CU: AUC = 0.74 +-0.13) on short story variants (immediate recall). Long stories and delayed retellings delivered broadly similar results. Discussion: Speech-based testing offers simple and accessible screening for early-stage AD.
