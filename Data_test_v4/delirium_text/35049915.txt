35049915|t|Sonneradon A Extends Lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans by Modulating Mitochondrial and IIS Signaling Pathways.
35049915|a|Aging is related to the lowered overall functioning and increased risk for various age-related diseases in humans. Sonneradon A (SDA), a new compound first extracted from the edible fruits of mangrove Sonneratia apetala, showed remarkable antiaging activity. However, the role of SDA in antiaging remains unclear. In this article, we studied the function of SDA in antiaging by using the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans. Results showed that SDA inhibited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 53%, and reduced the accumulation of aging markers such as lipids and lipofuscins. Moreover, SDA also enhanced the innate immune response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Genetic analysis of a series of mutants showed that SDA extended the lifespan of the mutants of eat-2 and glp-1. Together, this effect may be related to the enhanced resistance to oxidative stress via mitochondrial and insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) pathways. The results of this study provided new evidence for an antiaging effect of SDA in C. elegans, as well as insights into the implication of antiaging activity of SDA in higher organisms.
