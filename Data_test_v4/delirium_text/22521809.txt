22521809|a|In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the microtubule-associated protein tau is found aggregated into paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary deposits. In solution, tau is intrinsically unstructured. However, the tubulin binding domain consisting of three or four 31-32 amino acid repeat regions exhibits both helical and beta-structure propensity and makes up the proteolysis resistant core of PHFs. Here, we studied the structure and dynamics of the three-repeat domain of tau (i.e. K19) when bound to membranes consisting of a phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine mixture or phosphatidylserine alone. Tau K19 binds to phospholipid vesicles with submicromolar affinity as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. The interaction is driven by electrostatic forces between the positively charged protein and the phospholipid head groups. The structure of the membrane-bound state of K19 was studied using CD spectroscopy and solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. To this end, the protein was selectively (13)C-labeled at all valine and leucine residues. Isotropic chemical shift values of tau K19 were consistent with a beta-structure. In addition, motionally averaged (1)H-(13)C dipolar couplings indicated a high rigidity of the protein backbone. The structure formation of K19 was also shown to depend on the charge density of the membrane. Phosphatidylserine membranes induced a gain in the alpha-helix structure along with an immersion of K19 into the phospholipid bilayer as indicated by a reduction of the lipid chain (2)H NMR order parameter. Our results provide structural insights into the membrane-bound state of tau K19 and support a potential role of phospholipid membranes in mediating the physiological and pathological functions of tau.
