28871793|t|Utility of Montreal Cognitive Assessment in Differentiating Dementia With Lewy Bodies From Alzheimer's Dementia.
28871793|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the 2 most common neurodegenerative dementias. Identification of patients with DLB is necessary to guide appropriate clinical management and medication trials. Patients with DLB are reported to perform poorly on tasks of visuospatial and executive function, compared to patients with AD who perform poorly on memory tasks. Using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, we found that patients with DLB (n = 73) had statistically significant lower performance in clock drawing (visuospatial and executive function) and higher performance in delayed recall (memory) subscores compared to patients with AD (n = 57). This score pattern should raise suspicion for a DLB diagnosis at initial evaluation of patients with dementia.
