37690318|a|A novel series of phthalimide-hydroxypyridinone derivatives were rationally designed and evaluated as potential anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) agents. Bioactivity tests showed that all compounds displayed great iron ions-chelating activity (pFe3+ = 17.07-19.52), in addition to potent inhibition of human monoamine oxidase B (hMAO-B). Compound 11n emerged as the most effective anti-AD lead compound with a pFe3+ value of 18.51, along with selective hMAO-B inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.79 +- 0.05 muM, SI > 25.3). The results of cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that 11n showed extremely weak toxicity in PC12 cell line at 50 muM. Additionally, compound 11n displayed a cytoprotective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage. Moreover, compound 11n exhibited ideal blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in the parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA), and significantly improved scopolamine-induced cognitive and memory impairment in mice behavioral experiments. In conclusion, these favorable experimental results suggested compound 11n deserved further investigation as an anti-AD lead compound.
