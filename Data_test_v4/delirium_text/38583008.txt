38583008|t|The Impact of Delirium after Radical Prostatectomy on Cognitive Function and Health Perception during the Recovery Period.
38583008|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the influence of delirium following radical prostatectomy on cognitive function and health perception during the recovery period. METHODS: Data were collected from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between May 2020 and May 2022. Postoperative delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), categorising patients into delirium and non-delirium groups. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) were employed to evaluate patients' mental health pre-and post-surgery. Comparative analyses were conducted between patients with and without delirium in the critical care unit, and correlation analyses were performed. RESULTS: The study revealed a delirium incidence rate of 19.13%. Patients in the delirium group exhibited significantly higher age and ICU length of stay compared to those without delirium (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in MoCA scores one day before surgery and seven days after surgery, as well as BIPQ scores one day before surgery, five days after surgery and seven days after surgery between the delirium and non-delirium groups (p > 0.05); However, the MoCA scores in the delirium group were significantly lower than those of the non-delirium group on the second and fifth days post-surgery. Additionally, the BIPQ scores in the delirium group were significantly higher than those in the non-delirium group two days after surgery (p < 0.001). A moderate negative correlation was observed between MoCA scores and CAM-ICU scores, and a moderate positive correlation was identified between BIPQ scores and CAM-ICU scores (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients experiencing delirium after radical prostatectomy are at a higher risk of cognitive function impairment and disease threat perception. A significant correlation exists between postoperative delirium and cognitive function as well as health perception.
