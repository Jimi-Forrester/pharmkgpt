3517922|a|Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activities were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of 25 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). Both SLI levels and AchE activities were reduced in the CSF of SDAT patients. The SLI levels and AchE activities were not correlated with the duration and the dementia score. However, in two patients the CSF SLI concentration was in agreement with the SLI levels in the frontal cortex obtained by biopsy. Our findings suggest that CSF SLI may be a good index of cortical SLI activities.
