37298967|t|A Descriptive Review of the Action Mechanisms of Berberine, Quercetin and Silymarin on Insulin Resistance/Hyperinsulinemia and Cardiovascular Prevention.
37298967|a|Insulin resistance (IR) and the associated hyperinsulinemia are early pathophysiological changes which, if not well treated, can lead to type 2 diabetes, endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. While diabetes care is fairly well standardized, the prevention and treatment of IR lacks a single pharmaceutical approach and many lifestyle and dietary interventions have been proposed, including a wide range of food supplements. Among the most interesting and well-known natural remedies, alkaloid berberine and the flavonol quercetin have particular relevance in the literature, while silymarin-the active principle of the Silybum marianum thistle-was traditionally used for lipid metabolism disorders and to sustain liver function. This review describes the major defects of insulin signaling leading to IR and the main properties of the three mentioned natural substances, their molecular targets and synergistic action mechanisms. The actions of berberine, quercetin and silymarin are partially superimposable as remedies against reactive oxygen intermediates generated by a high-lipid diet and by NADPH oxidase, which is triggered by phagocyte activation. Furthermore, these compounds inhibit the secretion of a battery of pro-inflammatory cytokines, modulate intestinal microbiota and are especially able to control the various disorders of the insulin receptor and post-receptor signaling systems. Although most of the evidence on the effects of berberine, quercetin and silymarin in modulating insulin resistance and preventing cardiovascular disease derive from experimental studies on animals, the amount of pre-clinical knowledge strongly suggests the need to investigate the therapeutic potential of these substances in human pathology.
