33175596|a|The disappointing results in bench-to-bedside translation of neuroprotective strategies caused a certain shift in stroke research towards enhancing the endogenous recovery potential of the brain. One reason for this focus on recovery is the much wider time window for therapeutic interventions which is open for at least several months. Since recently two large clinical studies using d-amphetamine or fluoxetine, respectively, to enhance post-stroke neurological outcome failed again it is a good time for a critical reflection on principles and requirements for stroke recovery science. In principal, stroke recovery science deals with all events from the molecular up to the functional and behavioral level occurring after brain ischemia eventually ending up with any measurable improvement of various clinical parameters. A detailed knowledge of the spontaneously occurring post-ischemic regeneration processes is the indispensable prerequisite for any therapeutic approaches aiming to modify these responses to enhance post-stroke recovery. This review will briefly illuminate the molecular mechanisms of post-ischemic regeneration and the principle possibilities to foster post-stroke recovery. In this context, recent translational approaches are analyzed. Finally, the principal and specific requirements and pitfalls in stroke recovery research as well as potential explanations for translational failures will be discussed.
