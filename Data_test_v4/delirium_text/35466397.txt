35466397|t|Biophysical characterization as a tool to predict amyloidogenic and toxic properties of amyloid-beta42 peptides.
35466397|a|Amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) peptides are central to the amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). As biological mimetics, properties of synthetic Abeta peptides usually vary between vendors and batches, thus impacting the reproducibility of experimental studies. Here, we tested recombinantly expressed Abeta42 (Asp1 to Ala42) against synthetic Abeta42 from different suppliers using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thioflavin T aggregation, surface plasmon resonance, and MTT cell viability assays. Overall, our recombinant Abeta42 provided a reproducible mimetic of desired properties. Across experimental approaches, the combined detection of Abeta42 dimers and random coil to beta-sheet transition only correlated with aggregation-prone and cytotoxic peptides. Conclusively, combining MALDI-MS with CD appears to provide a rapid, reliable means to predict the 'bioactivity' of Abeta42.
