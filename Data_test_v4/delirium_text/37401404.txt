37401404|a|The growing usage of aluminum nanoparticles (Al-NP) and their exposure may influence body function. Considering the proposed relationship between Al and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and the concern about the effect of this nanoparticle on brain health and cognitive function, the use of neuroprotective agents might be helpful. According to the reported neuroprotective effects of agmatine, in the present study, the possible protective effect of agmatine was assessed in mice model of Al-NP-induced memory impairment. In addition, due to the roles of hippocampal Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) and ERK signaling in memory and its disorders, these pathways were also investigated. Al-NP (10 mg/kg/p.o.) with/without agmatine (5 or 10 mg/kg/i.p.) was administered to adult male NMRI mice for 5 days. Novel object recognition (NOR) test session was used to assess cognitive function. Following the behavioral assessments, the hippocampi were used to determine the phosphorylated and total levels of GSK-3beta and ERK as well as GAPDH using western blot analysis. The results showed that Al-NP impaired NOR memory in mice while agmatine 10 mg/kg prevented the memory deficit induced by Al-NP. Furthermore, Al-NP activated GSK-3beta as well as ERK signals within the hippocampus while agmatine prevented the effects of Al-NP on GSK-3beta and ERK signals within the hippocampus. Besides supporting the neuroprotective effects of agmatine, these findings suggest the possibility of the connection of hippocampal GSK-3beta and ERK signaling in the neuroprotective effect of this polyamine against Al-NP.
