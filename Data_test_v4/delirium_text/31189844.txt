31189844|a|The purpose of this study is to understand the current situation of skin tears and examine the factors related to such tears in a long term care facility. The study sample consisted of 152 persons who developed skin tears during a 1 year period in a long term care facility. The results show that the incidence of skin tears was 9.7%, and 27.0%of all incidents involved care workers such as during the care of patients with delirium and dementia. The severity of skin tears was associated with patients over 85 years of age(p<0.05)and a BMI of less than 16.8(p<0.05). Nurses and care workers need to cooperate with each other to improve the quality of care by preventing skin tears.
