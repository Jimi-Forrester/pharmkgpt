39075895|t|The complex effects of miR-146a in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
39075895|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities. Neuroinflammatory plaques formed through the extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta proteins, as well as neurofibrillary tangles formed by the intracellular deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, comprise two typical pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Besides symptomatic treatment, there are no effective therapies for delaying Alzheimer's disease progression. MicroRNAs (miR) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels and play important roles in multiple physiological and pathological processes. Indeed, miR-146a, a NF-kappaB-regulated gene, has been extensively implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease through several pathways. Research has demonstrated substantial dysregulation of miR-146a both during the initial phases and throughout the progression of this disorder. MiR-146a is believed to reduce amyloid-beta deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation through the TLR/IRAK1/TRAF6 pathway; however, there is also evidence supporting that it can promote these processes through many other pathways, thus exacerbating the pathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. It has been widely reported that miR-146a mediates synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death by targeting mRNAs encoding synaptic-related proteins, mitochondrial-related proteins, and membrane proteins, as well as other mRNAs. Regarding the impact on glial cells, miR-146a also exhibits differential effects. On one hand, it causes widespread and sustained inflammation through certain pathways, while on the other hand, it can reverse the polarization of astrocytes and microglia, alleviate neuroinflammation, and promote oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation, thus maintaining the normal function of the myelin sheath and exerting a protective effect on neurons. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the involvement of miR-146a in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We aim to elucidate the relationship between miR-146a and the key pathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid-beta deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and glial cell dysfunction, as well as summarize recent relevant studies that have highlighted the potential of miR-146a as a clinical diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.
