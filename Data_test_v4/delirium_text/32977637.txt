32977637|t|Ethionamide Preconditioning Enhances the Proliferation and Migration of Human Wharton's Jelly-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
32977637|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a useful source for cell-based therapy of a variety of immune-mediated diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. However, poor migration ability and survival rate of MSCs after brain transplantation hinder the therapeutic effects in the disease microenvironment. Therefore, we attempted to use a preconditioning strategy with pharmacological agents to improve the cell proliferation and migration of MSCs. In this study, we identified ethionamide via the screening of a drug library, which enhanced the proliferation of MSCs. Preconditioning with ethionamide promoted the proliferation of Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling. Preconditioning with ethionamide also enhanced the migration ability of MSCs by upregulating expression of genes associated with migration, such as C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). Furthermore, preconditioning with ethionamide stimulated the secretion of paracrine factors, including neurotrophic and growth factors in MSCs. Compared to naive MSCs, ethionamide-preconditioned MSCs (ETH-MSCs) were found to survive longer in the brain after transplantation. These results suggested that enhancing the biological process of MSCs induced by ethionamide preconditioning presents itself as a promising strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of MSCs-based therapies.
