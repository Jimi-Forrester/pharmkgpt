39433348|a|Study Design: A retrospective comparative study. Purpose: To compare the characteristics of perioperative complications in patients aged >=85 years with those of younger patients undergoing similar spine surgery and examine factors associated with perioperative complications and clinical outcomes among patients aged >=85 years. Overview of Literature: The risk factors for perioperative complications and their effect on outcomes in patients aged >=85 years remain unclear. Furthermore, no study has compared younger patients with similar surgeries and condition with those aged >=85 years. Methods: The study included patients aged >=65 years who underwent spinal surgeries. The patients aged >=85, 75-84, and 65-74 years were categorized into the super-old, old, and pre-old groups, respectively. The differences in perioperative age-related complications were compared among the three groups while matching for surgical procedures and general conditions (study 1). Furthermore, preoperative and intraoperative factors were examined for perioperative complications in the super-old group (study 2). Complications were categorized into surgical site and systemic complications. Results: The analysis included 44 patients from each group. In study 1, the total complication rates were 40.9%, 25%, and 18.2% of the super-old, old, and pre-old groups, respectively. Differences in complication rates were observed between the super-old and pre-old groups (p=0.011). In study 2, 58 patients from the super-old group were analyzed. Surgical site complications were significantly associated with longer surgical duration (p=0.02) and more estimated blood loss (p=0.003). Systemic complications were significantly associated with previous cerebrovascular disease (p=0.014), preoperative motor deficit (p=0.023), and emergency case (p=0.006) and negatively associated with diabetes mellitus (p=0.048). Conclusions: Perioperative complications increased with advancing age in the super-old, old, and pre-old groups. The complication type is associated with specific background factors; therefore, determining them may help prevent perioperative complications.
