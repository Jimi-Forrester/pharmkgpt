36731803|t|Possibility of averting cytokine storm in SARS-COV 2 patients using specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators.
36731803|a|Fatal "cytokine storms (CS)" observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients are consequences of dysregulated host immune system and over-exuberant inflammatory response. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-system organ failure, and eventual death are distinctive symptoms, attributed to higher morbidity and mortality rates among these patients. Consequent efforts to save critical COVID-19 patients via the usage of several novel therapeutic options are put in force. Strategically, drugs being used in such patients are dexamethasone, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, etc. along with the approved vaccines. Moreover, it is certain that activation of the resolution process is important for the prevention of chronic diseases. Until recently Inflammation resolution was considered a passive process, rather it's an active biochemical process that can be achieved by the use of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). These endogenous mediators are an array of atypical lipid metabolites that include Resolvins, lipoxins, maresins, protectins, considered as immunoresolvents, but their role in COVID-19 is ambiguous. Recent evidence from studies such as the randomized clinical trial, in which omega 3 fatty acid was used as supplement to resolve inflammation in COVID-19, suggests that direct supplementation of SPMs or the use of synthetic SPM mimetics (which are still being explored) could enhance the process of resolution by regulating the aberrant inflammatory process and can be useful in pain relief and tissue remodeling. Here we discussed the biosynthesis of SPMs, & their mechanistic pathways contributing to inflammation resolution along with sequence of events leading to CS in COVID-19, with a focus on therapeutic potential of SPMs.
