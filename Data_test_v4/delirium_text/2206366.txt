2206366|a|Delirium is a syndrome that requires immediate medical and nursing attention. Systematic and regular assessment of specific mental status factors is necessary for early identification of the signs and symptoms of delirium. Nurses are with patients around the clock and thus are in an optimal position to assess the patients' mental status and to provide the physical, psychological, and social support they need. Nurses can have a significant effect on this problem, with early detection and appropriate management helping to ensure safety and minimize the emotional stress this syndrome can cause.
