34245621|a|Innervation sustains cornea integrity. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) regenerated damaged nerves by stimulating the synthesis of a new stereoisomer of Resolvin D6 (RvD6si). Here, we resolved the structure of this lipid isolated from mouse tears after injured corneas were treated with PEDF + DHA. RvD6si synthesis was inhibited by fluvoxamine, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, but not by 15- or 5-LOX inhibitors, suggesting that the 4- and 17-hydroxy of DHA have an RR- or SR-configuration. The two compounds were chemically synthesized. Using chiral phase HPLC, four peaks of RvD6si1-4 from tears were resolved. The RR-RvD6 standard eluted as a single peak with RvD61 while pure SR-RvD6 eluted with RvD63 . The addition of these pure mediators prompted a trigeminal ganglion transcriptome response in injured corneas and showed that RR-RvD6 was the more potent, increasing cornea sensitivity and nerve regeneration. RR-RvD6 stimulates Rictor and hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) genes specifically as upstream regulators and a gene network involved in axon growth and suppression of neuropathic pain, indicating a novel function of this lipid mediator to maintain cornea integrity and homeostasis after injury.
