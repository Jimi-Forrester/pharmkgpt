34368479|t|The phenomenon of clasmatodendrosis.
34368479|a|Clasmatodendrosis derives from the Greek for fragment (klasma), tree (dendron), and condition (- osis). Cajal first used the term in 1913: he observed disintegration of the distal cell processes of astrocytes, along with a fragmentation or beading of proximal processes closer to the astrocyte cell body. In contemporary clinical and experimental reports, clasmatodendrosis has been observed in models of cerebral ischemia and seizures (including status epilepticus), in elderly brains, in white matter disease, in hippocampal models and cell cultures associated with amyloid plaques, in head trauma, toxic exposures, demyelinating diseases, encephalitides and infection-associated encephalopathies, and in the treatment of cancer using immune effector cells. We examine evidence to support a claim that clasmatodendrotic astrocyte cell processes overtly bead (truncate) as a morphological sign of ongoing damage premortem. In grey and white matter and often in relationship to vascular lumina, beading becomes apparent with immunohistochemical staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein when specimens are examined at reasonably high magnification, but demonstration of distal astrocytic loss of processes may require additional marker study and imaging. Proposed mechanisms for clasmatodendrotic change have examined hypoxic-ischemic, osmotic-demyelinating, and autophagic models. In these models as well as in neuropathological reports, parenchymal swelling, vessel-wall leakage, or disturbed clearance of toxins can occur in association with clasmatodendrosis. Clasmatodendrotic features may serve as a marker for gliovascular dysregulation either acutely or chronically. We review correlative evidence for blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction associated with astrocytic structural change, with attention to interactions between endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytic endfeet.
