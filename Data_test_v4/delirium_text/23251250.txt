23251250|t|C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mediates neuronal apoptosis in rats with spinal cord injury.
23251250|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe health problem and the mechanism involved remains elusive. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a prominent protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in SCI. A total of 20 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups at random, ten rats were subjected to a modified Allen's test (using a weight-drop device) to induce a SCI model and the remaining ten rats only had the corresponding vertebral lamina removed with no injury and served as the sham-operated group. Pathological changes in the spinal cord were observed 12 h after injury by hematoxylin and eosin staining and TUNEL staining was performed to visualize apoptotic cells. The expression of CHOP was also detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that a typical apoptotic morphology, namely the increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the injured spinal cord. The expression levels of CHOP in the rats with SCI were increased compared with the sham-operated rats (P<0.05). These results revealed that CHOP-mediated ER stress-induced apoptosis may be involved in SCI.
