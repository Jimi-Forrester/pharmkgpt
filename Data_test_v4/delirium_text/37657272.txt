37657272|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder with a complex aetiology, is the most common memory dysfunction particularly affecting the elderly. Various protein targets have been classified to be involved in the AD treatment, including 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R). So far, the 5-HT6R ligands obtained by our research group have become a good basis for hydrophobicity modulation to give a chance for more effective action toward AD by additional influence on target enzymes, e.g. cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). In the search for 5-HT6R agents with additional inhibitory action on the enzyme, a series of 25 new 1,3,5-triazines (7-31) as modifications of lead, 4-[1-(2,5-dichlorophenoxy)propyl]-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2-amine (6), was rationally designed. Molecular modelling, synthesis, crystallographic studies, in vitro biological assays and behavioral studies in vivo were performed. The new triazines showed high affinity (Ki < 100 nM) and selectivity for 5-HT6R. The most effective one, 4-[1-(2,5-difluorophenoxy)propyl]-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2-amine (8), exhibited the strong antagonistic action towards 5-HT6R (Ki = 5 nM, pKb = 8.16), had an impact on the memory processes in the Novel Object Recognition test and displayed anxiolytic-like activity in the Elevated Plus Maze test in rats. Moreover, it had the antiplatelet effect as well as very good permeability (PAMPA model), high metabolic stability (RLMs) and satisfactory safety in vitro. Although the CDK5 inhibitory effects in vitro for the tested compounds (8, 10, 14, 18, 26-31) missed the potency expected from in silico simulations, the novel antagonist (8) with a very satisfying pharmacological and ADMET profile can serve as a new lead structure in further searches for innovative therapy against AD with accompanying symptoms.
