34738783|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, has limited treatment options. As such, extensive studies have been conducted to identify novel therapeutic approaches. We previously reported that rhynchophylline (Rhy), a small molecule EphA4 inhibitor, rescues impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive dysfunctions in APP/PS1 mice, an AD transgenic mouse model. To assess whether Rhy can be developed as an alternative treatment for AD, it is important to examine its pharmacokinetics and effects on other disease-associated pathologies. Here, we show that Rhy ameliorates amyloid plaque burden and reduces inflammation in APP/PS1 mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Rhy regulates various molecular pathways in APP/PS1 mouse brains associated with amyloid metabolism and inflammation, specifically the ubiquitin proteasome system, angiogenesis, and microglial functional states. These results show that Rhy, which is blood-brain barrier permeable, is beneficial to amyloid pathology and regulates multiple molecular pathways.
