35624290|t|Multi sequence average templates for aging and neurodegenerative disease populations.
35624290|a|Magnetic resonance image (MRI) processing pipelines use average templates to enable standardization of individual MRIs in a common space. MNI-ICBM152 is currently used as the standard template by most MRI processing tools. However, MNI-ICBM152 represents an average of 152 healthy young adult brains and is vastly different from brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In those populations, extensive atrophy might cause inevitable registration errors when using an average template of young healthy individuals for standardization. Disease-specific templates that represent the anatomical characteristics of the populations can reduce such errors and improve downstream driven estimates. We present multi-sequence average templates for Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), Fronto-temporal Dementia (FTD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), cognitively intact and impaired Parkinson's Disease patients (PD-CIE and PD-CI, respectively), individuals with Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), AD with vascular contribution (V-AD), Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment (V-MCI), Cognitively Intact Elderly (CIE) individuals, and a human phantom. We also provide separate templates for males and females to allow better representation of the diseases in each sex group.
