38264389|t|A Palliative Care Approach to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
38264389|a|INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction. Currently, treatment options are limited and management is based mostly on symptom control and quality of life optimization, so palliative care plays a fundamental role. Our objective was to characterize the ALS population in Madeira Island that was referenced and/or followed by a palliative care unit over a five-year period. METHODS: Longitudinal, retrospective, descriptive, and observational study to analyze patients with ALS who were referred and/or followed by a palliative care unit during a five-year period, between 2017 and 2021. Patient's medical electronic and physical records were analyzed to gather data. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 28.0.1). RESULTS: During this five-year period, a total of 38 patients were diagnosed with ALS in Madeira Island and 23 (60.53%) were referred to palliative care. Three patients died before assessment, so 20 (50.63%) were followed by the palliative care team. They had a median life expectancy of 425 days and the median time spent in palliative care was 137 days. Of this population, 56.52% (n=13) was male with an average age of 64 years. The median period from diagnosis to referral was 167 days, with most referrals being made by family medicine (39.13%; n=9) motivated by uncontrolled symptoms (95.65%; n=22). The median period from referral to first assessment by a palliative care physician was 19 days. The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) applied on the first visit had a median score of 40% in the former and was negative in 95.00% (n=19) of patients in the latter. Advanced care directives were present in 55.00% (n=11) of patients and all provided care was in accordance with the patient's wishes. The most common symptoms were dysphagia, dyspnea, pain, anxiety, and sialorrhea. The most used drugs were morphine, riluzole, butylscopolamine, bisacodyl, and midazolam. As for other interventions, 55.00% (n=11) of patients underwent noninvasive ventilation (NIV), 15.00% (n=3) were submitted to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and one patient (5.00%) was nasogastrically intubated. The death rate was 95.00% (n=19) with 73.68% (n=14) of deaths occurring in the palliative care unit. CONCLUSION: Literature has shown that there are many advantages to the early inclusion of palliative care in ALS management, achieving effective symptom control and greater quality of life, but also reducing caregiver burden. However, in this study, we found that referrals to palliative care were late and included mostly cases of advanced disease with uncontrolled symptoms.
