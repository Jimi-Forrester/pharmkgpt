38965103|t|Binding studies of promethazine and its metabolites with human serum albumin by high-performance affinity chromatography and molecular docking in the presence of codeine.
38965103|a|"Purple Drank", a soft drink containing promethazine (PMZ) and codeine (COD), has gained global popularity for its hallucinogenic effects. Consuming large amounts of this combination can lead to potentially fatal events. The binding of these drugs to plasma proteins can exacerbate the issue by increasing the risk of drug interactions, side effects, and/or toxicity. Herein, the binding affinity to human serum albumin (HSA) of PMZ and its primary metabolites [N-desmethyl promethazine (DMPMZ) and promethazine sulphoxide (PMZSO)], along with COD, was investigated by high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) though zonal approach. PMZ and its metabolites exhibited a notable binding affinity for HSA (%b values higher than 80%), while COD exhibited a %b value of 65%. To discern the specific sites of HSA to which these compounds were bound, displacement experiments were performed using warfarin and (S)-ibuprofen as probes for sites I and II, respectively, which revealed that all analytes were bound to both sites. Molecular docking studies corroborated the experimental results, reinforcing the insights gained from the empirical data. The in silico data also suggested that competition between PMZ and its metabolites with COD can occur in both sites of HSA, but mainly in site II. As the target compounds are chiral, the enantioselectivity for HSA binding was also explored, showing that the binding for these compounds was not enantioselective.
