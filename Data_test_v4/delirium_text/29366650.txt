29366650|a|Owning to the promising neuroprotective profile and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, triptolide has attracted extensive attention. Although its limited solubility and toxicity have greatly hindered clinical translation, triptolide has nonetheless emerged as a promising candidate for structure-activity relationship studies for Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, a series of triptolide analogs were designed and synthesized, and their neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects were then tested using a cell culture model. Among the triptolide derivatives tested, a memantine conjugate, compound 8, showed a remarkable neuroprotective effect against Abeta1-42 toxicity in primary cortical neuron cultures as well as an inhibitory effect against LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in BV2 cells at a subnanomolar concentration. Our findings provide insight into the different pharmacophores that are responsible for the multifunctional effects of triptolide in the central nervous system. Our study should help in the development of triptolide-based multifunctional anti-Alzheimer drugs.
