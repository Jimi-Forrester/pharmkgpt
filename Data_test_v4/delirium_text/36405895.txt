36405895|t|Association between the reactivity of local cerebral oxygen saturation after hypo-to-hypercapnic tests and delirium after abdominal surgery in older adults: A prospective study.
36405895|a|Objective: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing major abdominal surgery. Materials and methods: This prospective study enrolled older adults scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from August 2021 to January 2022. The change in rSO2 from baseline was determined using the hypo-to-hypercapnic test. The main study outcome was the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Results: A total of 101 participants were included for analysis, of whom 16 (15.8%) developed postoperative delirium. Compared with non-delirium participants, the mean arterial pressure and heart rate were not significantly different in the postoperative delirium group at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T6 (all Pinteraction > 0.05), but the delirium group had lower pH, lower PaO2, and higher lactate levels at T4, T5, and T6 (all Pinteraction < 0.05). rSO2 at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T6 was 69.0 (63.2-75.2), 70.7 +- 7.3, 68.2 +- 7.5, 72.1 +- 8.0, 69.9 +- 7.8, 67.4 +- 7.2, and 71.7 +- 8.1, respectively. The postoperative change in rSO2 during the hypercapnia test (TDeltarSO2%) was 6.62 (5.31-9.36). Multivariable analysis showed that the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (odd ratio, OR = 1.89, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.10-3.25, P = 0.021), preoperative albumin levels (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94, P = 0.022), rSO2 at T4 (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.89, P = 0.010), and postoperative TDeltarSO2% (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, P = 0.028) were independently associated with postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Conclusion: The rSO2 measured at T4 and postoperative TDeltarSO2% were independently associated with postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing elective abdominal surgery.
