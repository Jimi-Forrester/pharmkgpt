39121445|a|OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal super-refractory status epilepticus associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). METHODS: We describe the history, neuroimaging, EEG, and brain pathology findings of a 75-year-old patient with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease (homozygous epsilon4 apolipoprotein status) and a remote history of 3 asymptomatic ARIA episodes, who developed super-refractory status epilepticus related to severe ARIA. RESULTS: The patient was participating in an extended open-label trial of aducanumab when she was admitted to hospital for focal seizures and ARIA in 2 noncontiguous regions of the left frontal and occipital lobes. Despite aggressive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, sedation, and antiseizure medications, she died from refractory focal status epilepticus. In retrospect, routine surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 11 weeks before hospitalization had signs of ARIA, which had not been identified. DISCUSSION: Clinicians should be aware that anti-amyloid therapies may cause rare serious adverse events. A high degree of vigilance is required in the interpretation of surveillance imaging for ARIA. Longitudinal studies are justified to further characterize the safety profile of anti-amyloid antibody therapies and identify participants at high risk of serious adverse events.
