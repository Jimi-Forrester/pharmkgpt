38007410|a|Mitofusin-2 (MFN2) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein essential for mitochondrial networking in most cells. Autosomal dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A disease (CMT2A), a severe and disabling sensory-motor neuropathy that impacts the entire nervous system. Here, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy tailored to correcting the root genetic defect of CMT2A. Though mutant and wild-type MFN2 mRNA are inhibited by RNA interference (RNAi), the wild-type protein is restored by overexpressing cDNA encoding functional MFN2 modified to be resistant to RNAi. We tested this strategy in CMT2A patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-differentiated motor neurons (MNs), demonstrating the correct silencing of endogenous MFN2 and replacement with an exogenous copy of the functional wild-type gene. This approach significantly rescues the CMT2A MN phenotype in vitro, stabilizing the altered axonal mitochondrial distribution and correcting abnormal mitophagic processes. The MFN2 molecular correction was also properly confirmed in vivo in the MitoCharc1 CMT2A transgenic mouse model after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) delivery of the constructs into newborn mice using adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). Altogether, our data support the feasibility of a combined RNAi and gene therapy strategy for treating the broad spectrum of human diseases associated with MFN2 mutations.
