31356828|a|Neuroinflammation and insulin resistance in the brain are intimately linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Even though traditionally Alzheimer s disease has been associated to Abeta deposits and hyperphosphorylated Tau intracellular tangles, several studies show that neuroinflammation may be the initial cause that triggers degeneration. Accordingly, a number of natural supplements that improves brain insulin sensitivity and reduce neuroinflammation have been proposed as good choices in the therapeutic prevention of cognitive decline. Further supporting this evidence, we show that phytohormone Abscisic Acid, can prevent memory impairment and neuroinflammation markers in a triple transgenic mouse model, where no peripheral inflammatory changes have occurred. Moreover, our data strongly suggests that early intervention is critical for good prognosis, and that cognitive improvement requires longer treatment than recovering neuroinflammation markers.
