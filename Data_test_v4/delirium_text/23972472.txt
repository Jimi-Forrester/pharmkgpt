23972472|a|The mitotic regulator Pin1 plays an important role in protein quality control and age-related medical conditions such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Although its cellular role has been thoroughly investigated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remain elusive. We provide evidence for interactions between the two domains of Pin1. Several residues displayed unequivocal peak splits in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, indicative of two different conformational states in equilibrium. Pareto analysis of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data demonstrates that the two domains approach each other upon addition of a nonpeptidic ligand. Titration experiments with phosphorylated peptides monitored by fluorescence anisotropy and chemical shift perturbation indicate that domain interactions increase Pin1's affinity toward peptide ligands. We propose this interplay of the domains and ligands to be a general mechanism for a large class of two-domain proteins.
