17596899|a|In Alzheimer's disease there is an increased production of the toxic beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), especially the longer forms such as Abeta(1-42). Using the patch-clamp technique we have studied the contribution of early pro-inflammatory processes to the acute effects of 1 microM Abeta(1-42) on the parallel fiber EPSC (PF-EPSC) of Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Abeta(1-42) induces a decrease in the PF-EPSC amplitude. This decrease is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of the miniature EPSCs, suggesting that Abeta acts at both pre- and post-synaptic sites. In the presence of L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, the effects of Abeta were partially blocked. The frequency of mEPSCs was unchanged while Abeta still reduced the mEPSCs amplitude. The anti-inflammatory agent flurbiprofen blocked the depressant action of Abeta on the mEPSCs amplitude but not its effect on mEPSCs frequency. Both a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) reverse the effects of Abeta as an increase in the mEPSCs frequency and amplitude was observed. This study provides evidence that the Abeta-induced depression of the PF-EPSCs was mediated via an activation of JNK and p38 and by the action of NO and raises the possibility of the involvement of an early pro-inflammatory process.
