METHODS: A universalist approach for the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of health measurement instruments was used. A group of pediatric critical care specialists assessed conceptual and item equivalences. Semantic equivalence was evaluated by means of a translation from English to Portuguese by two independent translators; reconciliation into a single version; back-translation by a native English speaker; and consensus among six experts with respect to language and content understanding by means of Likert scale responses and the Content Validity Index. Finally, operational equivalence was assessed by applying a pre-test to 30 patients. RESULTS: The back-translation was approved by the original authors. The medians of the expert consensus responses varied between good and excellent, except for the feature "acute onset" of the instructions. Items with a low Content Validity Index for the features "acute onset" and "disorganized thinking" were adapted. In the pre-test, the expression "signal with your head" was modified into "nod your head" for better understanding. No further adjustments were necessary, resulting in the final version for Brazilian Portuguese. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian version of the Pediatric Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit was generated in agreement with the international recommendations and can be used in Brazil for the diagnosis of delirium in critically ill children 5 years of age or above and with no developmental cognitive disabilities.
