26465894|t|Bacterial Chaperones CsgE and CsgC Differentially Modulate Human alpha-Synuclein Amyloid Formation via Transient Contacts.
26465894|a|Amyloid formation is historically associated with cytotoxicity, but many organisms produce functional amyloid fibers (e.g., curli) as a normal part of cell biology. Two E. coli genes in the curli operon encode the chaperone-like proteins CsgC and CsgE that both can reduce in vitro amyloid formation by CsgA. CsgC was also found to arrest amyloid formation of the human amyloidogenic protein alpha-synuclein, which is involved in Parkinson's disease. Here, we report that the inhibitory effects of CsgC arise due to transient interactions that promote the formation of spherical alpha-synuclein oligomers. We find that CsgE also modulates alpha-synuclein amyloid formation through transient contacts but, in contrast to CsgC, CsgE accelerates alpha-synuclein amyloid formation. Our results demonstrate the significance of transient protein interactions in amyloid regulation and emphasize that the same protein may inhibit one type of amyloid while accelerating another.
