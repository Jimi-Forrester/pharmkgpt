29664486|t|Heparin-induced tau filaments are structurally heterogeneous and differ from Alzheimer's disease filaments.
29664486|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of tau filaments in the brain whose structure was recently solved. The formation of AD filaments is routinely modeled in vitro by mixing tau with heparin. This study shows that heparin-induced tau filaments are markedly different from the AD filaments and are highly heterogeneous.
