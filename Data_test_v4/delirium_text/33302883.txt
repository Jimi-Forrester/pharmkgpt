33302883|a|BACKGROUND: Self-reported life-space assessment methods so far focus on community-dwelling persons, with a lack of validated assessment methods for institutionalized settings. This study evaluated construct validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and feasibility of a new Life-Space Assessment for Institutionalized Settings (LSA-IS) in geriatric patients. METHODS: Psychometric properties of the LSA-IS in 119 hospitalized geriatric patients (83.0 +- 6.2 years) with and without cognitive impairment (CI) [Mini-Mental State Examination: 22.4 +- 4.9 scores] were evaluated within a comprehensive validation design. For the total group and subgroups according to cognitive status, construct validity was assessed by calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rho) with established construct variables, test-retest reliability by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), sensitivity to change by standardized response means (SRMs) calculated for effects of early ward-based rehabilitation during hospital stay. RESULTS: The LSA-IS (total score) demonstrated good test-retest reliability (ICC = .704), and large sensitivity to change (SRM = .806), while construct validity was small to high indicated by significant correlations of the LSA-IS to construct variables (rho = .208-716), depending on relative construct association. On average results of LSA-IS sub-scores confirmed results of the total score. Subgroups according to cognitive status did not differ for most analyzed variables. A completion rate of 100% and a completion time of 3.2 +- 1.2 min documented excellent feasibility. CONCLUSIONS: The interview-based LSA-IS has proven to be valid, reliable, sensitive, and feasible in hospitalized, multi-morbid, geriatric patients with and without CI documenting good psychometric properties for institutionalized settings.
