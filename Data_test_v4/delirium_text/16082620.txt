16082620|t|A comparison of the behavioural and emotional characteristics of Alzheimer's dementia in individuals with and without Down syndrome.
16082620|a|The behavioural and emotional changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are compared for individuals with Down syndrome and AD and individuals with AD from the general population (AD-only). The primary caregivers of 30 people with Down syndrome and AD and 30 people with AD-only completed the BEHAVE-AD and the Apathy subscale of the CERAD. As well, behavioural observations at adult day programs were undertaken with selected participants (n = 26). The Down syndrome group experienced fewer delusions and had lower total scores on the BEHAVE-AD, indicating fewer problem behaviours overall. Day program observations suggested that the AD-only group were more likely to be sedentary and observe the activities of others, while the Down syndrome group were more physically active. Improving our understanding of the similarities and differences between these two groups may help facilitate the integration of individuals with Down syndrome into adult day programs for the general population.
