35962927|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Integrative medicine is the practice of combining conventional medical treatments with "alternative" or "complementary" therapies. Integrative psychiatry is a holistic, person-centered approach to neuropsychiatric disorders that emphasizes a person's physical, emotional, interpersonal, behavioral, nutritional, environmental, and spiritual dimensions to achieve well-being. Older adults are more prone to physical injury, interpersonal loss, chronic illnesses, and physical and cognitive decline that can manifest as anxiety, depression, with functional decline and inability to care for self. Additionally, stress of caring for older adults with dementia can adversely affect caregivers' health. Although integrative approaches are perceived as safer and less stigmatizing, it is important to understand the risks and benefits of such therapies for older adults with neurocognitive disorders and their caregivers. RECENT FINDINGS: Here, we summarize the results of the recent clinical trials and meta-analyses that provide evidence for integrative approaches to treating older adults with cognitive disorders and their caregivers which include the use of diet and supplements, and mind-body therapies. Dietary and mind-body therapies have become increasingly popular and show the strongest evidence of effectiveness for cognitive disorders and caregiver stress. Vitamins and supplements are the most popular integrative intervention, but there is mixed evidence supporting their use and the concern for herb (supplement)-drug interactions. While there is increasing popularity of integrative treatments, information to guide clinicians providing care for older adults remains limited, with variable scientific rigor of the available RCTs for a large number of commonly used integrative interventions particularly for cognitive disorders and caregiver stress and well-being.
