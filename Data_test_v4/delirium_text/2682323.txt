2682323|a|Recently, protease inhibitors have been recognized as potential contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this role, they could mediate an exaggerated regenerative response in the brain, participate as acute phase reactants, or be involved in the aberrant proteolytic processing of the amyloid proteins. Protease inhibitors are, therefore, attractive targets for drug intervention in Alzheimer's disease.
