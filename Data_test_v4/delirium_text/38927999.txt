38927999|t|Platelets and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.
38927999|a|Platelets have a fundamental role in mediating hemostasis and thrombosis. However, more recently, a new idea is making headway, highlighting the importance of platelets as significant actors in modulating immune and inflammatory responses. In particular, platelets have an important role in the development of vascular amyloid-b-peptide(ab) deposits, known to play a relevant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through accumulation and deposition within the frontal cortex and hippocampus in the brain. The involvement of platelets in the pathogenesis of AD opens up the highly attractive possibility of applying antiplatelet therapy for the treatment and/or prevention of AD, but conclusive results are scarce. Even less is known about the potential role of platelets in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim to this brief review is to summarize current knowledge on this topic and to introduce the new perspectives on the possible role of platelet activation as therapeutic target both in AD and MCI.
