39117996|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of femoral neck fractures in older adults is increasing each year. Active and reasonable postoperative rehabilitation exercises can restore the activity of geriatric patients with femoral neck fractures to a great extent, while also avoiding bedridden complications and re-fractures. This study explores the perspectives, experiences, and recommendations of medical staff regarding the implementation status, existing problems, promoting factors, and hindering factors of post-surgical rehabilitation exercises for geriatric patients with femoral neck fractures. The ultimate goal is to further optimize rehabilitation exercise programs and to expedite this process for patients. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive phenomenological study was conducted. A total of 21 clinical medical staff were selected using the purposive sampling method for semi-structured interviews. A content analysis method was used to collate and analyze the collected interview data. RESULTS: A total of 2 themes and 6 sub-themes were defined. The themes consisted of multiple obstacles occurring during the implementation of rehabilitation exercises and the scientific cognition of medical staff on these exercises. Respondents found that patient initiative during rehabilitation exercises was insufficient, that the comprehensiveness and continuity of exercises could not be guaranteed, and that unification between textbook theory and clinical practice was incomplete. Moreover, respondents believed that their professional quality should be excellent, but that staffing and organizational management required optimization, and that support was required for the implementation of rehabilitation exercises. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the opinions and experiences of medical staff during postoperative rehabilitation exercises in geriatric patients with femoral neck fractures. Collaborative efforts should fully engage hospitals, communities, and families, enhance the alignment of health education with patient needs, advance the scientific development of an integrated medical model by refining the curriculum and teaching system, and significantly elevate the level of medical science and technology. This study will serve as a valuable reference for the establishment of future professional, and personalized rehabilitation programs tailored for geriatric patients with femoral neck fractures.
