31344820|t|Comparative Examination of Antioxidant Capacity and Fingerprinting of Unfractionated Extracts from Different Plant Parts of Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) Grown under Greenhouse Conditions.
31344820|a|Integrated surveys of metabolic profiles and antioxidant capacity from Chenopodium quinoa have been limited and have particularly focused on an examination of seeds and leaves. According to this, the main aim of the present study was to address an evaluation of the antioxidant activity of crude ethanolic extracts from different plant parts (leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and seeds) harvested at different times during growth and processed by two distinct drying methods: Air-drying and freeze-drying. In order to characterize the resulting extracts, the total content of phenolics (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) was then measured through the Folin-Ciocalteu method, while antioxidant capacity was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH ) free radical scavenging and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. Parallel to this evaluation, extracts were profiled by LC-DAD-ESI-MS. Data analysis was supported by statistics. Most of the extracts obtained from freeze-dried samples showed higher TPC values ranging from 6.02 to 43.47 milligram of gallic acid equivalents per gram of plant material and a TFC between 1.30 and 12.26 milligram of quercetin equivalents per gram of plant material. After statistical analysis, a low correlation between TPC and TFC values was observed regarding antioxidant capacity from DPPH and FRAP measurements of both drying methods. A multivariate analysis showed that antioxidant components and antioxidant capacity in C. quinoa changed during growth and between plant parts and drying methods. These changes need to be taken into consideration when comparing the production/accumulation of beneficial bioactive compounds in this pseudocereal.
