33714109|a|Phenolic compounds from plant sources have significant health-promoting properties and are known to be an integral part of folk and herbal medicines. Consumption of phenolics is known to alleviate the risk of various lifestyle diseases including cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. In this context, numerous plant crops have been explored and characterized based on phenolic compounds for their use as supplements, nutraceutical, and pharmaceuticals. The present review highlights some important source of bioactive phenolic compounds and novel technologies for their efficient extraction. These techniques include the use of microwave, ultrasound, and supercritical methods. Besides, the review will also highlight the use of response surface methodology (RSM) as a statistical tool for optimizing the recoveries of the phenolic bioactives from plant-based matrices.
