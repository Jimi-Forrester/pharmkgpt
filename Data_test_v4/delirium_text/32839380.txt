32839380|a|In the middle of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak, the main efforts of the scientific community are rightly all focused on identifying efficient pharmacological treatments to cure the acute severe symptoms and developing a reliable vaccine. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that, in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive subjects, the virus infection could have long-term consequences, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease. Considering the age of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, the neuroinvasive potential might lead/contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we analyzed a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Alzheimer's disease risk, hypothesizing possible mechanisms at the base of disease development. This reflection raises the need to start to experimentally investigating today the mechanistic link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and COVID-19 to be ready tomorrow.
