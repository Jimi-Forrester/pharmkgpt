32560205|t|The Clinical Application of EEG-Signals Recurrence Analysis as a Measure of Functional Connectivity: Comparative Case Study of Patients with Various Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
32560205|a|BACKGROUND: An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a simple and widely used assessment tool that allows one to analyze the bioelectric activity of the brain. As a result, one can observe brain waves with different frequencies and amplitudes that correspond to the temporary synchronization of different parts of the brain. Synchronization patterns may be changed by almost any type of pathological conditions, such as psychiatric diseases and structural abnormalities of the brain tissue. In various neuropsychiatric disorders, the coordination of cortical activity may be decreased or enhanced as a result of neurobiological compensatory mechanisms. METHODS: In this paper, we analyzed the EEG signals in resting-state condition, with reference to three patients with a similar set of psychopathological symptoms typical for the first psychotic episode, but with different functional and structural neural basis of the disease. Additionally, those patients were compared with a demographically matched healthy individual. We used the non-linear method of time series analysis based on the recurrences of states, to verify whether functional connectivity configurations assessed with recurrence method will qualitatively distinguish patients from a healthy subject, but also differentiate patients from each other. RESULTS: Obtained results confirmed that the connectivity architecture mapped with the recurrence analysis substantially differentiated all participants from each other. An applied analysis additionally showed the specificity of cortical desynchronization and over-synchronization matched to the psychiatric or neurological basis of the disease. Despite this encouraging finding, group-oriented studies are needed to corroborate our qualitative results, based only on a series of clinical case studies.
