30883423|t|Neuroinflammation and Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
30883423|a|Neuroinflammation has become a key hallmark of neurological complications including perioperative pathologies such as postoperative delirium and longer-lasting postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Dysregulated inflammation and neuronal injury are emerging from clinical studies as key features of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. These findings are paralleled by a growing body of preclinical investigations aimed at better understanding how surgery and anesthesia affect the central nervous system and possibly contribute to cognitive decline. Herein, we review the role of postoperative neuroinflammation and underlying mechanisms in immune-to-brain signaling after peripheral surgery.
