37773821|t|Role of hypoxia-inducible factor in postoperative delirium of aged patients: A review.
37773821|a|Postoperative delirium is common, especially in older patients. Delirium is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased risk of postoperative complications, and significant mortality. The mechanism of postoperative delirium is not yet clear. Cerebral desaturation occurred during the maintenance period of general anesthesia and was one of the independent risk factors for postoperative delirium, especially in the elderly. Hypoxia stimulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which controls the hypoxic response. HIF-1 may have a protective role in regulating neuron apoptosis in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia brain damage and may promote the repair and rebuilding process in the brain that was damaged by hypoxia and ischemia. HIF-1 has a neuroprotective effect during cerebral hypoxia and controls the hypoxic response by regulating multiple pathways, such as glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and cell survival. On the other hand, anesthetics have been reported to inhibit HIF activity in older patients. So, we speculate that HIF plays an important role in the pathophysiology of postoperative delirium in the elderly. The activity of HIF is reduced by anesthetics, leading to the inhibition of brain protection in a hypoxic state. This review summarizes the possible mechanism of HIF participating in postoperative delirium in elderly patients and provides ideas for finding targets to prevent or treat postoperative delirium in elderly patients.
