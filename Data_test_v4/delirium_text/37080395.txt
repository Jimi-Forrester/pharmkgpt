37080395|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable, age-related and progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairments. Deficits in synaptic plasticity were reported in various models of AD-like pathology and are considered as an early contributing factor of cognitive impairment. However, the majority of previous studies were focused on overt, symptomatic stages of pathology and assessed long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas long-term depression (LTD) was much less investigated and the precise nature of its involvement remains poorly defined. To better understand the earliest synaptic dysfunctions along the pre-symptomatic stage of AD-like pathology, we performed a detailed analysis of underlying mechanisms and quantified basal synaptic activity, presynaptic release probability, and synaptic plasticity such as post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), as well as LTP and LTD. These parameters were studied in APPPS1 mouse model at two time points (early- and mid-) along the pre-symptomatic stage, which were compared with alterations monitored at two later time-points, i.e. the onset of cognitive deficits and the overt stage of full-blown pathology. Because sex is known to be an instrumental biological parameter in AD pathophysiology, all alterations were assessed in both males and females. Our data show that, as compared to wild-type (WT) littermates, initial neuronal hyperexcitability, seen at early pre-symptomatic stage shifts subsequently towards hypoexcitability at mid-pre-symptomatic stage and remains impaired at advanced stages. The pre-symptomatic changes also involve increased synaptic plasticity as assessed by paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), which returns to basal level at the onset of pathology and remains stable afterwards. Synaptic plasticity is impaired by mid-pre-symptomatic stage and manifests as lowered LTP and absence of LTD induction, the latter being reported here for the first time. Observed LTP and LTD impairments both persist in older APPPS1 mice. Remarkably, none of the observed differences was gender-dependent. Altogether, our data evidence that major impairments in basal synaptic efficacy and plasticity are detectable already during mid-pre-symptomatic stage of AD-like pathogenesis and likely involve hyperexcitability as the underlying mechanism. Our study also uncovers synaptic alterations that may become critical read-outs for testing the efficiency of novel, pre-symptomatic stage-targeted therapies for AD.
