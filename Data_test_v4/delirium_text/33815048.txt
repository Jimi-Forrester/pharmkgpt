33815048|t|Clinical Implications of Psychophysical Olfactory Testing: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment Outcome.
33815048|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Olfactory dysfunction dramatically impairs quality of life with a prevalence of 20% in the general adult population. Psychophysical olfactory testing has been widely used to evaluate the ability to smell due to its validated utility and feasibility in clinic. This review summarizes the current literature regarding psychophysical olfactory testing and the clinical relevance of the olfactory testing with different components. Furthermore, the review highlights the diagnosis and treatment value of olfactory subtests in patients with olfactory dysfunction. RECENT FINDINGS: With the accumulation of studies of psychophysical olfactory testing in olfactory disorders, the clinical relevance of olfactory testing with different components is expanding. Different olfactory domains present with distinct olfactory processing and cortical activity. Psychophysical assessment of olfaction with three domains reveals different levels of olfactory processing and might assist with analyzing the pathophysiologic mechanism of the various olfactory disorders. Furthermore, olfactory thresholds provided the largest amount of non-redundant information to the olfactory diagnosis. Sinonasal olfactory dysfunction and non-sinonasal-related olfactory dysfunction are emerging classifications of smell disorders with certain characteristics of olfactory impairment and different responses to the therapy including steroids, sinus surgery, and olfactory training. SUMMARY: These recent advancements should promote the understanding of psychophysical olfactory testing, the association between individual subcomponents and neurophysiological processes, and pave the way for precision assessment and treatment of the olfactory dysfunction.
