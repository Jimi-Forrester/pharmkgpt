39006534|a|Background: Although anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures for cervical spine disease have been increasing amid a growing population of patients with kidney dysfunction, there is a scarcity of literature focusing on kidney dysfunction as a risk-factor for post-operative ACDF complications. The purpose is to evaluate the differential impact of kidney dysfunction on perioperative outcomes including surgical and medical complications, extended length of hospital stay (LOS), and death within 30 days following ACDF. Patient Sample: This was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify patients who had undergone an elective ACDF procedure between 2011-2021 using Current Procedural Terminology code 22551. Patients were categorized into five cohorts based on eGFR according to the "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes" Classification: values of: >= 90(reference cohort), 60-89 (G2), 30-59 (G3), 15-29 (G4), and <15 (G5). One-way ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables were used to identify differences in perioperative variables between the five groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis assessed the effect of kidney dysfunction on post-operative surgical outcomes. Significance was defined as p<.05. Results: About 75,508 ACDF patients were included, of who 57,480 were G1, 15,186 were G2, 2,192 were G3, 312 were G4, and 338 were G5. G4 and G5 independently increased the risk of medical complications (OR: 1.893, 95% CI [1.296-2.705]; OR: 2.241, 95% CI [1.222-3.964]) and blood transfusion. Only G5 independently increased the risk for extended LOS (OR: 2.410, 95% CI [1.281-4.371], p=.005). Conclusion: High grade CKD is an independent risk factor for medical complications, extended hospital LOS, and blood transfusions following ACDF, underscoring the importance of risk stratification to optimize perioperative management and reduce the burden of complications and healthcare costs. Conversely, low grade CKD does not increase the risk of complications in ACDF.
