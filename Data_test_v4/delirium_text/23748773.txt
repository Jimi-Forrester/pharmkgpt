23748773|a|We examined the effects of acteoside (1a), which was isolated from Orobanche minor, and its derivatives on the aggregation of a 42-mer amyloid beta protein (Abeta42) in our search for anti-amyloidogenic compounds for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. Acteoside (1a) strongly inhibited the aggregation of Abeta42 in a dose-dependent manner. The structure-activity relationship for acteoside (1a) and related compounds suggests the catechol moiety of phenylethanoid glycosides to be essential for this inhibitory activity.
