35685057|a|Introduction: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and Alzheimer's disease are the most common cognitive impairment diseases in the elderly. This study aimed to apply the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scale to evaluate VCI in elderly patients and analyze its reliability and validity. Methods: We enrolled 278 VCI patients admitted to our hospital, from June 2017 to June 2018. The basic clinical information of each patient was documented, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the RBANS scales were suggested to complete. Results: We found significant correlations between the RBANS total score and age, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and years of education. The internal consistency of the RBANS scale Cronbach alphasuggested a good agreement with the total score and the single score at two time points. Moreover, the RBANS total score and the score of each dimension in the RBANS scale were positively correlated with the MMSE immediate memory, calculation ability, delayed memory, commanding ability, reading comprehension ability, command execution, sentence making, and pattern duplicating ability. Conclusion: In conclusion, the RBANS has good reliability and validity for the assessment of cognitive dysfunction in elderly VCI patients. It can be used as a routine clinical and research tool, for the simplicity in operation and superior acceptance.
