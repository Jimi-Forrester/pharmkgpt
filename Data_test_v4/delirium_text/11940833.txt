11940833|a|Clinical studies of the efficacy of ECT in mania are reviewed. ECT is effective in the short-term treatment of mania, but its use may require concurrent neuroleptic drugs early in treatment as the effects of both ECT and lithium are delayed. Indications for ECT in delirium, post-partum illnesses, psychoneuroses, and other conditions are also reviewed.
