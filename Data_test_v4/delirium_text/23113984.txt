23113984|t|The birth of the Epitranscriptome: deciphering the function of RNA modifications.
23113984|a|Recent studies have found methyl-6-adenosine in thousands of mammalian genes, and this modification is most pronounced near the beginning of the 3' UTR. We present a perspective on current work and new single-molecule sequencing methods for detecting RNA base modifications.
