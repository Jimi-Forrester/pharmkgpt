37056120|a|The scientists are dedicated to studying the detection of Alzheimer's disease onset to find a cure, or at the very least, medication that can slow the progression of the disease. This article explores the effectiveness of longitudinal data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning approaches based on magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography neuroimaging modalities for progression estimation and the detection of Alzheimer's disease onset. The significance of feature extraction in highly complex neuroimaging data, identification of vulnerable brain regions, and the determination of the threshold values for plaques, tangles, and neurodegeneration of these regions will extensively be evaluated. Developing automated methods to improve the aforementioned research areas would enable specialists to determine the progression of the disease and find the link between the biomarkers and more accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease onset.
