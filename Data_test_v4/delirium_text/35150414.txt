35150414|t|1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments of stress granule key component G3BP1 RRM domain.
35150414|a|G3BP1 exists as a helicase and one of the core components in stress granules, which are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain performs the paramount function of binding mRNA. Here we report the resonance assignment of human G3BP1 RRM domain to understand its structure-function relationship.
