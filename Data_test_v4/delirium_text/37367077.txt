37367077|a|This study analyzed the chemical composition of Cymbopogon citratus essential oil from Puebla, Mexico, assessed its antioxidant activity, and evaluated in silico protein-compound interactions related to central nervous system (CNS) physiology. GC-MS analysis identified myrcene (8.76%), Z-geranial (27.58%), and E-geranial (38.62%) as the main components, with 45 other compounds present, which depends on the region and growing conditions. DPPH and Folin-Ciocalteu assays using the leaves extract show a promising antioxidant effect (EC50 = 48.5 microL EO/mL), reducing reactive oxygen species. The bioinformatic tool SwissTargetPrediction (STP) shows 10 proteins as potential targets associated with CNS physiology. Moreover, protein-protein interaction diagrams suggest that muscarinic and dopamine receptors are related to each other through a third party. Molecular docking reveals that Z-geranial has higher binding energy than M1 commercial blocker and blocks M2, but not M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas beta-pinene and myrcene block M1, M2, and M4 receptors. These actions may positively affect cardiovascular activity, memory, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. This study highlights the significance of understanding natural product interactions with physiological systems to uncover potential therapeutic agents and advanced knowledge on their benefits for human health.
