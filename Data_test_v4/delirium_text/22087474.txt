22087474|t|C-terminal tetrapeptides inhibit Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity primarily through specific interaction at the N-terminus of Abeta42.
22087474|a|Inhibition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced toxicity is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we reported that the C-terminal tetrapeptide Abeta(39-42) is a potent inhibitor of neurotoxicity caused by Abeta42, the form of Abeta most closely associated with AD. Here, initial structure-activity relationship studies identified key structural requirements, including chirality, side-chain structure, and a free N-terminus, which control Abeta(39-42) inhibitory activity. To elucidate the binding site(s) of Abeta(39-42) on Abeta42, we used intrinsic tyrosine (Y) fluorescence and solution-state NMR. The data suggest that Abeta(39-42) binds at several sites, of which the predominant one is located in the N-terminus of Abeta42, in agreement with recent modeling predictions. Thus, despite the small size of Abeta(39-42) and the hydrophobic, aliphatic nature of all four side-chains, the interaction of Abeta(39-42) with Abeta42 is controlled by specific intermolecular contacts requiring a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and a particular stereochemistry.
