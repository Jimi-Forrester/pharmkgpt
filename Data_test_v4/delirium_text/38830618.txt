38830618|t|Integrative Single-Plaque Analysis Reveals Signature Abeta and Lipid Profiles in the Alzheimer's Brain.
38830618|a|Cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) initiates molecular and cellular cascades that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, amyloid deposition does not invariably lead to dementia. Amyloid-positive but cognitively unaffected (AP-CU) individuals present widespread amyloid pathology, suggesting that molecular signatures more complex than the total amyloid burden are required to better differentiate AD from AP-CU cases. Motivated by the essential role of Abeta and the key lipid involvement in AD pathogenesis, we applied multimodal mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and machine learning (ML) to investigate amyloid plaque heterogeneity, regarding Abeta and lipid composition, in AP-CU versus AD brain samples at the single-plaque level. Instead of focusing on a population mean, our analytical approach allowed the investigation of large populations of plaques at the single-plaque level. We found that different (sub)populations of amyloid plaques, differing in Abeta and lipid composition, coexist in the brain samples studied. The integration of MSI data with ML-based feature extraction further revealed that plaque-associated gangliosides GM2 and GM1, as well as Abeta1-38, but not Abeta1-42, are relevant differentiators between the investigated pathologies. The pinpointed differences may guide further fundamental research investigating the role of amyloid plaque heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis/progression and may provide molecular clues for further development of emerging immunotherapies to effectively target toxic amyloid assemblies in AD therapy. Our study exemplifies how an integrative analytical strategy facilitates the unraveling of complex biochemical phenomena, advancing our understanding of AD from an analytical perspective and offering potential avenues for the refinement of diagnostic tools.
