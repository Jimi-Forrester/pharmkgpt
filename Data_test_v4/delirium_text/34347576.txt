34347576|a|Neurological infections are often devastating in their clinical presentation. Although significant advances have made in neuroimaging techniques and molecular tools for diagnosis, as well as in anti-infective therapy, these diseases always difficult to diagnose and treat. Neuroparasitic infections and virus infections lead to neurological infections. In the nervous system, various cytokines and chemokines act as neuroinflammatory agents, neuromodulators, regulate neurodevelopment, and synaptic transmission. Among the most important cytokines, interleukins (ILs) are a large group of immunomodulatory proteins that elicit a wide variety of responses in cells and tissues. These ILs are involved in pro and anti-inflammatory effects, systemic inflammation, immune system modulation and play crucial roles in fighting cancer, infectious disease, and neurological disorders. Interleukin-34 (IL-34) identified by screening a comprehensive human protein library containing ~3400 secreted and extracellular domain proteins in a human monocyte viability assay. Recent evidence has disclosed the crucial roles of IL-34 in the proliferation and differentiation of mononuclear phagocyte lineage cells, osteoclastogenesis, and inflammation. Additionally, IL-34 plays an important role in development, homeostasis, and disease. Dysregulation in IL-34 function can lead to various inflammatory and infectious diseases (e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease, liver fibrosis, Systemic Lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer disease) and neurological infectious disease (e.g. West Nile virus disease). In this review, we explore the biological role of IL-34 in addition to various impairments caused by dysregulation in IL-34 and discuss their potential links that may lead to important therapeutic and/or preventive strategies for these disorders.
