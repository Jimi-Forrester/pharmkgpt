38398528|t|An Update of Kaempferol Protection against Brain Damage Induced by Ischemia-Reperfusion and by 3-Nitropropionic Acid.
38398528|a|Kaempferol, a flavonoid present in many food products, has chemical and cellular antioxidant properties that are beneficial for protection against the oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Kaempferol administration to model experimental animals can provide extensive protection against brain damage of the striatum and proximal cortical areas induced by transient brain cerebral ischemic stroke and by 3-nitropropionic acid. This article is an updated review of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of protection by kaempferol administration against brain damage induced by these insults, integrated with an overview of the contributions of the work performed in our laboratories during the past years. Kaempferol administration at doses that prevent neurological dysfunctions inhibit the critical molecular events that underlie the initial and delayed brain damage induced by ischemic stroke and by 3-nitropropionic acid. It is highlighted that the protection afforded by kaempferol against the initial mitochondrial dysfunction can largely account for its protection against the reported delayed spreading of brain damage, which can develop from many hours to several days. This allows us to conclude that kaempferol administration can be beneficial not only in preventive treatments, but also in post-insult therapeutic treatments.
