38352553|a|Due to the assumed plasticity of immature brain, early in life brain alterations are thought to lead to better recoveries in comparison to the mature brain. Despite clinical needs, how neuronal networks and associated behaviors are affected by early in life brain stresses, such as pediatric concussions, have been overlooked. Here we provide first evidence in mice that a single early in life concussion durably increases neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex into adulthood, disrupting neuronal integration while the animal is performing sensory-related tasks. This represents a previously unappreciated clinically relevant mechanism for the impairment of sensory-related behavior performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pharmacological modulation of the endocannabinoid system a year post-concussion is well-suited to rescue neuronal activity and plasticity, and to normalize sensory-related behavioral performance, addressing the fundamental question of whether a treatment is still possible once post-concussive symptoms have developed, a time-window compatible with clinical treatment.
