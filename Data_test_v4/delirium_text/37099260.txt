37099260|t|Resonance assignments of the microtubule-binding domain of the microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7).
37099260|a|The microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) is a protein involved in cargo transport along microtubules (MTs) by interacting with kinesin-1 through the C-terminal kinesin-binding domain. Moreover, the protein is reported to stabilize MT, thereby playing a key role in axonal branch development. An important element for this latter function is the 112 amino-acid long N-terminal microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of MAP7. Here we report NMR backbone and side-chain assignments that suggest a primarily alpha-helical secondary fold of this MTBD in solution. The MTBD contains a central long alpha-helical segment that includes a short four-residue 'hinge' sequence with decreased helicity and increased flexibility. Our data represent a first step towards analysing the complex interaction of MAP7 with MTs at an atomic level via NMR spectroscopy.
