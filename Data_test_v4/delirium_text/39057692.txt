39057692|t|Impaired Mitochondrial Energy Metabolism Regulated by p70S6K: A Putative Pathological Feature in Alzheimer's Disease.
39057692|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Mitochondrial energy metabolism and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) play significant roles in AD pathology. However, the potential relationship between them is unclear. In this study, bioinformatics methods were initially applied to analyze the transcriptomic data in the CA1 and the primary visual cortex of patients with AD and Abeta42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. By applying secreted Abeta42 and p70S6K gene silencing in cells, we explored disorders in mitochondrial function and the regulatory roles of p70S6K by flow cytometry, laser scanning confocal microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The study reveals that impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism is a potential pathological feature of AD and that p70S6K gene silencing reversed most of the changes induced by Abeta42, such as the activities of the electron transport chain complexes I and III, as well as ATP synthase, ATP production, generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and phosphorylation of AMPK, PINK1, and Parkin, all of which are required for mitochondria to function properly in the cell.
