14963730|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive cognitive and functional decline. There is evidence that AD is more prevalent in women. This study aims at identifying the clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with the cognitive functions and the pattern of decline in women with moderate to moderately severe AD. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 165 women with dementia of the AD type according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The cognitive functions were assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). The sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly (CAMDEX) interview, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was administrated to the caregiver. RESULTS: The number of years of schooling and the score on the CAMDEX depression scale were the variables associated with the CAMCOG score. The effect of these variables was not homogenous for all the CAMCOG subtests. CONCLUSIONS: The number of years of schooling and the presence of depressive symptomatology influence the results of the neuropsychological exploration, but the effect is moderate and not homogenous for all the CAMCOG subtests. The differences in cognitive profile between moderate and moderately severe are characterised by a greater effect on temporal orientation, calculation and perception.
