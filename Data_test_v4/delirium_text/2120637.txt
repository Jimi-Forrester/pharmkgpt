2120637|t|Intraventricular infusions of antibodies to amyloid-beta-protein precursor impair the acquisition of a passive avoidance response in the rat.
2120637|a|Intraventricular infusions of an antiserum raised against a 14 amino acid residue in the extracellular domain of amyloid-beta-protein precursor significantly decreased stepdown latency, at both 24 h and 48 h recall times, in rats trained to avoid an electroshock by remaining on a platform. The antiserum was effective when infused up to 2.5 h following training and no retention deficit was noted when it was administered at 4h or 6h after training. An antiserum generated against a 17 amino acid residue of the A4 amyloid peptide had no effect on learning. Thus the amyloid precursor protein, which is aberrantly processed in Alzheimer's disease, appears to be directly involved in memory formation.
