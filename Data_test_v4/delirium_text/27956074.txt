27956074|a|BACKGROUND: Comorbid depression is highly prevalent in geriatric patients and associated with functional loss, frequent hospital re-admissions, and a higher mortality rate. Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) has shown to be effective in older depressive patients living in the community. To date, CBT has not been applied to older patients with acute physical illness and comorbid depression. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in depressed geriatric patients, hospitalized for acute somatic illness. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with waiting list control group. SETTING: Postdischarge intervention in a geriatric day clinic; follow-up evaluations at the patients' homes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 155 randomized patients, hospitalized for acute somatic illness, aged 82 +- 6 years and suffering from depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores >7]. Exclusion criteria were dementia, delirium, and terminal state of medical illness. INTERVENTION: Fifteen, weekly group sessions based on a CBT manual. Commencement of psychotherapy immediately after discharge in the intervention group and a 4-month waiting list interval with usual care in the control group. MEASUREMENTS: HADS depression total score after 4 months. Secondary endpoints were functional, cognitive, psychosocial and physical status, resource utilization, caregiver burden, and amount of contact with physician. RESULTS: The intervention group improved significantly in depression scores (HADS baseline 18.8; after 4 months 11.4), whereas the control group deteriorated (HADS baseline 18.1; after 4 months 21.6). Significant improvement in the intervention group, but not in the control group, was observed for most secondary outcome parameters such as the Barthel and Karnofsky indexes. Intervention effects were less pronounced in patients with cognitive impairment or acute fractures. CONCLUSIONS: CBT is feasible and highly effective in geriatric patients. The benefits extend beyond effective recovery and include improvement in physical and functional parameters. Early diagnosis, good access to psychotherapy, and early intervention could improve care for depressive older patients.
