38156880|a|BACKGROUND: Care home residents live with frailty and multiple long-term conditions. Their medical management is complex and specialised. We set out to develop a list of core competencies for doctors providing medical care in long-term care homes. METHODS: A scoping review searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CAB Abstracts, supplemented by grey literature from the Portal of Online Geriatrics Education and the International Association of Geriatrics and Gerontology, looking for core competencies for doctors working in care homes. These were mapped to the UK nationally mandated Generic Professional Competencies Framework. A Delphi exercise was conducted over three rounds using a panel of experts in care homes and medicine of older people. Competencies achieving 80% agreement for inclusion/exclusion were rejected/accepted, respectively. RESULTS: The scoping review identified 22 articles for inclusion, yielding 124 competencies over 21 domains. The Delphi panel comprised 23 experts, including 6 geriatricians, 4 nurses, 3 general practitioners, 2 advanced clinical practitioners, 2 care home managers, and one each of a patient and public representative, palliative care specialist, psychiatrist, academic, physiotherapist and care home audit lead. At the end of three rounds, 109 competencies over 19 domains were agreed. Agreement was strongest for generic competencies around frailty and weaker for sub-specialist knowledge about specific conditions and competencies related to care home medical leadership and management. CONCLUSION: The resulting competencies provide the basis of a curriculum for doctors working in long-term care homes for older people. They are specialty agnostic and could be used to train general practitioners or medical specialty doctors.
