31766571|a|Necroptosis, or regulated necrosis, is an important type of programmed cell death in addition to apoptosis. Necroptosis induction leads to cell membrane disruption, inflammation and vascularization. It plays important roles in various pathological processes, including neurodegeneration, inflammatory diseases, multiple cancers, and kidney injury. The molecular regulation of necroptotic pathway has been intensively studied in recent years. Necroptosis can be triggered by multiple stimuli and this pathway is regulated through activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3 and pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). A better understanding of the mechanism of regulation of necroptosis will further aid to the development of novel drugs for necroptosis-associated human diseases. In this review, we focus on new insights in the regulatory machinery of necroptosis. We further discuss the role of necroptosis in different pathologies, its potential as a therapeutic target and the current status of clinical development of drugs interfering in the necroptotic pathway.
