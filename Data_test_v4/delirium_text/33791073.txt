33791073|t|Novel Technologies in Studying Brain Immune Response.
33791073|a|Over the past few decades, the immune system, including both the adaptive and innate immune systems, proved to be essential and critical to brain damage and recovery in the pathogenesis of several diseases, opening a new avenue for developing new immunomodulatory therapies and novel treatments for many neurological diseases. However, due to the specificity and structural complexity of the central nervous system (CNS), and the limit of the related technologies, the biology of the immune response in the brain is still poorly understood. Here, we discuss the application of novel technologies in studying the brain immune response, including single-cell RNA analysis, cytometry by time-of-flight, and whole-genome transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. We believe that advancements in technology related to immune research will provide an optimistic future for brain repair.
