39116955|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of neurological disorders marked by the progressive loss of neurons that afflict millions of people worldwide. These illnesses affect brain connection, impairing memory, cognition, behavior, sensory perception, and motor function. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases are examples of common NDDs, which frequently include the buildup of misfolded proteins. Cognitive-behavioral impairments are early markers of neurodevelopmental disorders, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are critical for neuron survival and synaptic plasticity, which is required for learning and memory. NDDs have been associated with decreased BDNF levels. Physical exercise, a non-pharmacological intervention, benefits brain health by increasing BDNF levels, lowering cognitive deficits, and slowing brain degradation. Exercise advantages include increased well-being, reduced depression, improved cognitive skills, and neuroprotection by lowering amyloid accumulation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. This study examines the effects of physical exercise on cognitive-behavioral deficits and BDNF levels in the limbic system impacted by neurodegeneration. The findings highlight the necessity of including exercise into NDD treatment to improve brain structure, function, and total BDNF levels. As research advances, exercise is becoming increasingly acknowledged as an important technique for treating cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders.
