37520116|a|Background: The coronavirus has caused a worldwide pandemic with serious impacts on our healthcare systems. Many countries experienced a decline in traumatological patient volume. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the first lockdown on traumatological patient volume in Switzerland. Methods: We retrospectively used a prospective national quality measurement database. We compared the period of the first lockdown in Switzerland from March 17 to April 26, 2020 to the same period in the years 2018 and 2019. Included were all adult patients with any S-code (trauma) according to the International Classification of Diseases. Results: In total, we assessed 3874 patients (1779 in the year 2018, 1303 in the year 2019, and 792 in the year 2020) with a mean age of 61 +- 21 years. The patients during the lockdown period had significantly more injuries to the hip and forearm, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to have statutory insurance. During the lockdown period, more thromboembolism prophylaxis or anticoagulation was applied, and more patients needed antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a 40-55% reduction in patient volume during the lockdown period in Switzerland compared to the previous years. The in-hospital mortality and complication rate during the lockdown period remained stable. This study suggests that in-hospital care for trauma patients in Switzerland was not substantially affected by the first lockdown.
