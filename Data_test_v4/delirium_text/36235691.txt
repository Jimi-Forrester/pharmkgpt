36235691|t|Associations of Diet Quality and Heavy Metals with Obesity in Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
36235691|a|A poor diet cannot fully explain the prevalence of obesity. Other environmental factors (e.g., heavy metals) have been reported to be associated with obesity. However, limited evidence is available for the combined effect of these factors on obesity. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study and used the data from the National Health and Examination Survey (2007-2018) to explore the associations between diet quality and heavy metals and obesity. Diet quality was evaluated by the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) score. Heavy metals included serum cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). We included 15,959 adults, with 5799 of obesity (body mass index >= 30 kg/m2). After adjustment for covariates, every interquartile range increase in HEI-2015 scores, Pb, Cd and Hg was associated with a 35% (odds ratios [OR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60, 0.70), 11% (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.98), 9% (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.96), 5% (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.89) reduction in risk of peripheral obesity, respectively. In addition, the association between the HEI-2015 scores and peripheral obesity was attenuated by higher levels of heavy metals (All p interaction < 0.05). Results remained similar for abdominal obesity. Our study reveals the distinct effects of a high-quality diet and heavy metals on obesity prevalence, and the beneficial effect of a high-quality diet could be weakened by higher levels of heavy metals.
