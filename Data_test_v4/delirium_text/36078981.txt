36078981|t|Clinical Factors Contributing to Cognitive Function in the Acute Stage after Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: A Cross-Sectional Study.
36078981|a|Background: The factors affecting cognitive function after treatment of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) can be categorised into aneurysmal factors, procedural factors, and complications. The aim of this study was to investigate which of these factors has greater influence on the cognitive function. Methods: We retrospectively identified 14 patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and 34 patients with SAH with mild symptoms at disease onset (Hunt and Hess grade: >3). All patients underwent neuropsychological tests within 35 days of discharge from hospitalisation for treatment. The relationship between the clinical factors and each neuropsychological test score was evaluated using multiple linear regression analysis after controlling for age and years of education. Results: Patients with UIA showed greater cognitive impairment in visual memory and the frontal/executive domains. Hypertension was associated with cognitive impairment. Patients with SAH showed greater cognitive impairment in the visuospatial, verbal memory, and frontal/executive domains. The dome-to-neck ratio, aneurysms located in the posterior circulation, microsurgical clipping, procedure time, anaesthesia duration, and complications were associated with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Underlying diseases, procedural factors, and complications contributed to cognitive impairment after treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Since the effect of each factor on each cognitive domain was slightly different, a more in-depth study of these effects is needed.
