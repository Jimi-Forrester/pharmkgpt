36322802|t|Imitation of meaningless gestures in the Alzheimer's disease: influence of egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames
36322802|a|Imitation of meaningless gestures is a frequently used task to assess praxis skills in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The visuospatial analysis is considered to be one of the cognitive mechanisms most involved in perceiving the gestures of the other (i.e. model to imitate) in the imitation of meaningless gestures. However, in order to perform a classic gesture imitation task (i.e. face model), it is also necessary to transpose the representation of the other's gestures to better represent one's own gestures. This transposition can be superimposed on the dichotomy of egocentric spatial reference frames (i.e. self-gestures) and allocentric spatial reference frames (i.e. gestures of the other). Given previous researches on the relation between hippocampus and allocentric performance, we predicted that AD patients could have imitation difficulties specifically for the allocentric imitation. We thus propose a specific methodology to evaluate the imitation of meaningless gestures in both egocentric and allocentric conditions using unimanual ( i.e. one hand gestures) as well bimanual (i.e. two hand gestures) gest modalities for each condition. Our results show significant differences between the AD group and control group, except under the bimanualallocentric condition. Moreover, correlation analyses with visuospatial assessments do not validate the essential role of visuospatial abilities in our gestural imitation tasks. The comparison of the within-group results shows a significant difference between egocentric and allocentric conditions only for the elderly control group suggesting that the impact of spatial reference frames in gestural imitation would not be specific to AD. However, one should also be alert to within-pathological variability in AD, which would require a future study with several subgroups of AD patients.
