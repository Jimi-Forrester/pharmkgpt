35467633|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare of psychiatric symptoms in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in intensive care units and non-intensive care units. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 3351 hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 were retrospectively scanned, and 130 of patients were checked by attending consultation psychiatrists. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in ICU (75+-11.3) was higher than those hospitalized in non-ICU (57.9+-14) (p<0.001). The rate of patients aged 65 and over was higher in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized ICU (86.3%) than those hopitalized in non-ICU (40.5%) (p<0.001). The frequency of psychiatric consultations due to delirium was higher in the patients hospitalized in ICU than those hospitalized in non-ICU (p<0.001). Haloperidol and SSRIs were preferred more frequently by psychiatrists in the patients hospitalized in ICU than those hospitalized in non-ICU (p<0.001 and p=0.041, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia and delirium are the most frequent psychiatric manifestations in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and delirium and anxiety are more common in the COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized in ICU.
