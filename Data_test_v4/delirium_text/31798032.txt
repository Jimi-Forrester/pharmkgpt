31798032|t|Structural Brain Alterations Associated With Alcoholism.
31798032|a|Structural changes in the brains of chronic heavy drinkers that were first observed in pathological studies have been supported and expanded upon using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. In general, the volume of brain tissue appears decreased in chronic drinkers, and this finding may be affected by a person's age, gender, and other factors. MRI studies also demonstrate some increase in brain tissue volume after a chronic drinker has been abstinent for a period of months. Whether this tissue increase can be linked with recovery of brain functioning remains unanswered.
