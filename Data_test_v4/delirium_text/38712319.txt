38712319|t|Multiple system atrophy with amyloid-beta-predominant Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change.
38712319|a|Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease with alpha-synuclein pathology predominating in the striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar systems. Mixed pathologies are considered to be of low frequency and mostly comprise primary age-related tauopathy or low levels of Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathologic change. Therefore, the concomitant presence of different misfolded proteins in the same brain region is less likely in multiple system atrophy. During the neuropathological evaluation of 21 consecutive multiple system atrophy cases, we identified four cases exhibiting an unusual discrepancy between high Thal amyloid-beta phase and low transentorhinal Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage. We mapped alpha-synuclein pathology, measured the size and number of glial cytoplasmic inclusions and compared the amyloid-beta peptides between multiple system atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we performed alpha-synuclein seeding assay from the affected putamen samples. We performed genetic testing for APOE, MAPT, PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP. We refer to the four multiple system atrophy cases with discrepancy between amyloid-beta and tau pathology as 'amyloid-beta-predominant Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change-multiple system atrophy' to distinguish these from multiple system atrophy with primary age-related tauopathy or multiple system atrophy with typical Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change. As most multiple system atrophy cases with mixed pathologies reported in the literature, these cases did not show a peculiar clinical or MRI profile. Three amyloid-beta-predominant Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change-multiple system atrophy cases were available for genetic testing, and all carried the APOE e4 allele. The extent and severity of neuronal loss and alpha-synuclein pathology were not different compared with typical multiple system atrophy cases. Analysis of amyloid-beta peptides revealed more premature amyloid-beta plaques in amyloid-beta-predominant Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change-multiple system atrophy compared with Alzheimer's disease. alpha-Synuclein seeding amplification assay showed differences in the kinetics in two cases. This study highlights a rare mixed pathology variant of multiple system atrophy in which there is an anatomical meeting point of amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein, i.e. the striatum or cerebellum. Since biomarkers are entering clinical practice, these cases will be recognized, and the clinicians have to be informed that the prognosis is not necessarily different than in pure multiple system atrophy cases but that the effect of potential alpha-synuclein-based therapies might be influenced by the co-presence of amyloid-beta in regions where alpha-synuclein also aggregates. We propose that mixed pathologies should be interpreted not only based on differences in the clinical phenotype but also on whether protein depositions regionally overlap, potentially leading to a different response to alpha-synuclein-targeted therapies.
