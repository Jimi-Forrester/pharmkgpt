36555270|t|A Study on the Protective Effect of sRAGE-MSCs in a Rodent Reperfusion Model of Myocardial Infarction.
36555270|a|Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the major leading causes of death in humans globally. Recently, increased levels of recruited macrophages and AGE-albumin were observed in the hearts of humans and animals with acute myocardial infarction. Thus, the purposes of this study were to investigate whether the elevated levels of AGE-albumin from activated macrophage cells are implicated in ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death and to develop therapeutic strategies for AMI based on its underlying molecular mechanisms with respect to AGEs. The present study demonstrated that activated macrophages and AGE-albumin were observed in heart tissues obtained from humans and rats with AMI incidences. In the cellular model of AMI, it was found that increased expression of AGE-albumin was shown to be co-localized with macrophages, and the presence of AGE-albumin led to increased expression of RAGE through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. After revealing cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by toxicity of the AGE-RAGE system, sRAGE-secreting MSCs were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 platform to investigate the therapeutic effects of sRAGE-MSCs in an AMI rat model. Gene-edited sRAGE-MSCs showed greater therapeutic effects against AMI pathogenesis in rat models compared to mock MSCs, and promising results of the functional improvement of stem cells could result in significant improvements in the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases.
