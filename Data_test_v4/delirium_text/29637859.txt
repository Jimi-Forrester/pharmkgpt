29637859|t|Melatonin Treatment Enhances Abeta Lymphatic Clearance in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Amyloidosis.
29637859|a|BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that inadequate clearance of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) plays an important role in the accumulation of Abeta in sporadic late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the blood brain barrier (BBB) has taken the center stage in processes involving Abeta clearance, little information is available about the role of the lymphatic system. We previously reported that Abeta is cleared through the lymphatic system. We now assessed lymphatic Abeta clearance by treating a mouse model of AD amyloidosis with melatonin, an Abeta aggregation inhibitor and immuno-regulatory neurohormone. OBJECTIVE: To confirm and expand our initial finding that Abeta is cleared through the lymphatic system. Lymphatic clearance of metabolic and cellular "waste" products from the brain into the peripheral lymphatic system has been known for a long time. However, except for our prior report, there is no additional experimental data published about Abeta being cleared into peripheral lymph nodes. METHODS: For these experiments, we used a transgenic mouse model (Tg2576) that over-expresses a mutant form of the Abeta precursor protein (APP) in the brain. We examined levels of Abeta in plasma and in lymph nodes of transgenic mice as surrogate markers of vascular and lymphatic clearance, respectively. Abeta levels were also measured in the brain and in multiple tissues. RESULTS: Clearance of Abeta peptides through the lymphatic system was confirmed in this study. Treatment with melatonin led to the following changes: 1-A statistically significant increase in soluble monomeric Abeta40 and an increasing trend in Abeta42 in cervical and axillary lymph nodes of treated mice. 2- Statistically significant decreases in oligomeric Abeta40 and a decreasing trend Abeta42 in the brain. CONCLUSION: The data expands on our prior report that the lymphatic system participates in Abeta clearance from the brain. We propose that abnormalities in Abeta clearance through the lymphatic system may contribute to the development of cerebral amyloidosis. Melatonin and related indole molecules (i.e., indole- 3-propionic acid) are known to inhibit Abeta aggregation although they do not reverse aggregated Abeta or amyloid fibrils. Therefore, these substances should be further explored in prevention trials for delaying the onset of cognitive impairment in high risk populations.
