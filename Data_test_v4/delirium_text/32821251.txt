32821251|t|The Effects of a Recollection-Based Occupational Therapy Program of Alzheimer's Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
32821251|a|Considering the high socioeconomic costs related to the increasing number of dementia patients and their poor quality of life and that of their families, it is important to identify the condition early on and provide an appropriate intervention. This study organized a recollection-based occupational therapy program: a nonpharmacological intervention consisting of five categories of activities (physical, horticultural, musical, art, and instrumental activity of daily living; IADL) and applied it to those having a mild stage of Alzheimer's disease. The experimental group participated in a total of 24 sessions--five times per week for one hour per session--while the control group took part in regular activities offered by the existing facilities. The experimental group presented improved cognitive functions, reduced depression, and enhanced quality of life; the two groups showed a statistically significant difference in every category. This study is meaningful in that it made a cognitive stimulation program concerning five different categories, implemented it for people suffering mild dementia, and confirmed positive outcomes. If a systemic version of the program is offered in dementia care facilities, it is expected to make a considerable contribution to the care of dementia patients.
