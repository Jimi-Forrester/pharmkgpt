24990253|t|The 37kDa/67kDa laminin receptor acts as a receptor for Abeta42 internalization.
24990253|a|Neuronal loss is a major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The associations between soluble Abeta oligomers and cellular components cause this neurotoxicity. The 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) has recently been implicated in Abeta pathogenesis. In this study the mechanism underlying the pathological role of LRP/LR was elucidated. Forsters Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) revealed that LRP/LR and Abeta form a biologically relevant interaction. The ability of LRP/LR to form stable associations with endogenously shed Abeta was confirmed by pull down assays and Abeta-ELISAs. Antibody blockade of this association significantly lowered Abeta42 induced apoptosis. Furthermore, antibody blockade and shRNA mediated downregulation of LRP/LR significantly hampered Abeta42 internalization. These results suggest that LRP/LR is a receptor for Abeta42 internalization, mediating its endocytosis and contributing to the cytotoxicity of the neuropeptide by facilitating intra-cellular Abeta42 accumulation. These findings recommend anti-LRP/LR specific antibodies and shRNAs as potential therapeutic tools for AD treatment.
