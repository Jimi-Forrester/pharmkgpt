22153704|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been extensively studied as diagnostic markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, results are variable probably due to lumbar puncture (LP) procedure, CSF collection and transport. This intercenter variability highlights the need for an efficient standardization of clinical and technical procedures. The aims of this study were firstly to compare the LP procedure and CSF transport process in all French Memory Centers and secondly to evaluate the incidence of LP side effects in 100 patients with cognitive disturbances. METHODS: LP practice and side effect prospective questionnaires were sent to all French Memory Centers in May 2010. Memory Centers were asked about their LP procedure. The prospective study over a three-week-period has evaluated the LP feasibility and side effects. All data were collected until the end of July 2010. RESULTS: The answers of 18 out of 26 Memory Centers were collected. Although, these centers did not have the same LP procedure and CSF transport, the majority of them proceeded according to Innogenetics's advices concerning the use of polypropylene tubes and transport duration but not sample conditioning. Polypropylene tubes were different from one center to the other. CSF volume, pharmacological premedication and prevention of post-LP syndrome were variable in all responding centers. The prospective study carried out in 100 patients revealed a very good LP acceptability (93/100 patients). LP feasibility was 97 % (90/93) and failed LP were consequently performed with success using radiological scopes. Three minor complications were observed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: All French Centers complied with Innogenetics' recommendations for pretechnical CSF procedures; however each Center put in place its own procedure that was different one center to the other. It will be very interesting to compare cut-off and result values for Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau protein on threonine 181 between several centers that used their own procedures. Acceptability and safety were very good in our short but significant prospective study. These results confirm the data of Zetterberg et al., 2010.
