27274853|t|Cefepime-induced encephalopathy with normal renal function.
27274853|a|Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that is frequently used in a wide array of infections. Since approval for use, concerns have been raised due to adverse effects including seizures, encephalopathy and myoclonus especially if renal dysfunction is present. Despite having appropriate renal dose adjustments, cases have been found with adverse neurological effects. On this occasion, we present a case of a patient with normal renal function that had demonstrated cefepime-induced encephalopathy with full resolution of symptoms following discontinuation of the medication.
