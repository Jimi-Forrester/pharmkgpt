35408917|t|Combined Modeling Study of the Binding Characteristics of Natural Compounds, Derived from Psoralea Fruits, to beta-Amyloid Peptide Monomer.
35408917|a|A dysfunctional protein aggregation in the nervous system can lead to several neurodegenerative disorders that result in intracellular inclusions or extracellular aggregates. An early critical event within the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide within the brain. Natural compounds isolated from Psoralea Fructus (PF) have significant anti-Alzheimer effects as strong inhibitors of Abeta42 aggregation. Computer simulations provide a powerful means of linking experimental findings to nanoscale molecular events. As part of this research four prenylated compounds, the active ingredients of Psoralea Fructus (PF), were studied as Abeta42 accumulation inhibitors using molecular simulations modeling. In order to resolve the binding modes of the ligands and identify the main interactions of Abeta42 residues, we performed a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculations starting from the model of the compounds obtained from the docking study. This study was able to pinpoint the key amino acid residues in the Abeta42 active site and provide useful information that could benefit the development of new Abeta42 accumulation inhibitors.
