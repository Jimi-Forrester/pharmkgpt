35956307|t|Alterations in Intestinal Brush Border Membrane Functionality and Bacterial Populations Following Intra-Amniotic Administration (Gallus gallus) of Nicotinamide Riboside and Its Derivatives.
35956307|a|Nicotinamide riboside (NR) acts as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor where NR supplementation has previously been shown to be beneficial. Thus, we synthesized and characterized nicotinamide riboside tributyrate chloride (NRTBCl, water-soluble) and nicotinamide riboside trioleate chloride (NRTOCl, oil-soluble) as two new ester derivatives of nicotinamide riboside chloride (NRCl). NRCl and its derivatives were assessed in vivo, via intra-amniotic administration (Gallus gallus), with the following treatment groups: (1) non-injected (control); and injection of (2) deionized H2O (control); (3) NRCl (30 mg/mL dose); (4) NRTBCl (30 mg/mL dose); and (5) NRTOCl (30 mg/mL dose). Post-intervention, the effects on physiological markers associated with brush border membrane morphology, intestinal bacterial populations, and duodenal gene expression of key proteins were investigated. Although no significant changes were observed in average body weights, NRTBCl exposure increased average cecum weight. NR treatment significantly increased Clostridium and NRCl treatment resulted in increased populations of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and E. coli. Duodenal gene expression analysis revealed that NRCl, NRTBCl, and NRTOCl treatments upregulated the expression of ZnT1, MUC2, and IL6 compared to the controls, suggesting alterations in brush border membrane functionality. The administration of NRCl and its derivatives appears to trigger increased expression of brush border membrane digestive proteins, with added effects on the composition and function of cecal microbial populations. Additional research is now warranted to further elucidate the effects on inflammatory biomarkers and observe changes in the specific intestinal bacterial populations post introduction of NR and its derivatives.
