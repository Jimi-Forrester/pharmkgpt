32133828|a|The process of drug discovery and drug development consumes billions of dollars to bring a new drug to the market. Drug development is time consuming and sometimes, the failure rates are high. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry is looking for a better option for new drug discovery. Drug repositioning is a good alternative technology that has demonstrated many advantages over de novo drug development, the most important one being shorter drug development timelines. In the last two decades, drug repositioning has made tremendous impact on drug development technologies. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in drug repositioning technologies and discuss the repositioned drugs used for inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis.
