34211215|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder is attributing to a significant health-care burden worldwide. Early-onset alcohol dependence is associated with more adverse outcomes than those with late-onset alcohol dependence. Comorbid externalizing disorders and cognitive deficits may be associated with the negative outcomes in early-onset alcohol dependence. This study aims at exploring the externalizing psychopathology and cognitive performance in early-onset alcohol dependence versus late-onset alcohol dependence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out on patients attending the psychiatry unit of a tertiary care center of north India after obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee. A total of 57 patients with alcohol dependence enrolled in the study, after screening a total of 112 patients. Patients were evaluated for the externalizing psychopathology (using SSAGA intravenous [IV]) and cognitive performance (using Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST] and continuous performance test [CPT]). Comparison of sociodemographic, clinical variables as well as externalizing psychopathology and cognitive performance was done between early-onset and late-onset alcohol dependence. RESULTS: Comparison between early-onset and late-onset alcohol dependence revealed that the score of individual externalizing psychopathologies and the total externalizing psychopathology score on SSAGA IV in the early-onset group are significantly higher than late-onset alcohol dependence. Similarly, there is a significant difference in the executive functions (on WCST) between the two groups (early onset < late onset). On CPT, there are significantly more errors of omission in the early-onset group in comparison to their late-onset counterparts. CONCLUSION: Early-onset alcohol dependence is associated with more externalizing psychopathology and more cognitive dysfunction than late-onset alcohol dependence.
