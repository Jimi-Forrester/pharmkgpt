36769718|t|Inhaled Sedation with Volatile Anesthetics for Mechanically Ventilated Patients in Intensive Care Units: A Narrative Review.
36769718|a|Inhaled sedation was recently approved in Europe as an alternative to intravenous sedative drugs for intensive care unit (ICU) sedation. The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the available data from the literature published between 2005 and 2023 in terms of the efficacy, safety, and potential clinical benefits of inhaled sedation for ICU mechanically ventilated patients. The results indicated that inhaled sedation reduces the time to extubation and weaning from mechanical ventilation and reduces opioid and muscle relaxant consumption, thereby possibly enhancing recovery. Several researchers have reported its potential cardio-protective, anti-inflammatory or bronchodilator properties, alongside its minimal metabolism by the liver and kidney. The reflection devices used with inhaled sedation may increase the instrumental dead space volume and could lead to hypercapnia if the ventilator settings are not optimal and the end tidal carbon dioxide is not monitored. The risk of air pollution can be prevented by the adequate scavenging of the expired gases. Minimizing atmospheric pollution can be achieved through the judicious use of the inhalation sedation for selected groups of ICU patients, where the benefits are maximized compared to intravenous sedation. Very rarely, inhaled sedation can induce malignant hyperthermia, which prompts urgent diagnosis and treatment by the ICU staff. Overall, there is growing evidence to support the benefits of inhaled sedation as an alternative for intravenous sedation in ICU mechanically ventilated patients. The indication and management of any side effects should be clearly set and protocolized by each ICU. More randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still required to investigate whether inhaled sedation should be prioritized over the current practice of intravenous sedation.
