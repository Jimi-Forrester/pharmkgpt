33106509|t|Desflurane anesthesia shifts the circadian rhythm phase depending on the time of day of anesthesia.
33106509|a|Desflurane is one of the most frequently used inhalational anesthetics in clinical practice. A circadian rhythm phase-shift after general anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane has been reported in mice, but few studies have reported this effect with desflurane. In the present study, we examined the rest/activity rhythm of mice by counting the number of running wheel rotations, and we found that desflurane anesthesia caused a phase shift in the circadian rhythm that was dependent on the time of day of anesthesia. We also found that desflurane anesthesia altered the relative mRNA expression of four major clock genes (Per2, Bmal, Clock, and Cry1) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). These results are important for elucidating the effects of desflurane on the SCN, which is the master clock for the mammalian circadian rhythm. Further studies on the relationship between anesthesia and circadian rhythm may lead to the prevention and treatment of postoperative complications related to circadian rhythms.
