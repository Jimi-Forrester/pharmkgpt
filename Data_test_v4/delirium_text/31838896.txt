31838896|a|Aim: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, and particularly in Alzheimer's disease. Results: This work describes the Ugi multicomponent synthesis, antioxidant power and Nrf2 pathway induction in antioxidant response element cells of (E)-N-(2-((2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-N-(2-(5-(benzyloxy)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acryl amides 8a-d, N-(2-((2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-N-(2-(5-(benzyloxy)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanamides 8e-h and N-(2-((2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-N-(2-(5-(benzyloxy)-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-carboxamides 8i,j. Conclusion: We have identified compounds 8e and 8g, showing a potent antioxidant capacity, a remarkable neuroprotective effect against the cell death induced by H2O2 in SH-SY5Y cells, and a performing activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, as very interesting new antioxidant agents for pathologies that curse with oxidative stress.
