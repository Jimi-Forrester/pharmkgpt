21787324|a|The pharmaceutical industry has invested a great deal of time and finance in the development of therapeutics targeting amyloid generation, signalling and plaque stability. This has been based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis which states that abnormal amyloid precursor protein processing and the formation of amyloid plaques is the central process in the development of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, most clinical trials in this area have been disappointing; therefore the attendees of the Models of Dementia: the Good, the Bad and the Future meeting were given the opportunity to openly debate the proposal 'the amyloid cascade has misled the pharmaceutical industry', with the main contributions from Professor John Hardy and Professor John Mayer. The present article is a representation of the debate.
