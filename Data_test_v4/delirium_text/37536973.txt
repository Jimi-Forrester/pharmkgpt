37536973|t|Study profile: the Genetics of Glaucoma Study.
37536973|a|PURPOSE: Glaucoma, a major cause of irreversible blindness, is a highly heritable human disease. Currently, the majority of the risk genes for glaucoma are unknown. We established the Genetics of Glaucoma Study (GOGS) to identify disease genes and improve genetic prediction of glaucoma risk and response to treatment. PARTICIPANTS: More than 5700 participants with glaucoma or a family history of glaucoma were recruited through a media campaign and the Australian Government healthcare service provider, Services Australia, making GOGS one of the largest genetic studies of glaucoma globally. The mean age of the participants was 65.30+-9.36 years, and 62% were female. Participants completed a questionnaire obtaining information about their glaucoma-related medical history such as family history, glaucoma status and subtypes, surgical procedures, and prescriptions. The questionnaire also obtained information about other eye and systemic diseases. Approximately 80% of the participants provided a DNA sample and ~70% consented to data linkage to their Australian Government Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme schedules. FINDINGS TO DATE: 4336 GOGS participants reported that an optometrist or ophthalmologist has diagnosed them with glaucoma and 3639 participants reported having a family history of glaucoma. The vast majority of the participants (N=4393) had used at least one glaucoma-related medication; latanoprost was the most commonly prescribed drug (54% of the participants who had a glaucoma prescription). A subset of the participants reported a surgical treatment for glaucoma including a laser surgery in 2008 participants and a non-laser operation in 803 participants. Several comorbid eye and systemic diseases were also observed; the most common reports were ocular hypertension (53% of the participants), cataract (48%), hypertension (40%), nearsightedness (31%), astigmatism (22%), farsightedness (16%), diabetes (12%), sleep apnoea (11%) and migraines (10%). FUTURE PLANS: GOGS will contribute to the global gene-mapping efforts as one of the largest genetic studies for glaucoma. We will also use GOGS to develop or validate genetic risk prediction models to stratify glaucoma risk, particularly in individuals with a family history of glaucoma, and to predict clinical outcomes (eg, which medication works better for an individual and whether glaucoma surgery is required). GOGS will also help us answer various research questions about genetic overlap and causal relationships between glaucoma and its comorbidities.
