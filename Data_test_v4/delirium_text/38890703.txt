38890703|a|BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in elderly people in the developed world, and the number of people affected is expected to almost double by 2040. The retina presents one of the highest metabolic demands in our bodies that is partially or fully fulfilled by mitochondria in the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), respectively. Together with its post-mitotic status and constant photooxidative damage from incoming light, the retina requires a tightly-regulated housekeeping system that involves autophagy. The natural polyphenol Urolithin A (UA) has shown neuroprotective benefits in several models of aging and age-associated disorders, mostly attributed to its ability to induce mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Sodium iodate (SI) administration recapitulates the late stages of AMD, including geographic atrophy and photoreceptor cell death. METHODS: A combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models were used to test the neuroprotective potential of UA in the SI model. Functional assays (OCT, ERGs), cellular analysis (flow cytometry, qPCR) and fine confocal microscopy (immunohistochemistry, tandem selective autophagy reporters) helped address this question. RESULTS: UA alleviated neurodegeneration and preserved visual function in SI-treated mice. Simultaneously, we observed severe proteostasis defects upon SI damage induction, including autophagosome accumulation, that were resolved in animals that received UA. Treatment with UA restored autophagic flux and triggered PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, as previously reported in the literature. Autophagy blockage caused by SI was caused by severe lysosomal membrane permeabilization. While UA did not induce lysosomal biogenesis, it did restore upcycling of permeabilized lysosomes through lysophagy. Knockdown of the lysophagy adaptor SQSTM1/p62 abrogated viability rescue by UA in SI-treated cells, exacerbated lysosomal defects and inhibited lysophagy. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data highlight a novel putative application of UA in the treatment of AMD whereby it bypasses lysosomal defects by promoting p62-dependent lysophagy to sustain proteostasis.
