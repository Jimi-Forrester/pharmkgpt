35747331|t|Time to Recovery from Covid-19 and Its Predictors Among Patients Admitted to Treatment Centers of Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), ETHIOPIA: Multi-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.
35747331|a|Background: The world is currently facing a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). It has caused significant morbidity and mortality. So far little is known about recovery time (prolonged hospital stay) from Covid-19 and its determinants in Ethiopia as well as in the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine time to recovery from Covid-19, and identify predictors of time to recovery among patients admitted to treatment centers of Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). Methods and Materials: A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among Covid-19 patients admitted to care centers of SNNPR from May 30, 2020 to October 15, 2021. A sample of 845 patients was included in the study. Summarization of the data was done using mean (standard deviation) and median (inter quartile range). Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve was used to estimate recovery time from Covid-19 and the independent effects of covariates on recovery time was analyzed using multivariable Cox-proportional hazard model. Results: The incidence density of recovery was 8.24 per 100 person-days (95% CI: 7.67, 8.85). The overall median recovery time was 10 days (IQR: 8-16 days). Critical stage of Covid-19 (aHR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.29), severe stage of Covid-19 (aHR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.56), mechanical ventilation (aHR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.073, 0.56) and treatment center (aHR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.90) were significant predictors of recovery rate among Covid-19 patients. Conclusion: The median time to recovery from Covid-19 was relatively short. The incidence density of recovery was 8.24 per 100 person-days. The hazard of recovery was lower for patients at higher levels of Covid-19 severity and for patients in need of mechanical ventilation. Early identification of severity levels of the patients is required at the time of admission. Special attention, critical follow-up and management is warranted for patients at higher levels of Covid-19 severity.
