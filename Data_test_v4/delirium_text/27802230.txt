27802230|t|Validation of a Latent Construct for Dementia in a Population-Wide Dataset from Singapore.
27802230|a|BACKGROUND: The latent variable delta has been proposed as a proxy for dementia. Previous validation studies have been conducted using convenience samples. It is currently unknown how delta performs in population-wide data. OBJECTIVE: To validate delta in Singapore using population-wide epidemiological study data on persons aged 60 and above. METHODS: delta was constructed using items from the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI'D) and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS II). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine delta model fit. Convergent validity was examined with the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) and GMS-AGECAT dementia. Divergent validity was examined with GMS-AGECAT depression. RESULTS: The delta model demonstrated fit to the data, chi2(df) = 249.71(55), p < 0.001, CFI = 0.990, TLI = 0.997, RMSEA = 0.037. Latent variable delta was significantly associated with CDR and GMS-AGECAT dementia (range: beta= 0.32 to 0.63), and was not associated with GMS-AGECAT depression. Compared to unadjusted models, delta model fit was poor when adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and education. CONCLUSION: The study found some support for delta as a proxy for dementia in Singapore based on population data. Both convergent and divergent validity were established. In addition, the delta model structure appeared to be influenced by age, gender, ethnicity, and education covariates.
