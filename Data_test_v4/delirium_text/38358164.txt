38358164|a|Malaria is a disease affecting millions of people, especially in Africa, Asia, and South America, and has become a substantial economic burden. Because malaria is contracted through the bite of a mosquito vector, it is very challenging to prevent. Bed nets and insect repellents are used in some homes; others do not have or use them even when available. Thus, treatment measures are crucial to controlling this disease. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently the first-line treatment for malaria. ACT has been used for decades, but recently, there has been evidence of potential resistance. This threat of resistance has led to the search for possible alternatives to ACT. In sub-Saharan Africa, Azadirachta indica, or simply neem, is a plant used to treat a variety of ailments, including malaria. Neem is effective against one of the more deadly malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum. Reports show that neem inhibits microgametogenesis of P. falciparum and interferes with the parasite's ookinete development. Although there is substantial in vitro research on the biological activity of A. indica (neem), there is limited in vivo research. Herein, we discuss the in vivo effects of neem on malaria parasites. With A. indica, the future of malaria treatment is promising, especially for high-risk patients, but further research and clinical trials are required to confirm its biological activity.
