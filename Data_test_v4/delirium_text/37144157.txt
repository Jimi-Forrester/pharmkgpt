37144157|a|Background: The correlation between cognitive function and lipid profiles, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, is inconsistent. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the association between serum lipid levels and the prevalence of cognitive impairment among community-dwelling older adults and explored this difference in association by gender and urban-rural residency. Methods: Participants aged 65 and above in urban and rural areas were recruited between 2018 and 2020, selected from the Hubei Memory and Aging Cohort Study. Detailed neuropsychological evaluations, clinical examinations and laboratory tests were conducted in community health service centres. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the correlation between serum lipid profiles and the prevalence of cognitive impairment. Results: We identified 1 336 cognitively impaired adults (>=65 years)-1 066 with mild cognitive impairment and 270 with dementia-from 4 746 participants. Triglycerides level was correlated with cognitive impairment in the total sample (chi2=6.420, p=0.011). In gender-stratified multivariate analysis, high triglycerides in males reduced the risk of cognitive impairment (OR: 0.785, 95% CI: 0.623 to 0.989, p=0.040), and high LDL-C in females increased the risk of cognitive impairment (OR: 1.282, 95% CI: 1.040 to 1.581, p=0.020). In both gender-stratified and urban-rural stratified multivariate analyses, high triglycerides reduced the risk of cognitive impairment in older urban men (OR: 0.734, 95% CI: 0.551 to 0.977, p=0.034), and high LDL-C increased the risk of cognitive impairment in older rural women (OR: 1.830, 95% CI: 1.119 to 2.991, p=0.016). Conclusions: There are gender and urban-rural differences in the correlation of serum lipids with cognitive impairment. High triglycerides levels may be a protective factor for cognitive function in older urban men, while high LDL-C levels may be a risk factor for cognitive function in older rural women.
