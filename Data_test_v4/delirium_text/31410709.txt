31410709|t|Role of PGC-1alpha in Mitochondrial Quality Control in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
31410709|a|As one of the major cell organelles responsible for ATP production, it is important that neurons maintain mitochondria with structural and functional integrity; this is especially true for neurons with high metabolic requirements. When mitochondrial damage occurs, mitochondria are able to maintain a steady state of functioning through molecular and organellar quality control, thus ensuring neuronal function. And when mitochondrial quality control (MQC) fails, mitochondria mediate apoptosis. An apparently key molecule in MQC is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Recent findings have demonstrated that upregulation of PGC-1alpha expression in neurons can modulate MQC to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction in certain in vivo and in vitro aging or neurodegenerative encephalopathy models, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Because mitochondrial function and quality control disorders are the basis of pathogenesis in almost all neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), the role of PGC-1alpha may make it a viable entry point for the treatment of such diseases. This review focuses on multi-level MQC in neurons, as well as the regulation of MQC by PGC-1alpha in these major NDDs.
