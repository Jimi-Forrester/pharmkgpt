37722986|a|OBJECTIVE: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is associated with increased risks for progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in individuals with SCD and healthy controls (HCs) in the baseline year and determined the predictability of cognitive changes in the clinical follow-up. METHODS: Resting-state magnetoencephalographic signals in 29 HCs and 23 SCD subjects were recorded in the baseline year. The parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). Based on the grand-averaged comodulograms, delta-beta, delta-gamma and theta-gamma PAC values were extracted from each ROI. RESULTS: Compared with the HCs, the SCD group showed decreased theta-gamma PAC in the precuneus. Theta-gamma PAC of the left precuneus was associated with SCD severity and performance of immediate recall in the baseline year. The SCD group was followed for 3 years and divided into SCD-Stable and SCD-Decline groups based on scores of Mini-Mental State Examination. No significant differences in PAC of the baseline year were found between SCD-Stable and SCD-Decline groups. CONCLUSIONS: The SCD group demonstrated reduced theta-gamma PAC in the precuneus. SIGNIFICANCE: Subjective perception of cognitive decline is reflected by objective alterations of brain function.
