Yet, routine-EEG (rEEG) is often not available, especially during off-hours. METHODS: We analyzed the value of a commercially available, simplified wireless eight-channel EEG recording (swEEG, CerebAir  EEG headset, Nihon Kohden), applied by non-EEG-specialized medical students, in patients presenting in our nER with (suspicion of) epileptic seizures and/or loss of or altered state of consciousness between 08/2019 and 08/2022. We evaluated the feasibility and validity compared to a standard rEEG (21 electrodes according to the international 10/20 system) and also included the clinical follow-up of the patients. RESULTS: 100 patients were included in our analysis (mean age 57.6 +- 20.4 years; 61 male). Median time of electrode application was 7 minutes (range 4-20 minutes), with significantly longer duration in patients with altered level of consciousness (median 8 minutes, p = 0.035). Electrode impedances also differed according to state of consciousness (p = 0.032), and were higher in females (p<0.001). 55 patients received additional rEEG, either during their acute nER stay (25) and/or during the next days (38). Considering normal EEG findings vs. pathological slowing vs. epileptiform activity, swEEG matched first rEEG results in 48/55 cases (87.3%). Overall, swEEG detected the same or additional pathological EEG patterns in 52/55 cases (94.5%). In 7/75 patients (9.3%) who did not receive rEEG, or had their rEEG scheduled to a later time point during their hospital stay, swEEG revealed important additional pathological findings (e.g. status epilepticus, interictal epileptiform discharges), which would have triggered acute therapeutic consequences or led to further diagnostics and investigations. CONCLUSION: The introduced swEEG represents a practicable, valuable technique to be quickly applied by non-EEG-specialized ER staff to initiate timely diagnostic and guide further investigations and treatment in the nER. Moreover, it may help to avoid under-diagnostic with potentially harmful consequences caused by skipped or postponed regular 10/20 EEG examinations, and ultimately improve the outcome of patients.
