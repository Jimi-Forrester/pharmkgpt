36018151|a|Recent studies have proposed three lymphatic drainage systems in the brain, that is, the glymphatic system, the intramural periarterial drainage pathway, and meningeal lymphatic vessels, whose roles in various neurological diseases have been widely explored. The glymphatic system is a fluid drainage and waste clearance pathway that utilizes perivascular space and aquaporin-4 protein located in the astrocyte endfeet to provide a space for exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid. The intramural periarterial drainage pathway drives the flow of interstitial fluid through the capillary basement membrane and the arterial tunica media. Meningeal lymphatic vessels within the dura mater are involved in the removal of cerebral macromolecules and immune responses. After ischemic stroke, impairment of these systems could lead to cerebral edema, accumulation of toxic factors, and activation of neuroinflammation, while restoration of their normal functions can improve neurological outcomes. In this review, we summarize the basic concepts of these drainage systems, including drainage routes, physiological functions, regulatory mechanisms, and detection technologies. We also focus on the roles of lymphatic drainage systems in brain injury after ischemic stroke, as well as recent advances in therapeutic strategies targeting these drainage systems. These findings provide information for potential novel strategies for treatment of stroke.
