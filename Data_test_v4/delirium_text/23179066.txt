23179066|a|There is no effective drug to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease affecting an estimated 30 million people around the world. Strongly supported by preclinical and clinical studies, amyloid-beta (Abeta) may be a target for developing drugs against AD. Meanwhile, the fact that localized neuronal death/loss and synaptic impairment occur in AD should also be considered. Neuronal regeneration, which does not occur normally in the mammalian central nervous system, can be promoted by neurotrophic factors (NTFs). Evidence from clinical trials has shown that both Abeta clearance and NTFs are potentially effective in treating AD, thus a new approach combining Abeta clearance and administration of NTFs may be an effective therapeutic strategy.
