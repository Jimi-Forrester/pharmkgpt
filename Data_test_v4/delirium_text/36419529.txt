36419529|a|Approximately 50-60% of patients with a clinical transient ischemic attack (TIA) do not have diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) evidence of cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to assess the added diagnostic value of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the evaluation of patients with TIA who have normal DWI findings. From September 2014 to May 2017, a total of 179 consecutive patients with suspected TIA were eligible for enrollment in our study. The inclusion criteria were a confirmed diagnosis of TIA confirmed by a stroke neurologist, MRI (including DWI and DKI) within 24 h after symptom onset, no stroke history, and no DWI lesion. A follow-up DWI was performed to establish stroke recurrence within a period of 90 days. A total of 98 patients who had no lesions on the baseline DWI were included for data analysis. Of these 98 patients, 31 (31.6%) had positive findings on the initial DKI. In 29 of the 31 (93.5%) patients, the location of the abnormality observed on DKI was consistent with the clinical symptoms. During the 90-day follow-up period, 14 (14.3%) patients developed recurrent stroke. The prevalence of recurrent stroke was higher in the DKI-positive group than in the DKI-negative group (29.0% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.01). A comparison between the patients with and without recurrent stroke showed that an abnormality on the baseline DKI was associated with stroke recurrence. Furthermore, 8 of the 9 stroke patients in the DKI-positive group developed a new ischemic lesion in the artery territory corresponding to the initial DKI abnormality. The new findings suggest the predictive value of DKI on the recurrence of stroke in the patients with TIA who have negative findings on conventional DWI.
