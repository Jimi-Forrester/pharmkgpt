31388846|t|A Comprehensive Review of Analgesia and Pain Modalities in Hip Fracture Pathogenesis.
31388846|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hip fracture is common in the elderly population, painful and costly. The present investigation was undertaken to review epidemiology, socio-economic and medical implications, relevant anatomy, and anesthetic and pain modalities of hip fracture. RECENT FINDINGS: A literature search of PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane databases was conducted in December 2018 to identify relevant published clinical trials, review articles, and meta-analyses studies related to anesthetic and pain modalities of hip fracture. The acute pain management in these situations is often challenging. Common issues associated with morbidity and mortality include patients' physiological decrease in function, medical comorbidities, and cognitive impairment, which all can confound and complicate pain assessment and treatment. Perioperative multidisciplinary and multimodal approaches require medical, surgical, and anesthesiology teams employing adequate preoperative optimization. Reduction in pain and disability utilizing opioid and non-opioid therapies, regional anesthesia, patient-tailored anesthetic approach, and delirium prevention strategies seems to ensure best outcomes.
