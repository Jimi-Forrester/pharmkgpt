38770684|t|Dexmedetomidine in Palliative Care: A Versatile New Weapon Against Delirium and Pain-Systematic Review.
38770684|a|Introduction: At the end of life, the prevalence of delirium and pain is high. Current therapy is not satisfactory. Dexmedetomidine could be useful in the control of delirium and pain but is not approved outside of intensive care setting. Our objectives are to evaluate existing evidence in the literature that assessed the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in pain and delirium control and its safety in palliative care patients outside intensive care units. This systematic review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO and included a risk of bias assessment. Methods: PubMed and SCOPUS were examined for literature published until 2023. Experimental, cohort, cross-sectional, case-control studies, and case series/reports were included if they evaluate the use of dexmedetomidine in delirium and/or pain management in hospitalized palliative care adult patients. Studies were excluded if they were carried out in intensive care units. Results: Of the initial 529 records, 14 were included. Although only two studies were randomized trials, most were small and only one had low risk of bias. In most case reports and in the two retrospective cohort studies, dexmedetomidine appears to be a better option for these symptoms, although differences were not significant in the randomized trials. Discussion: Dexmedetomidine seems to be a promising option for refractory pain and delirium and may contribute to a reduction in opioid administration to control pain. This is the first systematic review of dexmedetomidine in palliative care. Quality evidence is limited, but clinical properties of dexmedetomidine justify the conduction of controlled trials in palliative care.
