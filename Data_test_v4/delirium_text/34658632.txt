34658632|t|Acute and Long Term Treatment of Manic Episodes in Bipolar Disorder.
34658632|a|Bipolar disorder is a disabling psychiatric disorder which causes premature death and loss of quality of life. Despite the developments, novel treatments are partially effective and insufficient responses to treatment may cause loss of quality of life. Contemporary approaches to treatment planning involve taking the current symptoms and the personal treatment history of the patient into account and tailoring them for the treatment of each patient, i.e. individualized treatment. In this article, effects and side effects of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and sedative hypnotic medications are reviewed and presented briefly for clinicians. Although novel developments have been observed in the literature about mixed states and psychotic symptoms, evidence-based options are still limited. Efficacy of mood stabilizers may be prolonged and additional medications may also be needed frequently in patients treated with mood stabilizers. Antipsychotics may cause several side effects and cannot be maintained for a long time in some of those patients. These factors may limit the use of mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Therefore, the experience of the clinician and personal history of the patient still have importance in the procedure.
