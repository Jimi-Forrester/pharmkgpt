33311571|a|Cortical thinning occurs throughout the entire life and extends to late-life neurodegeneration, yet the neurobiological substrates are poorly understood. Here, we used a virtual-histology technique and gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to compare the regional profiles of longitudinal cortical thinning through life (4004 magnetic resonance images [MRIs]) with those of gene expression for several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The results were replicated in three independent datasets. We found that inter-regional profiles of cortical thinning related to expression profiles for marker genes of CA1 pyramidal cells, astrocytes and, microglia during development and in aging. During the two stages of life, the relationships went in opposite directions: greater gene expression related to less thinning in development and vice versa in aging. The association between cortical thinning and cell-specific gene expression was also present in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. These findings suggest a role of astrocytes and microglia in promoting and supporting neuronal growth and dendritic structures through life that affects cortical thickness during development, aging, and neurodegeneration. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiology underlying variations in MRI-derived estimates of cortical thinning through life and late-life disease.
