37306922|a|The occurrence of neurological manifestations and complications in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women with COVID-19 is unclear. This cross-sectional study included women aged over 18 years hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR from March to June 2020 in Recife, Brazil. We evaluated 360 women, including 82 pregnant patients who were significantly younger (27.5 vs. 53.6 years; p < 0.01) and less frequently obese (2.4% vs. 15.1%; p < 0.01) than the non-pregnant group. All pregnancies were confirmed using ultrasound imaging. Abdominal pain was the only more frequent COVID-19 manifestation during pregnancy (23.2% vs. 6.8%; p < 0.01), but was not associated with the outcomes. Almost half the pregnant women presented neurological manifestations, including anosmia (31.7%), headache (25.6%), ageusia (17.1%), and fatigue (12.2%). However, neurological manifestations occurred similarly in pregnant and non-pregnant women. Four (4.9%) pregnant women and 64 non-pregnant women (23%) presented delirium, but the frequency with age-adjustment was similar in the non-pregnant group. Pregnant women with COVID and preeclampsia (19.5%) or eclampsia (3.7%) were older (31.8 vs. 26.5 years; p < 0.01), and epileptic seizures occurred more often in association with eclampsia (18.8% vs. 1.5%; p < 0.01) regardless of previous epilepsy. There were three maternal deaths (3.7%), one dead fetus, and one miscarriage. The overall prognosis was good. There was no difference in prolonged hospital stay, the need for ICU and mechanical ventilation, or death when comparing pregnant and non-pregnant women.
