39192797|a|Given the increasing trend of aging population in the world, neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), a common type of diseases that mostly occur in the elderly, have attracted much more attention. It has been shown that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation, an important pathological feature of NDDs, and affects the occurrence and development of NDDs. Most importantly, the regulatory effect of TRAF6 is related to its ubiquitination. Therefore, in the present paper, the molecular structure, biological function, and ubiquitination mechanism of TRAF6, and its relationship with some common NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, were analyzed and summarized. The possible molecular mechanisms by which TRAF6 regulates the occurrence of NDDs were also elucidated, providing a theoretical basis for exploring the etiology and treatment of NDDs.
