30781821|a|Functional food ingredients, including prebiotics, have been increasingly developed for human health. The improvement of the human intestinal environment is one of their main targets. Fructooligosaccarides (FOS) are oligosaccharide fructans that are well studied and commercialized prebiotics. 1-Kestose, one of the components of FOS, is considered to be a key prebiotic component in FOS. However, to our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the physiological efficacy of 1-Kestose regarding its anti-oxidative activity. In the present study, we examined the effects of dietary 1-Kestose on gene expression of antioxidative enzymes in the liver, kidney and epididymal adipose tissue of mice by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We demonstrated that a 1-Kestose-rich diet increased mRNA and enzymatic activity levels of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in mouse liver. These results suggest the possibility that dietary 1-Kestose as a prebiotic may enhance antioxidative activity in mice.
