32345319|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron degeneration in adults, and several mechanisms underlying the disease pathology have been proposed. It has been shown that glia communicate with other cells by releasing extracellular vesicles containing proteins and nucleic acids, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Dysregulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in ALS patients, together with inflammation and an altered microglial phenotype. However, the role of miRNA-containing vesicles in microglia-to-neuron communication in the context of ALS has not been explored in depth. This review summarises the evidence for the presence of inflammation, pro-inflammatory microglia and dysregulated miRNAs in ALS, then explores how microglia may potentially be responsible for this miRNA dysregulation. The possibility of pro-inflammatory ALS microglia releasing miRNAs which may then enter neuronal cells to contribute to degeneration is also explored. Based on the literature reviewed here, microglia are a likely source of dysregulated miRNAs and potential mediators of neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, dysregulated miRNAs may be promising candidates for the development of therapeutic strategies.
