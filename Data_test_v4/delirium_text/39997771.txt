39997771|a|Background/Objectives: The systematic review by Zaher-Sanchez et al. evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in preventing and managing delirium in elderly patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). This commentary discusses its importance, limitations, and dilemmas regarding delirium prevention. Conclusions: The need for effective measures for preventing delirium is imperative, and the findings to date support the benefits of non-pharmacological interventions, but we still do not have a sufficient body of evidence to choose specific interventions.
