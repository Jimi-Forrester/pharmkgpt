36003483|a|Objectives: Patients undergoing lung resection are at risk of perioperative complications, many of which necessitate unplanned critical care unit admission in the postoperative period. We sought to characterize this population, providing an up-to-date estimate of the incidence of unplanned critical care admission, and to assess critical care and hospital stay, resource use, mortality, and outcomes. Methods: A multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing lung resection in participating UK hospitals over 2 years. A comprehensive dataset was recorded for each critical care admission (defined as the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation and/or renal replacement therapy), in addition to a simplified dataset in all patients undergoing lung resection during the study period. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with critical care outcome. Results: A total of 11,208 patients underwent lung resection in 16 collaborating centers during the study period, and 253 patients (2.3%) required unplanned critical care admission with a median duration of stay of 13 (4-28) days. The predominant indication for admission was respiratory failure (68.1%), with 77.8% of patients admitted during the first 7 days following surgery. Eighty-seven (34.4%) died in critical care. On multivariable regression, only the diagnosis of right ventricular dysfunction and the need for both mechanical ventilation and renal-replacement therapy were independently associated with critical care survival; this model, however, had poor predictive value. Conclusions: Although resource-intensive and subject to prolonged stay, following unplanned admission to critical care after lung resection outcomes are good for many patients; 65.6% of patients survived to hospital discharge, and 62.7% were discharged to their own home.
