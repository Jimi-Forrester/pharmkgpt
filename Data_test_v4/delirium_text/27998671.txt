27998671|t|Synthesis, physicochemical and biological studies of technetium-99m labeled tacrine derivative as a diagnostic tool for evaluation of cholinesterase level.
27998671|a|In the present work the synthesis and physicochemical investigations of new tacrine analogues labeled with technetium-99m are reported. All obtained novel radioconjugates showed high stability in the presence of an excess of standard amino acids cysteine or histidine, as well as in human serum. Lipophilicity (LogD values) of these compounds is within the range from 0.92 to 1.56. For the selected radioconjugate 99mTc(NS3)(CN-NH(CH2)7Tac) (LogD=1.56) the biological activity studies in the course of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase action have been performed (IC50=45.0nM, estimated by means of Ellman's method). Biodistribution studies of this compound showed its uptake in brain on the level of 0.07%ID/g and its clearance through the hepatic and renal route in comparable degree. The ascertained presence of the radioconjugate in brain indicates its possibility to cross the blood-brain barrier. Molecular modeling of 99mTc(NS3)(CN-NH(CH2)7Tac) radioconjugate showed that the main structural fragment is tacrine moiety which is responsible for most interactions within catalytic and peripheral active sites and provides the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. The 99mTc(NS3)(CN-NH(CH2)7Tac) radioconjugate may be considered to be a diagnostic tool for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease as well as a marker to determine the physiological condition of liver and intestines.
