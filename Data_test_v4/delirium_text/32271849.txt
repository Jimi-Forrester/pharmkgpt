32271849|t|Establishment of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol in minimally invasive heart valve surgery.
32271849|a|Protocols for "Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)" are on the rise in different surgical disciplines and represent one of the most important recent advancements in perioperative medical care. In cardiac surgery, only few ERAS protocols have been described in the past. At University Heart Center Hamburg, Germany, we invented an ERAS protocol for patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac valve surgery. In this retrospective single center study, we aimed to describe the implementation of our ERAS program and to evaluate the results of the first 50 consecutive patients. Our ERAS protocol was developed according to a modified Kern cycle by an expert group, literature search, protocol creation and pilot implementation in the clinical practice. Data of the first 50 consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac valve surgery were analysed retrospectively. The key features of our multidisciplinary ERAS protocol are physiotherapeutic prehabilitation, minimally invasive valve surgery techniques, modified cardiopulmonary bypass management, fast-track anaesthesia with on- table extubation and early mobilisation. A total of 50 consecutive patients (mean age of 51.9+-11.9 years, mean STS score of 0.6+-0.3) underwent minimally-invasive mitral or aortic valve surgery. The adherence to the ERAS protocol was high and neither protocol related complications nor in-hospital mortality occurred. 12% of the patients developed postoperative atrial fibrillation, postoperative delirium emerged in two patients and reintubation was required in one patient. Intensive care unit stay was 14.0+-7.4 hours and total hospital stay 6.2+-2.9 days. Our ERAS protocol is feasible and safe in minimally-invasive cardiac surgery setting and has a clear potential to improve patients outcome.
