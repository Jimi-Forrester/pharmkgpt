33583100|a|INTRODUCTION: Convenient, cost-effective tests for amyloid beta (Abeta) are needed to identify those at higher risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review evaluates recent models that predict dichotomous Abeta. (PROSPERO: CRD42020144734). METHODS: We searched Embase and identified 73 studies from 29,581 for review. We assessed study quality using established tools, extracted information, and reported results narratively. RESULTS: We identified few high-quality studies due to concerns about Abeta determination and analytical issues. The most promising convenient, inexpensive classifiers consist of age, apolipoprotein E genotype, cognitive measures, and/or plasma Abeta. Plasma Abeta may be sufficient if pre-analytical variables are standardized and scalable assays developed. Some models lowered costs associated with clinical trial recruitment or clinical screening. DISCUSSION: Conclusions about models are difficult due to study heterogeneity and quality. Promising prediction models used demographic, cognitive/neuropsychological, imaging, and plasma Abeta measures. Further studies using standardized Abeta determination, and improved model validation are required.
