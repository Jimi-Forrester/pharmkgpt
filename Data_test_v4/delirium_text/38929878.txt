38929878|t|Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis of Older Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Requiring Mechanical Ventilation.
38929878|a|An older age is associated with severe progression and poor prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and mechanical ventilation is often required. The specific characteristics of older patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and their prognostic factors are largely unknown. We aimed to identify potential prognostic factors in this group to inform treatment decisions. This retrospective cohort study collected data from patients with COVID-19 at 22 medical centers. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess factors that influence mortality. We allocated 434 patients in geriatric (>=80 years) and elderly (65-79 years) groups. The former group scored significantly higher than the elderly group in the clinical frailty scale and sequential organ failure assessment, indicating more severe organ dysfunction. Significantly lower administration rates of tocilizumab and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and higher intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality were noted in the geriatric group. The factors associated with ICU and in-hospital mortality included high creatinine levels, the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, prone positioning, and the administration of life-sustaining treatments. These results highlight significant age-related differences in the management and prognosis of critically ill older patients with COVID-19. Increased mortality rates and organ dysfunction in geriatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation necessitate age-appropriate treatment strategies to improve their prognoses.
