38338331|a|Excess cortisol release is associated with numerous health concerns, including psychiatric issues (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depression) and nonpsychiatric issues (i.e., osteoporosis). The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro inhibition of cortisol release, bioaccessibility, and bioavailability exerted by a chemically characterized Scutellaria lateriflora L. extract (SLE). The treatment of H295R cells with SLE at increasing, noncytotoxic, concentrations (5-30 ng/mL) showed significant inhibition of cortisol release ranging from 58 to 91%. The in vitro simulated gastric, duodenal, and gastroduodenal digestions, induced statistically significant reductions (p < 0.0001) in the bioactive polyphenolic compounds that most represented SLE. Bioavailability studies on duodenal digested SLE, using Caco-2 cells grown on transwell inserts and a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay, indicated oroxylin A glucuronide and oroxylin A were the only bioactive compounds able to cross the Caco-2 cell membrane and the artificial lipid membrane, respectively. The results suggest possible applications of SLE as a food supplement ingredient against cortisol-mediated stress response and the use of gastroresistant oral dosage forms to partially prevent the degradation of SLE bioactive compounds. In vivo studies and clinical trials remain necessary to draw a conclusion on the efficacy and tolerability of this plant extract.
