32235558|a|Among the hundreds of reported Achillea species, A. membranacea (Labill.) DC. is one of the six that grow in Jordan. Many species of this genus are used in folk medicine to treat a variety of ailments and several biological and pharmacological activities have been ascribed to their essential oil (EO). For this study, the EO obtained from a specimen of A. membranacea grown in Jordan was analyzed by GC-MS. Ninety-six compounds were detected, of which oxygenated monoterpenes was the predominant class (47.9%), followed by non-terpene derivatives (27.9%), while sesquiterpenes represented 14.2% of the total composition. The most abundant compound in the EO was 1,8-cineole (21.7%). The cytotoxic activity of the EO was evaluated against three cancer cell lines (MCF7, A2780 and HT29), and one normal fibroblast cell line (MRC5) by MTT assay. Significant growth inhibition was observed in EO-exposed A2780 and HT29 cells (IC50 = 12.99 and 14.02 mug/mL, respectively), while MCF7 and MRC5 were less susceptible. The EO induced apoptosis and increased the preG1 events in A2780 cells. 1,8-Cineole, the major constituent of the EO, exhibited submicromolar cytotoxicity against A2780 cells, and was 42 times more selective against MRC5 cells. Its cytotoxicity against A2780 cells was comparable with that of doxorubicin, but 1,8-cineole was more selective for MRC5 normal cells. Interestingly, 1,8-cineole enhanced apoptosis in A2780, and caused a remarkable dose-dependent increase in preG1 events. Thus, 1,8-cineole has demonstrated promising cytotoxic and proapoptotic properties.
