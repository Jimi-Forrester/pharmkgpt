11825528|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the polymorphic alleles of dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DLST) gene cDNA at position A19117G in intron 13 and C19183T in exon 14 and the risk for sporandic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). METHODS: The polymorphism of DLST gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques in 105 patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease and 109 normal controls. RESULTS: The frequency of AT/AC genotype was found to be significantly higher in SAD patients (21%) than in controls (10%) with an odds ratio of 2.36 (P < 0.05). The frequencies of AC/AC, AT/AT genotypes and AC allele were slightly decreased in cases with SAD as compared with controls. While the frequencies of the GC/GC genotype and GC allele were slightly higher in SAD patients than in controls. However, these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The AT/AC genotype of DLST gene is associated with an increased risk for SAD.
