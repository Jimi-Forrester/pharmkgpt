40000934|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on agitation and inflammatory response during recovery from anesthesia in young children following cochlear implantation surgery. METHODS: We randomly divided 80 children who underwent unilateral cochlear implantation into two equal groups. Group D received an intravenous infusion of Dex after induction of anesthesia, while those in group C received an equal volume of saline infusion. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of children in the two groups were recorded at four different time intervals: before induction of anesthesia (T0); 30 min after intravenous infusion of Dex (T1); upon admission to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (T2); and at the time of being transferred out of the PACU (T3). At T3, we also recorded general information. RESULTS: The MAP and HR in group D showed more consistent trends during the anesthesia recovery period when compared to those in group C. Children in group D had a significantly lower crying, requires increased O2 administration, increased vital signs, expression and sleepless score (CRIES score), pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) score, and incidence of agitation than in group C (P < 0.01). The rate of supplementary pain relief for the children was lower in group D than in group C (P < 0.01). At T3, serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were lower in children in group D than in group C (P < 0.01). Compared to T0, the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha were higher in both groups at T3 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We found that the use of Dex helped reduce the occurrence and severity of agitation during anesthesia recovery in children after cochlear implantation surgery and improved postoperative inflammatory reactions.
