26005710|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have explored the association between renal function and major subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The sample was from the Einstein Aging Study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated in mL/min/1.73m2 units) was classified into low (<45), moderate (45-59) and high (>=60). Separate binary logistic regression models were run to determine if eGFR is associated withamnestic MCI (aMCI) and dysexecutive MCI (dMCI). RESULTS: Out of 622 eligible participants 65 (10.5%) had low eGFR, 43 (7.1%) had aMCI, and 46 (7.6) had dMCI. Low eGFR was independently associated with dMCI and aMCI in fully adjusted models. CONCLUSION: At cross-section low eGFR is associated with a higher risk of both dMCI and aMCI. eGFR may contribute to the development of these cognitive states directly. Alternatively, low eGFR may be a marker for risk factors that influence both the kidney and the brain, such as coronary microvascular disease.
