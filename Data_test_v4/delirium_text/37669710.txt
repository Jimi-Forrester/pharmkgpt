37669710|a|There is a growing body of evidence about the potential of diet and nutrients to improve the population's mental health and the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Some studies have suggested that resveratrol has therapeutic properties in mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and autism. In addition, resveratrol is known to induce several benefits modulated by multiple synergistic pathways, which control oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. This review collects the currently available data from animal and human studies and discusses the potential mechanisms of action of resveratrol in prevention and therapy for psychiatric disorders.
