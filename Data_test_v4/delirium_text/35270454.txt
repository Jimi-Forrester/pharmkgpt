35270454|t|A Successful Outcome of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Obese Patients with Respiratory Failure in the Course of COVID-19: A Report of Two Cases.
35270454|a|The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with respiratory failure in the course of COVID-19 indicates its limited efficacy and high mortality rates. It seems that one of the conditions for the success of veno-venous ECMO (VV ECMO) in obese patients with COVID-19 is the correct qualification and rapid implementation of this method. We present two cases of obese patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the successful use of ECMO. Two 41-year-old obese patients (Case 1: BMI 31.5 kg/m2 and Case 2: 44.5 kg/m2), with pneumonia and severe respiratory failure in the course of COVID-19, underwent ECMO therapy. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guidelines were used to qualify the patients. Due to the persistence of PaO2/FiO2 rate <80 for 6 h, a decision was made to implement VV ECMO. Both patients were discharged from the intensive care unit (Case 1: on day 35; Case 2: on day 22). Rapid implementation of VV ECMO in middle-aged, obese patients with ARDS in the course of COVID-19 showed a positive outcome.
