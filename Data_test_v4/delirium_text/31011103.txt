31011103|t|Patients with Clinically Suspected but Unproven Hip Fractures, Who Require Cross-Sectional Imaging, Are Best Initially Admitted under Geriatrician-Led Care-A Retrospective Review.
31011103|a|Patients with suspected hip fractures who require further imaging to confirm or disprove the diagnosis may be admitted to orthopaedic or medical departments. We aim to provide evidence regarding the appropriate admission pathway for such patients. This is a retrospective study of all suspected hip fracture patients receiving second-line imaging between 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2016 in one hospital trust. Information was gained from hospital records to determine indication and result of imaging, eventual diagnoses, length of stay, and inpatient mortality. During the study period, 126 patients underwent cross-sectional imaging for clinically suspected but unproven hip fractures. Of these, 27% were positive for hip fractures (n = 34, 3.2% of hip fracture admissions) whilst the remainder were negative. Of the patients without hip fractures, 50 (54%) had a concomitant medical discharge diagnosis. Thirty-one different diagnoses were found in this cohort. This research provides evidence for geriatrician-led admission of patients with suspected but unproven hip fracture, due to the frailty and medical requirements of this patient group.
