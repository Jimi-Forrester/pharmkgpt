37170683|t|Rationally Design and Acoustically Assemble Human Cerebral Cortex-like Microtissues from hiPSC-derived Neural Progenitors and Neurons.
37170683|a|Development of human biologically relevant and clinically relevant cerebral cortex models is demanded by mechanistic studies of human cerebral cortex-associated neurological diseases and discovery of preclinical neurological drug candidates. Here, we demonstrated rational design of human sourced brain-like cortical tissue models by reverse engineering and bionic design. To implement this design, we employed acoustic assembly technique to assemble hiPSC-derived neural progenitors and neurons separately in a label-free and contact-free manner followed by subsequent neural differentiation and culture. The generated microtissues encapsulated neuronal microanatomy of human cerebral-cortex tissue that contained six-layered neuronal architecture, 400-micrometer interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, we infected these microtissues with HSV-1 virus and determined the HSV-induced pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease, including neuron loss and the expression of Abeta. Overall, we provided a high-fidelity human-relevant in vitro histotypic models for cerebral cortex, and these models will facilitate wide applications in probing the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and screening the candidates of neuroprotective agents.
