37202145|a|OBJECTIVE: Hip fracture is a prevalent condition with a significant death rate among the elderly. We sought to develop a nomogram-based survival prediction model for older patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study. SETTING: The data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III V.1.4). PARTICIPANTS: The clinical features of elderly patients with hip fracture, including basic information, comorbidities, severity score, laboratory tests and therapy, were filtered out based on the MIMIC-III V.1.4. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients included in the study were from critical care and randomly divided into training and validation sets (7:3). On the basis of retrieved data, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify independent predictive variables of 1-year mortality, and then constructed a risk prediction nomogram. The predictive values of the nomogram model were evaluated by the concordance indexes (C-indexes), receiver operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curve. RESULTS: A total of 341 elderly patients with hip fracture were included in this study; 121 cases died within 1 year. After LASSO regression and multiple logistic regression analysis, a novel nomogram contained the predictive variables of age, weight, the proportion of lymphocyte count, liver disease, malignant tumour and congestive heart failure. The constructed model proved satisfactory discrimination with C-indexes of 0.738 (95% CI 0.674 to 0.802) in the training set and 0.713 (95% CI 0.608 to 0.819) in the validation set. The calibration curve shows a good degree of fitting between the predicted and observed probabilities and the DCA confirms the model's clinical practicability. CONCLUSIONS: The novel prediction model provides personalised predictions for 1-year mortality in elderly patients with hip fractures. Compared with other hip fracture models, our nomogram is particularly suitable for predicting long-term mortality in critical patients.
