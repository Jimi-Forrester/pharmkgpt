33083728|t|Hippocampal 7alpha-Hydroxylated Neurosteroids Are Raised by Training and Bolster Remote Spatial Memory with Increase of the Spine Densities.
33083728|a|Neuroactive steroids, termed neurosteroids, are synthesized locally in the brain and influence biological functions including cognition and behavior. These neurosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol by a series of cytochrome P450 enzymes, among which a member of P450 hydroxylase, cytochrome P450-7b1 (CYP7B1), catalyzes the formation of 7alpha-hydroxylated neurosteroids, 7alpha-hydroxypregnenolone (7alpha-OH-Preg) and 7alpha-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone (7alpha-OH-DHEA). Here we demonstrated the occurrence of these neurosteroids in the mouse hippocampus after spatial-learning tasks. Cyp7b1 deficiency impaired remote spatial memory with recent memory mostly unaffected. The hippocampal dendritic spine densities were reduced in Cyp7b1-deficient mice, and they were no more increased by the training. Furthermore, chronic intracerebroventricular administration of a mixture of 7alpha-OH-Preg and 7alpha-OH-DHEA rescued the deteriorated remote memory performance in Cyp7b1-deficient mice. It is concluded that the 7alpha-hydroxylated neurosteroids are required for long-term maintenance of spatial memory, and we suggest that these neurosteroids may induce synaptic remodeling to maintain the hippocampal function.
