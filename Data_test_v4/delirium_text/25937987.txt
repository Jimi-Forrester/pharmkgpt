25937987|a|The barks and leaves extracts of Canarium patentinervium Miq. (Burseraceae Kunth.) were investigated for cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibition via in vitro models. The corresponding antioxidative power of the plant extract was also tested via nonenzyme and enzyme in vitro assays. The ethanolic extract of leaves inhibited the enzymatic activity of 5-LOX, COX-1, and COX-2 with IC50 equal to 49.66 +- 0.02 mug/mL, 0.60 +- 0.01 mug/mL, and 1.07 +- 0.01 mug/mL, respectively, with selective COX-2 activity noted in ethanolic extract of barks with COX-1/COX-2 ratio of 1.22. The ethanol extract of barks confronted oxidation in the ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assay with EC50 values equal to 0.93 +- 0.01 mug/mL, 2.33 +- 0.02 mug/mL, and 67.00 +- 0.32 mug/mL, respectively, while the ethanol extract of leaves confronted oxidation in beta-carotene bleaching assay and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay with EC50 value of 6.04 +- 0.02 mug/mL and IC50 value of 3.05 +- 0.01 mug/mL. The ethanol extract acts as a dual inhibitor of LOX and COX enzymes with potent antioxidant capacity. The clinical significance of these data is quite clear that they support a role for Canarium patentinervium Miq. (Burseraceae Kunth.) as a source of lead compounds in the management of inflammatory diseases.
