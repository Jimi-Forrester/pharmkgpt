37528645|t|Postoperative recovery in preschool-aged children: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing premedication with midazolam, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine.
37528645|a|BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients can worsen postoperative outcomes and delay discharge. Drugs aimed at reducing preoperative anxiety and facilitating postoperative recovery are available; however, their effects on postoperative recovery from propofol-remifentanil anesthesia have not been studied in preschool-aged children. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of three sedative premedications on postoperative recovery from total intravenous anesthesia in children aged 2-6 years. METHODS: In this prespecified secondary analysis of a double-blinded randomized trial, 90 children scheduled for ear, nose, and throat surgery were randomized (1:1:1) to receive sedative premedication: oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg, oral clonidine 4 mug/kg, or intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 mug/kg. Using validated instruments, outcome measures including time for readiness to discharge from the postoperative care unit, postoperative sedation, emergence delirium, anxiety, pain, and nausea/vomiting were measured. RESULTS: After excluding eight children due to drug refusal or deviation from the protocol, 82 children were included in this study. No differences were found between the groups in terms of median time [interquartile range] to readiness for discharge (midazolam, 90 min [48]; clonidine, 80 min [46]; dexmedetomidine 100.5 min [42]). Compared to the midazolam group, logistic regression with a mixed model and repeated measures approach found no differences in sedation, less emergence delirium, and less pain in the dexmedetomidine group, and less anxiety in both clonidine and dexmedetomidine groups. CONCLUSIONS: No statistical difference was observed in the postoperative recovery times between the premedication regimens. Compared with midazolam, dexmedetomidine was favorable in reducing both emergence delirium and pain in the postoperative care unit, and both clonidine and dexmedetomidine reduced anxiety in the postoperative care unit. Our results indicated that premedication with alpha2 -agonists had a better recovery profile than short-acting benzodiazepines; although the overall recovery time in the postoperative care unit was not affected.
