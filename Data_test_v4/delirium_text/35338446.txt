35338446|t|Beyond the Glycaemic Control of Dapagliflozin: Microangiopathy and Non-classical Complications.
35338446|a|Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In monotherapy or as an additive therapy, dapagliflozin aids glycaemic control, is associated with reductions in blood pressure and weight, and promotes a favourable lipid profile. In this review, we address the impact of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular risk factors and common microangiopathic complications such as kidney disease and retinopathy in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, we evaluate its potential beneficial effects on other less frequent complications of diabetes, such as macular oedema, cognitive impairment, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and respiratory disorders during sleep. Moreover, the underuse of SGLT2i in clinical practice is discussed. Our goal is to help translate this evidence into clinical practice.
