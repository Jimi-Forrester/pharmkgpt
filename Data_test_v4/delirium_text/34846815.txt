34846815|a|The article presents the results of the first experience of comparative studies of the state of the oral fluid and buccal epithelium in 12 patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and in 12 individuals without any signs of cognitive impairment. In the course of the study, the correlative relationships of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors of the oral fluid, the main cytological changes of the buccal epithelium with the results obtained during neuropsychological testing using the MMSE and ADAS-COG scales were studied. This comparative study is associated with the assumption of a common ectodermal origin of the nervous tissue and buccal epithelium, which may be due to systemic pathological changes in the tissues of a single embryonic embryo leaf. The results obtained indicate the specificity of pathological changes in the oral fluid and buccal epithelium for Alzheimer's disease, which allows us to use the study of these materials to obtain additional diagnostic markers of this disease.
