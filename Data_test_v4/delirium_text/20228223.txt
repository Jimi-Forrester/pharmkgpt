20228223|t|Iowa variant of familial Alzheimer's disease: accumulation of posttranslationally modified AbetaD23N in parenchymal and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits.
20228223|a|Mutations within the amyloid-beta (Abeta) sequence, especially those clustered at residues 21-23, which are linked to early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), are primarily associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The basis for this predominant vascular amyloid burden and the differential clinical phenotypes of cerebral hemorrhage/stroke in some patients and dementia in others remain unknown. The AbetaD23N Iowa mutation is associated with progressive AD-like dementia, often without clinically manifested intracerebral hemorrhage. Neuropathologically, the disease is characterized by predominant preamyloid deposits, severe CAA, and abundant neurofibrillary tangles in the presence of remarkably few mature plaques. Biochemical analyses using a combination of immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, amino acid sequence, and Western blot analysis performed after sequential tissue extractions to separately isolate soluble components, preamyloid, and fibrillar amyloid species indicated that the Iowa deposits are complex mixtures of mutated and nonmutated Abeta molecules. These molecules exhibited various degrees of solubility, were highly heterogeneous at both the N- and C-termini, and showed partial aspartate isomerization at positions 1, 7, and 23. This collection of Abeta species-the Iowa brain Abeta peptidome-contained clear imprints of amyloid clearance mechanisms yet highlighted the unique neuropathological features shared by a non-Abeta cerebral amyloidosis, familial Danish dementia, in which neurofibrillary tangles coexist with extensive pre-amyloid deposition in the virtual absence of fibrillar lesions. These data therefore challenge the importance of neuritic plaques as the sole contributors for the development of dementia.
