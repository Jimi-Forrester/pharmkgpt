29343034|a|Objective: To investigate and compare the effect and safety of nasal high-flow oxygen therapy (HFNCO) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) therapy after extubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: All COPD patients subjected to mechanical ventilation in the Emergency Intensive Unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University during January 2015 to June 2016 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups after extubation and HFNCO and NIV were adopted on each group respectively. Clinical indexes including the patients' general condition, blood gas analysis and pulmonary function before and after extubation, ratio of re-intubation and CT grades were collected and analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in the incidence of aspiration (4.8% vs 8.3%), pressure sores (0 vs 8.3%) and delirium (4.8% vs 12.5%) between the two groups (all P>0.05). At 12 h after extubation, the oxygenation index of NIV group was significantly higher than that of the HFNCO group (265+-29 vs 297+-33; P<0.05), while no significant difference in PCO(2) (P>0.05). For 24 h and 72 h after extubation, there was no statistically significant difference in oxygenation index and PCO(2) between the both groups (P>0.05). The intensive care unit (ICU) retention time in HFNCO group was significantly lower than that in NIV group (13.7+-0.8 vs 15.2+-0.5; P<0.05). In addition, no significant difference between the two groups in mortality and re-intubation rate at 28 d (P>0.05) was observed. Conclusion: HFNCO is effective and safe in the treatment of COPD patients after extubation, and it is hence valuable for further clinical application.
