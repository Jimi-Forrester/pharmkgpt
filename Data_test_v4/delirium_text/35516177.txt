35516177|t|A dual-sensitized luminescent europium(iii) complex as a photoluminescent probe for selectively detecting Fe3.
35516177|a|A new luminescent EuIII complex, namely [Eu2(BTFA)4(OMe)2(dpq)2] (1), in which BTFA = 3-benzoyl-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone and dpq = dipyrido [3,2-d:2',3'-f] quinoxaline, has been designed and synthesized by employing two different ligands as sensitizers. Crystal structure analysis reveals that complex 1 is composed of dinuclear EuIII units crystallized in the monoclinic P1 space group. Notably, 1 exhibits high thermal stability up to 270  C and excellent water stability. The photoluminescence property of the complex is investigated. Further studies show 1 can recognize Fe3+ ions with high selectivity from mixed metal ions in aqueous solution through the luminescence quenching phenomenon. Furthermore, the recyclability and stability of 1 after sensing experiments are observed to be adequate. By virtue of the superior stability, detection efficiency, applicability and reusability, the as-prepared EuIII complex can be a promising fluorescent material for practical sensing.
