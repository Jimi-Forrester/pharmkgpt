31565158|t|Nutrients in the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.
31565158|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms, some of which are still not fully understood. To date, pharmacological treatments and supplementation of individual nutrients have been poorly effective in terms of the prevention and treatment of AD, while alternative strategies based on multimodal approaches (diet, exercise, and cognitive training) seem to be more promising. In this context, the focus on dietary patterns rather than on single food components could be more useful in preventing or counteracting the pathological processes typical of AD, thanks to the potential synergistic effects of various nutrients (neuronutrients). The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the currently existing preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which are three dietary patterns with well-known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, they have been related to brain protection and AD prevention, perhaps thanks to their high content of neuroprotective bioactive compounds. Similarly, intermittent fasting (IF) or calorie restriction (CR) is emerging as interesting approaches that seem to promote hippocampal neurogenesis, activate adaptive stress response systems, and enhance neuronal plasticity, thus leading to motor and cognitive improvements in animal models of AD and hopefully also in human beings.
