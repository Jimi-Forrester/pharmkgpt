38640294|a|Some patients with heatstroke also experience intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, clinical case reports of heatstroke-induced ICH are rare. The risk factors for cerebral hemorrhage after heatstroke remain unknown. The present study evaluated the clinical characteristics and risk factors of patients with heatstroke-related ICH. In this retrospective observational study, we collected data on all ICHs after heatstroke occurred between 2012 and 2022. The characteristics of patients with heatstroke-induced ICH were described. The risk factors for cerebral hemorrhage after heatstroke were examined using logistic regression analysis. In total, 177 patients were included in this study, and 11 patients with ICH secondary to heatstroke were identified. Variables with P values of <.05 in univariate models, comparing the cerebral hemorrhage and control groups, included heatstroke cause, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation use, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, total bilirubin, creatinine, platelet count, prothrombin time, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurrence, and DIC score. Multivariate logistic regression showed that heatstroke patients with higher DIC scores (odds ratio, 18.402, 95% confidence interval, 1.384-244.763, P = .027) and higher creatine kinase levels (odds ratio, 1.021, 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.041, P = .033) were at a higher risk of developing ICH. The death rate was higher in the cerebral hemorrhage group than in the control group (P = .042). Heatstroke-related cerebral hemorrhage may be associated with elevated creatinine levels and DIC severity (International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis score) after heatstroke, and heatstroke with cerebral hemorrhage may accelerate death.
