36938369|a|Objective: This study aimed to predict nasogastric tube (NGT) removal in patients with poststroke dysphagia (PSD) by non-swallowing function assessment. Methods: We enrolled 232 eligible patients and performed rehabilitation. The Fugl-Meyer assessment motor (FMM) and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were used to measure the motor and overall nervous system functions. Predictors for NGT removal in patients with PSD after rehabilitation were analyzed. Results: Of the 232 included patients, the NGTs were removed from 78% of them, while 22% were dependent on a feeding tube after 4 weeks of rehabilitation. Compared to the preserved NGT group, older age, a higher rate of intubation or tracheostomy, and more severe baseline functions were found in the NGT removal group. Age [odds ratio (OR) = 0.907; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.859-0.957; p = 0.000], difference in the FMM score after 4 weeks of rehabilitation (OR = 1.219; 95% CI: 1.145-1.299; p = 0.00), and item 9 of NIHSS (OR = 0.488; 95% CI: 0.252-0.946; p = 0.034) were predictors of NGT removal after rehabilitation. Conclusion: We established a predictive model in patients with PSD using a non-swallowing assessment, which enabled us to predict swallowing recovery based on the non-swallowing function.
