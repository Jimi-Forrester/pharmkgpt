35210763|a|PURPOSE: Osteoporotic hip fracture surgery is associated with a risk of morbidity and mortality. Admission hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL have been documented as a strong predictor of mortality risk. This study aimed to investigate the mortality outcome between osteoporotic hip fracture patients who had preoperative hemoglobin levels raised to >=10 g/dL and those with hemoglobin levels were <10 g/dL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 5-year retrospective observational study included 226 participants with osteoporotic hip fractures that required surgery and who had admission hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL. Patients were categorized into two groups: those with corrected preoperative hemoglobin >=10 g/dL and those with either corrected or uncorrected preoperative hemoglobin <10 g/dL. Outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression adjusted for confounders. Results are presented as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: Among 226 the patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.25% (n=39/226) of the 226 patients, 93 (41.15%) had their hemoglobin levels raised to >=10 g/dL by red blood cell transfusion. Multivariable analysis after adjustment for confounders showed a 50% lower incidence of mortality among patients with preoperative hemoglobin levels >=10 g/dL than among those with hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL (HR 0.50, 95% CI (0.25-0.99), p=0.048). CONCLUSION: In osteoporotic hip fracture patients with admission hemoglobin <10g/dL, raising preoperative hemoglobin levels to >=10 g/dL can significantly reduce the risk of mortality. Testing for and correction of low preoperative hemoglobin levels is of value in hip surgery patients.
