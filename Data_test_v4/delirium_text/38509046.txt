38509046|t|Prolonged Hourly Neurologic Examinations are Associated with Increased Delirium and No Discernible Benefit in Mild/Moderate Geriatric Traumatic Brain Injury.
38509046|a|BACKGROUND: Serial neurologic examinations (NE) are routinely recommended in the ICU within the first 24 hours following a TBI. There are currently no widely accepted guidelines for the frequency of NE. Disruptions to the sleep-wake cycles increase the delirium rate. We aimed to evaluate whether there is a correlation between prolonged Q1-NE and development of delirium and to determine if this practice reduces the likelihood of missing the detection of a process requiring emergent intervention. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with mild/moderate TBI, admitted to the ICU with serial-NE. Cohorts were stratified by the duration of exposure to Q1-NE, into Prolonged(>=24 h) and Not Prolonged(<24 h). Our primary outcomes of interest was delirium, evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU), radiological progression from baseline images, neurological deterioration (focal neurological deficit, abnormal pupillary exam, or GCS decrease >2), and neurosurgical procedures. RESULTS: A total of 522 patients were included. No significant differences were found in demographics. Patients in the Prolonged Q1-NE group (26.1%) had higher ISS with similar AIS Head, and significantly higher delirium rate [59% vs 35%, p < .001], and a longer Hospital/ICU length of stay when compared to the Not Prolonged Q1-NE group. No neurosurgical interventions were found to be performed emergently as a result of findings on NE. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Prolonged Q1-NE was the only independent risk factor associated with a 2.5-fold increase in delirium rate. The Number Needed to Harm for prolonged Q1-NE was 4. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients with mild/moderate TBI exposed to Q1-NE for periods longer than 24 h had nearly a 3-fold increase in ICU-Delirium rate. One out of five patients exposed to prolonged Q1-NE is harmed by the development of delirium. No patients were found to directly benefit as a result of more frequent neurological examinations.
