37762370|t|Hemorrhagic Transformation of Ischemic Strokes.
37762370|a|Ischemic stroke, resulting from insufficient blood supply to the brain, is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. A potentially severe complication of the disease itself or its treatment aiming to restore optimal blood flow is hemorrhagic transformation (HT) increasing morbidity and mortality. Detailed summaries can be found in the literature on the pathophysiological background of hemorrhagic transformation, the potential clinical risk factors increasing its chance, and the different biomarkers expected to help in its prediction and clinical outcome. Clinicopathological studies also contribute to the improvement in our knowledge of hemorrhagic transformation. We summarized the clinical risk factors of the hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic strokes in terms of risk reduction and collected the most promising biomarkers in the field. Also, auxiliary treatment options in reperfusion therapies have been reviewed and collected. We highlighted that the optimal timing of revascularization treatment for carefully selected patients and the individualized management of underlying diseases and comorbidities are pivotal. Another important conclusion is that a more intense clinical follow-up including serial cranial CTs for selected patients can be recommended, as clinicopathological investigations have shown HT to be much more common than clinically suspected.
