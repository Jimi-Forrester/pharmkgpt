38587698|t|HAT and HDAC: Enzyme with Contradictory Action in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38587698|a|In view of the increasing risk of neurodegenerative diseases, epigenetics plays a fundamental role in the field of neuroscience. Several modifications have been studied including DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone phosphorylation, etc. Histone acetylation and deacetylation regulate gene expression, and the regular activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) provides regulatory stages for gene expression and cell cycle. Imbalanced homeostasis in these enzymes causes a detrimental effect on neurophysiological function. Intriguingly, epigenetic remodelling via histone acetylation in certain brain areas has been found to play a key role in the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. It has been demonstrated that a number of HATs have a role in crucial brain processes such regulating neuronal plasticity and memory formation. The most recent therapeutic methods involve the use of small molecules known as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that antagonize HDAC activity thereby increase acetylation levels in order to prevent the loss of HAT function in neurodegenerative disorders. The target specificity of the HDAC inhibitors now in use raises concerns about their applicability, despite the fact that this strategy has demonstrated promising therapeutic outcomes. The aim of this review is to summarize the cross-linking between histone modification and its regulation in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Furthermore, these findings also support the notion of new pharmacotherapies that target particular areas of the brain using histone deacetylase inhibitors.
