33003078|t|Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of the ABCDE Bundle: Impact of Bundle Adherence on Inpatient and 1-Year Mortality and Costs of Care.
33003078|a|OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence supports the Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management, and Early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle processes as improving a number of short- and long-term clinical outcomes for patients requiring ICU care. To assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, we determined the impact of ABCDE bundle adherence on inpatient and 1-year mortality, quality-adjusted life-years, length of stay, and costs of care. DESIGN: We conducted a 2-year, prospective, cost-effectiveness study in 12 adult ICUs in six hospitals belonging to a large, integrated healthcare delivery system. SETTING: Hospitals included a large, urban tertiary referral center and five community hospitals. ICUs included medical/surgical, trauma, neurologic, and cardiac care units. PATIENTS: The study included 2,953 patients, 18 years old or older, with an ICU stay greater than 24 hours, who were on a ventilator for more than 24 hours and less than 14 days. INTERVENTION: ABCDE bundle. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used propensity score-adjusted regression models to determine the impact of high bundle adherence on inpatient mortality, discharge status, length of stay, and costs. A Markov model was used to estimate the potential effect of improved bundle adherence on healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-years in the year following ICU admission. We found that patients with high ABCDE bundle adherence (>= 60%) had significantly decreased odds of inpatient mortality (odds ratio 0.28) and significantly higher costs ($3,920) of inpatient care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of high bundle adherence was $15,077 (95% CI, $13,675-$16,479) per life saved and $1,057 per life-year saved. High bundle adherence was associated with a 0.12 increase in quality-adjusted life-years, a $4,949 increase in 1-year care costs, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $42,120 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: The ABCDE bundle appears to be a cost-effective means to reduce in-hospital and 1-year mortality for patients with an ICU stay.
