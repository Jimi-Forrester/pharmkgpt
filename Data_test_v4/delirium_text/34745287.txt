34745287|t|Biological Functions of Diallyl Disulfide, a Garlic-Derived Natural Organic Sulfur Compound.
34745287|a|Garlic is widely accepted as a functional food and an excellent source of pharmacologically active ingredients. Diallyl disulfide (DADS), a major bioactive component of garlic, has several beneficial biological functions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardiovascular protective, neuroprotective, and anticancer activities. This review systematically evaluated the biological functions of DADS and discussed the underlying molecular mechanisms of these functions. We hope that this review provides guidance and insight into the current literature and enables future research and the development of DADS for intervention and treatment of multiple diseases.
