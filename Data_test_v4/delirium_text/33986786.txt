33986786|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely to have a major impact on society and the economy since the illness is currently infecting a significant number of active workers in the industry and service sectors. The illness can have long-term consequences for patients, affecting their functional capacity and, consequently, their occupational performance. This study analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on occupational health, with a focus on the importance of physical therapy in rehabilitation. An integrative literature review was conducted based on articles retrieved from the PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and occupational health. The search retrieved 1,308 studies, 15 of which met inclusion criteria for the review. A thorough assessment of the articles revealed four topics that corresponded to the results of this study: 1) effects of COVID-19 on occupational health; 2) physical therapy in mild and moderate cases without hospitalization; 3) physical therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; 4) physical therapy in post-intensive care unit (ICU) recovery and after hospital discharge. The findings showed that COVID-19 can affect several physiological systems and have both short- and long-term effects on patients, including physical and psychological impairments. Physical therapists must be involved in the battle against this illness to help patients recover their physical function and return to work as quickly, safely, and effectively as possible.
