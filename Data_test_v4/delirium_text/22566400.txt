22566400|a|Protein misfolding is common to most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Recent work using animal models with intracellular alpha-synuclein and tau inclusions adds decisively to a growing body of evidence that misfolded protein aggregates can induce a self-perpetuating process that leads to amplification and spreading of pathological protein assemblies. When coupled with the progressive nature of neurodegeneration, recognition of such cell-to-cell aggregate spread suggests a unifying mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of these disorders.
