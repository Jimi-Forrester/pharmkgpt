35886936|a|Cholesterol metabolism seems dysregulated and linked to amyloid-beta (Abeta) formation in neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly known. Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol with antioxidant activity and neuroprotective properties. Here, we analyzed the effect of age and RSV supplementation on cholesterol metabolism in the brain and blood serum, and its potential link to Abeta processing, in SAMP8 mice-an animal model of aging and Alzheimer's disease. In the brain, our results revealed an age-related increase in ApoE and unesterified cholesterol in the plasma membrane whereas LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA-C1 synthase, and ABCA1 transporter remained unaltered. Furthermore, BACE-1 and APP gene expression was decreased. This dysregulation could be involved in the amyloidogenic processing pathway of APP towards Abeta formation. In turn, RSV exhibited an age-dependent effect. While levels of unesterified cholesterol in the plasma membrane were not affected by RSV, several participants in cholesterol uptake, release, and de novo synthesis differed, depending on age. Thus, RSV supplementation exhibited a different neuroprotective effect acting on Abeta processing or cholesterol metabolism in the brain at earlier or later ages, respectively. In blood serum, HDL lipoprotein and free cholesterol were increased by age, whereas VLDL and LDL lipoproteins remained unaltered. Again, the protective effect of RSV by decreasing the LDL or increasing the HDL levels also seems to depend on the intervention's moment. In conclusion, age is a prominent factor for cholesterol metabolism dysregulation in the brain of SAMP8 mice and influences the protective effects of RSV through cholesterol metabolism and Abeta processing.
