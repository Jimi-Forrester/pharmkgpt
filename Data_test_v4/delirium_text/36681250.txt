36681250|a|Necroptosis, a regulated form of cell death, is involved in the genesis and development of various life-threatening diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, cardiac myopathy, and diabetes. Necroptosis initiates with the formation and activation of a necrosome complex, which consists of RIPK1, RIPK2, RIPK3, and MLKL. Emerging studies has demonstrated the regulation of the necroptosis cell death pathway through the implication of numerous post-translational modifications, namely ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation, hydroxylation, and others. In addition, the negative regulation of the necroptosis pathway has been shown to interfere with brain homeostasis through the regulation of axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dynamics, lysosomal defects, and inflammatory response. Necroptosis is controlled by the activity and expression of signaling molecules, namely VEGF/VEGFR, PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), ERK/MAPK, and Wnt/beta-catenin. Herein, we briefly discussed the implication and potential of necrosome activation in the pathogenesis and progression of neurological manifestations, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and others. Further, we present a detailed picture of natural compounds, micro-RNAs, and chemical compounds as therapeutic agents for treating neurological manifestations.
