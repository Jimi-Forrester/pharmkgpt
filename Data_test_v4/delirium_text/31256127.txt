31256127|a|BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate factors that predict progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: We studied the usefulness of quantitative assessment of amyloid burden measured by Florbetapir PET scan. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of aMCI participants older than 65 and those with available Florbetapir PET scan at diagnosis from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). To assess the prognostic impact of amyloid burden, a staging system based on the global SUVr of the PET scan was applied. We defined the stages as: stage I, negative amyloid scan; stage II, positive amyloid in 1st tertile; stage III, positive amyloid in 2nd tertile; and stage IV, positive amyloid in 3rd tertile. RESULTS: Of 250 eligible aMCI subjects (age 74.1+-5.4, female n = 105), 71 (28.4%) were diagnosed with probable AD within 3 years. Higher amyloid stages showed faster cognitive decline by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In multivariate Cox analysis, with stage I as a reference, the hazard ratio (HR) increased as the stage increased: stage II (HR, 4.509; p = 0.015), stage III (HR, 7.616; p = 0.001), and stage IV (HR, 9.421; p < 0.001). Along with amyloid stage, ApoE e4 (HR, 1.943; p = 0.031), score of CDR-SB (HR, 1.845; p < 0.001) and ADAS 11 (HR, 1.144; p < 0.001), and hippocampal volume (HR, 0.002; p = 0.005) were also identified as predictors of dementia progression in aMCI subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Large amyloid burden measured from amyloid PET scan could be a predictor of faster cognitive decline in aMCI patients.
