26043929|a|OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple sclerosis (MS) with delirium as the first presentation. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 34-year-old female was referred to our department with an acute onset of drowsiness, withdrawal from routine activities and aggression, followed by neurologic deficits after a couple of days. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed, leading to the initial diagnosis of MS. A vast range of differential diagnoses was excluded to confirm the diagnosis of MS. CONCLUSION: Neurological examination and appropriate imaging enabled the diagnosis of MS with delirium in this patient followed by the appropriate treatment.
