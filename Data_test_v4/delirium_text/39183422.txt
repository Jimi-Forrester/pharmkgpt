39183422|t|Thyroid dysfunction and risk of different types of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
39183422|a|BACKGROUND: The impact of thyroid function on the risk of various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), remains unclear. This meta-analysis investigates the association between thyroid dysfunction and the risk of these dementia types, aiming to inform strategies for dementia prevention. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to February 2023, focusing on the risk of thyroid dysfunction in dementia. We excluded duplicates, studies without full text, those with incomplete data, animal studies, case reports, and reviews. Data analysis was performed using STATA 15.1 software. RESULTS: Our analysis indicated that overt hyperthyroidism significantly increases the risk of all studied dementia types (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.35). In contrast, overt hypothyroidism was associated with a decreased risk of AD (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.98) and VD (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62-0.82). Subclinical hyperthyroidism also showed a significant association with an increased risk of any dementia (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.09-1.46) and specifically VD (OR = 6.70; 95% CI: 1.38-32.58). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that overt hypothyroidism may reduce the risk of dementia, including AD and VD, whereas overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism are linked to an increased risk. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring thyroid function as a preventative measure against dementia.
