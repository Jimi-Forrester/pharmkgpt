39064669|a|Gestational diet has a long-dated effect not only on the disease risk in offspring but also on the occurrence of future neurological diseases. During ontogeny, changes in the epigenetic state that shape morphological and functional differentiation of several brain areas can affect embryonic fetal development. Many epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs control brain gene expression, both in the course of neurodevelopment and in adult brain cognitive functions. Epigenetic alterations have been linked to neuro-evolutionary disorders with intellectual disability, plasticity, and memory and synaptic learning disorders. Epigenetic processes act specifically, affecting different regions based on the accessibility of chromatin and cell-specific states, facilitating the establishment of lost balance. Recent insights have underscored the interplay between epigenetic enzymes active during embryonic development and the presence of bioactive compounds, such as vitamins and polyphenols. The fruit of Manilkara zapota contains a rich array of these bioactive compounds, which are renowned for their beneficial properties for health. In this review, we delve into the action of each bioactive micronutrient found in Manilkara zapota, elucidating their roles in those epigenetic mechanisms crucial for neuronal development and programming. Through a comprehensive understanding of these interactions, we aim to shed light on potential avenues for harnessing dietary interventions to promote optimal neurodevelopment and mitigate the risk of neurological disorders.
