34316168|t|A New ICU Delirium Prevention Bundle to Reduce the Incidence of Delirium: A Randomized Parallel Group Trial.
34316168|a|INTRODUCTION: Although various preventive strategies have been advocated, delirium is common in critically ill patients and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and long-term adverse effects. The efficacy of a novel delirium prevention bundle in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients was investigated in this study. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 50 mechanically ventilated adult patients in a tertiary care medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) were randomized to receive either delirium prevention bundle protocol or standard of care protocol. Delirium was assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) score by an independent investigator up to 28 days or death or discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence of new-onset delirium. Secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS), hospital LOS, and other adverse events. RESULTS: There was a 20% reduction in the incidence of delirium in the intervention group (36 vs 56%; p = 0.156). The 28-day mortality (28 vs 24%; p = 0.747), duration of mechanical ventilation (9 vs 12 days; p = 0.281), ICU-LOS (11 vs 12 days; p = 0.221), and hospital LOS (16 vs 20 days; p = 0.062) were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: Implementation of delirium prevention bundle does not reduce the incidence of delirium compared to standard of care protocol in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.
