32999728|t|Galapagosization of sepsis management in Japan: a nationwide survey of current practices.
32999728|a|AIM: Sepsis treatment has been standardized in many countries worldwide. However, treatment of sepsis in Japan has developed independently, and how Japanese physicians actually treat sepsis patients nationwide remains uninvestigated. The aim of this study was to clarify the current practice for septic patients in Japan and how it differs from standard care throughout the world. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective, cross-sectional, self-reported questionnaire- and Web-based electronic survey in Japan. The survey was undertaken to assess respondents' clinical practices and preferences regarding treatment strategies, sepsis assessment, and management in the setting of critical illness. An exploratory factor analysis and a hierarchical cluster analysis were carried out to identify the treatments distinctive to Japan, called "Galapagos therapies". RESULTS: The final analysis included 295 respondents. According to the factor analysis, we defined anticoagulant therapy for disseminated intravascular coagulation, antimediator renal replacement therapy, and others as Galapagos therapies. These Galapagos therapies were undertaken by approximately two-thirds of the Japanese physicians who responded. We classified Japanese physicians according to three patterns of clinical practice carried out for sepsis: (i) those who do not perform Galapagos therapies but do perform worldwide standardized care, (ii) those who perform Galapagos therapies on top of worldwide standardized care, (iii) those who do not perform worldwide standardized care. CONCLUSION: On the basis of a nationwide questionnaire-based survey in Japan, we clarified distinctive sepsis treatments performed in Japan, such as antimediator renal replacement therapy and treatment for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.
