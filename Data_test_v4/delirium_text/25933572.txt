25933572|t|A case of nicotine withdrawal delirium.
25933572|a|Nicotine withdrawal is not a well recognized cause of delirium. A few published cases are on post-operative, terminally ill cancer or neuro-intensive care unit patients. Because of the high incidence of morbidity and mortality of delirium it is important to identify and treat delirium promptly and effectively. We report a case of delirium after sudden cessation of smoking in a heavy smoker, with schizophrenia, hospitalized for stabilization of psychiatric illness.
