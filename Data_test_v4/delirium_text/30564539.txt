30564539|t|Depression and Catatonia: A Case of Neuropsychiatric Complications of Moyamoya Disease.
30564539|a|Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare idiopathic cerebrovascular disease most common among the Asian population. Studies have shown that patients with MMD are at increased risk for developing psychiatric complications. We present a patient with hemorrhagic MMD (RNF213 gene mutation) who developed depression and catatonia over time following MMD-related strokes. While no guidelines exist for the management of such an uncommon scenario, it at least requires an interdepartmental approach. Our report highlights the medical complications of untreated MMD and its neuropsychiatric association with depression and catatonia.
