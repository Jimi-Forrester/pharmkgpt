36831041|t|Stem Cell Therapies in Movement Disorders: Lessons from Clinical Trials.
36831041|a|Stem cell-based therapies (SCT) to treat neurodegenerative disorders have promise but clinical trials have only recently begun, and results are not expected for several years. While most SCTs largely lead to a symptomatic therapeutic effect by replacing lost cell types, there may also be disease-modifying therapeutic effects. In fact, SCT may complement a multi-drug, subtype-specific therapeutic approach, consistent with the idea of precision medicine, which matches molecular therapies to biological subtypes of disease. In this narrative review, we examine published and ongoing trials in SCT in Parkinson's Disease, atypical parkinsonian disorders, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxia in humans. We discuss the benefits and pitfalls of using this treatment approach within the spectrum of disease-modification efforts in neurodegenerative diseases. SCT may hold greater promise in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, but much research is required to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of these complementary aims of therapeutic efforts.
