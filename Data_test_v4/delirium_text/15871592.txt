15871592|a|Many patients go through traumatic experiences in response to surgery, illness, or prolonged hospitalizations. The medicines and anesthesia they are introduced to, as well as metabolic changes and withdrawal from substances, often cause negative effects on their psyche. Some of these effects take the form of depression, psychosis, or delirium. Additionally, patients with preexisting dementia are often exacerbated by the hospitalization, causing increased confusion and agitation. Although generally reversible, it is important for healthcare practitioners to explore nonpharmacologic alternatives and reexamine the power of milieu therapy in the general medical setting.
