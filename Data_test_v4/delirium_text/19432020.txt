19432020|a|Despite the high prevalence of malnutrition among elderly patients, nutritional problems are still not recognized as a priority forthem by health professionals. The need for nutritional assessment and intervention is particularly crucial in this age group, in whom the incidence of chronic illness is high and a myriad of socio-economic factors enhance the likelihood of malnutrition. Malnutrition could be considered as an element of frailty among the old, leading to increased risk of many geriatric syndromes such as falls, delirium, functional decline, depressed immunity, etcetera. However, detection of nutritional risk and nutritional intervention are effective in frail patients. Nutritional assessment should be part of routine clinical practice in elderly hospitalized patients. A comprehensive screening tool for assessment of nutritional status that is clinically relevant and cost effective to perform is therefore needed. If malnutrition is suggested by such screening tests, then a supplemental conventional nutritional assessment should be performed before treatment is planned.
