31244434|t|Co-ultraPEALut: Role in Preclinical and Clinical Delirium Manifestations.
31244434|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a disorder in awareness, attention and cognition. Pathophysiologically it is a response to stress. Postoperative delirium (POD) is a usual complication in aged patients following hip fracture surgery. Neuroinflammation is an important factor linked with the progress of POD. Though there are no efficient cures for delirium the endocannabinoid system may have a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we examined the effects of co-ultramicronized PEALut (co-ultraPEALut) in the LPS murine model of delirium and in elderly hip fractured patients. METHODS: In the preclinical study, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with Escherichia coli LPS (10 mg/kg). Co-ultraPEALut (1 mg/kg o.s.) was administered 1h before LPS injection or 1h and 6h after LPS injection or 1h before LPS injection and 1h and 6h after LPS. In the clinical study, the effects of Glialia  (co-ultramicronized 700 mg PEA + 70 mg luteolin) administration was evaluated in elderly hip fractured patients with an interventional, randomized, single-blind, monocentric study. RESULTS: Administration of co-ultraPEALut to LPS-challenged mice ameliorated cognitive dysfunctions and locomotor activity; moreover, it reduced inflammation and apoptosis, while stimulating antioxidant response and limiting the loss of neurotrophins. In the clinical study, the results obtained demonstrated that administration of Glialia  to these surgical patients prevented the onset of POD and attenuated symptom intensity and their duration. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the results obtained enhanced the idea that co-ultraPEALut may be a potential treatment to control cognitive impairment and the inflammatory and oxidative processes associated with delirium.
