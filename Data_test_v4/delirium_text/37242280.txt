37242280|t|Long-Term Soft-Food Rearing in Young Mice Alters Brain Function and Mood-Related Behavior.
37242280|a|The relationship between caloric and nutrient intake and overall health has been extensively studied. However, little research has focused on the impact of the hardness of staple foods on health. In this study, we investigated the effects of a soft diet on brain function and behavior in mice from an early age. Mice fed a soft diet for six months exhibited increased body weight and total cholesterol levels, along with impaired cognitive and motor function, heightened nocturnal activity, and increased aggression. Interestingly, when these mice were switched back to a solid diet for three months, their weight gain ceased, total cholesterol levels stabilized, cognitive function improved, and aggression decreased, while their nocturnal activity remained high. These findings suggest that long-term consumption of a soft diet during early development can influence various behaviors associated with anxiety and mood regulation, including weight gain, cognitive decline, impaired motor coordination, increased nocturnal activity, and heightened aggression. Therefore, the hardness of food can impact brain function, mental well-being, and motor skills during the developmental stage. Early consumption of hard foods may be crucial for promoting and maintaining healthy brain function.
