26238230|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is associated with postoperative delirium incidence, severity, and duration in older patients free of dementia at baseline. METHODS: The authors examined 557 nondemented patients aged 70 years or older undergoing major noncardiac surgery enrolled in the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery Study. Three ApoE measures were considered: epsilon2, epsilon4 carriers versus noncarriers, and a three-category ApoE measure. Delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and chart review. We used generalized linear models to estimate the association between ApoE and delirium incidence, severity (peak CAM Severity [CAM-S] score), and days. RESULTS: ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon4 was present in 15% and 19%, respectively, and postoperative delirium occurred in 24%. Among patients with delirium, the mean peak CAM-S score was 8.0 (standard deviation: 4), with most patients experiencing 1 or 2 delirium days (51% or 28%, respectively). After adjusting for age, sex, surgical procedure, and preoperative cognitive function, ApoE epsilon4 and epsilon2 carrier status were not associated with postoperative delirium: RR for epsilon4=1.0, 95% CI: 0.7-1.5 and RR for epsilon2=0.9, 95% CI: 0.6-1.4. No association between ApoE and delirium severity or number of delirium days was observed. CONCLUSION: In older surgery patients free of dementia, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the ApoE genotype does not confer either risk or protection in postoperative delirium incidence, severity, or duration. Thus, an important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease does not affect risk of delirium.
