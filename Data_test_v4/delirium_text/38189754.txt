38189754|t|The Oxytocin Puzzle: Unlocking Alzheimer's Disease.
38189754|a|Alzheimer's disease is a multi-factorial disease that disrupts many aspects of human behavior. In this comment, we highlight the work by Koulousakis et al. published in a recent issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. In this study, the authors tested the therapeutic potential of the neuropeptide oxytocin in a pre-clinical model of Alzheimer's disease and found positive behavioral outcomes on memory assessments. We discuss these findings in the context of oxytocin research in the field of Alzheimer's disease and the literature regarding oxytocin-based therapeutics, including administration protocols and potential underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.
