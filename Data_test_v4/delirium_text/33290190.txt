33290190|t|Skeletal Muscle Index's Impact on Discharge Disposition After Head and Neck Cancer Free Flap Reconstruction.
33290190|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of skeletal muscle index (SMI) in the assessment of frailty and determination of discharge to post-acute care facilities (PACF) after head and neck cancer free flap reconstruction (HNCFFR). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Single-institution, academic tertiary referral center. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing HNCFFR from 2014 to 2019 with preoperative abdominal computed tomography imaging were retrospectively analyzed. Patient demographics, 5-factor modified frailty index (5-mFI), body mass index (BMI), SMI at the third lumbar vertebra, oncologic history, perioperative data, and Clavien-Dindo (CD) complications were collected. Binary logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of discharge disposition. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 206 patients, 62 (30.1%) of whom were discharged to PACF. Patients discharged to PACF were of older age (65.4 vs 57.1 years, P < .0001) and had a lower SMI (38.8 vs 46.8 cm2/m2, P < .0001), higher 5-mFI (>=3; 25.8% vs 4.2%, P < .0001), and greater incidence of stage IV (80.6% vs 64.1%, P = .0211) aerodigestive cancer (80.6% vs 66.7%, P = .0462). Patients discharged to PACF experienced more blood transfusions (74.2% vs 35.4%, P < .0001), major postoperative complications (CD >=3, 40.3% vs 12.9%, P < .0001), and delirium (33.9% vs 4.2%, P < .0001). After adjusting for pre- and postoperative factors, multivariate binary logistic regression identified age (P = .0255), 5-mFI (P < .0042), SMI (P = .0199), stage IV cancer (P = .0250), aerodigestive tumor (P = .0366), delirium (P < .0001), and perioperative blood transfusion (P = .0144) as independent predictors of discharge to PACF. CONCLUSIONS: SMI and 5-mFI are independently associated with discharge to PACF after HNCFFR and should be considered in preoperative planning and assessment of frailty.
