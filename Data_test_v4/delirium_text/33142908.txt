33142908|t|Masked Phenolic-Selenium Conjugates: Potent and Selective Antiproliferative Agents Overcoming P-gp Resistance.
33142908|a|Cancer accounts for one of the most complex diseases nowadays due to its multifactorial nature. Despite the vast number of cytotoxic agents developed so far, good therapeutic approaches are not always reached. In recent years, multitarget drugs are gaining great attention against multifactorial diseases in contraposition to polypharmacy. Herein we have accomplished the conjugation of phenolic derivatives with an ample number of organochalcogen motifs with the aim of developing novel antiproliferative agents. Their antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties (against six tumour and one non-tumour cell lines) were analysed. Moreover, in order to predict P-gp-mediated chemoresistance, the P-glycoprotein assay was also conducted in order to determine whether compounds prepared herein could behave as substrates of that glycoprotein. Selenium derivatives were found to be significantly stronger antiproliferative agents than their sulfur isosters. Moreover, the length and the nature of the tether, together with the nature of the organoselenium scaffold were also found to be crucial features in the observed bioactivities. The lead compound, bearing a methylenedioxyphenyl moiety, and a diselenide functionality, showed a good activity (GI50 = 0.88-2.0 microM) and selectivity towards tumour cell lines (selectivity index: 14-32); moreover, compounds considered herein were not substrates for the P-gp efflux pump, thus avoiding the development of chemoresistance coming from such mechanism, commonly found for widely-used chemotherapeutic agents.
