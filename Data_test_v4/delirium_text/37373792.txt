37373792|a|Previous studies have found facial emotion recognition (FER) impairments in individuals with epilepsy. While such deficits have been extensively explored in individuals with focal temporal lobe epilepsy, studies on individuals with generalized epilepsies are rare. However, studying FER specifically in individuals with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is particularly interesting since they frequently suffer from social and neuropsychological difficulties in addition to epilepsy-specific symptoms. Furthermore, recent brain imaging studies have shown subtle microstructural alterations in individuals with JME. FER is considered a fundamental social skill that relies on a distributed neural network, which could be disturbed by network dysfunction in individuals with JME. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine FER and social adjustment in individuals with JME. It included 27 patients with JME and 27 healthy controls. All subjects underwent an Ekman-60 Faces Task to examine FER and neuropsychological tests to assess social adjustment as well as executive functions, intelligence, depression, and personality traits. Individuals with JME performed worse in global FER and fear and surprise recognition than healthy controls. However, probably due to the small sample size, no significant difference was found between the two groups. A potential FER impairment needs to be confirmed in further studies with larger sample size. If so, patients with JME could benefit from addressing possible deficits in FER and social difficulties when treated. By developing therapeutic strategies to improve FER, patients could be specifically supported with the aim of improving social outcomes and quality of life.
