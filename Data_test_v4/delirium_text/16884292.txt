16884292|t|Potential lead for an Alzheimer drug: a peptide that blocks intermolecular interaction and amyloid beta protein-induced cytotoxicity.
16884292|a|A peptide chAbeta30-16 (15-mer; CTFVRTHIFCKEHQF) was designed to bind to a region encompassing the entire polymerization-related (16KLVFF20) and part of the polymerization and toxicity-related (25GSNKGAIIGLM35) regions of amyloid beta-protein, Abeta1-42 by a hydropathic complementary approach. This peptide efficiently binds to Abeta and blocks intermolecular interaction and the formation of Abeta aggregates. In addition, the peptide neutralizes the cell toxicity of Abeta fibrils. The chAbeta30-16 peptide or its derivatives may be a starting point for the future development of drugs that prevent the neurotoxicity and deposition of Abeta in the brain of Alzheimer's disease.
