31844591|a|BACKGROUND: Icaritin (ICT) is a prenylflavonoid derivative from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. ICT has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. We investigate how ICT affects secretion of amyloid precursor protein (APP). METHODS: We exposed APP-PS1-HEK293 cells to ICT to investigate its effect on beta-site amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE)1. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ICT for BACE1 was measured using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Effects of ICT on the mRNA expression of APP were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression was measured by western blotting and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Icaritin inhibited BACE1 activity and IC50 was 5.70 +- 1.09 muM. Compared with the control group, at ICT concentrations of 5 muM and 10 muM, the viability increased and LDH leakage decreased in APP-PS1-293 cells. Also, mRNA expression of A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) increased, while that of BACE1 and presenilin-1 (PS1) decreased, upon ICT treatment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence confirmed that protein expression of ADAM10, BACE1 and PS1 showed the same trend. Expression of the APP fragments sAPPbeta and C-terminal fragment beta decreased, while that of sAPPalpha increased, upon ICT treatment. Expression of amyloid beta peptides in APP-PS1-HEK293 cells was lower in ICT-treated groups compared with that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Icaritin, as a BACE1 inhibitor, inhibits APP secretion in APP-PS1-HEK293 cells by impeding the amyloidogenic pathway.
