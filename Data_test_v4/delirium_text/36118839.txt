36118839|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commonly seen neurodegenerative brain disorder. The paracrine effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) signify to trigger immunomodulation and neural regeneration. However, the role and mechanism of bone marrow MSC- (BMSC-) derived CX3CL1 in AD remains elusive. In this study, Abeta 1-42-intervened SH-SY5Y cells were used for AD cell model construction. pcDNA-ligated CX3CL1 overexpression plasmids were transfected into BMSCs. The levels of soluble and membrane-bound CX3CL1 were detected by ELISA and Western blotting (WB), respectively. The growth, apoptosis, and pathology of AD model cells were evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, morphology observation, biochemical examination, and WB. It was found that Abeta 1-42 significantly reduced CX3CL1 expression either in soluble or membrane-bound form, cell viability, relative protein expression of synaptic markers, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px contents, as well as Trx protein expression; in addition, it enhanced the apoptosis rate, the relative expression of cleaved caspase-3, Abeta, tau, p-Tau, Iba1, MDA, TXNIP, and NLRP3 in SH-SY5Y cells; however, the above effects were prominently reversed by the coculture of BMSCs. Moreover, overexpression of CX3CL1 in BMSCs observably strengthened the corresponding tendency caused by BMSCs. In conclusion, through the TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway, CX3CL1 derived from BMSCs inhibited pathological damage in Abeta 1-42-induced SH-SY5Y.
