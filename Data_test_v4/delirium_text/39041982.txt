39041982|a|BACKGROUND: Extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis (NCC) commonly presents with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, or delirium. Intraventricular NCC is frequently associated with obstructive hydrocephalus as well as recurrent inflammatory cascade leading to chronic meningitis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the novel use and benefit of B cell depleting therapy in a case of treatment-refractory cysticercal meningoencephalitis. CASE: In this article, we report about a young male with intraventricular NCC, who had recurrent meningitis (with encephalitis) and kept relapsing despite multiple cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, cysticidal therapy, and high-dose steroids. He finally showed clinical and radiological resolution with pulsed rituximab therapy. CONCLUSION: This off-label use of a monoclonal antibody against CD20 may be considered as a rescue therapy in steroid-refractory immune-mediated cysticercal meningitis.
