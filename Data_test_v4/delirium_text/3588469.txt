3588469|t|Digitalis delirium in an elderly woman.
3588469|a|A case of anorexia, paranoid delusions, and lethargy associated with digoxin toxicity is presented here. The digitalis glycosides are among the most commonly used drugs in modern medicine, and as such, they frequently cause toxicity. Although cardiac side effects of digoxin are well recognized, less attention has been paid to potential CNS effects. Psychiatric manifestations, from calm disorientation to violent psychosis, tend to occur more often in elderly patients and may be the earliest or only sign of digitalis toxicity.
