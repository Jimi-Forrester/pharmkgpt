31366317|t|Exploration of time-frequency reassignment and homologous inter-hemispheric asymmetry analysis of MCI-AD brain activity.
31366317|a|BACKGROUND: In this study, nonlinear based time-frequency (TF) and time domain investigations are employed for the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of mild cognitive impairment-Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) patients and healthy controls. This study attempts to comprehend the cognitive decline of MCI-AD under both resting and cognitive task conditions. RESULTS: Wavelet-based synchrosqueezing transform (SST) alleviates the smearing of energy observed in the spectrogram around the central frequencies in short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). A precise TF representation is assured due to the reassignment of scale variable to the frequency variable. It is discerned from the studies of time domain measures encompassing fractal dimension (FD) and approximate entropy (ApEn), that the parietal lobe is the most affected in MCI-AD under both resting and cognitive states. Alterations in asymmetry in the brain hemispheres are analysed using the homologous areas inter-hemispheric symmetry (HArS). CONCLUSION: Time and time-frequency domain analysis of EEG signals have been used for distinguishing various brain states. Therefore, EEG analysis is highly useful for the screening of AD in its prodromal phase.
