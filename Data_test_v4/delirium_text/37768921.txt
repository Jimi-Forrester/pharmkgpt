37768921|a|This study addresses the current trend of essential oils in alternative medicine using the non-chordate model Drosophila melanogaster. Following the three R's principles, it proposes non-chordate models to fill knowledge gaps on essential oil toxicity. Copaiba, lavender, and ginger essential oils are evaluated for effects on D. melanogaster lifespan, climbing ability, and brain structure, while their anti-inflammatory properties are also analyzed. Results show dose-related differences: higher concentrations (0.25% v/v) cause brain deterioration and impaired climbing, while lower concentrations (0.0625% v/v for copaiba and ginger; 0.125% for lavender) have no effect on climbing or brain structure. Lavender oil significantly extends lifespan and maintains anti-inflammatory activity when ingested, underscoring its therapeutic potential. These findings highlight the importance of D. melanogaster as a model for studying essential oil properties, potentially replacing chordate models. In addition, this research advances alternative remedies for currently incurable diseases, with lavender oil emerging as a promising candidate for drug discovery.
