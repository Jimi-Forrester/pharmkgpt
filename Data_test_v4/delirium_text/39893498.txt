METHODS: Using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, we examined group differences in gut microbiome, fecal metabolome, neuroimaging measures, and cognitive variables across 30 patients with AD, 75 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 61 healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we assessed the associations between these multi-omics changes using correlation and mediation analyses. RESULTS: There were significant group differences in gut microbial composition, which were driven by 8 microbial taxa (e.g., Staphylococcus and Bacillus) exhibiting a progressive increase in relative abundance from HC to MCI to AD, and 2 taxa (e.g., Anaerostipes) showing a gradual decrease. 26 fecal metabolites (e.g., Arachidonic, Adrenic, and Lithocholic acids) exhibited a progressive increase from HC to MCI to AD. We also observed progressive gray matter atrophy in broadly distributed gray matter regions and gradual micro-structural integrity damage in widespread white matter tracts along the AD continuum. Integration of these multi-omics changes revealed significant associations between microbiota, metabolites, neuroimaging, and cognition. More importantly, we identified two potential mediation pathways: (1) microbiota   metabolites   neuroimaging   cognition, and (2) microbiota   metabolites   cognition. CONCLUSION: Aside from elucidating the underlying mechanism whereby gut microbiota dysbiosis is linked to AD, our findings may contribute to groundwork for future interventions targeting the microbiota-metabolites-brain-cognition pathways as a therapeutic strategy in the AD continuum.
