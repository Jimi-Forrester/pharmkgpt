34514434|t|Episode of COVID-19 Telepsychiatry Session Key Origination Upon Swarm-Based Metaheuristic and Neural Perceptron Blend.
34514434|a|Current pandemic has immensely disrupted the entire world in the field of medical science. The novel corona virus has not only brought physical sufferings but also huge psychiatric complications on the patients. Treating the psychiatric issues from remote locations can be best done through telepsychiatry. Patients can virtually consult with psychiatrists from their quarantines. However, during this COVID-19 era of excessive digital transactions, patients' data security mechanism is a challenging issue to prevent from intruding. Efficient cryptographic algorithms are used depending on the transmission key. This paper deals with the episode of transmission key origination with the help of salp swarm algorithm and neural perceptron. Threshold cryptography provides the generation of the partial shares of the E-prescriptions, which can be restructured on the threshold set of shares. The property of lossless theory has been implemented on the proposed set of telepsychiatry shares. A mask matrix has been proposed to diffuse the E-prescription shares into the specified group of users. The transmission key validation has been carried out in this paper based on myriad statistical tests. Chi Square test,  chi 2 = 17.04  has been observed under 5% level of significance. Thus, there exists no similarity between the bit patterns of the transmission key. A correlation coefficient between the average encryption and decryption time and the functional time has been estimated as 0.92076 and 0.72340, respectively. Also, it confirms the data resistance against the opponents in terms of different mathematical and statistical methods.
