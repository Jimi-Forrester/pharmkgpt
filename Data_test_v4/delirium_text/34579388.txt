34579388|t|Chemical Diversity and Therapeutic Effects of Essential Oils of Aniba Species from the Amazon: A Review.
34579388|a|Lauraceae families have great diversity in the world's tropical regions and are represented mainly by aromatic shrubs and trees with significant production of essential oils (EOs). This work presents a review of the EO chemical profiles from specimens of Aniba, including their seasonal variations, geographical distributions, and biological activities in the Amazon biome. Based on the survey, 15 species were reviewed, representing 167 oil samples extracted from leaves, twig barks, and woods. Brazilian Amazon was the most representative geographic area in the number of specimens, highlighting the locations Belem, (Para state, PA) (3 spp., 37 samples), Santarem (PA) (3 spp., 10 samples), Carajas (PA) (3 spp., 7 samples), and Manaus (Amazonas state, AM) (3 spp., 16 samples). The main compound classes identified in oils were benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, represented by 1-nitro-2-phenylethane, benzyl salicylate, benzyl benzoate and methyleugenol, along with terpenoids, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as linalool, alpha-phellandrene, beta-phellandrene, beta-selinene, and spathulenol. The EOs from Aniba showed considerable variation in the chemical profiles according to season and collection site. The hierarchical cluster analysis classified the samples into two main groups according to chemical composition. This review highlights its comprehensive and up-to-date information on history, conservation, traditional uses, chemosystematics, pharmacological potential of Aniba species.
