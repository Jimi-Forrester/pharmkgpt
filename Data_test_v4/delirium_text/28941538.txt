28941538|t|Sedation Analgesia and Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Critical Care: Overview and Current Landscape.
28941538|a|Sedation is a mainstay of therapy for critically ill children. Although necessary in the care of the critically ill child, sedative drugs are associated with adverse effects, such as disruption of circadian rhythm, altered sleep, delirium, potential neurotoxicity, and immunosuppression. Optimal approaches to the sedation of the critically ill child should include identification of sedation targets and sedation interruptions, allowing for a more individualized approach to sedation. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between critical illness and sedation pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the impact of sedation on immune function, and the genetic implications on drug disposition and response.
