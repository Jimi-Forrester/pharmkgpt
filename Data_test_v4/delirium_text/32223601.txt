32223601|t|One-Year Evaluation of a Targeted Medication Therapy Management Intervention for Older Adults.
32223601|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults are especially susceptible to adverse effects of inappropriate medication therapy, and anticholinergic medications are common culprits for cognitive dysfunction due to their action on the central nervous system. Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions can aid in deprescribing and reducing inappropriate medication use in older adults. However, there is sparse literature on the long-term sustainability of these interventions. OBJECTIVES: To (a) investigate whether the deprescribing of anticholinergic medications during an 8-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a targeted MTM intervention is sustained at 1-year postintervention follow-up and (b) compare anticholinergic utilization trends in the study population with a large sample of similar individuals not exposed to the intervention. METHODS: Participants in the targeted MTM (tMTM) RCT had normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment and were recruited from enrollees in a longitudinal study at the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) and thus have pertinent medical information gathered approximately annually. In this posttrial observational follow-up, sustainability of the anticholinergic deprescribing intervention was assessed in participants in the RCT, and anticholinergic medication use trends were described from the RCT baseline (which occurred immediately following an ADC visit) to the next annual visit in all participants. Mean change in anticholinergic burden from RCT baseline to the next annual visit was estimated using analysis of covariance, and participants were compared with 2 external samples. Anticholinergic burden was measured using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS). The odds of decreasing baseline anticholinergic burden and number of total and strong anticholinergic medications at the follow-up study time point was assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the deprescribing changes made during the initial RCT, 50% were sustained after 1 year. Participants in the tMTM trial reported decreases in the use of anticholinergic antihistamines and bladder agents (-6.5 and -4.4%, respectively), but there was no change in the use of anticholinergic agents targeted at the central nervous system. While the anticholinergic burden of RCT participants decreased over 1 year (adjusted mean ADS change [95% CI] = -0.33 [-0.72, 0.07]), it was not different than the change observed in 2 external samples at the trial center (-0.20 [-0.42, 0.02]) and nationally (-0.33 [-0.39, -0.26]). There were no statistically significant differences between trial participants and external samples in the odds of decreasing anticholinergic burden nor in decreasing the number of total, or strongly anticholinergic, medications at the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the sustainability of deprescribing is limited to the period of intervention, rather than affording lasting effects even over periods as short as 1 year, which was demonstrated not only in the small group of RCT participants but also by comparison with external groups. Future work should extend the duration of intervention and follow-up periods for MTM interventions to allow further insights regarding the sustainability of deprescribing efforts in older adults. DISCLOSURES: The original trial was supported by a pilot study award from the University of Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (UL1TR000117). Additional support for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (R01 AG054130).
