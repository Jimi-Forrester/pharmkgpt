37367099|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify risk factors for nursing home (NH) entry 36 months after hospitalization via the emergency department (ED) in a population of patients aged 75 years or older. METHODS: This was a prospective multicentre cohort. Patients were recruited from the emergency departments (EDs) of nine hospitals. Subjects had been hospitalised in a medical ward in the same hospital as the ED to which they were initially admitted. Subjects who experienced NH entry prior to ED admission were excluded. NH entry has been defined as the incident admission either into an NH or other long-term care facility within the follow-up period. Variables from a comprehensive geriatric assessment of patients were entered into a Cox model with competing risks to predict NH entry during 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Among 1306 patients included in the SAFES cohort, 218 (16.7%) who were already in an NH were excluded. The remaining 1088 patients included in the analysis were aged 84 +- 6 years on average. During 3 years of follow-up, 340 (31.3%) entered an NH. The independent risk factors for NH entry were that they: living alone (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.00, had a 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-2.54, p < 0.0001), could not independently perform activities of daily living (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24-2.64, p = 0.002), and had balance disorders (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73, p = 0.007), dementia syndrome (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29, p < 0.0001) and a risk of pressure ulcers (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.82, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The majority of the risk factors for NH entry within 3 years after emergency hospitalization are amenable to intervention strategies. It is therefore reasonable to imagine that targeting these features of frailty could delay or prevent NH entry and improve the quality of life of these individuals before and after NH entry.
