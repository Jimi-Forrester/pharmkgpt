Alzheimer's disease leads to a rapid and irreversible decline in cognitive abilities by damaging memory cells. Methods: A ResNet-18-based system is proposed, integrating Depth Convolution with a Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block to minimize tuning parameters. This design is based on analyses of existing deep learning architectures and feature extraction techniques. Additionally, pre-trained ResNet-18 models were created with and without the SE block to compare ROC and accuracy values across different hyperparameters. Results: The proposed model achieved ROC values of 95% for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), 95% for Cognitively Normal (CN), and 93% for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), with a maximum test accuracy of 88.51%. However, the pre-trained model with SE had 93.26% accuracy and ROC values of 98%, 99%, and 98%, while the model without SE had 94%, 97%, and 94% ROC values and 92.41% accuracy. Discussion: Collecting medical data can be expensive and raises ethical concerns. Small data sets are also prone to local minima issues in the cost function. A scratch model that experiences extensive hyperparameter tuning may end up being either overfitted or underfitted. Class imbalance also reduces performance. Transfer learning is most effective with small, imbalanced datasets, and pre-trained models with SE blocks perform better than others. The proposed model introduced a method to reduce training parameters and prevent overfitting from imbalanced medical data. Overall performance findings show that the suggested approach performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques.
