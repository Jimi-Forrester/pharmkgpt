31673221|a|Purpose: We analyzed the molecular mechanisms leading to glutamate release from rat primary cultures of RPE cells, under isosmotic conditions. Thrombin has been shown to stimulate glutamate release from astrocytes and retinal glia; however, the effect of thrombin on glutamate release from RPE cells has not been examined. Our previous work showed that upon the alteration of the blood-retina barrier, the serine protease thrombin could contribute to the transformation, proliferation, and migration of RPE cells. In this condition, elevated extracellular glutamate causes neuronal loss in many retinal disorders, including glaucoma, ischemia, diabetic retinopathy, and inherited photoreceptor degeneration. Methods: Primary cultures of rat RPE cells were preloaded with 1 microCi/ml 3H-glutamate in Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) buffer for 30 min at 37  C. Cells were rinsed and super-perfused with 1 ml/min KRB for 15 min. Stable release was reached at the 7th minute, and on the 8th minute, fresh KRB containing stimuli was added. Results: This study showed for the first time that thrombin promotes specific, dose-dependent glutamate release from RPE cells, induced by the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1). This effect was found to depend on the Ca2+ increase mediated by the phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, as well as by the reverse activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Conclusions: Given the intimate contact of the RPE with the photoreceptor outer segments, diffusion of RPE-released glutamate could contribute to the excitotoxic death of retinal neurons, and the development of thrombin-induced eye pathologies.
