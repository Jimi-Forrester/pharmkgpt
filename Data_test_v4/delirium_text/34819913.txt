34819913|t|The Rate of Decrease in Brain Perfusion in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Syndrome May Be Impacted by Glycemic Variability-A Pilot Study.
34819913|a|Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are tauopathic parkinsonian syndromes, presently lacking disease-modifying treatments. Patients affected by these diseases suffer due to multidimensional deteriorations resulting in motor and cognitive impairment. Previously published research has confirmed risk factors that may impact the course of PSP and CBS, among them hypertension and diabetes. Less data is available regarding prediabetes and glycemic variability. In this study, 26 patients with clinical diagnoses of PSP and CBS were examined using glycated hemoglobin and perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). Patients were divided into two groups-PSP/CBS patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) below and above 5.7%. The results of the perfusion evaluation were compared with the values from healthy volunteers from the software's database. A decrease in perfusion in certain regions of interest was observed among patients affected by increased glycemic variability. A more pronounced decrement in perfusion was observed only in some regions of interest-the hippocampus, pons, left thalamus, right insula. The results indicated that, among PSP/CBS patients, individuals with more pronounced glycemic variability had more severe hypoperfusion in certain brain regions in comparison with PSP/CBS patients without carbohydrate metabolism disorders. Due to the fact that PSP and CBS are associated with cognitive impairment, an additional decrease in perfusion in the hippocampal area may impact the rate of cognitive deterioration.
