23362445|a|PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors for developing urinary retention after removal of the urethral catheter on postoperative day 1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients who underwent Greenlight HPS laser photoselective vaporization prostatectomy (PVP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 427 men who underwent Greenlight HPS laser PVP between 2009 and 2012, excluding patients in whom a catheter was maintained for more than 1 day because of urethral procedures. In all patients, a voiding trial was performed on postoperative day 1; if patients were unable to urinate, the urethral catheter was replaced before hospital discharge. The patients were divided into two groups: early catheter removal (postoperative day 1) and late catheter removal (urethral catheter reinsertion). Preoperative and perioperative parameters were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Catheters were successfully removed in 378 (88.6%) patients on postoperative day 1. In 49 patients, the catheters were reinserted and removed a mean of 6.45+-0.39 days after surgery. In a multivariate analysis, a history of diabetes was the most significant predictor (p=0.028) of failure of early catheter removal, followed by operative time (p=0.039). There were no significant differences in age, prostate volume, International Prostate Symptom Score, or urodynamic parameters between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible, safe, and cost-effective to remove the urethral catheter on postoperative day 1 after Greenlight HPS laser PVP, but the procedure should be done carefully in patients who have history of diabetes or an extended operative time.
