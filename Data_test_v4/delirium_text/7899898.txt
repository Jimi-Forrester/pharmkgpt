DESIGN: This was a longitudinal study which measured changes in a five-year interval. SETTING: The study was conducted in the Henderson district of Singapore at the subjects' homes and at a day centre. SUBJECTS: A random sample of elderly Chinese was selected in 1985 from the electoral roll of the Henderson constituency and reassessed after 5 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: A semi-structured questionnaire adapted from the Older American Resources and Services, and the computerised mental state programme, GMS-AGECAT. RESULTS: There was no apparent change in social resources after 5 years and the majority of the elderly (80.3%) were still living with their families. On activities of daily living, there was a significant decline especially after the age of 75. The incidence of dementia was 2.01%--the rate of Alzheimer's disease was 0.67% and multi-infarct dementia 1.34%. CONCLUSION: The change in performance of activities of daily living after the age of 75 and the low incidence of dementia were similar to studies in Europe and the United States.
