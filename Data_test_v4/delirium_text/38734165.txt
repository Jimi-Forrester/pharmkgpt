38734165|a|OBJECTIVE: Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) are a relatively common condition defined as an abnormal collection of blood and its break down products in the subdural space, usually accompanied by a history of preceding mild head trauma. Surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the surgical treatment outcome of patients operated on for CSDH at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. This comprehensive novel study serves as a benchmark for assessing therapeutic outcomes among patients with CSDH in the context of Ethiopia. METHODS: Institution-based prospective observational study was conducted among patients operated on for symptomatic CSDH at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023 G C. RESULT: A total of 107 patients (70 males (65.4%) and 37 females (34.6%) with a male to female ration of 1.9:1 and mean age of 62.4 and a standard deviation of 13.7 (range from 23 to 92) were studied. Fifyt-one (47.7%) of the patients had a history of antecedent trauma. In terms of clinical symptoms, 86 (80.4%) patients had weakness as the chief complaint, followed by headache in 81 (75.7%). Among complications, recurrence is the most common, which was seen in 16 (15%) patients, followed by altered mental status (confusion, delirium) in 18 (16.8%) patients. The mean duration of the hospital stay was 6 days, with a standard deviation of 4 days. The majority of the patients had a good recovery with the resumption of normal life: 92 (86%), 10 (9.3%) patients had moderate disability, were disabled but independent, 2 (1.8%) patients had severe disability, were dependent on daily support, and 3 (2.8%) patients died. CONCLUSION: CSDHs are a relatively common condition characterized by an abnormal collection of blood. Antecedent trauma is the usual risk factor. Complication can happen following surgical intervention; however, patients with CSDH generally have a good prognosis.
