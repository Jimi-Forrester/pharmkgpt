39247873|a|Several decades of research on cell and animal models contributed tremendously to understanding human diseases. Particularly, research on rodents and non-human primates revealed that animal research is a major and important component in biomedical research in learning complex pathophysiological processes. Further, animal research helped us to understand human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, animal research has also helped us to test hundreds of drugs and develop treatments for human use. Researchers can gain a better understanding of key biological and physiological processes in humans by comparing them to laboratory animals. Based on their relevance and resemblance to people, or even usual living conditions, scientists rationalize the use of particular animal models in their studies. It is suggested that in the National Institutes of Health and other agencies-funded research, animal models should be carefully selected to study the biology and pathophysiology of human health and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. However, it is critical to use a minimum number of animals for human research. Further, it is also noted that the use and reuse of behavioral,  molecular, and biochemical data from wild-type (WT) control mice with mutant lines of disease models, as long as the genetic background is the same in both WT and disease mice. On the other hand, anonymous readers have challenged the use and reuse of WT mice data for comparison. In the current article, we discuss the minimum utility of animals, covering the 3Rs, Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement, and also discuss the use and reuse of behavioral, molecular, and biochemical data.
