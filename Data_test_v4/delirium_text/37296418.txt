37296418|a|BACKGROUND: Neonatal hydrocephalus is a congenital abnormality resulting in an inflammatory response and microglial cell activation both clinically and in animal models. Previously, we reported a mutation in a motile cilia gene, Ccdc39 that develops neonatal progressive hydrocephalus (prh) with inflammatory microglia. We discovered significantly increased amoeboid-shaped activated microglia in periventricular white matter edema, reduced mature homeostatic microglia in grey matter, and reduced myelination in the prh model. Recently, the role of microglia in animal models of adult brain disorders was examined using cell type-specific ablation by colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, however, little information exists regarding the role of microglia in neonatal brain disorders such as hydrocephalus. Therefore, we aim to see if ablating pro-inflammatory microglia, and thus suppressing the inflammatory response, in a neonatal hydrocephalic mouse line could have beneficial effects. METHODS: In this study, Plexxikon 5622 (PLX5622), a CSF1R inhibitor, was subcutaneously administered to wild-type (WT) and prh mutant mice daily from postnatal day (P) 3 to P7. MRI-estimated brain volume was compared with untreated WT and prh mutants P7-9 and immunohistochemistry of the brain sections was performed at P8 and P18-21. RESULTS: PLX5622 injections successfully ablated IBA1-positive microglia in both the WT and prh mutants at P8. Of the microglia that are resistant to PLX5622 treatment, there was a higher percentage of amoeboid-shaped microglia, identified by morphology with retracted processes. In PLX-treated prh mutants, there was increased ventriculomegaly and no change in the total brain volume was observed. Also, the PLX5622 treatment significantly reduced myelination in WT mice at P8, although this was recovered after full microglia repopulation by P20. Microglia repopulation in the mutants worsened hypomyelination at P20. CONCLUSIONS: Microglia ablation in the neonatal hydrocephalic brain does not improve white matter edema, and actually worsens ventricular enlargement and hypomyelination, suggesting critical functions of homeostatic ramified microglia to better improve brain development with neonatal hydrocephalus. Future studies with detailed examination of microglial development and status may provide a clarification of the need for microglia in neonatal brain development.
