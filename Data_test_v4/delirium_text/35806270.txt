35806270|a|Disturbance of the brain homeostasis, either directly via the formation of abnormal proteins or cerebral hypo-perfusion, or indirectly via peripheral inflammation, will activate microglia to synthesise a variety of pro-inflammatory agents which may lead to inflammation and cell death. The pro-inflammatory cytokines will induce changes in the iron proteins responsible for maintaining iron homeostasis, such that increased amounts of iron will be deposited in cells in the brain. The generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which is directly involved in the inflammatory process, can significantly affect iron metabolism via their interaction with iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs). This underlies the importance of ensuring that iron is maintained in a form that can be kept under control; hence, the elegant mechanisms which have become increasingly well understood for regulating iron homeostasis. Therapeutic approaches to minimise the toxicity of iron include N-acetyl cysteine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds and iron chelation.
