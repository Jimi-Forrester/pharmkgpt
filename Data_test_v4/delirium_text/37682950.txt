37682950|t|Periodontal disease and subsequent risk of cardiovascular outcome and all-cause mortality: A meta-analysis of prospective studies.
37682950|a|Studies reported periodontal disease (PD) periodontal disease is associated with many systemic diseases, including cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. However, the precise mechanistic link for these relationship remained unclear. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of cohort studies to investigate the association of PD with the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. We systematically searched the databases of PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane library to identify eligible studies until April 2023. The investigated outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. The summary relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model. Thirty-nine cohort studies with 4,389,263 individuals were selected for final meta-analysis. We noted PD were associated with elevated risk of MACEs (RR: 1.24; 95%CI: 1.15-1.34; P<0.001), CHD (RR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.12-1.29; P<0.001), MI (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.06-1.22; P = 0.001), stroke (RR: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.15-1.37; P<0.001), cardiac death (RR: 1.42; 95%CI: 1.10-1.84; P = 0.007), and all-cause mortality (RR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.07-1.61; P = 0.010). Sensitivity analyses indicated the pooled conclusions for cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality are robustness. The associations of PD with the risk of ardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality could affected by region, study design, PD definition, follow-up duration, and study quality. This study found the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality were elevated in PD patients, and the intervention for PD should be applied to prevent the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.
