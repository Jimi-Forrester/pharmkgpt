16788245|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) isoforms ratio as a risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease and to assess its relationship with demographic and genetic variables of the disease. METHODS: Blood samples from 26 patients fulfilling NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria for AD and 46 healthy control subjects were collected for Western blotting for betaAPP. A ratio of betaAPP isoforms, in optical densities, between the upper band (130 Kd) and the lower bands (106-110 Kd) was obtained. Odds ratios were obtained to determine risk factor of this component. RESULTS: betaAPP ratio on AD subjects was lower than that of control subjects: 0.3662 +/- 0.1891 vs. 0.6769 +/- 0.1021 (mean +/- SD, p<0.05). A low betaAPP ratio (<0.6) showed an OR of 4.63 (95% CI 1.45-15.33). When onset of disease was taken into account, a betaAPP ratio on EOAD subjects of 0.3965 +/- 0.1916 was found vs. 0.3445 +/- 0.1965 on LOAD subjects (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Altered betaAPP isoforms is a high risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although it has no influence on the time of onset of the disease.
