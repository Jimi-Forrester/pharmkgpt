35148670|a|To explore the effects of antiepileptic drug sodium valproate on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, neurological cognition, and JAK1/STAT3 pathway in hippocampus of rats with depression, 30 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were included. The depression model (DM) was prepared through the chronic stress restraint test. Some model rats were injected with 10 mg/kg sodium valproate into abdominal cavity before modeling (RT group)), and healthy rats were selected as controls (healthy control (HC) group). Depth of split brain was greatly increased in DM group, and nitrogen-acetyl aspartic acid (NAA)/creatine (Cr), glutamic acid (Glu)/Cr, and choline (Cho)/Cr ratios were greatly reduced (P < 0.05). Behavioral test results showed that sugar water preference rate, escape latency, and divergence index in DM group were greatly reduced (P < 0.05), and cumulative immobility time, target quadrant stay time, and number of crossings in forced swimming and tail suspension were prolonged dramatically (P < 0.05), with no difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Expression levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in hippocampus of DM group were obviously increased (P < 0.05), and expression levels of JAK1 and STAT3 were decreased visibly (P < 0.05), with no difference between the two (P > 0.05). In summary, anti-epileptic drug sodium valproate effectively improves hippocampal volume characteristics and memory and neurocognitive dysfunction of depression models.
