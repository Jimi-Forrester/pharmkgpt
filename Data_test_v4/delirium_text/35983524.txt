35983524|a|Objective: To explore the influence of personalized health management model based on the Internet mode on self-management ability and life quality of patients with chronic diseases of physical examination. Methods: Sixty patients with chronic diseases who went through physical examination from February 2019 to April 2021 were enrolled in our hospital. The patients were arbitrarily assigned into control and research group. The former group received routine nursing, and the latter group received personalized health management mode based on the Internet mode. The nursing satisfaction, self-management behavior ability, blood pressure level, physiological index, mastery of health knowledge, and life quality scores were compared. Results: In terms of nursing satisfaction, the research group was very satisfied in 20 cases, satisfactory in 9 cases, and general in 1 case, with a satisfaction rate of 100.00%; In the control group, 15 cases were very satisfied, 9 cases were satisfied, 1 case was general, 5 cases were not satisfied, and the satisfaction rate was 83.33%; The nursing satisfaction of the research group was higher (P < 0.05). Compared with the self-management behavior ability, the scores of diet control, regular medication, correct medication, and smoking cessation in the research group were remarkably higher (P < 0.05). There exhibited no significant difference in blood pressure level before intervention (P > 0.05); after intervention, the blood pressure levels lessened. Compared with the control group, the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of the research group were lower (P < 0.05). The levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and fasting blood glucose in the research group were remarkably lower (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the scores of health knowledge in the research group were remarkably higher, including the harm of smoking, the use of drugs, the importance of persisting in taking drugs, the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, the effect of emotional management on the disease, and the dietary awareness in the research group (P < 0.05). There exhibited no significant difference in the score of life quality before nursing (P > 0.05); after nursing, the score of life quality lessened, and the scores of physiological function, psychological function, social function, and health self-cognition in the research group were lower (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The personalized health management model based on the Internet mode can effectively enhance the chronic disease physiological indexes such as blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood sugar and improve the self-management ability of the patients with chronic disease, which is worth further popularizing and applying in the clinical physical examination in clinic.
