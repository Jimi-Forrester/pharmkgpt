METHODS: Patients aged >=60 years, admitted in clinical and geriatric units of a public hospital were invited to participate in the study. The information about the use of medicines was collected from the patient's electronic record and through telephone contact. The Brazilian Consensus on Potentially Inappropriate Medication for Elderly was used to classify the medication, regardless of the clinical condition. RESULTS: A total of 255 elders were included in this study. The frequency of use of potentially inappropriate medication by elderly was 58.4%. The potentially inappropriate medication use in elderly was positively associated with the presence of depression (odds ratio of 2.208) and polypharmacy (odds ratio of 2.495). The hospitalization in a geriatric unit showed an inverse association with the potentially inappropriate medication use in elderly (odds ratio of 0.513). CONCLUSION: The frequency of potentially inappropriate medication prescription to elderly upon hospital discharge was high. The presence of depression and polypharmacy were directly associated with use of potentially inappropriate medication in the elderly. Admission to the geriatric clinic has become a protection factor for the use of potentially inappropriate medication in elderly. Strategies to improve the elderly pharmacotherapy should implemented aiming at healthcare quality and safety in the transition of care.
