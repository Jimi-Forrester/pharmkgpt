39993281|t|Daylighting and Patients' Access to View Assessment in the Palestinian Hospitals' ICUs.
39993281|a|Daylight and access to a view out are vital factors in improving patients' wellness, side by side healthcare providers' satisfaction and productivity in intensive care units (ICUs). Unfortunately, insufficient attention was paid to this issue in Palestine resulting in many ICU designs lacking the required daylight and access to view, which, in turn, negatively affects patients' wellness, increasing delirium incidence and sleep disorders. This study aims to assess the Palestinian hospitals' ICUs in terms of daylight and patients' access to view by conducting daylight measurements and field observations. The results show that the available ICU designs in Palestine do not provide adequate daylight and access to view for patients.
