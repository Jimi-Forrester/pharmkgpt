37890895|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between baseline macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and retinal layer thicknesses in eyes with and without manifest primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (CAREDS2). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MPOD was measured at CAREDS baseline (2001-2004) via heterochromatic flicker photometry (0.5  from foveal centre). Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), macular ganglion cell complex (GCC), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and RNFL thicknesses were measured at CAREDS2 (2016-2019) via spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Associations between MPOD and retinal thickness were assessed using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Among 742 eyes (379 participants), manifest POAG was identified in 50 eyes (32 participants). In eyes without manifest POAG, MPOD was positively associated with macular GCC, GCL and IPL thicknesses in the central subfield (P-trend <=0.01), but not the inner or outer subfields. Among eyes with manifest POAG, MPOD was positively associated with macular GCC, GCL, IPL and RNFL in the central subfield (P-trend <=0.03), but not the inner or outer subfields, and was positively associated with peripapillary RNFL thickness in the superior and temporal quadrants (P-trend<=0.006). CONCLUSION: We observed a positive association between MPOD and central subfield GCC thickness 15 years later. MPOD was positively associated with peripapillary RNFL superior and temporal quadrant thicknesses among eyes with manifest POAG. Our results linking low MPOD to retinal layers that are structural indicators of early glaucoma provide further evidence that carotenoids may be protective against manifest POAG.
