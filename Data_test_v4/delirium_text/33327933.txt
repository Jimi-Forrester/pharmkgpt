33327933|a|BACKGROUND: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) during development and/or in adulthood has been associated in many human studies with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: In the present study, C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to environmentally relevant levels (250+/-50 mug/m3) of diesel exhaust (DE) or filtered air (FA) during development (E0 to PND21). The expression of several transcription factors relevant for CNS development was assessed on PND3. To address possible mechanistic underpinnings of previously observed behavioral effects of DE exposure, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and laminar organization of neurons in the somatosensory cortex were analyzed on PND60. Results were analyzed separately for male and female mice. RESULTS: Developmental DE exposure caused a male-specific upregulation of Pax6, Tbr1, Tbr2, Sp1, and Creb1 on PND3. In contrast, in both males and females, Tbr2+ intermediate progenitor cells in the PND60 hippocampal dentate gyrus were decreased, as an indication of reduced adult neurogenesis. In the somatosensory region of the cerebral cortex, laminar distribution of Trb1, calbindin, and parvalbumin (but not of Ctip2 or Cux1) was altered by developmental DE exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide additional evidence to previous findings indicating the ability of developmental DE exposure to cause biochemical/molecular and behavioral alterations that may be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.
