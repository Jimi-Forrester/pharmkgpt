37196135|t|Prospective Longitudinal Perfusion in Probable Alzheimer's Disease Correlated with Atrophy in Temporal Lobe.
37196135|a|Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the temporoparietal region and gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the temporal lobe were previously reported in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the temporal relationship between reductions in CBF and GMVs requires further investigation. This study sought to determine if reduced CBF is associated with reduced GMVs, or vice versa. Data came from 148 volunteers of the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study (CHS-CS), including 58 normal controls (NC), 50 MCI, and 40 AD who had perfusion and structural MRIs during 2002-2003 (Time 2). Sixty-three of the 148 volunteers had follow-up perfusion and structural MRIs (Time 3). Forty out of the 63 volunteers received prior structural MRIs during 1997-1999 (Time 1). The relationships between GMVs and subsequent CBF changes, and between CBF and subsequent GMV changes were investigated. At Time 2, we observed smaller GMVs (p<0.05) in the temporal pole region in AD compared to NC and MCI. We also found associations between: (1) temporal pole GMVs at Time 2 and subsequent declines in CBF in this region (p=0.0014) and in the temporoparietal region (p=0.0032); (2) hippocampal GMVs at Time 2 and subsequent declines in CBF in the temporoparietal region (p=0.012); and (3) temporal pole CBF at Time 2 and subsequent changes in GMV in this region (p = 0.011). Therefore, hypoperfusion in the temporal pole may be an early event driving its atrophy. Perfusion declines in the temporoparietal and temporal pole follow atrophy in this temporal pole region.
