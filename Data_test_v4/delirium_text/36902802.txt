36902802|t|Elective Ascending Aortic Aneurysm Surgery in the Elderly.
36902802|a|BACKGROUND: No clear guidelines exist for performing preventive surgery for ascending aortic (AA) aneurysm in elderly patients. This study aims to provide insights by: (1) evaluating patient and procedural characteristics and (2) comparing early outcomes and long-term mortality after surgery between elderly and non-elderly patients. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective observational cohort-study was performed. Data was collected on patients who underwent elective AA surgery in three institutions (2006-2017). Clinical presentation, outcomes, and mortality were compared between elderly (>=70 years) and non-elderly patients. RESULTS: In total, 724 non-elderly and 231 elderly patients were operated upon. Elderly patients had larger aortic diameters (57.0 mm (IQR 53-63) vs. 53.0 mm (IQR 49-58), p < 0.001) and more cardiovascular risk factors at the time of surgery than non-elderly patients. Elderly females had significantly larger aortic diameters than elderly males (59.5 mm (55-65) vs. 56.0 mm (51-60), p < 0.001). Short-term mortality was comparable between elderly and non-elderly patients (3.0% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.16). Five-year survival was 93.9% in non-elderly patients and 81.4% in elderly patients (p < 0.001), which are both lower than that of the age-matched general Dutch population. CONCLUSION: This study showed that in elderly patients, a higher threshold exists to undergo surgery, especially in elderly females. Despite these differences, short-term outcomes were comparable between 'relatively healthy' elderly and non-elderly patients.
