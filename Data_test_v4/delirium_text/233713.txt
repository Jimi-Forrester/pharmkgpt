233713|t|[Dangerous side effects of lithium therapy].
233713|a|A report is made on two cases of a pharmacogenic delirium as a result of combined lithium-haloperidol therapy, and on one case of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus renales with second-degree high pressure. Also, the development of a hydrocephalus internus male-resorptivus through lithium is discussed. In all patients there was a possible disposition due to old age or cerebral injury. Based on their effect on synaptic transmission the potentiating effect of lithium and haloperidol is discussed. Under the influence of Na-K stimulated ATPase and, thus, of active transport and adenylcyclase a basic mechanism of lithium therapy and its side-effects is seen.
