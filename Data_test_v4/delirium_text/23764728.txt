23764728|t|An expanded role for neuroimaging in the evaluation of memory impairment.
23764728|a|SUMMARY: Alzheimer disease affects millions of people worldwide. The neuropathologic process underlying this disease begins years, if not decades, before the onset of memory decline. Recent advances in neuroimaging suggest that it is now possible to detect Alzheimer-associated neuropathologic changes well before dementia onset. Here, we evaluate the role of recently developed in vivo biomarkers in the clinical evaluation of Alzheimer disease. We discuss how assessment strategies might incorporate neuroimaging markers to better inform patients, families, and clinicians when memory impairment prompts a search for diagnosis and management options.
