37140357|t|Riluzole and its prodrugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
37140357|a|Current medications for Alzheimer's disease help manage symptoms and behavioral problems. Nevertheless, they do not slow the progression of cognitive decline or dementia. A potential approach for treating Alzheimer's disease is to target neurons that are sensitive to disease pathobiology such as glutamatergic neurons. Several patents disclosed methods for treating Alzheimer's disease by administering riluzole or its prodrugs. Clinical trials revealed that 6 months treatment using riluzole or troriluzole is associated with a slower decline in the tomographic measures of the positron emissions of cerebral glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's patients. The proposed strategy claims to prevent and/or slow the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's patients and to enhance global functioning. These claims may also pave the way for other glutamate modulators to be used for Alzheimer's disease.
