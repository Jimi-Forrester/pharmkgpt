29771495|a|Aberrant assembly of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) is responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease, but can also be exploited to obtain highly functional biomaterials. The short Abeta fragment, KLVFF (Abeta16-20), is crucial for Abeta assembly and considered to be an Abeta aggregation inhibitor. Here, we show that acetylation of KLVFF turns it into an extremely fast self-assembling molecule, reaching macroscopic ( i.e., mm) size in seconds. We show that KLVFF is metastable and that the self-assembly can be directed toward a crystalline or fibrillar phase simply through chemical modification, via acetylation or amidation of the peptide. Amidated KLVFF can form amyloid fibrils; we observed folding events of such fibrils occurring in as little as 60 ms. The ability of single KLVFF molecules to rapidly assemble as highly ordered macroscopic structures makes it a promising candidate for applications as a rapid-forming templating material.
