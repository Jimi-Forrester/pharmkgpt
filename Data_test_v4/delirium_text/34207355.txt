34207355|t|Neuroprotective Function of High Glycolytic Activity in Astrocytes: Common Roles in Stroke and Neurodegenerative Diseases.
34207355|a|Astrocytes (also, astroglia) consume huge amounts of glucose and produce lactate regardless of sufficient oxygen availability, indicating a high capacity for aerobic glycolysis. Glycolysis in astrocytes is activated in accordance with neuronal excitation and leads to increases in the release of lactate from astrocytes. Although the fate of this lactate remains somewhat controversial, it is believed to fuel neurons as an energy substrate. Besides providing lactate, astrocytic glycolysis plays an important role in neuroprotection. Among the minor pathways of glucose metabolism, glucose flux to the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), a major shunt pathway of glycolysis, is attracting research interest. In fact, PPP activity in astrocytes is five to seven times higher than that in neurons. The astrocytic PPP plays a key role in protecting neurons against oxidative stress by providing neurons with a reduced form of glutathione, which is necessary to eliminate reactive oxygen species. Therefore, enhancing astrocytic glycolysis might promote neuronal protection during acute ischemic stroke. Contrariwise, the dysfunction of astrocytic glycolysis and the PPP have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, since mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress trigger and accelerate disease progression.
