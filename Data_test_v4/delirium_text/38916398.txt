38916398|t|The differences in cytokine signatures between severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
38916398|a|Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus and hantavirus are categorized under the Bunyavirales order. The severe disease progression in both SFTS and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is associated with cytokine storms. This study aimed to explore the differences in cytokine profiles and immune responses between the two diseases. A cross-sectional, single-center study involved 100 participants, comprising 46 SFTS patients, 48 HFRS patients, and 6 healthy controls. The study employed the Luminex cytokine detection platform to measure 48 cytokines. The differences in cytokine profiles and immune characteristics between the two diseases were further analyzed using multiple linear regression, principal component analysis, and random forest method. Among the 48 cytokines tested, 30 showed elevated levels in SFTS and/or HFRS compared to the healthy control group. Furthermore, there were 19 cytokines that exhibited significant differences between SFTS and HFRS. Random forest analysis suggested that TRAIL and CTACK were predictive of SFTS, while IL2Ralpha, MIG, IL-8, IFNalpha2, HGF, SCF, MCP-3, and PDGFBB were more common with HFRS. It was further verified by the receiver operating characteristic with area under the curve >0.8 and P-values <0.05, except for TRAIL. Significant differences were observed in the cytokine profiles of SFTS and HFRS, with TRAIL, IL2Ralpha, MIG, and IL-8 being the top 4 cytokines that most clearly distinguished the two diseases. IMPORTANCE: SFTS and HFRS differ in terms of cytokine immune characteristics. TRAIL, IL-2Ralpha, MIG, and IL-8 were the top 4 that differed markedly between SFTS and HFRS.
