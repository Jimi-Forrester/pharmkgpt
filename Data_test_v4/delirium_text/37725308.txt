37725308|t|Patient and Clinician Challenges with Anticholinergic Step Therapy in the Treatment of Overactive Bladder: A Narrative Review.
37725308|a|Anticholinergics have been used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), but their use is limited by poor tolerability and anticholinergic-related side effects. Increasingly, providers are discontinuing anticholinergic prescribing because of growing evidence of the association of anticholinergic use with increased risk of cognitive decline and other adverse effects. Newer medications for OAB, the beta3-adrenergic receptor agonists mirabegron and vibegron, do not have anticholinergic properties and are typically well tolerated; however, many insurance plans have limited patient access to these newer OAB medications by requiring step therapy, meaning less expensive anticholinergic medications must be trialed and/or failed before a beta3-agonist will be covered and dispensed. Thus, many patients are unable to easily access these medications. Step therapy and other drug utilization strategies (e.g., prior authorization) are often used to manage the growing costs of pharmaceuticals, but these policies do not always follow treatment guidelines and may harm patients as a result of treatment delays, discontinuations, or related increases in adverse events. Medical professionals have called for reform of drug utilization strategies through partnerships that include clinicians and policymakers. This narrative review discusses prescribing patterns for OAB treatment and the effect of switching between drugs, as well as the costs of step therapy and prior authorization on patients and prescribers.
