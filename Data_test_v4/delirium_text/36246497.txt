36246497|t|Downregulation of Crystallin Lambda 1 is a New Independent Prognostic Marker in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.
36246497|a|Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most prevalent kidney cancer subtype, has a high mortality rate. Crystallin lambda 1 (CRYL1) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the dehydrogenation of L-gulonate into dehydro-L-gulonate in uronate cycle. CRYL1 dysregulation has been linked to the progression of several cancers. This research aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of CRYL1 expression in ccRCC prognosis. Methods: Clinical data and gene expression profiles on ccRCC were retrieved from the University of California Santa Cruz Xena platform. Differences (variations) in the expression profiles of CRYL1 in ccRCC and healthy tissues were found using RNA-sequencing data, and these findings were validated using qPCR with real-world samples. CRYL1 expression levels were also linked to clinicopathological characteristics, survival, and immune microenvironments. The potential pathway via which CRYL1 expression levels impact the prognosis of patients with ccRCC was investigated using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results: In ccRCC tissues, CRYL1 expression levels were lower compared to healthy renal tissues in TCGA cohort (n = 535, P < 0.001), which was validated in another real-world cohort (n = 14, P < 0.001). Lower CRYL1 expression levels were linked to unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses (P < 0.001). According to multivariate Cox regression analysis (P < 0.001), CRYL1 expression levels in patients with ccRCC could serve as an independent prognostic indicator. Furthermore, a strong link between CRYL1 expression levels and immune microenvironment was observed (P < 0.001). Finally, GSEA revealed that CRYL1 expression levels (P < 0.001) were associated with fatty acid metabolism, G2M checkpoint delays, and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in ccRCC. Conclusion: Our study found that lower levels of CRYL1 expression were linked to unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics and worse prognoses, and CRYL1 could serve as a new target for the treatment of ccRCC, which is useful for personalized medicine.
