34237258|t|Factors Associated With COVID-19 Hospitalizations and Deaths in French Nursing Homes.
34237258|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and management of residents in French nursing homes with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to determine the risk factors for COVID-19-related hospitalization and death in this population. DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty nursing home residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 between March 1 and May 20, 2020, were enrolled and followed until June 2, 2020, in 15 nursing homes in Marseille's greater metropolitan area. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment type, and clinical outcome data were collected from patients' medical records. Multivariable analysis was used to determine factors associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. For the former, the competing risk analysis-based on Fine and Gray's model-took death into account. RESULTS: A total of 480 residents were included. Median age was 88 years (IQR 80-93), and 330 residents were women. A total of 371 residents were symptomatic (77.3%), the most common symptoms being asthenia (47.9%), fever or hypothermia (48.1%), and dyspnea (35.6%). One hundred twenty-three patients (25.6%) were hospitalized and 96 (20%) died. Male gender [specific hazard ratio (sHR) 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.35], diabetes (sHR 1.69, 95% CI 1.15-2.50), an altered level of consciousness (sHR 2.36, 95% CI 1.40-3.98), and dyspnea (sHR 1.69, 95% CI 1.09-2.62) were all associated with a greater risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. Male gender [odds ratio (OR) 6.63, 95% CI 1.04-42.39], thermal dysregulation (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.60-4.38), falls (2.21 95% CI 1.02-4.75), and being aged >85 years (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.32-4.24) were all associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality risk, whereas polymedication (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.77) and preventive anticoagulation (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.79) were protective prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Male gender, being aged >85 years old, diabetes, dyspnea, thermal dysregulation, an altered level of consciousness, and falls must all be considered when identifying and protecting nursing home residents who are at greatest risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death.
