34414184|t|A Role for Frizzled and Their Post-Translational Modifications in the Mammalian Central Nervous System.
34414184|a|The Wnt pathway is a key signalling cascade that regulates the formation and function of neuronal circuits. The main receptors for Wnts are Frizzled (Fzd) that mediate diverse functions such as neurogenesis, axon guidance, dendritogenesis, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity. These processes are crucial for the assembly of functional neuronal circuits required for diverse functions ranging from sensory and motor tasks to cognitive performance. Indeed, aberrant Wnt-Fzd signalling has been associated with synaptic defects during development and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. New studies suggest that the localisation and stability of Fzd receptors play a crucial role in determining Wnt function. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Fzd are emerging as an important mechanism that regulates these Wnt receptors. However, only phosphorylation and glycosylation have been described to modulate Fzd function in the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we discuss the function of Fzd in neuronal circuit connectivity and how PTMs contribute to their function. We also discuss other PTMs, not yet described in the CNS, and how they might modulate the function of Fzd in neuronal connectivity. PTMs could modulate Fzd function by affecting Fzd localisation and stability at the plasma membrane resulting in local effects of Wnt signalling, a feature particularly important in polarised cells such as neurons. Our review highlights the importance of further studies into the role of PTMs on Fzd receptors in the context of neuronal connectivity.
