34522273|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is one of the most prevalent complications in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, which is related to worse clinical outcomes including a longer ICU stay, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, higher mortality rates and increased risk of cognitive impairment. Observational studies have suggested that statins might have a positive effect on delirium status of hospitalized patients. To date, there has been no trial assessing the effect of atorvastatin on delirium status in critically ill patients. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine the efficacy of atorvastatin on delirium status of patients in the ICU. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind and controlled trial, a total of 90 patients in the general ICU who had delirium for at least 2 days were randomly divided into atorvastatin (40 mg/day) (n = 40) and control (n = 50) groups. Delirium status of the patients was determined twice a day at 10:00 a.m. and 18:00 p.m. using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). RESULTS: Administration 40 mg/day of atorvastatin significantly reduced the mean RASS score and increased delirium-free days at both morning and afternoon time points compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of atorvastatin had a significant positive effect on delirium status in patients admitted to the ICU.
