38397828|t|Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 Regulates Cellular Stress Responses and Inflammatory Pathways in Chronic Neuroinflammatory Conditions.
38397828|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by neuronal death due to various triggers. Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the development of AD. The neuroinflammatory response is manifested by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; various chemokines; nitrous oxide; and reactive oxygen species. In this study, we evaluated the relevance of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), which is expressed in the brain cells during the induction of neuroinflammation. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic neuroinflammation model and Pgrmc1 knockdown cells were used to assess the inflammatory cytokine levels, AD-related factors, inflammation-related signaling, and cell death. Pgrmc1 knockout (KO) mice had higher IL-1beta levels after treatment with LPS compared with those of wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, Pgrmc1 KO mice had higher levels of inflammatory factors, endoplasmic reticulum stress indicators, and AD-associated markers compared with those of WT mice who underwent LPS treatment or not. Finally, these indicators were observed in vitro using U373-MG astrocytes. In conclusion, the loss of PGRMC1 may promote neuroinflammation and lead to AD.
