36973676|a|INTRODUCTION: Constipation can be one of the biggest health problems for the older people that has negative effects on their quality of life. Some studies have reported that new non-pharmacological interventions such auricular acupressure have promising results in the management of constipation. This study was performed to investigate the effect of auricular acupressure on constipation and health-related quality of life in the older people living in the residential care home. METHODS: Sample of this randomized clinical trial consisted of 53 older people with chronic constipation living in a residential care home in the southeast of Iran (Kerman city). The participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 27) and control (n = 26) groups. Auricular acupressure was applied to seven auricular acupoints (large intestine, rectum, San Jiao, spleen, lung, sympathetic, and subcortex) using Vaccaria seeds for the intervention group and for the control group, seedless auricular plasters were used at the seven auricular acupoints for 10 days. Data were collected before the intervention, end of the intervention, and 10-day follow-up using demographic and clinical, Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptom, and Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life questionnaires. The SPSS-22 software was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The difference between groups and times was significant in constipation and related quality of life and scores. The mean score of constipation at the end of intervention was 0.41 less in the intervention group than the control group (P < 0.0001). This mean score, in the intervention group also on the 10-day follow-up was 0.09 less than the control group (P = 0.004), which indicates a decrease in the severity of constipation symptoms. In the intervention group, mean score of quality of life related to constipation at the end of intervention and the 10-day follow-up was 0.56 and 0.19 less than the control group (Decrease in the mean score of quality of life related to constipation indicates an improvement in the quality of life) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results showed the positive effect of auricular acupressure on reducing the severity of constipation symptoms and improving the quality of life in old patients living in the residential care home. This non-pharmaceutical practice can be used by nurses as an inexpensive, safe, acceptable, and non-invasive nursing care for older people with constipation in homes, medical centers, or nursing homes.
