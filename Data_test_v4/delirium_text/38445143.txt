38445143|t|A Comprehensive Review of Inhaled Nitric Oxide Therapy: Current Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions.
38445143|a|This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted landscape of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy, tracing its historical evolution, mechanisms of action, clinical applications, challenges, and future directions. The nitric oxide signaling pathway, characterized by vasodilatory effects and anti-inflammatory properties, forms the foundation of iNO's therapeutic efficacy. Clinical applications are found in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, showcasing its versatility. However, challenges, including cost considerations, technical intricacies, safety concerns, and resistance, highlight the nuanced landscape surrounding iNO therapy. Implications for clinical practice underscore the need for a tailored and evidence-based approach, considering individual patient characteristics and indications. Recommendations for future research emphasize ongoing exploration, novel indications, and the development of targeted therapies. In conclusion, this review positions iNO as a dynamic and adaptable intervention, poised to reshape therapeutic strategies and enhance patient outcomes in critical care.
