38047697|t|Systemic and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for tuberculous meningitis identification and treatment monitoring.
38047697|a|IMPORTANCE: Tuberculous meningitis is a life-threatening infection with high mortality and disability rates. Current diagnostic methods using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples have limited sensitivity and lack predictive biomarkers for evaluating prognosis. This study's findings reveal excessive activation of the immune response during tuberculous meningitis (TBM) infection. Notably, a strong negative correlation was observed between CSF levels of monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG) and the CSF/blood glucose ratio in TBM patients. MIG also exhibited the highest area under the curve with high sensitivity and specificity. This study suggests that MIG may serve as a novel biomarker for differentiating TBM infection in CSF or serum, potentially leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and better patient outcomes.
