33665063|t|Building research in diet and cognition (BRIDGE): Baseline characteristics of older obese African American adults in a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of the Mediterranean diet with and without weight loss on cognitive functioning.
33665063|a|In the United States, >5.4 million people age 65 and older are affected by cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. African Americans are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to suffer from these disorders. Obesity is linked to accelerated age-related cognitive decline, and weight loss through caloric restriction is a potential strategy to prevent this cognitive impairment. Adherence to a healthful dietary pattern, such as the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), has also shown positive effects on reducing risk for dementia. African Americans are disproportionately affected by obesity and have less healthful diets than non-Hispanic whites. We present baseline characteristics from a three-arm randomized controlled trial that randomized 185 obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m2 and <= 50 kg/m2) healthy older adults (55-85 years of age) to: 1) Typical Diet Control (TDC); 2) MedDiet alone (MedDiet-A) intervention; or 3) MedDiet caloric restricted intervention to promote weight loss (MedDiet-WL). The majority of the sample was African American (91.4%) and female (85.9%). The two active interventions (MedDiet-A and MedDiet-WL) met once weekly for 8 months, and the TDC received weekly general health newsletters. Baseline data were collected between January 2017 and July 2019 in Chicago, IL. In our sample, closer adherence to a MedDiet pattern was associated with higher attention and information processing (AIP) and higher executive functioning (EF). Consistent with the literature, we saw that older participants performed more poorly on the cognitive assessments than younger participants, and women outperformed men across verbally mediated tasks, especially ones related to learning and memory.
