37542831|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease with continuous brain changes and has caused a severe burden on families and society. Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJD) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine formula that can improve AD animals' cognitive impairment. This study recruited 50 AD patients who were divided into two groups, one receiving donepezil (DON) treatment and the other receiving DON + HLJD treatment for 3 months. The curative effect, inflammatory and oxidative stress levels were analyzed. The PES-D/11, MMSE, and ADL scales were used to evaluate traditional Chinese medicine syndrome elements, cognitive function, mental state, and life ability. There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics and vital sign indicators. After drug treatment, the results showed that AD patients with HLJD combined with DON treatment didn't increase the adverse effects and had good compliance. HLJD combined with DON could improve the disease syndrome, making the differences in PES-D/11, MMSE, and ADL scores before and after the intervention larger. Furthermore, both DON and DON+HLJD treatment inhibited the levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and MDA, raised SOD level, and HLJD enhances the inhibitory effect of DON on inflammation and oxidative stress. IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and MDA levels were significantly correlated with curative effect. Moreover, this study found 107 (206) up-regulated metabolites and 1430 (145) down-regulated metabolites in urine (serum) and conducted differential metabolite screening and correlation analysis suggesting that HLJD may interfere with oxidative stress and inflammation in AD by regulating lipid metabolism and glutamic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid, diaminopimelic acid, and 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid may play an important role in HLJD to improve AD.
