19082414|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative delirium is a common complication in the elderly whose pathophysiology is not well known. It seems to be related to central cholinergic activity. A literature review was undertaken to describe the etiology, diagnosis, prophylactic strategies, and treatment of postoperative delirium. CONTENTS: Probable etiologies, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of postoperative delirium in the elderly were described. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative delirium is higher in the elderly, and prophylactic measures should be taken to reduce the mortality associated with this complication.
