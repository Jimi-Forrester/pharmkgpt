39111273|a|Air pollution is a critical global issue with extensive implications beyond respiratory health, significantly affecting neurological and psychiatric disorders. Emerging evidence establishes a link between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM < 2.5 microm), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and heightened risks of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Mechanistic pathways include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Epidemiological studies indicate increased susceptibility among urban residents, particularly men, middle-aged individuals, and married persons, to the mental health impacts of air pollution. Additionally, socioeconomic factors, such as GDP per capita, access to health resources, green spaces, and sports facilities, modulate these health outcomes. Addressing this public health challenge necessitates stricter industrial emission controls, sustainable agricultural practices, promotion of cleaner energy sources, and incorporation of pollution exposure history into clinical assessments. Enhanced public awareness and interdisciplinary research are vital for mitigating the detrimental effects of air pollution on neurological and psychiatric health, ultimately striving for a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations.
