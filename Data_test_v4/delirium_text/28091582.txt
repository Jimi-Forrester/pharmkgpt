28091582|a|The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises thirty percent of the newly translated proteins in eukaryotic cells. The quality control mechanism within the ER distinguishes between properly and improperly folded proteins and ensures that unwanted proteins are retained in the ER and subsequently degraded through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Besides cleaning of misfolded proteins ERAD is also important for physiological processes by regulating the abundance of normal proteins of the ER. Thus it is important to unreveal the regulation patterns of ERAD. Here, we describe that ERAD pathway is regulated by androgen, where its inhibitor SVIP was downregulated, all other ERAD genes were upregulated. Consistently, androgen treatment increased the degradation rate of ERAD substrates. Using several independent techniques, we showed that this regulation is through androgen receptor transactivation. ERAD genes found to be upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and silencing expression of Hrd1, SVIP, and gp78 reduced the in vitro migration and malignant transformation of LNCaP cells. Our data suggests that expression levels of ERAD components are regulated by androgens, that promotes ERAD proteolytic activity, which is positively related with prostate tumorigenesis.
