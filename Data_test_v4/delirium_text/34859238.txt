34859238|t|A review of neurotoxicities associated with immunotherapy and a framework for evaluation.
34859238|a|Immuno-oncology agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies, are increasing in use for a growing list of oncologic indications. While harnessing the immune system against cancer cells has a potent anti-tumor effect, it can also cause widespread autoimmune toxicities that limit therapeutic potential. Neurologic toxicities have unique presentations and can progress rapidly, necessitating prompt recognition. In this article, we review the spectrum of central and peripheral neurologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with ICI therapies, emphasizing a diagnostic framework that includes consideration of the therapy regimen, timing of symptom onset, presence of non-neurologic irAEs, pre-existing neurologic disease, and syndrome specific features. In addition, we review the immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) associated with CAR-T cell therapy and address diagnostic challenges specific to patients with brain metastases. As immunotherapy use grows, so too will the number of patients affected by neurotoxicity. There is an urgent need to understand pathogenic mechanisms, predictors, and optimal treatments of these toxicities, so that we can manage them without sacrificing anti-tumor efficacy.
