32987811|a|Heat Shock Protein A2 (HSPA2) is a member of the HSPA (HSP70) chaperone family and has a critical role for male fertility. HSPA2 is present in a number of somatic organs. Limited evidence suggests that HSPA2 may be involved in regulating epithelial cell differentiation. HSPA2 also emerged as a cancer-related chaperone; however, no consensus on its functional significance has been reached so far. In this study, we compared the phenotypic effects of HSPA2 deficit in non-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), and in lung, breast, and cervical cancer cells. We used various techniques to inhibit the HSPA2 gene expression in order to examine the impact of HSPA2 deficiency on cell growth, migration, adhesion, and invasion. Our results show that HBEC but not cancer cells are sensitive to HSPA2 deficit. HSPA2 knockdown in HBEC cells impaired their clone-forming ability and adhesiveness. Thus, our results indicate that epithelial cells can rely on a specific activity of HSPA2, but such dependence can be lost in epithelial cells that have undergone malignant transformation.
