37282449|a|Data from studies analyzing the differentiation and functional connectivity of embryonic neural tissue grafted into the mammalian nervous system has led to the clinical testing of the fetal graft approach in patients with neurodegenerative disease. While some success has been achieved, ethical concerns have led to a search for alternative therapeutic strategies, mostly exploring the use of neural precursors or neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells to replace damaged host neurons and restore lost circuitries. These more recent studies address questions of graft viability, differentiation, and connectivity similar to those posed by researchers in earlier fetal transplant work, thus reviews of the fetal graft literature may inform and help guide ongoing research in the stem cell/organoid field. This brief review describes some key observations from research into the transplantation of neural tissue into the rat visual system, focusing on grafts of the fetal superior colliculus (tectal grafts) into neonatal or adult hosts. In neonate hosts, grafts quickly develop connections with the underlying host midbrain and attain a morphology typical of mature grafts by about 2 weeks. Grafts consistently contain numerous localized regions which, based on neurofibrillar staining, neuronal morphology (Golgi), neurochemistry, receptor expression, and glial architecture, are homologous to the stratum griseum superficiale of normal superior colliculus. These localized "patches" are also seen after explant culture and when donor tectal tissue is dissociated and reaggregated prior to transplantation. In almost all circumstances, host retinal innervation is restricted to these localized patches, but only those that are located adjacent to the graft surface. Synapses are formed and there is evidence of functional drive. The only exception occurs when Schwann cells are added to dissociated tecta prior to reaggregation. In these co-grafts, the peripheral glia appear to compete with local target factors and host retinal ingrowth is more widespread. Other afferent systems (e.g., host cortex, serotonin) show different patterns of innervation. The host cortical input originates more from extrastriate regions and establishes functional excitatory synapses with grafted neurons. Finally, when grafted into optic tract lesions in adult rat hosts, spontaneously regrowing host retinal axons retain the capacity to selectively innervate the localized patches in embryonic tectal grafts, showing that the specific affinities between adult retinal axons and their targets are not lost during regeneration. While the research described here provides some pertinent information about development and plasticity in visual pathways, a more general aim is to highlight how the review of the extensive fetal graft literature may aid in an appreciation of the positive (and negative) factors that influence survival, differentiation, connectivity and functionality of engineered cells and organoids transplanted into the central nervous system.
