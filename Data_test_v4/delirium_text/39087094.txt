39087094|a|BACKGROUND: The totally preperitoneal (TPP) approach is a new concept that was recently introduced. Although the TPP approach combined with single-incision laparoscopic hernia repair has its own advantages, there is little evidence reflecting the characteristics and feasibility of either approach. AIM: To analyze the potential applications of single-incision laparoscopic TPP (SIL-TPP) inguinal hernia hernioplasty for the treatment of inguinal hernias. METHODS: A total of 152 SIL-TPP surgeries were performed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University from February 2019 to November 2022. A single-port, named Iconport, and standard laparoscopic instruments were used during the operation. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters and short-term postoperative outcomes were collected and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The demographic data of 152 patients underwent SIL-TPP were shown in Table 1. The average age was 49.5 years (range from 21 to 81 years). The average body mass index was 27.7 kg/m2 (range from 17.7 kg/m2 to 35.6 kg/m2). SIL-TPP were conducted successfully in 147 patients. Three patients were converted to the SIL-transabdominal preperitoneal laparoscopic herniorrhaphy at the initial stage of the study due to a lack of experience. In 2 patients with incisional hernias, an auxiliary operation hole was added during the SIL-TPP procedure, as required for surgery. The mean operative time was 64.5 minutes (range: 36.0-110.0 minutes) for unilateral direct and femoral hernias and 81.6 minutes for indirect hernias (range: 40.0-150.0 minutes). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 3.4 days. CONCLUSION: SIL-TPP is feasible and has advantages for inguinal hernia repair. SIL-TPP has potential benefits for patients with various abdominal wall hernias. Consequently, doctors should be encouraged to actively apply the TPP approach combined with a single incision in their daily work.
