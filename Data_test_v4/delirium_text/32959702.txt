32959702|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with multi-pathways pathogenesis. Sildenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor with a potential benefit in the treatment of AD. This study investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the effect of sildenafil in AD with emphasis on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Twenty-four adult male rats were classified into four groups; control group: received vehicles, sildenafil-control: received sildenafil (15 mg/kg/day, p.o.), AD group received Aluminum (25 mg/kg/day, p.o.), AD-treated group: received sildenafil (15 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 6 weeks. AD was assessed by memory performance test and confirmed by histopathological examination and immunostaining of, neurogenesis marker nestin and alpha-synuclein. The levels of VEGF-A, VCAM-1, oxidative stress markers and TNF-alpha in brain tissue were evaluated. AD rats showed histopathological evidences of AD; along with increased latency time in the memory test. There was a decrease in VEGF-A, and an increase in VCAM-1, TNF-alpha, and oxidative stress markers. Immunohistochemical study showed a significant increase in alpha-synuclein and a significant decrease in nestin expressions in brain tissues. Sildenafil administration ameliorated the histopathological changes and decreased latency time. Such effect was associated with a decrease in VCAM-1, TNF-alpha and oxidative stress as well as an increase in VEGF-A. Sildenafil caused a significant increase in nestin and a decrease in alpha-synuclein immunostaining. These findings suggested a protective effect of sildenafil via modulation of VEGF-A, and VCAM-1.
