31389866|t|Effect of Perioperative Mental Status on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Adult Spinal Deformities.
31389866|a|STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the impact of mental status on the clinical outcomes of patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Limited information is currently available on how preoperative mental status affects postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with ASD. METHODS: We enrolled 165 patients with ASD who underwent corrective surgery at a single university hospital between March 2010 and September 2015. We compared Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores using various x-ray parameters at these time points: preoperative period and postoperative 2 years. Additionally, to determine the associations between perioperative complications and mental health disorders, we examined these x-ray parameters: lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, sacral slope, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and T1 pelvic angle (TPA). RESULTS: We found correlations between the preoperative SRS-22r total score and preoperative ODI (r = -0.692, P < 0.01) and postoperative ODI (r = -0.443, P < 0.01). Preoperative SRS-22r mental domain correlated with preoperative ODI (r = -0.561, P <= 0.01) and postoperative ODI (r = -0.315, P <= 0.01). Perioperative (preoperative and postoperative) SRS-22r mental domain did not correlate with the postoperative x-ray parameters except for SVA and TPA. Postoperative mental health correlated with early infection (P < 0.05), hematoma (P < 0.05), deep vein thrombosis (P < 0.05), and delirium (P < 0.05). Regression analysis revealed that preoperative SRS-22r mental health score correlated with preoperative ODI (P < 0.001) and postoperative ODI (P < 0.001). The regression coefficient number between preoperative SRS-22r mental health score and perioperative (preoperative and postoperative) ODI improved from -17.3 to -10.2 from preoperative to postoperative periods. CONCLUSION: Diminished preoperative mental health worsened postoperative HRQOL. Perioperative complications influence postoperative mental status and HRQOL; hence, screening preoperative mental health is important. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
