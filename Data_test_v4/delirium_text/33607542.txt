33607542|a|With a constantly growing elderly population worldwide, a focus on developing efficient prevention and therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) seems timely and topical. Emphasis on natural medicine is increasingly popular in the search for drug candidates that are capable of preventing and treating AD related pathology, particularly where suppression of amyloid accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are equally significant. A number of phytochemical compounds have been shown to collectively reduce these AD hallmarks with the progression of natural drug candidates into human clinical trials. This review focuses on current research surrounding the therapies emerging within natural medicines and their related therapeutic potential for AD treatment.
