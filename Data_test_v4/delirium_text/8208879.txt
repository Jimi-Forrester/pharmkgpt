8208879|t|A short form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE): development and cross-validation.
8208879|a|Data from four studies were used to assess the psychometric properties of the 26 IQCODE items. The items were assessed in terms of item-total correlations, test-retest reliabilities, correlations with indicators of current cognitive functioning and correlations with indicators of premorbid cognitive functioning. These data were used to develop a 16-item short form. The short form was cross-validated in a new sample using dementia/delirium diagnosis as the validity standard. It was found to perform as well as the long form.
