16327356|a|This analysis presents a recruitment, retention, and (treatment and/or research) adherence (RRA) best practices model for targeting Alzheimer disease and associated dementias (ADAD) impacting ethnically diverse populations. RRA practice involves many more factors beyond cultural considerations to be highlighted here. However, it is the cultural dimension where much is at stake, where there is the least comprehensive framework, and where the most ambiguity exists relative to RRA practice. The discussion proceeds on three premises. First, a composite, culturally attuned RRA working model can be assembled from the current literature. Second, culturally speaking, recruitment, retention, and adherence are essentially linked processes. Although each of the components of RRA practice has its own unique set of tasks, culture permeates them all. Third, any RRA practice model that emerges must be tailored to the communities, the specific target populations, and the programmatic circumstances to which the effort is attached.
