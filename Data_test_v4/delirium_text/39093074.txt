39093074|a|Background: The September 11, 2001, catastrophe unleashed widespread destruction beyond the World Center (WTC), with fires and toxic gases leaving lasting impacts. First responders at Ground Zero faced prolonged exposure to hazardous particulate matter (PM), resulting in chronic health challenges. Among the multitude of health concerns, the potential association between the WTCPM and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as an area of intense inquiry, probing the intricate interplay between environmental factors and neurodegenerative diseases. Objective: We posit that a genetic predisposition to AD in mice results in dysregulation of the gut-brain axis following chronic exposure to WTCPM. This, in turn, may heighten the risk of AD-like symptoms in these individuals. Methods: 3xTg-AD and WT mice were intranasally administered with WTCPM collected at Ground Zero within 72 hours after the attacks. Working memory and learning and recognition memory were monitored for 4 months. Moreover, brain transcriptomic analysis and gut barrier permeability along with microbiome composition were examined. Results: Our findings underscore the deleterious effects of WTCPM on cognitive function, as well as notable alterations in brain genes associated with synaptic plasticity, pro-survival, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Complementary, chronic exposure to the WTCPM led to increased gut permeability in AD mice and altered bacteria composition and expression of functional pathways in the gut. Conclusions: Our results hint at a complex interplay between gut and brain axis, suggesting potential mechanisms through which WTCPM exposure may exacerbate cognitive decline. Identifying these pathways offers opportunities for tailored interventions to alleviate neurological effects among first responders.
