31888015|a|Background: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Previous reports have suggested MF is associated with inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, increased cardiovascular risk factors as well as secondary neoplasms. Methods: A cross-sectional study of MF patients seen from 2013 to 2019 was performed. Comorbidities were selected based on the 2015 Medicare report highlighting the most common chronic medical illnesses in the United States. Lifetime comorbidity occurrence in patients with MF were compared with that in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and patients without MF. Additional analyses were performed with patients sub-stratified by race. Results: Compared to control groups, MF was strongly associated with lymphomatoid papulosis and Hodgkin's disease, but not significantly associated with lung, breast or colon cancer. Interestingly, the association with lymphomatoid papulosis was observed in Caucasians (CI 1062-4338; p < 0.001) and not African Americans (p = 0.9). Patients with MF had a greater association with congestive heart failure, hypertension (HT) and hyperlipidemia (HLD) compared with the general population. However, they were significantly less likely to have HT and HLD when compared with psoriasis patients (HT CI: 0.6-0.9; p < 0.001, and HLD CI: 0.05-0.07; p < 0.001). MF patients were also significantly less likely to have concomitant vitamin D deficiency compared with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the association of MF with lymphomatoid papulosis varies by race. Compared to the general population, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were positively associated with MF, however, these were significantly less likely on comparison to psoriasis. Unlike previously described, vitamin D deficiency was found to be significantly less in patients with MF.
