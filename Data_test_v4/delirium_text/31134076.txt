31134076|t|Regulation of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) Signaling Pathway by Polyphenols in the Treatment of Age-Linked Neurodegenerative Diseases: Focus on TLR4 Signaling.
31134076|a|Neuronal dysfunction initiates several intracellular signaling cascades to release different proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as various reactive oxygen species. In addition to neurons, microglia, and astrocytes are also affected by this signaling cascade. This release can either be helpful, neutral or detrimental for cell survival. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate and signal their downstream pathway to activate NF-kappaB and pro-IL-1beta, both of which are responsible for neuroinflammation and linked to the pathogenesis of different age-related neurological conditions. However, herein, recent aspects of polyphenols in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are assessed, with a focus on TLR regulation by polyphenols. Different polyphenol classes, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, stilbenes, and lignans can potentially target TLR signaling in a distinct pathway. Further, some polyphenols can suppress overexpression of inflammatory mediators through TLR4/NF-kappaB/STAT signaling intervention, while others can reduce neuronal apoptosis via modulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB-pathway in microglia/macrophages. Indeed, neurodegeneration etiology is complex and yet to be completely understood, it may be that targeting TLRs could reveal a number of molecular and pharmacological aspects related to neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, activating TLR signaling modulation via natural resources could provide new therapeutic potentiality in the treatment of neurodegeneration.
