34318654|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular functions via protein-protein interactions and has been most studied with respect to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormal processing of the single transmembrane-spanning C99 fragment of APP contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques, which are causally related to AD. Pathological C99 accumulation is thought to associate with early cognitive defects in AD. Here, unexpectedly, sequence analysis revealed that C99 exhibits 24% sequence identity with the KCNE1 voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel beta subunit, comparable to the identity between KCNE1 and KCNE2-5 (21-30%). This suggested the possibility of C99 regulating Kv channels. METHODS: We quantified the effects of C99 on Kv channel function, using electrophysiological analysis of subunits expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, biochemical and immunofluorescence techniques. RESULTS: C99 isoform-selectively inhibited (by 30-80%) activity of a range of Kv channels. Among the KCNQ (Kv7) family, C99 isoform-selectively inhibited, shifted the voltage dependence and/or slowed activation of KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ5, with no effects on KCNQ1, KCNQ1-KCNE1 or KCNQ4. C99/APP co-localized with KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in adult rat sciatic nerve nodes of Ranvier. Both C99 and full-length APP co-immunoprecipitated with KCNQ2 in vitro, yet unlike C99, APP only weakly affected KCNQ2/3 activity. Finally, C99 altered the effects on KCNQ2/3 function of inhibitors tetraethylammounium and XE991, but not openers retigabine and ICA27243. CONCLUSION: Our findings raise the possibility of C99 accumulation early in AD altering cellular excitability by modulating Kv channel activity.
