38128884|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related neurodegenerative disease, and the main pathological feature was beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) deposition. Recently, bioactive materials-based drug delivery system has been widely investigated for the treatment of AD. In this study, we developed a red blood cells (RBC) membrane-coated polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles (NPs) loading with a therapeutic agent for AD, curcumin (Cur). A functional peptide TGNYKALHPHN (TGN) was conjugated to the surface of membrane for blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport (TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur). TGN peptide can be recognized by receptors on the BBB and has great potential for brain transport. To confirm the targeted delivery of Cur to the brain, a cell co-culturing immortalized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and human brain astrocytes glioblastoma (hCMEC/D3 and U-118MG) in vitro model was established. As a result, the BBB transporting ratio of TGN-RBC-NPs-FITC was 29.64% at 12 h which was approximately eight-fold than RBC-NPs-FITC. The improvement of drug accumulation in the AD lesion was confirmed by the NPs modified with the BBB-penetrating peptide in the fluorescence imaging and quantitative analysis with UPLC-MS/MS in vivo. The neuroprotective effects were evaluated with new object recognition behavioral test, in vitro AD cell model, dendritic spine stain, GFAP and IBA1 immunofluorescence stain. The spatial learning and memory abilities of the AD model mice treated with TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur were obviously enhanced compared with the AD control mice and were also better than Cur at the same dosage. These results were consistent with the values of protection index of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) treated by Abeta25-35. TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur increased the dendritic segments densities and restrained activation of microglia and astrocytes of AD mice, as well as reversed cognitive function of AD mice. All of the results demonstrated TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur a promising therapeutic strategy for delaying the progression of AD by designing biomimetic nanosystems to deliver drugs into the brain.
