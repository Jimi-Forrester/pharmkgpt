We aimed to investigate an association of biochemical markers including calcium, vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), parathormone (PTH), and phosphorous with PD. METHODS: This study was conducted on 139 PD patients and 100 healthy individuals. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, ALP, PTH and vitamin D were evaluated. Furthermore, student's t-test and logistic regression models were used by SPSS. RESULTS: The mean levels of calcium (9.4+-0.7 and 9.0+-0.8 ) and vitamin D (29.7+-22.1 and 25.8+-23.7) were higher in PD patients as compared with healthy controls, which only status of calcium being significantly different in the two groups (P<0.001). Levels of ALP (202.4+-96.7 and 242.9+-142.4) and phosphorous (3.6+-0.6 and 4.22+-1.1) were significantly different comparing PD patients with healthy subjects (P<0.01, P<0.001, respectively). ALP and phosphorous were significantly different in the two groups (OR=0.996, [CI 95%, 0.994-0.999], P<0.001, OR=0.475, [CI 95%, 0.325-0.694], P<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, increased levels of calcium resulted in an elevated risk of PD (OR=2.175, [CI 95% 1.377-3.435], P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Results show that mean levels of calcium are higher in PD patients relative to healthy controls. Thereby, higher levels of calcium may be associated with PD.
