36847004|t|Normative Scores on the Norwegian Version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.
36847004|a|BACKGROUND: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a simple test for measuring global cognitive function, is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults. To decide whether a score on the test indicates a significant deviation from the mean score, normative scores should be defined. Moreover, because the test may vary depending on its translation and cultural differences, normative scores should be established for national versions of the MMSE. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine normative scores for the third Norwegian version of the MMSE. METHODS: We used data from two sources: the Norwegian Registry of Persons Assessed for Cognitive Symptoms (NorCog) and the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT). After persons with dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and disorders that may cause cognitive impairment were excluded, the sample contained 1,050 cognitively healthy persons, 860 from NorCog, and 190 from HUNT, whose data we subjected to regression analyses. RESULTS: The normative MMSE score varied from 25 to 29, depending on years of education and age. More years of education and younger age were associated with higher MMSE scores, and years of education was the strongest predictor. CONCLUSION: Mean normative MMSE scores depend on test takers' years of education and age, with level of education being the strongest predictor.
