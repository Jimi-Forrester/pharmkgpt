32156981|t|[Surgical Treatment for Extremely Elderly Patients Over 90 Years of Age with Colorectal Cancer].
32156981|a|We report 18 cases of colorectalcancer in patients aged over 90 years who received surgicaltreatment . Except for 2 patients who had StageIV colorectal cancer, all patients underwent R0 colorectal resection. The mean operation time, blood loss, and length of hospitalization were 167 min, 115 mL, and 23.5 days, respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients(83%), of which the most common was delirium. All the patients were discharged safely. We treated them successfully with a collaborative medical team that included experienced staffs for rehabilitation, oral care, skin care, and mentalcare; socialworkers; and others. Regarding the surgicaltreatment for elderly patients with colorectalcancer who are over 90 years of age, not only perioperative treatment but also post-discharge comprehensive and palliative care must be considered.
