38535243|t|Enhancing the Antifouling Properties of Alumina Nanoporous Membranes by GO/MOF Impregnated Polymer Coatings: In Vitro Studies.
38535243|a|Nanoporous membranes (NPMBs) have been the focus of interest of many scientists in the last decade. However, the fouling phenomenon that takes place during the implantation period blocks pores and causes failure in the local implant. In this study, alumina NPMBs were developed using electrochemical anodization through two steps. Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO), free and impregnated with ZIF-8 MOF, was synthesized and loaded in a mixture of PVDF/PVP polymer matrix at different ratios, and was applied to the produced NPMBs using spin-coater. The NPMBs were characterized before and after coating by SEM/EDX, TEM, FTIR, XRD, contact angle and AFM. The antifouling features of the NPMBs were analyzed against two different bacterial species. The prepared alumina NPMBs demonstrated homogeneous porous structures with pore sizes ranging from 36 to 39 nm. The coated layers were proven to possess microporous coatings on the surfaces of the NPMBs. The numbers of released ions (Al and Zn) from the coated NPMBs were below the allowed limits. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) uptake in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was impressively reduced with the presence of coating materials. In addition, the antifouling behavior of the coated NPMBs against the selected strains of bacteria was greatly enhanced compared with the pure alumina NPMBs. Finally, NPMBs' uncoated and polymer-coated membranes were tested for their ability to deliver donepezil HCl. The results reveal the downregulation of donepezil release, especially from NPMBs coated with PVDF/PVP 0.5GO. It is advised to use the current antifouling materials and techniques to overcome the limitations of the inorganic NPMBs implants.
