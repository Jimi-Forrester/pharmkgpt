32719902|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system, and several neurological symptoms have been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We describe a 48-year-old Caucasian woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by the onset of word finding difficulties, effortful speech along with prosody distortion, in the context of spared semantic and syntactic abilities. The clinical picture, perceived as foreign accent syndrome (FAS), was not associated with structural and functional imaging changes or neurophysiological assessment abnormalities. We suggest that FAS, herein perceived as a regional accent syndrome, should be considered a possible additional neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2.
