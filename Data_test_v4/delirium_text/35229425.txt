35229425|a|Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (alphaS-nChap) for alpha-synuclein to regulate its assembly. The alphaS-nChap is capable of i) specifically recognizing alpha-synuclein; ii) dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric alpha-synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii) tightly capturing oligomeric alpha-synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv) transporting alpha-synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of alpha-synuclein assembly by alphaS-nChap was studied in vitro. Moreover, the role of alphaS-nChap preventing alpha-synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that alphaS-nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease.
