However, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Surgery-triggered neuroinflammation is a major contributor to the development of PNDs. Neuroinflammation can influence N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) expression or function which is closely associated with cognition. We, therefore, hypothesized that the persistent changes in NMDAR expression or function induced by transient neuroinflammation after surgery were involved in the development of PNDs. METHODS: Eighteen-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to abdominal surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia to establish the PNDs animal model. Then, we determined the transient neuroinflammation by detecting the protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines and microglia activation using ELISA, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and microglial morphological analysis from postoperative days 1-20. Persistent changes in NMDAR expression were determined by detecting the protein levels of NMDAR subunits from postoperative days 1-59. Subsequently, the dysfunction of synaptic NMDAR was evaluated by detecting the structural plasticity of dendritic spine using Golgi staining. Pull-down assay and western blot were used to detect the protein levels of Rac1-GTP, phosphor-cofilin, and Arp3, which contribute to the regulation of the structural plasticity of dendritic spine. Finally, glycyrrhizin, an anti-inflammatory agent, was administered to further explore the role of synaptic NMDAR dysfunction induced by transient neuroinflammation in the neuropathogenesis of PNDs. RESULTS: We showed that transient neuroinflammation induced by surgery caused sustained downregulation of synaptic NR2A and NR2B subunits in the dorsal hippocampus and led to a selective long-term spatial memory deficit. Meanwhile, the detrimental effect of neuroinflammation on the function of synaptic NMDARs was shown by the impaired structural plasticity of dendritic spines and decreased activity of the Rac1 signaling pathways during learning. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory treatment reversed the downregulation and hypofunction of synaptic NR2A and NR2B and subsequently rescued the long-term spatial memory deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify sustained synaptic NR2A and NR2B downregulation and hypofunction induced by transient neuroinflammation following surgery as important contributors to the development of PNDs in elderly rats.
