37138256|a|BACKGROUND: The evidence on the psychological consequences of coronavirus 2019 mainly relates to general psychiatric problems, and a few studies have reported the incidence and predictors of obsessive-compulsive disorder. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its predictors in Iranian COVID - 19 recovered individuals at 3-6 months, 6-12 months, and 12-18 months after recovery. METHOD: In this cross-sectional analytical study, 300 participants were randomly selected based on the inclusion criteria from three hospitals in three different regions of Tehran, Iran, and were assessed by the Clinical Demographic Information Questionnaire, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS21), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The obtained data were analyzed with SPSS version 26. RESULTS: The results showed that the mean score of OCD is 30.58 +- 15.22, with a prevalence of 71% (n = 213). Female gender (BF = 0.50, p = 0.01), sleep disturbance (BF = 0.02, p = 0.001), PTSD (BF = 0.009, p = 0.0001), depression (BF = 0.0001, p = 0.0001), and stress (BF = 0.0001, p = 0.001) are the strongest predictors of the presence of OCD in recovered COVID - 19 individuals. CONCLUSION: OCD-like symptoms was observed in the majority of COVID - 19 recovered individuals with mild to moderate severity. In addition, the stated prevalence, severity, and significance varied according to sociodemographic and health inequalities.
