14605735|a|OBJECTIVE: We intended to analyze the influence of postoperative delirium on postoperative morbidity and length of hospital stay. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 153 patients undergoing elective arterial surgery were studied prospectively. Patients were examined postoperatively by a psychiatrist daily from days 1 to 7. Delirium was diagnosed according to standardised criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). The severity of delirium was quantified using the Delirium Rating Scale. We compared patients without delirium to those who developed postoperative delirium using univariate statistical analysis (t-test, chi (2) test, and Fisher's test). RESULTS: Sixty patients (39.2%) developed postoperative delirium. They removed catheters significantly more frequently than patients without delirium and had more catheter-related infections. Their length of stay in intensive care units was higher, as was their total postoperative length of stay in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who developed postoperative delirium have significantly more complications and increased postoperative length of stay in hospital and intensive care units.
