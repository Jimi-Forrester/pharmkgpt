22180671|t|Regulating caspase-1 during infection: roles of NLRs, AIM2, and ASC.
22180671|a|Pathogens are detected by a variety of innate immune sensors in host cells leading to rapid induction of cell autonomous responses. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion and a specialized form of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis are induced during infection through activation of caspase-1. Pathogen-induced caspase-1 activation is regulated in large part by a vast array of cystosolic sensor proteins, including NLRs and AIM2, and an adaptor protein called ASC. Together, these proteins cooperate in forming caspase-1 activation platforms and, more importantly, direct caspase-1 toward cytokine secretion or cell death.
