36229920|t|NRSF regulates age-dependently cognitive ability and its conditional knockout in APP/PS1 mice moderately alters ad-like pathology.
36229920|a|NRSF/REST plays a key role in neuronal homeostasis as a transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes. NRSF/REST relates to cognitive preservation and longevity of humans, but its specific functions in age-dependent and Alzheimer's disease (ad)-related memory deficits remain unclear. Here we show that conditional NRSF/REST knockout either in the dorsal telencephalon or specially in neurons induced an age-dependently diminished retrieval performance in spatial or fear conditioning memory tasks and altered hippocampal synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The NRSF/REST deficient mice were also characterized by an increase of activated glial cells, complement C3 protein, and the transcription factor C/EBPbeta in the cortex and hippocampus. Reduction of NRSF/REST by conditional depletion upregulated the activation of astrocytes in APP/PS1 mice, and increased the C3-positive glial cells, but did not alter the Abeta loads and memory retrieval performances of 6- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Simultaneously, overexpression of NRSF/REST improved cognitive abilities of aged WT, but not in ad mice. These findings demonstrated that NRSF/REST is essential for the preservation of memory performance and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity during aging and takes potential roles in the onset of age-related memory impairments. However, while altering the glial activation, NRSF/REST deficiency does not interfere with the Abeta deposits, and the electrophysiological and cognitive ad-like pathologies.
