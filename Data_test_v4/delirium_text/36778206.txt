36778206|a|Testes produce sperms, and gamete generation relies on a proper niche environment. The disruption of hierarchical regulatory homeostasis in Leydig or Sertoli cells may evoke a sterile phenotype in humans. In this study, we recapitulated type 2 diabetes mellitus by using a high-fat diet- (HFD-) fed mouse model to identify the phenotype and potential mechanism of diabetes-induced testicular impairment. At the end of the study, blood glucose levels, testosterone structure, testicular antioxidant capacity, and testosterone level and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor- (HIF-) 1alpha, apoptosis-related protein cleaved-caspase3, and autophagy-related proteins such as LC3I/II, p62, and Beclin1 were evaluated. We found that long-term HFD treatment causes the development of diabetes mellitus, implicating increased serum glucose level, cell apoptosis, and testicular atrophy (P < 0.05 vs. Ctrl). Mechanistically, the results showed enhanced expression of HIF-1alpha in both Sertoli and Leydig cells (P < 0.05 vs. Ctrl). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were demonstrated to be a potential factor leading to HIF-1alpha upregulation in both cell types. In Sertoli cells, high glucose treatment had minor effects on Sertoli cell autophagy. However, AGE treatment stagnated the autophagy flux and escalated cell apoptosis (P < 0.05 vs. Ctrl+Ctrl). In Leydig cells, high glucose treatment was adequate to encumber autophagy induction and enhance oxidative stress. Similarly, AGE treatment facilitated HIF-1alpha expression and hampered testosterone production (P < 0.05 vs. Ctrl+Ctrl). Overall, these findings highlight the dual effects of diabetes on autophagy regulation in Sertoli and Leydig cells while imposing oxidative stress in both cell types. Furthermore, the upregulation of HIF-1alpha, which could be triggered by AGE treatment, may negatively affect both cell types. Together, these findings will help us further understand the molecular mechanism of diabetes-induced autophagy dysregulation and testicular impairment, enriching the content of male reproductive biology in diabetic patients.
