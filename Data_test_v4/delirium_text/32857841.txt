32857841|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and tau protein are two hallmark proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the parameters, which mediate the abnormal aggregation of Abeta and tau, have not been fully discovered. Here, we have provided an optimum method to purify tau protein isoform 1N4R by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose chromatography under denaturing condition. The biochemical and biophysical properties of the purified protein were further characterized using in vitro tau filament assembly, tubulin polymerization assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Afterwards, we investigated the effect of tau protein on aggregation of Abeta (25-35) peptide using microscopic imaging and cell viability assay. Incubation of tau at physiologic and supra-physiologic concentrations with Abeta25-35 for 40 days under reducing and non-reducing conditions revealed formation of two types of aggregates with distinct morphologies and dimensions. In non-reducing condition, the co-incubated sample showed granular aggregates, while in reducing condition, they formed annular protofibrils. Results from cell viability assay revealed the increased cell viability for the co-incubated sample. Therefore, the disassembling action shown by tau protein on Abeta25-35 suggests the possibility that tau may have a protective role in preventing Abeta peptide from acquiring the cytotoxic, aggregated form against oxidative stress damages.
