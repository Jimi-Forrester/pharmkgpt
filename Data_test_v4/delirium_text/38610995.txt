38610995|a|Centella asiatica has been recognized for centuries in Eastern medicine for its pharmacological properties. Due to the increasing prevalence of oncological diseases worldwide, natural substances that could qualify as anticancer therapeutics are becoming increasingly important subjects of research. This review aims to find an innovative use for asiatic acid (AA) in the treatment or support of cancer therapy. It has been demonstrated that AA takes part in inhibiting phosphorylation, inducing cell death, and reducing tumor growth and metastasis by influencing important signaling pathways, such as PI3K, Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and STAT3, in cancer cells. It is also worth mentioning the high importance of asiatic acid in reducing the expression of markers such as N-cadherin, beta-catenin, claudin-1, and vimentin. Some studies have indicated the potential of asiatic acid to induce autophagy in cancer cells through changes in the levels of specific proteins such as LC3 and p62. It can also act as an anti-tumor immunotherapeutic agent, thanks to its inductive effect on Smad7 in combination with naringenin (an Smad3 inhibitor). It seems that asiatic acid may be a potential anticancer drug or form of adjunctive therapy. Further studies should take into account safety and toxicity issues, as well as limitations related to the pharmacokinetics of AA and its low oral bioavailability.
