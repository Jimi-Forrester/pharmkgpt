39557076|t|Knowledge and Attitudes Toward New Disease-Modifying Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease Among Nursing Home Directors.
39557076|a|OBJECTIVES: Nursing home (NH) administrator perceptions regarding the utility of Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying medications in NHs are important because many short and long-stay residents have mild AD. This study examined the interest of directors of nursing (DoNs) in using new AD disease-modifying treatments, changes in attitudes based on differences in costs to the NH, and characteristics (DoN and NH) associated with such changes. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is based on a 2022 nationally representative survey of 340 NH DoNs, which was drawn from a stratified random sample of US NHs with >=30 beds and with a 26.6% response rate. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis to assess the awareness of new AD disease-modifying treatments and the support for their use. We applied logistic regression models to explore the associations between the interest of the DoN in using these new AD treatments and various characteristics. RESULTS: Most (86%) DoNs stated that they would at least sometimes support the usage of a new disease-modifying medication if there were no NH costs. This percentage was lower if the NH costs per resident were $2000 per year (51.3%) and $20,000 per year (14%). NHs with moderate shares of dual-eligible residents were more sensitive to cost. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicated that the interest of DoNs in using disease-modifying treatments for dementia varies widely according to the cost to the NHs. The uptake of new AD medications in the NH setting should be monitored, and targeted efforts may be needed to mitigate inequities in access for less-resourced NHs.
