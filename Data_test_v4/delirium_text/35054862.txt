35054862|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated and incapacitating neurodegenerative malady that emanates following the dopaminergic (DArgic) nerve cell deprivation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN-PC). The etiopathogenesis of PD is still abstruse. Howbeit, PD is hypothesized to be precipitated by an amalgamation of genetic mutations and exposure to environmental toxins. The aggregation of alpha-synucelin within the Lewy bodies (LBs), escalated oxidative stress (OS), autophagy-lysosome system impairment, ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) impairment, mitochondrial abnormality, programmed cell death, and neuroinflammation are regarded as imperative events that actively participate in PD pathogenesis. The central nervous system (CNS) relies heavily on redox-active metals, particularly iron (Fe) and copper (Cu), in order to modulate pivotal operations, for instance, myelin generation, synthesis of neurotransmitters, synaptic signaling, and conveyance of oxygen (O2). The duo, namely, Fe and Cu, following their inordinate exposure, are viable of permeating across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and moving inside the brain, thereby culminating in the escalated OS (through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-reliant pathway), alpha-synuclein aggregation within the LBs, and lipid peroxidation, which consequently results in the destruction of DArgic nerve cells and facilitates PD emanation. This review delineates the metabolism of Fe and Cu in the CNS, their role and disrupted balance in PD. An in-depth investigation was carried out by utilizing the existing publications obtained from prestigious medical databases employing particular keywords mentioned in the current paper. Moreover, we also focus on decoding the role of metal complexes and chelators in PD treatment. Conclusively, metal chelators hold the aptitude to elicit the scavenging of mobile/fluctuating metal ions, which in turn culminates in the suppression of ROS generation, and thereby prelude the evolution of PD.
