37182889|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system (CNS) with an insidious onset. Clinically, it is characterized by a full range of dementia manifestations including memory impairment, aphasia, loss of speech, loss of use, loss of recognition, impairment of visuospatial skills, and impairment of executive function, as well as changes in personality and behavior. The exact cause of AD has not yet been identified. Nevertheless, modern research indicates that genetic factors contribute to 70% of human's risk of AD. Apolipoprotein (APOE) accounts for up to 90% of the genetic predisposition. APOE is a crucial gene that cannot be overstated. In addition, innate immunity plays a significant role in the etiology and treatment of AD. Understanding the different subtypes of APOE and their interconnections is of paramount importance. APOE and innate immunity, along with their relationship to AD, are primary research motivators for in-depth research and clinical trials. The exploration of novel technologies has led to an increasing trend in the study of AD at the cellular and molecular levels and continues to make more breakthroughs and progress. As of today, there is no effective treatment available for AD around the world. This paper aims to summarize and analyze the role of APOE and innate immunity, as well as development trends in recent years. It is anticipated that APOE and innate immunity will provide a breakthrough for humans to hinder AD progression in the near future.
