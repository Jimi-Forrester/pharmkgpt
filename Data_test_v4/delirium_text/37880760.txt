37880760|t|Influences of comorbidities on perioperative rehabilitation in patients with gastrointestinal cancers: a retrospective study.
37880760|a|BACKGROUND: Older patients are more likely to have comorbidities than younger patients, and multiple comorbidities are associated with mortality in patients with cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that a functional comorbidity index could predict the therapeutic effects of rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigate whether the comorbidities influenced the execution and therapeutic effects of rehabilitation. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 48 patients with gastrointestinal cancer who underwent surgery between January 1 and November 30, 2020, was analyzed. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were calculated based on data derived from medical records. The primary outcomes were ambulation status, duration (days) from the start of postoperative rehabilitation, and length of hospital stay. We investigated the relationship between CCI scores and primary outcomes. RESULTS: The CCI did not correlate with the duration of rehabilitation or the length of hospital stay. Subsequently, patients with functional recovery problems were evaluated, and we identified the conditions that were not included in the list using CCI scores. Most conditions are associated with surgical complications. Furthermore, using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC), we assessed the clinical features of the severity of complications. We found that the length of stay and the duration to start rehabilitation were significantly longer in the patients with higher severity of surgical complications (CDC III) than in those with lower severity (CDC II). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-related conditions may significantly impact the perioperative period more than the original comorbidities. In addition to original comorbidities, events related to surgical complications should be assessed to determine the therapeutic effects of rehabilitation in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.
