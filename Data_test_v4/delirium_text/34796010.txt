34796010|t|Emerging Trends in the Use of Therapeutic Hypothermia as a Method for Neuroprotection in Brain Damage (Review).
34796010|a|The review analyzes current clinical studies on the use of therapeutic hypothermia as a neuroprotective method for treatment of brain damage. This method yields good outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and chronic critical conditions. There has been shown the interest of researchers in studying the preventive potential of therapeutic hypothermia in secondary neuronal damage. There has been described participation of new molecules producing positive effect on tissues and cells of the central nervous system - proteins and hormones of cold stress - in the mechanisms of neuroprotection in the brain. The prospects of using targeted temperature management in treatment of brain damage are considered.
