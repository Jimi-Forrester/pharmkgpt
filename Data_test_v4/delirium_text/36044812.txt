36044812|a|Due to the hugely important roles of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the development of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) focused on cholinesterase (ChE) and Abeta becomes one of the most attractive strategies for combating AD. To date, numerous preclinical studies toward multifunctional conjugates bearing ChE inhibition and anti-Abeta aggregation have been reported. Noteworthily, most of the reported multifunctional cholinesterase inhibitors are carbamate-based compounds due to the initial properties of carbamate moiety. However, because their easy hydrolysis in vivo and the instability of the compound-enzyme conjugate, the mechanism of action of these compounds is rare. Thus, non-carbamate compounds are of great need for developing novel cholinesterase inhibitors. Besides, given that Abeta accumulation begins to occur 10-15 years before AD onset, modulating Abeta is ineffective only in inhibiting its aggregation but not eliminate the already accumulated Abeta if treatment is started when the patient has been diagnosed as AD. Considering the limitation of current Abeta accumulation modulators in ameliorating cognitive deficits and ineffectiveness of ChE inhibitors in blocking disease progression, the development of a practically valuable strategy with multiple pharmaceutical properties including ChE inhibition and Abeta modulation for treating AD is indispensable. In this review, we focus on summarizing the scaffold characteristics of reported non-carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors with Abeta modulation since 2020, and understanding the ingenious multifunctional drug design ideas to accelerate the pace of obtaining more efficient anti-AD drugs in the future.
