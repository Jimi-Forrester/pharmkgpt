23371443|t|No association between an intronic polymorphism in the presenilin-1 gene and Alzheimer disease in a Tunisian population.
23371443|a|We examined the potential involvement of the polymorphism in intron 8 of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), both through independent effect and interaction with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele risk, in 85 patients and 90 controls. We found no significant differences in the distribution of PSEN1 genotype and allele frequency between both groups; and post stratification distribution with APOE epsilon4 allele. Age of onset suggests that this polymorphism influences AD progression.
