36653015|t|Atomic Resolution Insights into pH Shift Induced Deprotonation Events in LS-Shaped Abeta(1-42) Amyloid Fibrils.
36653015|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the deposition of misfolded aggregates of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Abeta(1-42) is one of the most aggregation-prone components in senile plaques of AD patients. We demonstrated that relatively homogeneous Abeta(1-42) fibrils with one predominant fold visible in solid-state NMR spectra can be obtained at acidic pH. The structure of these fibrils differs remarkably from some other polymorphs obtained at neutral pH. In particular, the entire N-terminal region is part of the rigid fibril core. Here, we investigate the effects of a pH shift on the stability and the fold of these fibrils at higher pH values. Fibril bundling at neutral pH values renders cryo-EM studies impractical, but solid-state NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biophysical methods provide residue-specific structural information under these conditions. The LS-fold of the Abeta(1-42) fibrils does not change over the complete pH range from pH 2 to pH 7; in particular, the N-terminus remains part of the fibril core. We observe changes in the protonation state of charged residues starting from pH 5 on a residue-specific level. The deprotonation of the C-terminal carboxyl group of A42 in the intermolecular salt bridge with D1 and K28 is slow on the NMR time scale, with a local pKa of 5.4, and local conformations of the involved residues are affected by deprotonation of A42. Thus, we demonstrate that this fibril form is stable at physiological pH values.
