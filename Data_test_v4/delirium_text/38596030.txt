38596030|a|Glioma is the leading cancer of the central nervous system (CNS). The efficacy of glioma treatment is significantly hindered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumour barrier (BBTB), which prevent most drugs from entering the brain and tumours. Hence, we established a novel drug delivery nanosystem of brain tumour-targeting that could self-assemble the method using an amphiphilic Zein protein isolated from corn. Zein's amphiphilicity prompted it to self-assembled into NPs, efficiently containing TMZ. This allowed us to investigate temozolomide (TMZ) for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. To construct TMZ-encapsulated NPs (TMZ@RVG-Zein NPs), the NPs' Zein was clocked to rabies virus glycoprotein 29 (RVG29). To verify that the NPs could penetrate the BBB and precisely target and kill the GBM cancer cell line, in vitro studies were performed. The process of NPs penetrating cancer cell membranes was investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to measure the expressions of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the U87 cell line. Therefore, effective targeted brain cancer treatment is possible by forming NP clocks, a cell-penetrating natural Zein protein with an RVG29. These NPs can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the glioblastoma (U87) cell line to release TMZ. These NPs have a distinct cocktail of biocompatibility and brain-targeting abilities, making them ideal for involving brain diseases.
