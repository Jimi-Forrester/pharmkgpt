36214002|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is important in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Removal of Abeta from the brain is a major strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD. OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether Abeta42 can be cleared by intestinal excretion and whether the gut microbiota (GM) can affect the excretory clearance of Abeta42 in the peripheral blood and intestines. METHODS: Male 8-month-old C57BL6 mice were maintained on either normal chow or received broad-spectrum antibiotics in their drinking water for one week. Sterile saline, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), or FITC-Abeta42 (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled amyloid-beta42 peptides) was injected 1 h before sampling. Related changes of Abeta42 before and after injection were evaluated. RESULTS: FITC-Abeta42 was injected into mice through the tail vein and could later be detected in feces. Furthermore, the fecal concentrations of FITC-Abeta42 were higher in mice that had been fed antibiotics to alter their GM than in normal mice. However, the FITC-Abeta42 concentrations in blood showed the opposite pattern. CONCLUSION: Abeta42 can be excreted into the intestinal lumen and is regulated by the GM.
