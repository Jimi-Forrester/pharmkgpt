32802961|t|Additional considerations for "checklists to guide the supportive and critical care of tuberculous meningitis".
32802961|a|Checklists are pivotal in the systematic assessment of critically ill patients, pre-operative assessments and for patients with multisystem involvements. Management of tuberculous meningitis is challenging due to prolonged hospital stay, multiple neurological complications like seizures, stroke, raised intracranial tension, stroke, neurosurgical interventions, multiple invasive procedures, health-care-associated sepsis, and ventilation. All these complications are managed by separate checklists to avoid treatment-related errors. The current manuscript aims to ensure completeness of inpatient care addressing issues addressing diagnostic issues, supportive care, and intensive care related issues.
