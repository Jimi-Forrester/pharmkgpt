25923490|t|In-Hospital Haloperidol Use and Perioperative Changes in QTc-Duration.
25923490|a|OBJECTIVES: Haloperidol may prolong ECG QTc-duration but is often prescribed perioperatively to hip-fracture patients. We aimed to determine (1) how QTc-duration changes perioperatively, (2) whether low-dose haloperidol-use influences these changes, and (3) which clinical variables are associated with potentially dangerous perioperative QTc-prolongation (PD-QTc; increase >50 ms or to >500 ms). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary university teaching-hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in a randomized controlled clinical trial of melatonin versus placebo on occurrence of delirium in hip-fracture patients. MEASUREMENTS: Data from ECGs made before and after hip surgery (1-3 days and/or 4-6 days post-surgery) were analyzed. QTc-duration was measured by hand, blinded for haloperidol and pre/post-surgery status. Clinical variables were measured at baseline. Mixed model analysis was used to estimate changes in QTc-duration. Risk-factors for PD-QTc were estimated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We included 89 patients (mean age 84 years, 24% male); 39 were treated with haloperidol. Patients with normal pre-surgery QTc-duration (male <=430 ms, female <=450 ms) had a significant increase (mean 12 ms, SD 28) in QTc-duration. A significant decrease (mean 19 ms, SD 34) occurred in patients with prolonged pre-surgery QTc-duration (male >450ms, female >470 ms). Haloperidol-use did not influence the perioperative course of the QTc-interval (p=0.351). PD-QTc (n=8) was not associated with any of the measured risk-factors. CONCLUSION: QTc-duration changed differentially, increasing in patients with normal, but decreasing in patients with abnormal baseline QTc-duration. PD-QTc was not associated with haloperidol-use or other risk-factors. Low-dose oral haloperidol did not affect perioperative QTc-interval.
