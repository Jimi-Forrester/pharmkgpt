38705398|t|A case of spinal epidural abscess concealed by delirium in a young man.
38705398|a|Spinal epidural abscess is a rare but serious condition with poor outcomes. It's classic triad of new back pain, neurological deficit and fever is only present in 15% of cases at presentation and is initially misdiagnosed in 75-89%.6,7 Delaying treatment is associated with worse outcomes. Delirium is itself a risk factor for mortality but the disturbance in cognition and memory can also complicate clinical assessment.1-5 We present a case of delirium caused by, and obscuring, a spinal epidural abscess. This case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing spinal epidural abscesses, the need for a high index of suspicion for the condition and timely action to minimise morbidity. In addition, it demonstrates the value of treating unexplained delirium as an emergency and the danger of diagnostic premature closure. Finally, the importance of persistent clinical examination of the confused and non-cooperative patient.
