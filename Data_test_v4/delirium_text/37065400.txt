37065400|t|Auditory and Visual Hallucinations Associated With Nitrofurantoin Use in an Inpatient Setting: A Case Report.
37065400|a|Nitrofurantoin has been utilized for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) since the 1950s, and it has been prescribed with increasing frequency since being recommended as a first-line therapy. The adverse neurological and psychiatric effects of antibiotic medications have been well-established. There is evidence to suggest a direct association between acute psychosis and antibiotic exposures. Nitrofurantoin-induced adverse effects have been reported recurrently; however, to the best of our knowledge, a combination of auditory and visual hallucinations with normal baseline mentation and cognition in an immunocompetent geriatric patient, without previously reported hallucinations, have not been reported in the literature so far. We present a case of an 86-year-old Caucasian female who was admitted with audio and visual hallucinations on the fifth day of starting nitrofurantoin therapy for UTI. During her stay, after ruling out all other probable etiologies, it was determined that the likely pathogenesis of the patient's neuropsychiatric effects was the use of nitrofurantoin.
