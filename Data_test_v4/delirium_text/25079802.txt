25079802|t|Ethnicity moderates dementia's biomarkers.
25079802|a|We have employed structural equation models to explicitly distinguish functional status, and therefore "dementia-relevant" variance in cognitive task performance (i.e., "delta"). We previously associated delta with cytokines and other serum biomarkers in a well characterized Alzheimer's disease cohort, the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium. However, that delta homolog did not exhibit factor equivalence across ethnicity. In this study, we construct a delta homolog that exhibits mean and factor equivalence across ethnicity [i.e., "d(=)"]. d(=) is associated significantly with ten of the twelve previously selected biomarkers. Most of these associations are again specific to Non-Hispanic White participants. These findings have yet to be validated in other cohorts, but may suggest cross-ethnic differences in dementia's pathobiological mechanisms between Hispanic Mexican-Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites.
