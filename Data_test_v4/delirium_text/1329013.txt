1329013|a|The authors report 6 cases of acute frontal syndrome following severe seizures of frontal origin. The study of the 6 cases shows the place of disorders in affectivity, behavior, judgement and motor activity; such features changing over time. The relationship between the frontal syndrome and epilepsy is suggested by the fact that the frontal syndrome appears after an increased frequency of frontal seizures, with prolonged discharges of generalized or frontal spikes. The frontal syndrome disappears slowly with the epileptic discharges, and no frontal lesion is found on CT-Scan. Such cases suggest that the frontal syndrome is functional, linked to the localization of the epileptic discharges; it may be regarded as a post-critic deficit, and must be differentiated from a post-critic delirium or a psychotic state.
