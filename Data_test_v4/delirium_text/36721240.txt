36721240|a|BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is an ultrarare, recessive, lethal, lysosomal disease characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and cognitive impairment. Although the NPC1 phenotype is heterogeneous with variable age of onset, classical NPC1 is a pediatric disorder. Currently there are no therapies approved by the FDA and therapeutics trials for NPC1 are complicated by disease rarity, heterogeneity, and the relatively slow rate of neurological decline. Thus, identification of disease relevant biomarkers is necessary to provide tools that can support drug development efforts for this devastating neurological disease. METHODS: Proximal extension assays (O-link  Explore 1536) were used to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from individuals with NPC1 enrolled in a natural history study and non-NPC1 comparison samples. Relative expression levels of 1467 proteins were determined, and candidate protein biomarkers were identified by evaluating fold-change and adjusted Kruskal-Wallis test p-values. Selected proteins were orthogonally confirmed using ELISA. To gain insight into disease progression and severity we evaluated the altered protein expression with respect to clinically relevant phenotypic aspects: NPC Neurological Severity Score (NPC1 NSS), Annual Severity Increment Score (ASIS) and age of neurological onset. RESULTS: This study identified multiple proteins with altered levels in CSF from individuals with NPC1 compared to non-NPC1 samples. These included proteins previously shown to be elevated in NPC1 (NEFL, MAPT, CHIT1, CALB1) and additional proteins confirmed by orthogonal assays (PARK7, CALB2/calretinin, CHI3L1/YKL-40, MIF, CCL18 and ENO2). Correlations with clinically relevant phenotypic parameters demonstrated moderate negative (p = 0.0210, r = -0.41) and possible moderate positive (p = 0.0631, r = 0.33) correlation of CSF CALB2 levels with age of neurological onset and ASIS, respectively. CSF CHI3L1 levels showed a moderate positive (p = 0.0183, r = 0.40) correlation with the concurrent NPC1 NSS. A strong negative correlation (p = 0.0016, r = -0.648) was observed between CSF CCL18 and age of neurological onset for childhood/adolescent cases. CSF CCL18 levels also showed a strong positive correlation (p = 0.0017, r = 0.61) with ASIS. CONCLUSION: Our study identified and validated multiple proteins in CSF from individuals with NPC1 that are candidates for further investigation in a larger cohort. These analytes may prove to be useful as supportive data in therapeutic trials. TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: NCT00344331, NCT00001721, NCT02931682.
