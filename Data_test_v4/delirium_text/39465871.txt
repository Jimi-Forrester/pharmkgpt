39465871|a|To systematically present an overview of randomized controlled trials on transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) using bibliometric methods, and describe the role and mechanisms of TEAS in most prevalent diseases. Relevant literature was searched in China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, and Web of Science. The literature was imported and screened into NoteExpress, screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and analyzed using Excel and CiteSpace 6.3R1 software. A total of 1296 documents were included. The number of publications increased annually after 2012. Junlu Wang was the most prolific author. The main research institutions were Peking University, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Shuguang Hospital, and Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province. The research hotspots in this field include perioperative care, cancer, pain management, and stroke, primarily focusing on analgesia, immune enhancement, antihypertension, and reduction of gastrointestinal disorders. The main regulatory mechanisms of TEAS include the control of inflammation, oxidative stress, and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. TEAS is most widely used in the elderly, with PC6, ST36, and LI4 being the most frequently studied acupoints in clinical randomized controlled trials. The concept of accelerated rehabilitation is gradually being applied to TEAS, representing an emerging trend for future development. Clinical research on TEAS is rapidly developing, with a focus on applications in cancer and perioperative care. Future research should expand collaboration and conduct high-level clinical and mechanistic studies, which will contribute to the development of standardized protocols and clinical practice.
