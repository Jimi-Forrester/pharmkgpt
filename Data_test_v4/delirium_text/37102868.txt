37102868|t|Phylogeny and Taxonomic Revision of the Family Discinaceae (Pezizales, Ascomycota).
37102868|a|Species of Discinaceae are common macrofungi with a worldwide distribution. Some of them are commercially consumed, while a few others are reported as poisonous. Two genera were accepted in the family: the epigeous Gyromitra with discoid, cerebriform to saddle-shaped ascomata and the hypogeous Hydnotrya with globose or tuberous ascomata. However, due to discrepancies in their ecological behaviors, a comprehensive investigation of their relationship was not thoroughly explored. In this study, phylogenies of Discinaceae were reconstructed using sequence analyses of combined and separate three gene partitions (internal transcribed spacer [ITS], large subunit ribosomal DNA [LSU], and translation elongation factor [TEF]) with a matrix containing 116 samples. As a result, the taxonomy of the family was renewed. Eight genera were recognized: two of them (Gyromitra and Hydnotrya) were retained, three (Discina, Paradiscina, and Pseudorhizina) were revived, and three (Paragyromitra, Pseudodiscina, and Pseudoverpa) were newly established. Nine new combinations were made in four genera. Two new species in Paragyromitra and Pseudodiscina and an un-named taxon of Discina were described and illustrated in detail based on the materials collected from China. Furthermore, a key to the genera of the family was also provided. IMPORTANCE Taxonomy of the fungal family Discinaceae (Pezizales, Ascomycota) was significantly renewed on the basis of sequence analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU), and translation elongation factor (TEF). Eight genera were accepted, including three new genera; two new species were described; and nine new combinations were made. A key to the accepted genera of the family is provided. The aim of this study is to deepen the understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among genera of the group, as well as the associated generic concepts.
