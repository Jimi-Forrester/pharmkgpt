33418512|t|Relationship between brain AD biomarkers and episodic memory performance in healthy aging.
33418512|a|The presence of brain biomarkers can be observed decades before the first clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to determine whether associations between biomarkers and episodic memory performance already exist in a healthy late middle-aged population or only in participants over 60 years old. Performance at the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [FCSRT], the Logical Memory test and the Mnemonic Similarity Task [MST] was determined in sixty healthy participants (50-70 y.) with a negative status for amyloid-beta (Abeta) biomarker. We assessed Abeta cortical level and tau/neuroinflammation burden using PET scanner, and hippocampal atrophy with MRI scanner. Generalized linear mixed models showed that MST scores (recognition and pattern separation) were positively associated with hippocampal volume in participants over 60 years. No association between memory performance and Abeta and tau/neuroinflammation burden was found in the older or in the younger age group. This suggests that visual recognition memory and discrimination of lures may constitute early cognitive markers of memory decline in an older population.
