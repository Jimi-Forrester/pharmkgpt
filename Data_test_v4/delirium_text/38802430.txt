38802430|t|Emergence of a short peptide based reductase via activation of the model hydride rich cofactor.
38802430|a|In extant biology, large and complex enzymes employ low molecular weight cofactors such as dihydronicotinamides as efficient hydride transfer agents and electron carriers for the regulation of critical metabolic processes. In absence of complex contemporary enzymes, these molecular cofactors are generally inefficient to facilitate any reactions on their own. Herein, we report short peptide-based amyloid nanotubes featuring exposed arrays of cationic and hydrophobic residues that can bind small molecular weak hydride transfer agents (NaBH4) to facilitate efficient reduction of ester substrates in water. In addition, the paracrystalline amyloid phases loaded with borohydrides demonstrate recyclability, substrate selectivity and controlled reduction and surpass the capabilities of standard reducing agent such as LiAlH4. The amyloid microphases and their collaboration with small molecular cofactors foreshadow the important roles that short peptide-based assemblies might have played in the emergence of protometabolism and biopolymer evolution in prebiotic earth.
