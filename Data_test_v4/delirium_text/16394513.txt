16394513|a|We previously reported that ten phenylethanoid glycosides including acteoside isolated from the leaves and twigs of Callicarpa dichotoma significantly attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. In the present study, we examined anti-amnesic activity of acteoside using scopolamine-induced (1 mg/kg body weight, s.c.) amnesic mice with both passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests. Acute oral treatment (single administration prior to scopolamine treatment) of mice with acteoside (1.0, 2.5 mg/kg body weight) significantly mitigated scopolamine-induced memory deficits in the passive avoidance test. It is interesting to note that prolonged oral daily treatment of mice with much lower amount (0.1 mg/kg body weight) of acteoside for 10 d reversed the scopolamine-induced memory deficits. In the Morris water maze, prolonged oral treatment with acteoside (prolonged daily administration of 1.0 mg/kg body weight for 10 d) significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced memory deficits showing the formation of long-term and/or short-term spatial memory. We suggest, therefore, that acteoside has anti-amnesic activity that may ultimately hold significant therapeutic value in alleviating certain memory impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease.
