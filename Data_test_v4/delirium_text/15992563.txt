15992563|a|The involvement of immunological alterations in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely discussed. Hitherto, findings on systemic immunological alterations are inconsistent. We measured the concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and of the soluble receptors sIL-2r, sIL-6r, and sTNF-alphar, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 20 Alzheimer patients and 21 controls. Moreover, we studied levels of the pro-inflammatory IL-6, Il-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, and of the anti-inflammatory IL-5 and IL-13 in stimulated blood cell cultures from 27 AD patients and 25 controls. The levels in CSF and serum were diminished in AD or under detection limit. In mitogen-stimulated blood cultures we found a significant decrease of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the AD group. Our data suggest a general decline of immune responsiveness in AD. Based on the recent research, an impaired immune response may be considered as a pathogenetically relevant factor in AD. With respect to the putative role of ageing in AD, we assume a premature immunosenescence contributing to the Alzheimer's pathology.
