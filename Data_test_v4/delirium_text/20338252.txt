20338252|t|Origin and reduction of motion and f0 artifacts in high resolution T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: application in Alzheimer's disease patients.
20338252|a|The altered iron concentration in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to the development of MRI sequences that are sensitive to the accompanying changes in the transverse relaxation rate. Heavily T(2)*-weighted imaging sequences at high magnetic field strength (7T and above), in particular, show potential for detecting small changes in iron concentration. However, these sequences require a long echo time in combination with a long scanning time for high resolution and are therefore prone to image artifacts caused by physiological fluctuations, patient motion or system instabilities. Many groups have found that the high image quality that was obtained using high resolution T(2)*-weighted sequences at 7T in healthy volunteers, could not be obtained in AD patients. In this study the source of the image artifacts was investigated in phantom and in healthy volunteer experiments by incorporating movement parameters and resonance frequency (f0) variations which were measured in AD patients. It was found that image degradation caused by typical f0 variations was a factor-of-four times larger than artifacts caused by movement characteristic of AD patients in the scanner. In addition to respiratory induced f0 variations, large jumps in the f0 were observed in AD patients. By implementing a navigator echo technique to correct for f0 variations, the image quality of high resolution T(2)*-weighted images increased considerably. This technique was successfully applied in five AD patients and in five subjective memory complainers. Visual scoring showed improvements in image quality in 9 out of 10 subjects. Ghosting levels were reduced by 24+/-13%.
