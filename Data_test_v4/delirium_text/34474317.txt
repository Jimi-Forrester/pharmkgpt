34474317|a|There is evidence of longitudinal atrophy in posterior brain areas in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD; aged < 65 years), but no studies have been conducted in an EOAD cohort with fluid biomarkers characterization. We used 3T-MRI and Freesurfer 6.0 to investigate cortical and subcortical gray matter loss at two years in 12 EOAD patients (A + T + N + ) compared to 19 controls (A-T-N-) from the Hospital Clinic Barcelona cohort. We explored group differences in atrophy patterns and we correlated atrophy and baseline CSF-biomarkers levels in EOAD. We replicated the correlation analyses in 14 EOAD (A + T + N + ) and 55 late-onset AD (LOAD; aged >= 75 years; A + T + N + ) participants from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found that EOAD longitudinal atrophy spread with a posterior-to-anterior gradient and beyond hippocampus/amygdala. In EOAD, higher initial CSF NfL levels correlated with higher ventricular volumes at baseline. On the other hand, higher initial CSF Abeta42 levels (within pathological range) predicted higher rates of cortical loss in EOAD. In EOAD and LOAD subjects, higher CSF t-tau values at baseline predicted higher rates of subcortical atrophy. CSF p-tau did not show any significant correlation. In conclusion, posterior cortices, hippocampus and amygdala capture EOAD atrophy from early stages. CSF Abeta42 might predict cortical thinning and t-tau/NfL subcortical atrophy.
