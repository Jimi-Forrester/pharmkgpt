31518519|a|Advances in human genetics have implicated a growing number of genes in neurodegenerative diseases, providing insight into pathological processes. For Alzheimer disease in particular, genome-wide association studies and gene expression studies have emphasized the pathogenic contributions from microglial cells and motivated studies of microglial function/dysfunction. Here, we summarize recent genetic evidence for microglial involvement in neurodegenerative disease with a focus on Alzheimer disease, for which the evidence is most compelling. To provide context for these genetic discoveries, we discuss how microglia influence brain development and homeostasis, how microglial characteristics change in disease, and which microglial activities likely influence the course of neurodegeneration. In all, we aim to synthesize varied aspects of microglial biology and highlight microglia as possible targets for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative disease.
