6197099|a|The aim of the study was to examine changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine concentrations related to alcohol withdrawal. Lumbar puncture was performed in 8 healthy volunteers (control group) and 36 chronic alcoholic patients following alcohol withdrawal. A second lumbar puncture was performed in 20 of these patients after recovery from the withdrawal. CSF 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured. Alcohol withdrawal phenomena in all patients were classified in the following three groups: (i) major withdrawal syndrome: alcohol-withdrawal delirium, (ii) minor withdrawal syndrome: evident autonomic nervous hyperactivity without hallucination or clouding of consciousness, and (iii) asymptomatic type: a withdrawal period without overt symptoms. MHPG concentration was significantly increased in the major withdrawal syndrome, as compared with other groups, including the controls. No change in MHPG was found in the patients without overt autonomic nervous syndrome. A positive correlation between CSF-MHPG and intensity of withdrawal symptoms (r = 0.60, p less than 0.02) was found. A higher correlation between CSF-MHPG and intensity of autonomic nervous disturbances was also found (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). CSF-HVA was significantly low during the alcohol delirium. It is suggested that a close relationship may exist between autonomic nervous disturbances and increase in central noradrenergic activity, as well as between the alcohol delirium and decrease in central dopaminergic activity.
