7047258|t|Treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome with carbamazepine: a double-blind comparison with tiapride.
7047258|a|A double-blind, randomized trial is described which was designed to compare the clinical effect of 600 mg daily of carbamazepine (Tegretol) and of tiapride (Sereprile) in hospitalized patients with pre-delirium tremens. Physicians' assessment of patients' progress was made following 2, 4 and 7 days of treatment. Of the sixty patients admitted to the study, five dropped out for various reasons, leaving fifty-five patients who completed the study. Both drugs were effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms; no significant difference was found between the two treatments with respect to total symptoms, score and visual analogue scale assessment. Carbamazepine gave faster relief of symptoms and demonstrated a preferential action on symptoms like fear and hallucinations. No case of delirium tremens was observed in those patients who completed the trial.
