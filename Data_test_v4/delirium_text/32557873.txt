32557873|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease that is poorly defined. Specific multitargeted protocols do not exist for setting the diagnosis and the prognosis of the syndrome. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To quantify Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to investigate their contribution to CCDS. ANIMALS: A total of 61 dogs from a hospital population. METHODS: Case-control study. Six young (YG: 0-4 years old), 8 middle-aged (4-8 years old), 17 cognitively unimpaired and aged (CU: 8-20 years old), and 30 cognitively impaired and aged (CI: 8-17 years). From the CI group, 10 dogs exhibited mild impairment (CI-MCI) and 20 exhibited severe impairment (CI-SCI). Cognitive status was assessed using a validated owner-based questionnaire. Direct and indirect Abeta markers were determined in plasma fractions (total-TP, free-FP, bound to plasma components-CP) and CSF using commercial ELISA assays (ABetatest, Araclon Biotech). RESULTS: TPAbeta42/40 facilitated discrimination between CI-MCI and CU aged dogs with area under curve >= 0.79. CSFAbeta42 levels were higher (P = .09) in CU (1.25 +- 0.28 ng/mL) than in MCI (1.04 +- 0.32 ng/mL) dogs. CSF Abeta42 levels were correlated with the CP fragment (CPAbeta40: P = .02, CPAbeta42: P = .02). CPAbeta42 was higher in the CI-MCI (23.03 +- 11.79 pg/muL) group compared to the other aged dogs (CU: 10.42 +- 7.18 pg/muL, P = .02, SCI: 11.40 +- 12.98 pg/muL, P = .26). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The Abeta should be determined in all of the 3 plasma fractions (TP, FP, CP). In the clinical approach, TPAbeta42/40 could be used as an efficient preselection tool for the aged canine population targeting dogs with mild cognitive impairment.
