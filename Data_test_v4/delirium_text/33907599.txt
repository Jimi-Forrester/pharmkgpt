33907599|a|Dementia and vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI) currently impose a tremendous human and economic burden on patients from aging populations and their families worldwide. Understanding the interplay of cardiometabolic risk factors and apolipoprotein E (APOE) may direct us to a more personalized medicine and preventative care in MCI and dementia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of cardiometabolic risk factors with MCI and assess the APOE genotype's role in an elderly cohort in the Dominican Republic. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 180 participants 65 years of age and older using a combined assessment of cardiometabolic risk factors, neuropsychological battery tests, and APOE genotyping. We used the number of failed tests as a proxy to predict MCI. RESULTS: We found that patients with the epsilon3-epsilon4 APOE genotype had 2.91 higher number of failed cognitive tests (p=0.027) compared to patients with the epsilon3-epsilon3 genotyped. The rate of test failures increased 10% (p=0.025) per unit increase in HbA1c percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Increased Hemoglobin A1c levels and epsilon3-epsilon4 APOE genotypes seem to have an association with the development of VaMCI.
