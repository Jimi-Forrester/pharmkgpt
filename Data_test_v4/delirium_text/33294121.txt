33294121|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disease; the pathogenesis of which is still uncertain. Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles, have been suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of PD, but their role is unknown. Here, a metabolomic analysis of serum and brain exosomes showed differentially expressed metabolites between 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride- (MPTP-) induced PD mice and control mice, such as oxidized lipids, vitamins, and cholesterol. These metabolites were enriched in coenzyme, nicotinamide, and amino acid pathways related to PD, and they could be served as preclinical biomarkers. We further found that blood-derived exosomes from healthy volunteers alleviated impaired motor coordination in MPTP-treated mice. Results from immunohistochemistry and western blotting indicated that the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra and striatum of PD model mice was rescued by the exosome treatment. The exosome treatment also restored the homeostasis of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cell apoptosis in the model mice. These results suggest that exosomes are important mediators for PD pathogenesis, and exosomes are promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of PD.
