34481243|a|BACKGROUND: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins can be targeted by antibodies associated with autoimmunity. Despite a growing appreciation for their intrinsic role in disease, there is a lack of highly multiplexed serological assays to characterize the fine specificities of PTM-directed autoantibodies. METHODS: In this study, we used the programmable phage display technology, Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq), to profile rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) reactivities. FINDINGS: Using both unmodified and peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD)-modified phage display libraries consisting of ~250,000 overlapping 90 amino acid peptide tiles spanning the human proteome, PTM PhIP-Seq robustly identified antibodies to citrulline-dependent epitopes. INTERPRETATION: PTM PhIP-Seq was used to quantify key differences among RA patients, including PAD isoform specific ACPA profiles, and thus represents a powerful tool for proteome-scale antibody-binding analyses.
