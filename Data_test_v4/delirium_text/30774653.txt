30774653|t|Application of Proteomics to Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research: Current Status and Future Perspectives.
30774653|a|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing/remitting inflammatory illness of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown aetiology. Despite recent advances in decoding the pathophysiology of IBD, many questions regarding disease pathogenesis remain. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and knockout mouse models have significantly advanced our understanding of genetic susceptibility loci and inflammatory pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis. Despite their important contribution to a better delineation of the disease process in IBD, these genetic findings have had little clinical impact to date. This is because the presence of a given gene mutation does not automatically correspond to changes in its expression or final metabolic or structural effect(s). Furthermore, the existence of these gene susceptibility loci in the normal population suggests other driving prerequisites for the disease manifestation. Proteins can be considered the main functional units as almost all intracellular physiological functions as well as intercellular interactions are dependent on them. Proteomics provides methods for the large-scale study of the proteins encoded by the genome of an organism or a cell, to directly investigate the proteins and pathways involved. Understanding the proteome composition and alterations yields insights into IBD pathogenesis as well as identifying potential biomarkers of disease activity, mucosal healing, and cancer progression. This review describes the state of the art in the field with respect to the study of IBD and the potential for translation from biomarker discovery to clinical application.
