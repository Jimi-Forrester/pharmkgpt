29997470|t|Alzheimer Disease and Selected Risk Factors Disrupt a Co-regulation of Monoamine Oxidase-A/B in the Hippocampus, but Not in the Cortex.
29997470|a|Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and MAO-B have both been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD). We examined 60 autopsied control and AD donor brain samples to determine how well MAO function aligned with two major risk factors for AD, namely sex and APOE epsilon4 status. MAO-A activity was increased in AD cortical, but not hippocampal, samples. In contrast, MAO-B activity was increased in both regions (with a strong input from female donors) whether sample means were compared based on: (a) diagnosis alone; (b) diagnosis-by-APOE epsilon4 status (i.e., carriers vs. non-carriers of the epsilon4 allele); or (c) APOE epsilon4 status alone (i.e., ignoring 'diagnosis' as a variable). Sample means strictly based on the donor's sex did not reveal any difference in either MAO-A or MAO-B activity. Unexpectedly, we found that cortical MAO-A and MAO-B activities were highly correlated in both males and females (if focussing strictly on the donor's sex), while in the hippocampus, any correlation was lost in female samples. Stratifying for sex-by-APOE epsilon4 status revealed a strong correlation between cortical MAO-A and MAO-B activities in both non-carriers and carriers of the allele, but any correlation in hippocampal samples was lost in carriers of the allele. A diagnosis of AD disrupted the correlation between MAO-A and MAO-B activities in the hippocampus, but not the cortex. We observed a novel region-dependent co-regulation of MAO-A and MAO-B mRNAs (but not proteins), while a lack of correlation between MAO activities and the respective proteins corroborated previous reports. Overexpression of human APOE4 increased MAO activity (but not mRNA/protein) in C6 and in HT-22 cell cultures. We identified a novel co-regulation of MAO-A and MAO-B activities that is spared from any influence of risk factors for AD or AD itself in the cortex, but vulnerable to these same factors in the hippocampus. Sex- and region-dependent abilities to buffer influences on brain MAO activities could have significant bearing on ambiguous outcomes when monoaminergic systems are targeted in clinical populations.
