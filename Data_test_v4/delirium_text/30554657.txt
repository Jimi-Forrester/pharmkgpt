30554657|a|Tripartite motif family-like 2 (TRIML2), a member of the TRIM proteins family, is closely related to Alzheimer's disease, however, no studies of TRIML2 have been published in the cancer research literature. In the current study, we investigated the expression level of TRIML2 and its molecular mechanisms in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot analysis, and immunohistochemistry showed that TRIML2 is up-regulated significantly in OSCCs in vitro and in vivo. TRIML2 knockdown OSCC cells showed decreased cellular proliferation by cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase that resulted from down-regulation of CDK4, CDK6, and cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. Surprisingly, resveratrol, a polyphenol, led to not only down-regulation of TRIML2 but also cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase similar to TRIML2 knockdown experiments. Taken together, we concluded that TRIML2 might play a significant role in tumoral growth and that resveratrol may be a new drug for treating OSCC by interfering with TRIML2 function.
