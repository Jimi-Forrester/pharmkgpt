38114437|t|Cath-KP, a novel peptide derived from frog skin, prevents oxidative stress damage in a Parkinson's disease model.
38114437|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that results in dyskinesia, with oxidative stress playing a pivotal role in its progression. Antioxidant peptides may thus present therapeutic potential for PD. In this study, a novel cathelicidin peptide (Cath-KP; GCSGRFCNLFNNRRPGRLTLIHRPGGDKRTSTGLIYV) was identified from the skin of the Asiatic painted frog ( Kaloula pulchra). Structural analysis using circular dichroism and homology modeling revealed a unique alphabetabeta conformation for Cath-KP. In vitro experiments, including free radical scavenging and ferric-reducing antioxidant analyses, confirmed its antioxidant properties. Using the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP +)-induced dopamine cell line and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice, Cath-KP was found to penetrate cells and reach deep brain tissues, resulting in improved MPP +-induced cell viability and reduced oxidative stress-induced damage by promoting antioxidant enzyme expression and alleviating mitochondrial and intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation through Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1)/Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway activation. Both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p38 were also identified as regulatory elements. In the MPTP-induced PD mice, Cath-KP administration increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, restored TH content, and ameliorated dyskinesia. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report on a cathelicidin peptide demonstrating potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in a PD model by targeting oxidative stress. These findings expand the known functions of cathelicidins, and hold promise for the development of therapeutic agents for PD.
