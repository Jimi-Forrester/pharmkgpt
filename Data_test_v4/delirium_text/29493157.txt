29493157|a|This study was aimed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of beta-asarone on the animal model of Alzheimer's disease(AD) which was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 combined cerebral ischemia. One hundred and five rats were randomly divided into seven groups including sham-operated group, AD model group, beta-asarone 10 mg kg-1 group, beta-asarone 20 mg kg-1 group, beta-asarone 30 mg kg-1 group, donepezil group(0.75 mg kg-1) and Ginkgo biloba extract group(24 mg kg-1). Rats' learning and memory abilities, cerebric regional blood flow, pathological changes in hippocampal CA1 region, the expression level of HIF-1alpha and serum CAT, SOD and MDA level were detected 4 weeks later. The results showed that the application of intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 joint 2-VO could lead to rats' dysfunction of learning and memory, decrease in regional cerebral blood flow. Neurons in CA1 region were arranged in disorder, and amyloid deposition was increased. The number of cerebral cortical cells expressing HIF-1alpha was increased as well. The level of serum CAT and SOD decreased, while level of serum MDA increased. However these symptoms were improved by 20 mg kg-1 and 30 mg kg-1 beta-asarone. The results indicated that beta-asarone could effectively relieve the symptoms of the AD model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 combined cerebral ischemia, and the potential mechanism might be that it could attenuate damage of MDA to the body by improving the level of CAT and SOD, meanwhile the level of HIF-1alpha decreased as the decline of hyperoxide which might attenuate its damage to neuron, so it finally achieved alleviating Alzheimer's disease.
