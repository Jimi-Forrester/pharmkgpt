37115196|t|A Double Whammy? Psychosocial Disadvantages of Dementia Caregivers with Cancer Histories.
37115196|a|Guided by the Diathesis-Stress model, this study examined how cancer history interacted with caregiving status to determine the psychosocial functioning of dementia caregivers. This study assessed a set of indicators for psychological health and social connections among 85 spousal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease and 86 age- and gender-matched spouses of healthy controls at study entry and 15-18 months later. Results showed that dementia caregivers with cancer histories reported lower social connections relative to caregivers without cancer histories or non-caregivers with or without cancer histories, and reported lower psychological health relative to non-caregivers with and without cancer histories at two time points. The findings highlight that a history of cancer is a predisposing vulnerability factor for psychosocial dysfunctions among dementia caregivers and address gaps in knowledge about the psychosocial adjustment of cancer survivors as caregivers.
