34349977|a|AIM: Fansidar (FAN) is widely used as an antimalarial drug, but it may cause hepatoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Hence, the study examines the cytoprotection of selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) tablets against FAN induced toxicity. METHOD: Group I was given distilled water. Groups II, III, IV, and V received 50 mg/kg FAN by gavage. Group III was co-treated with a 50 mg/kg Se tablet. Group IV was co-treated with a 50 mg/kg Zn tablet. Group V was co-treated with a 50 mg/kg Se tablet + 50 mg/kg Zn tablet. The exposure lasted for 7 days (sub-acute exposure). RESULT: FAN causes cytotoxicity through significant (p < 0.05) alteration of antioxidant molecules and hepatic enzymes. It also significantly (p < 0.05) induces renal, hepatocyte, and purkinje cell damage, but no visible lesion on testicular cells. The FAN induced cytotoxicity was significantly (p < 0.05) reversed on treatment with both single and combined antioxidant tablets. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the view that antioxidant micronutrient (Se and Zn) tablets may be a useful modulator in alleviating FAN induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in male rats. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Combined selenium and zinc capsules: better therapy against cytotoxicity Fansidar was approved by United States' Food and Drug Administration as an anti-malarial drug to treat acute and complicated malaria fever among patients in West Africa; however, its usage elicits toxicity to several organs of the body. It was elucidated that the combination of selenium and zinc capsules promotes organ wellness on co-treatment with Fansidar.
