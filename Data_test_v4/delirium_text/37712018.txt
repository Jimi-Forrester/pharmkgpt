37712018|a|Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, plays a crucial role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several characteristics of AD, including excessive iron accumulation, elevated lipid peroxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and decreased glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) levels, align with the features of ferroptosis. While traditional methods of inhibiting ferroptosis have centered on chelating Fe and trapping radicals, therapeutic strategies that modulate the GPX4 axis to mitigate ferroptosis in AD are yet to be explored. This report introduces naturally occurring polyphenols (PPs) as dual-acting therapeutic agents to synergistically alleviate ferroptosis and AD. The mechanisms of action encompass modulation of amyloid and tau cascade, reduction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial rescue, and inhibition of ferroptosis. For the first time, we show that a single multifunctional molecule, tannic acid (TA) binds at the activator site of GPX4, augmenting both its activity and cellular levels, providing a conceptually innovative and integrated approach for treating AD via the GPX4-ferroptosis axis. The ability of TA to enhance GPX4 levels under conditions of AD pathology opens up newer promising therapeutic avenues for combating the crosstalk between ferroptosis and AD.
