32722232|t|Implications of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 in Skeletal Muscle and Various Diseases.
32722232|a|Skeletal muscle is an essential tissue that attaches to bones and facilitates body movements. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a hormone found in blood that plays an important role in skeletal myogenesis and is importantly associated with muscle mass entity, strength development, and degeneration and increases the proliferative capacity of muscle satellite cells (MSCs). IGF-1R is an IGF-1 receptor with a transmembrane location that activates PI3K/Akt signaling and possesses tyrosine kinase activity, and its expression is significant in terms of myoblast proliferation and normal muscle mass maintenance. IGF-1 synthesis is elevated in MSCs of injured muscles and stimulates MSCs proliferation and myogenic differentiation. Mechanical loading also affects skeletal muscle production by IGF-1, and low IGF-1 levels are associated with low handgrip strength and poor physical performance. IGF-1 is potentially useful in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle atrophy, and promotes neurite development. This review highlights the role of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle, its importance during myogenesis, and its involvement in different disease conditions.
