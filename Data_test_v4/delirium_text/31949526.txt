31949526|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal ageing and the serious decline of dementia. AIM: To identify risk factors and role of miRNAs associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among employees. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 186 employees aged between 40 and 65 years. Cognitive function was evaluated using ACEIII, MoCA, and Quick cognitive tests. Medical history and lifestyle were assessed. Family 132 & 134 miRNA expressions were assessed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: MCI was detected among 14 / 186 (7.5%). miRNA 132 expression was the only significant miRNAs to detect MCI with low sensitivity and specificity (70%). The logistic analysis revealed that higher miRNA132 expressions, low monthly intake of; vegetables, unroasted nuts, low education and higher ALT levels were predicting factors for MCI with AOR 1.1 (1.01-3.3), 1.2 (1.04-1.43), 0.8 (0.8-0.98), 2.7 (1.9-7.4) and 1.6 (1.1-2.3) respectively. CONCLUSION: MiRNAs expression showed low sensitivity and specificity in detecting MCI; only miRNA 132 might be used. Several modifiable factors seem to reduce the risk of MCI.
