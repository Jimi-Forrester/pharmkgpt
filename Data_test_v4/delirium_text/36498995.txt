36498995|a|Maintenance of the tightly regulated homeostatic environment of the brain is facilitated by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-binding cassette transporter, is expressed on the luminal surface of the endothelial cells in the BBB, and actively exports a wide variety of substrates to limit exposure of the vulnerable brain environment to waste buildup and neurotoxic compounds. Downregulation of P-gp expression and activity at the BBB have been reported with ageing and in neurodegenerative diseases. Upregulation of P-gp at the BBB contributes to poor therapeutic outcomes due to altered pharmacokinetics of CNS-acting drugs. The regulation of P-gp is highly complex, but unravelling the mechanisms involved may help the development of novel and nuanced strategies to modulate P-gp expression for therapeutic benefit. This review summarises the current understanding of P-gp regulation in the brain, encompassing the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that have been identified to affect P-gp expression and transport activity.
