14724070|a|Synaptic disturbances may play a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. To characterize differential synaptic alterations in the brains of Alzheimer patients, chromogranin A, chromogranin B and secretoneurin were applied as soluble constituents for large dense core vesicles, synaptophysin as a vesicle membrane marker and calbindin as a cytosolic protein. In controls, chromogranin B and secretogranin are largely co-contained in interneurons, whereas chromogranin A is mostly found in pyramidal neurons. In Alzheimer's disease, about 30% of beta-amyloid plaques co-labelled with chromogranin A, 20% with secretoneurin and 15% with chromogranin B. Less than 5% of beta-amyloid plaques contained synaptophysin or calbindin, respectively. Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry revealed a significant loss for chromogranin B- and secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity in the dorsolateral, the entorhinal, and orbitofrontal cortex. Chromogranin A displayed more complex changes. It was the only chromogranin peptide to be expressed in glial fibrillary acidic protein containing cells. About 40% of chromogranin A immunopositive plaques and extracellular deposits were surrounded and pervaded by activated microglia. The present study demonstrates a loss of presynaptic proteins involved in distinct steps of exocytosis. An imbalanced availability of chromogranins may be responsible for impaired neurotransmission and a reduced functioning of dense core vesicles. Chromogranin A is likely to be a mediator between neuronal, glial and inflammatory mechanisms found in Alzheimer disease.
