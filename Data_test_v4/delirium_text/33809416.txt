33809416|t|Plasmonic Nanoparticles as Optical Sensing Probes for the Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.
33809416|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), considered a common type of dementia, is mainly characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions. Although its cause is multifactorial, it has been associated with the accumulation of toxic aggregates of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of tau protein. At present, the development of highly sensitive, high cost-effective, and non-invasive diagnostic tools for AD remains a challenge. In the last decades, nanomaterials have emerged as an interesting and useful tool in nanomedicine for diagnostics and therapy. In particular, plasmonic nanoparticles are well-known to display unique optical properties derived from their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), allowing their use as transducers in various sensing configurations and enhancing detection sensitivity. Herein, this review focuses on current advances in in vitro sensing techniques such as Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), Surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF), colorimetric, and LSPR using plasmonic nanoparticles for improving the sensitivity in the detection of main biomarkers related to AD in body fluids. Additionally, we refer to the use of plasmonic nanoparticles for in vivo imaging studies in AD.
