21378601|t|No association between CALHM1 polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease risk in a Hungarian population.
21378601|a|Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a promising candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease risk, has been recently identified. We tested the hypothesis that the T-allelic variant of the CALHM1 rs2986017 polymorphism confers susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in a Hungarian case-control sample that was also genotyped for apolipoprotein E. This study included 238 probable patients with Alzheimer's disease who met the diagnostic criteria for National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association and 202 elderly healthy control participants. We failed to detect an association between the CALHM1 polymorphism and the risk for Alzheimer's disease (P=0.153 for genotypes and P=0.090 for alleles), nor did we find an effect on age at onset. However, a potential weak correlation between the presence of the T allele (CT and TT genotypestogether) and Alzheimer's disease was observed (P=0.056).
