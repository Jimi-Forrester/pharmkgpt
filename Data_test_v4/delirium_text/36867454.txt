36867454|a|Effective drug delivery in the central nervous system (CNS) needs to have long blood-circulation half-lives, to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and subsequently to be taken up by target cells. Herein, a traceable CNS delivery nanoformulation (RVG-NV-NPs) is developed by encapsulating bexarotene (Bex) and AgAuSe quantum dots (QDs) within Lamp2b-RVG-overexpressed neural stem cell (NSC) membranes. The high-fidelity near-infrared-II imaging by AgAuSe QDs offers a possibility of in vivo monitoring the multiscale delivery process of the nanoformulation from the whole-body to the single-cell scale. It was revealed the synergy of acetylcholine receptor-targeting of RVG and the natural brain-homing and low immunogenicity of NSC membranes prolong the blood circulation, facilitate BBB crossing and nerve cell targeting of RVG-NV-NPs. Thus, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, the intravenous delivery of as low as 0.5% of oral dose Bex showed highly effective up-regulation of the apolipoprotein E expression, resulting rapid alleviation of ~40% beta-amyloid (Abeta) level in the brain interstitial fluid after a single dose administration. The pathological progression of Abeta in AD mice is completely suppressed during a 1 month treatment, thus effectively protecting neurons from Abeta-induced apoptosis and maintaining the cognitive abilities of AD mice.
