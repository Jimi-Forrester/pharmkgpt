32901578|t|Clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of orexin receptor antagonists for the treatment of insomnia disorders.
32901578|a|INTRODUCTION: The last two decades have witnessed a rapid increase in the knowledge about the role of the orexin system, particularly in the regulation of wakefulness and arousal. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) have been approved for the treatment of insomnia disorders (suvorexant, lemborexant) and drugs with a distinctive profile (daridorexant) or orexin-2 receptor selectivity (seltorexant) are in development. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety properties of orexin receptor antagonists (ORAs). EXPERT OPINION: In general, the drugs described have a similar effect on sleep characteristics although their pharmacokinetic variables differ. ORAs have the potential to revolutionize the pharmacological treatment of insomnia because they not only improve sleep, but, in addition, appear to have no dependence - and tolerance-inducing effects, which makes them suitable for long-term-treatment. The safety and tolerability profile of ORAs clearly differ from those of more traditional sleep-promoting drugs. Further research is needed to demonstrate benefits to patients suffering from insomnia disorder, e.g., with respect to improving not only sleep but also daytime functioning. In addition, ongoing and future research will show whether ORAs may have beneficial effects in patients with various psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.
