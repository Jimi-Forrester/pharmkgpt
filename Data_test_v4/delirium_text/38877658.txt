38877658|a|BACKGROUND: The mechanisms linking mild behavioral impairment (MBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been insufficiently explored, with conflicting results regarding tau protein and few data on other metabolic markers. We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal association of the MBI domains and a spectrum of plasma biomarkers. METHODS: Our study is a secondary analysis of data from NOLAN. The longitudinal association of the MBI domains with plasma biomarkers, including pTau181, was tested using adjusted linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: The sample comprised 359 participants (60% female, mean age: 78.3, standard deviation: 0.3 years). After 1 year, the MBI domain of abnormal perception was associated with steeper increases in plasma pTau181. Abnormal perception, decreased motivation, and impulse dyscontrol were associated with homocysteine or insulin dysregulation. DISCUSSION: Apart from the association with plasma pTau181, our results suggest that MBI might also represent metabolic dysregulation, probably contributing to dementia transition among older adults with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment. HIGHLIGHTS: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) psychosis was associated with steeper increases in plasma p. pTau could be a pharmacological target to treat agitation and psychosis symptoms. MBI domains were linked to metabolic dysregulation involving insulin and homocysteine.
