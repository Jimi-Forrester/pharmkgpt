33005521|a|We present two cases of thyroid hormone alterations revealing clinical emergencies that require early diagnosis and prompt treatment. The first patient, a 56-year-old woman, presented in the emergency room with psychomotor agitation, disorientation and headache. She was very agitated, incapable of standing still, looked very thin, feverish, tachycardic and presented no alteration at neurological examination with negative meningeal signs. Analyses revealed a severe hyperthyroidism. She initiated propylthiouracil 100 mg 8/8 h. After six months, thyroid function was normal. The second patient, a 54-year-old woman, was transferred from the Psychiatry Department due to memory and behavior changes for the past two weeks. She presented visual and auditive hallucinations and inadequate daily behavior. Analyses revealed a severe hypothyroidism. She was medicated with levothyroxine 100 ug/day. At the third month, she presented normalized thyroid function, normal thyroid ultrasound and an increased antithyroperoxidase antibody.
