36336936|a|BACKGROUND: It is difficult to assess brain health status and risk of cognitive impairment, particularly at the initial evaluation. To address this, we developed the Brain Health Platform to quantify brain health and identify Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) risk factors by combining a measure of brain health: the Resilience Index (RI), a measure of risk of ADRD; the Vulnerability Index (VI); and the Number-Symbol Coding Task (NSCT), a measure of brain performance. OBJECTIVE: The Brain Health Platform is intended to be easily and quickly administered, providing an overview of a patient's risk of developing future impairment based on modifiable and non-modifiable factors as well as current cognitive performance. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprehensively evaluated 230 participants (71 controls, 71 mild cognitive impairment, 88 ADRD). VI and RI scores were derived from physical assessments, lifestyle questionnaires, demographics, medical history, and neuropsychological examination including the NSCT. RESULTS: Individuals with abnormal scores were 95.7% likely to be impaired, with a misclassification rate of 9.7%. The combined model had excellent discrimination (AUC:0.923+-0.053; p < 0.001), performing better than the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. CONCLUSION: The Brain Health Platform combines measures of resilience, vulnerability, and performance to provide a cross-sectional snapshot of overall brain health. The Brain Health Platform can effectively and accurately identify even the very mildest impairments due to ADRD, leveraging brief yet powerful and actionable indices of brain health and risk that could be used to develop personalized, precision medicine-like interventions.
