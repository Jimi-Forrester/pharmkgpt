38763935|a|Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown a benefit of brexpiprazole in managing agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its efficacy and safety remain unclear. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for RCTs comparing brexpiprazole with placebo in patients with agitation and AD. Three studies comprising 1,048 patients were included. In patients with agitation and AD, brexpiprazole significantly improved the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score (CMAI) at any dose (MD -3.05; 95% CI -5.12, -0.98; p < 0.01; I2 = 19%) and at 2 mg (MD -4.36; 95% CI -7.02, -1.70; p < 0.01; I2 = 0%) over 12 weeks. Brexpiprazole at any dose and 2 mg also showed benefit in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of illness (CGI-S) score as related to agitation over 12 weeks (MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.36, -0.05; p < 0.01; I2 = 35%). There is no significant difference between the groups in the incidence of at least one treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.95, 1.37; p = 0.16; I2 = 45%) and all-cause mortality (RR 1.99; 95% CI 0.37, 10.84; p = 0.42; I2 = 0%). Brexpiprazole at any dose significantly increased the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS; MD 0.47; 95% CI 0.28, 0.66; p < 0.01). Our results suggest that brexpiprazole is more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of agitation in AD patients. Further studies are still necessary to confirm long-term effects of brexpiprazole.Prospero registry: CRD42023486694.
