38870460|t|Outcomes of Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment With Lewy Bodies or Alzheimer Disease at 3 and 5 Years After Diagnosis.
38870460|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Retrospective studies indicate that dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may be preceded by a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prodrome. Research criteria for the prospective identification of MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) have been developed. We aimed to assess the prognosis of a prospectively identified MCI-LB cohort at 2 key milestones, 3- and 5 years after diagnosis, to examine classification stability over time and rates of adverse outcomes (dementia or death). METHODS: This was a retrospective examination of data from 2 longitudinal observational cohort studies where participants with MCI were prospectively recruited from North East England and differentially classified as MCI due to Alzheimer disease (MCI-AD), possible MCI-LB, or probable MCI-LB. Adverse outcomes (DLB/other dementia or death) and stability of disease-specific classifications were examined in each group. RESULTS: Of 152 participants with baseline MCI (54 MCI-AD, 29 possible MCI-LB, and 69 probable MCI-LB), 126 were followed for up to 3 years (mean age 75.3 years; 40% female). We found that prospective probable MCI-LB classifications were both sensitive (91%) and specific (94%) to classifications either remaining as probable MCI-LB or progressing to DLB (in some cases autopsy confirmed) for 3 or more years after. Classifications were at least as stable as those in MCI-AD. In this cohort with disease-specific MCI classifications, rates of progression to dementia were high: 55% of MCI-LB had developed DLB within 3 years. Dementia occurred in 47% of MCI-AD over the same duration (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 0.66-4.26, p = 0.278). Premature death was a common competing risk, occurring in 9% of MCI-AD and 11% of MCI-LB within 3 years. DISCUSSION: These findings support that prospectively identified probable MCI-LB is a prodromal presentation of DLB and that disease-specific classifications of MCI may reliably identify different prodromal dementias.
