33851077|a|OBJECTIVE: Polypharmacy and anticholinergic burden are the indicators for the evaluation of the quality of pharmacotherapy in older adults. The aim of this study was to consider which anticholinergic burden scales are more related with polypharmacy among older patients. METHODS: Four hundred and twenty older adults were evaluated retrospectively in this cross-sectional study. The patient's demographic data, comorbidities, the drugs, and number of drugs were recorded. Anticholinergic burden scales were calculated by a tool named anticholinergic burden calculator. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 73.08+-8.71. The prevalence of polypharmacy was 32.14%. The highest relationship with polypharmacy was observed for drug burden index (DBI) (odds ratio 10.87, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that polypharmacy and DBI scores were more related than other anticholinergic burden scales in older adults.
