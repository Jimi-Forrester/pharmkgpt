26510319|a|Cerebrovascular inflammation is often involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Non-invasive and sensitive molecular imaging of cerebrovascular inflammation biomarkers therefore represents a potential AD diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring method. Here, we describe the development of a novel aptamer-based near infrared fluorescence imaging probe targeting Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1), an adhesion molecule overexpressed by the activated cerebrovasculature during inflammation. A SELEX-type screening of a random ssDNA library against human VCAM-1 identified a high-affinity ssDNA aptamer with a dissociation constant of 49 nM. We demonstrated that the Cy5.5-labeled aptamer binds to activated endothelial cells, with no affinity to non-activated cells. A scrambled aptamer labeled with Cy5.5 did not image activated and non-activated endothelial cells, confirming the sequence specificity of the targeting. In vivo, the aptameric imaging agent targeting VCAM-1 successfully identified inflammation associated with amyloid-beta plaques deposition in the vessels of the cerebellum of transgenic AD mice. It exhibited excellent retention by remaining bound to vessels 4 hours post-injection, indicating its effectiveness in in vivo imaging and its potential in early detection of cerebrovascular inflammation.
