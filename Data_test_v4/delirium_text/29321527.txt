29321527|t|A hospital based retrospective study of factors influencing therapeutic leukapheresis in patients presenting with hyperleukocytic leukaemia.
29321527|a|Therapeutic leukapheresis is a rapid and effective method to reduce early mortality of patients with hyperleukocytic leukaemia (HLL). However, few studies on factors influencing the efficiency have been reported. In this study, 67 cases who underwent leukapheresis were retrospectively analysed and factors related to the collection efficiency of leukapheresis (CEWBC) were also evaluated. Paired t test showed that there was a significant decrease in statistics of white blood cell (WBC) counts after apheresis. The results of two independent samples nonparametric test suggested that WBC counts, platelet (PLT) counts, haematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), serum chlorine (Cl) and globulin (GLB) before leukapheresis correlated with the CEWBC. Multiple linear regression analysis with background stepwise variable selection indicated that only WBC and HCT before leukapheresis had an influence on CEWBC significantly. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model indicated that lymphocyte (LY) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) pre-apheresis as independent factors significantly affected the prognostic survival of patients with HLL. Moreover, platelets and red blood cell were contaminated in the product of leukapheresis. It is an urgent problem to be solved in order to realise higher efficacy and higher purity of WBC collection to improve the survival of patients with HLL through optimising instruments.
