T cell senescence and immune response dysfunction can result in a decline in immune function, especially in anti-tumor immune responses. Metformin has been shown to have various beneficial effects on health, such as lowering blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of cancer development, and slowing down the aging process. However, the immunomodulatory effects of metformin on senescent T cells still need to be investigated. METHODS: PBMCs isolation from different age population (n = 88); Flow Cytometry is applied to determine the phenotypic characterization of senescent T lymphocytes; intracellular staining is applied to determine the function of senescent T cells; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is employed to test the telomerase concentration. The RNA-seq analysis of gene expression associated with T cell senescence. RESULTS: The middle-aged group had the highest proportion of senescent T cells. We found that metformin could decrease the number of CD8 + senescent T cells. Metformin affects the secretion of SASP, inhibiting the secretion of IFN-gamma in CD8 + senescent T cells. Furthermore, metformin treatment restrained the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in lymphocytes. Metformin had minimal effects on Granzyme B secretion in senescent T cells, but it promoted the production of TNF-alpha in senescent T cells. Additionally, metformin increased the concentration of telomerase and the frequency of undifferentiated T cells. The results of RNA-seq showed that metformin promoted the expression of genes related to stemness and telomerase activity, while inhibiting the expression of DNA damage-associated genes. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that metformin could inhibit T cell senescence in terms of cell number, effector function, telomerase content and gene expression in middle-aged individuals, which may serve as a promising approach for preventing age-related diseases in this population.
