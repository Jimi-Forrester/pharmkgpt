35758658|a|For more than 3 decades, mounting evidence has associated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection with late-term abortions and stillbirths in sows and respiratory disease in piglets, causing enormous economic losses to the global swine industry. However, to date, the underlying mechanisms of PRRSV-triggered cell death have not been well clarified, especially in the pulmonary inflammatory injury characterized by the massive release of pro-inflammatory factors. Here, we demonstrated that PRRSV infection triggered gasdermin D-mediated host pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PRRSV infection triggered disassembly of the trans-Golgi network (TGN); the dispersed TGN then acted as a scaffold for NLRP3 activation through phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. In addition, PRRSV replication-transcription complex (RTC) formation stimulated TGN dispersion and pyroptotic cell death. Furthermore, our results indicated that TMEM41B, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident host protein, functioned as a crucial host factor in the formation of PRRSV RTC, which is surrounded by the intermediate filament network. Collectively, these findings uncover new insights into clinical features as previously unrecognized mechanisms for PRRSV-induced pathological effects, which may be conducive to providing treatment options for PRRSV-associated diseases and may be conserved during infection by other highly pathogenic viruses. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the pathogens responsible for major economic losses in the global swine industry. Characterizing the detailed process by which PRRSV induces cell death pathways will help us better understand viral pathogenesis and provide implications for therapeutic intervention against PRRSV. Here, we showed that PRRSV infection induces GSDMD-driven host pyroptosis and IL-1beta secretion through NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis are elucidated here. The dispersed trans-Golgi network (TGN) induced by PRRSV serves as a scaffold for NLRP3 aggregation into multiple puncta via phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P). Moreover, the formation of PRRSV replication-transcription complex is essential for TGN dispersion and host pyroptosis. This research advances our understanding of the PRRSV-mediated inflammatory response and cell death pathways, paving the way for the development of effective treatments for PRRSV diseases.
