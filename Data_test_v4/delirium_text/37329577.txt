37329577|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a serious complication in patients with diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD). In this study, we aim to explore the protective effect of exercise on DACD in diabetic mice, and the role of NDRG2 as a potential guarder for reversing the pathological structure of neuronal synapses. METHODS: Seven weeks of standardized exercise at moderate intensity was carried out using an animal treadmill in the vehicle + Run and STZ + Run groups. Based on quantitative transcriptome and tandem mass tag (TMT) proteome sequencing, weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to investigate the activation of complement cascades to injury neuronal synaptic plasticity. Golgi staining, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and electrophysiology were used to verify the reliability of sequencing data. The role of NDRG2 was assessed by overexpressing or inhibiting the NDRG2 gene in vivo. Moreover, we estimated the cognitive function in diabetic or normal patients using DSST scores. FINDINGS: Exercise reversed the injury of neuronal synaptic plasticity and the downregulation of astrocytic NDRG2 in diabetic mice, which succeeded in attenuating DACD. The deficiency of NDRG2 aggravated the activation of complement C3 by accelerating the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, ultimately leading to synaptic injury and cognitive dysfunction. Conversely, the overexpression of NDRG2 promoted astrocytic remodeling by inhibiting complement C3, thus attenuating synaptic injury and cognitive dysfunction. Meanwhile, C3aR blockade rescued dendritic spines loss and cognitive deficits in diabetic mice. Moreover, the average DSST score of diabetic patients was significantly lower than that of non-diabetic peers. Levels of complement C3 in human serum were elevated in diabetic patients compared to those in non-diabetic patients. INTERPRETATION: Our findings illustrate the effectiveness and integrative mechanism of NDRG2-induced improvement of cognition from a multi-omics perspective. Additionally, they confirm that the expression of NDRG2 is closely related to cognitive function in diabetic mice and the activation of complement cascades accelerated impairment of neuronal synaptic plasticity. NDRG2 acts as a regulator of astrocytic-neuronal interaction via NF-kappaB/C3/C3aR signaling to restore synaptic function in diabetic mice.
