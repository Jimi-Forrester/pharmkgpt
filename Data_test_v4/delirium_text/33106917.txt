33106917|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been regarded as the main therapeutic target for AD. However, most of the Abeta-targeted clinical trials have not succeeded. Therefore, the Abeta-targeted therapeutic strategy on treating this complex disease needs to be re-evaluated. In this review, we analyzed the challenges and critical points of the current anti-Abeta therapeutic strategies. In addition to Abeta, multiple pathological events such as tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, which are involved in AD pathogenesis and synergistically drive disease progression, could be important targets for AD treatment. Tertiary prevention strategies are needed for the successful management of AD due to its complex and dynamic pathogenesis. Systemic perspective addressing the disease pathogenesis within and outside the brain, as well as the multidomain intervention targeting risk factors and comorbidities, are important approaches for the therapeutic solutions of AD.
