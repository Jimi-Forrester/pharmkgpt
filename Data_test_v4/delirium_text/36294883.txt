36294883|t|Influence of Renal Impairment on the Success of Reconstruction Using Microvascular Grafts-A Retrospective Study of 251 Free Flaps.
36294883|a|BACKGROUND: In head and neck surgery, reconstruction using microvascular grafts is a successful method for functional and aesthetic restoration. Due to technological advances and medical care, the number of patients with comorbidities and diseases requiring free tissue transfer has increased. To provide adequate treatment to these patients, preoperative identification of potential risk factors is essential. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated the impact of renal insufficiency on reconstruction in 251 microvascular grafts. Perioperative complications, failure rate, and outcomes serve as the basis for this evaluation. RESULTS: Comparing pre- and postoperative values, there was a significant decrease in potassium and creatinine levels and a significant increase in GFR. The electrolyte changes in relation to the complication rate showed that complications were more likely to occur as potassium levels increased. As sodium levels increase, the complication rate decreases. CONCLUSION: A preoperative value indicative of impaired renal function, such as creatinine levels, GFR, or electrolytes, did not prove to be an individual risk factor for the occurrence of graft failure in this patient population. Nevertheless, increased renal parameters are associated with increased incidence of serious complications. Therefore, these should be considered in the indication and preoperative planning.
