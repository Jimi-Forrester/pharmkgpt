36613744|t|The Expression of miRNAs Involved in Long-Term Memory Formation in the CNS of the Mollusk Helix lucorum.
36613744|a|Mollusks are unique animals with a relatively simple central nervous system (CNS) containing giant neurons with identified functions. With such simple CNS, mollusks yet display sufficiently complex behavior, thus ideal for various studies of behavioral processes, including long-term memory (LTM) formation. For our research, we use the formation of the fear avoidance reflex in the terrestrial mollusk Helix lucorum as a learning model. We have shown previously that LTM formation in Helix requires epigenetic modifications of histones leading to both activation and inactivation of the specific genes. It is known that microRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate the expression of genes; however, the role of miRNAs in behavioral regulation has been poorly investigated. Currently, there is no miRNAs sequencing data being published on Helix lucorum, which makes it impossible to investigate the role of miRNAs in the memory formation of this mollusk. In this study, we have performed sequencing and comparative bioinformatics analysis of the miRNAs from the CNS of Helix lucorum. We have identified 95 different microRNAs, including microRNAs belonging to the MIR-9, MIR-10, MIR-22, MIR-124, MIR-137, and MIR-153 families, known to be involved in various CNS processes of vertebrates and other species, particularly, in the fear behavior and LTM. We have shown that in the CNS of Helix lucorum MIR-10 family (26 miRNAs) is the most representative one, including Hlu-Mir-10-S5-5p and Hlu-Mir-10-S9-5p as top hits. Moreover, we have shown the involvement of the MIR-10 family in LTM formation in Helix. The expression of 17 representatives of MIR-10 differentially changes during different periods of LTM consolidation in the CNS of Helix. In addition, using comparative analysis of microRNA expression upon learning in normal snails and snails with deficient learning abilities with dysfunction of the serotonergic system, we identified a number of microRNAs from several families, including MIR-10, which expression changes only in normal animals. The obtained data can be used for further fundamental and applied behavioral research.
