37563173|a|Malnutrition poses a significant risk to the older population globally, highlighting the critical role of nutrition in healthy aging. In this study, the aim is to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition among older adults aged 45-59 years and the elderly population aged 60 years and above based on their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Furthermore, the study examines the risk factors within a multivariate framework. A sample of 59,073 individuals aged 45 years and above from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), Wave 1 survey constitutes the study population. This study adopts a cross-sectional design. Bivariate cross-tabulation analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis are employed to understand the prevalence and determinants of nutritional status. About 25% of males and 37% of females below the age of 60 years are overweight (including obese), while among those aged 60 years and above, 28% of males and 25% of females are underweight. The elderly male population carries a comparatively higher burden of underweight (28%) prevalence than the females (25%) in the same age group. Overall, the urban population is less likely to be underweight [AOR: 0.41, C.I 0.38-0.43] and more likely to be overweight [AOR: 2.41, C.I 2.32-2.52]. Older adults from low economic and social strata are more likely to be underweight. In terms of bio-physical factors, individuals aged 60 years and above with infections to endemic diseases [AOR: 1.24; p-value < 0.01] and those with edentulism [AOR: 1.29; p-value < 0.01] are more likely to be underweight. As evident from the study, nutritional status among older adults is a complicated manifestation of multiple risk factors and requires potential nutritional intervention. Initiating a routine screening program at the grassroots level can effectively identify older adults and the elderly in India, facilitating the provision of nutritional care.
