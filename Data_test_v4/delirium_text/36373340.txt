36373340|a|During the last decade, the stimulation of T-cell function by the blockage of immunosuppressive checkpoints has experienced an outstanding impact in the treatment of cancer. Development of the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell technology has also emerged as a powerful alternative for patients suffering from oncological processes, especially those affected by hematological neoplasms. Recent evidence suggest that the use of immunotherapy could be extended to non-oncological diseases and could be especially relevant for age-associated disorders, opening exciting therapeutic options for a wide range of diseases of the elderly. Here we comment on the emergence of T-cell-based immunotherapies as feasible approaches that could revolutionize the future of GeroScience.
