29950785|t|The awareness of healthcare staff towards post-stroke cognitive impairment: a cross sectional study.
29950785|a|[Purpose] This study aimed to determine the awareness amongst healthcare staff of post-stroke cognitive impairment in a university teaching hospital and supporting stroke rehabilitation unit. [Subjects and Methods] A cross sectional study was employed to collect data from 20 healthcare staff about post-stroke cognitive impairment. This study was conducted in Ireland at two sites, the Acute Stroke unit in Cork University Hospital, and the Stroke Rehabilitation unit and Assessment and Treatment Centre in St. Finbarr's Hospital. [Results] Approximately 75% of participants felt that they had knowledge about post-stroke cognitive deficits, with around 50% of them having patients with persistent cognitive decline between 40% and 60%. Most participants (70%) agreed that cognitive function should be routinely assessed and the majority (85%) discussed the potential impact of post-stroke cognitive deficits with patients and their families. However, some participants need to be aware of post-stroke cognitive deterioration. [Conclusion] Although there was evidence of good practice, a small number of healthcare staff felt that they did not have sufficient knowledge about post-stroke cognitive deficits. Thus, further professional education should be provided to improve the knowledge of healthcare staff about potential cognitive impairments after stroke.
