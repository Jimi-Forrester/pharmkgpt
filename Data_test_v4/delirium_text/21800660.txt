21800660|a|Oral rehydration therapy before surgery may be useful for elderly patients in perioperative management especially induction of general anesthesia, as they cannot preserve water in the body sufficiently. In elderly patients oral rehydration therapy is favorable to intravenous hydration as in younger patients. However, if swallowing is impaired or there are risks for aspiration, gastric emptying rate is decreased; gastroesophageal reflux disease is pointed out; cognitive function is disordered; or delirium has appeared, oral rehydration therapy should be carefully considered. It may be necessary to provide preoperative oral rehydration therapy to high risk elderly patients when they are hospitalized and they should be watched for taking oral rehydration solution soon by hospital nurses.
