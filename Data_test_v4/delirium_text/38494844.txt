38494844|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multifactorial autoimmune disease, can affect the brain and cause neuropsychiatric dysfunction, also named neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE). Microglial activation is observed in NPSLE patients. However, the mechanisms regulating microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in NPSLE remain elusive. Here, we showed that M1-like proinflammatory cytokine levels were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SLE patients, especially those with neuropsychiatric symptoms. We also demonstrated that MRL/lpr lupus mice developed anxiety-like behaviours and cognitive deficits in the early and active phases of lupus, respectively. An increase in microglial number was associated with upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the MRL/lpr mouse brain. RNA sequencing revealed that genes associated with phagocytosis and M1 polarization were upregulated in microglia from lupus mice. Functionally, activated microglia induced synaptic stripping in vivo and promoted neuronal death in vitro. Finally, tofacitinib ameliorated neuropsychiatric disorders in MRL/lpr mice, as evidenced by reductions in microglial number and synaptic/neuronal loss and alleviation of behavioural abnormalities. Thus, our results indicated that classically activated (M1) microglia play a crucial role in NPSLE pathogenesis. Minocycline and tofacitinib were found to alleviate NPSLE by inhibiting micrglial activation, providing a promising therapeutic strategy.
