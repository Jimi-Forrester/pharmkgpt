34082192|t|Post-infectious rhombencephalitis after coronavirus-19 infection: A case report and literature review.
34082192|a|A wide number of neurological manifestations have been described in association with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). We describe an unusual case of a young man who developed severe rhombencephalitis after COVID-19. He demonstrated clinical and radiological improvement with high dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange and intravenous immune globulin. Our findings, along with previously reported cases that we review here, support an autoimmune para- or post-infectious mechanism and highlight a possible role for immunotherapy in patients with rhombencephalitis after COVID-19.
