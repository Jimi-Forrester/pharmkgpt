37373795|t|Conscious Sedation Methods for Blepharoplasty in Day Surgery.
37373795|a|Midazolam and fentanyl, in combination, are the most commonly used medications for conscious sedation in day aesthetic surgeries. Dexmedetomidine is popularly used in the sedation protocol of our hospital due to its reduced respiratory depression. However, its sedation benefits in facial aesthetic surgeries, like blepharoplasty, have not been well-evaluated. We retrospectively compared individuals sedated with midazolam and fentanyl bolus injection (N = 137) and those sedated with dexmedetomidine infusion (N = 113) to determine which is more suitable for blepharoplasty with a mid-cheek lift. The total amount of local anesthetic (p < 0.001), postoperative pain (p = 0.004), ketoprofen administration (p = 0.028), and the number of hypoxia episodes (p < 0.001) and intraoperative hypertension (p = 0.003) were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group. Hypoxia severity (p < 0.001) and minor hematoma formation (p = 0.007) were also significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group. Sedation with dexmedetomidine infusion is associated with less hematoma formation than sedation with midazolam and fentanyl bolus pattern due to hemodynamic stability and analgesic effects. Dexmedetomidine infusion may be a good alternate sedative for lower blepharoplasty.
