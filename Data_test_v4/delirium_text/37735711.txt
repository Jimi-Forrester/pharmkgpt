37735711|a|BACKGROUND: The mechanisms whereby CYFIP2 acts in tumor development and drives immune infiltration have been poorly explored. Thus, this study aimed to identifying the role of CYFIP2 in tumors and immune response. METHODS: In this study, we first explored expression patterns, diagnostic role and prognostic value of CYFIP2 in cancers, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Then, we performed functional enrichment, genetic alterations, DNA methylation analysis, and immune cell infiltration analysis of CYFIP2 to uncover its potential mechanisms involved in immune microenvironment. RESULTS: We found that CYFIP2 significantly differentially expressed in different tumors including LUAD compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, CYFIP2 was found to be significantly correlated with clinical parameters in LUAD. According to the diagnostic and survival analysis, CYFIP2 may be employed as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Moreover, genetic alterations revealed that mutation of CYFIP2 was the main types of alterations in different cancers. DNA methylation analysis indicated that CYFIP2 mRNA expression correlated with hypomethylation. Afterwards, functional enrichment analysis uncovered that CYFIP2 was involved in tumor-associated and immune-related pathways. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that CYFIP2 was significantly correlated with immune cells infiltration. In particular, CYFIP2 was strongly linked with immune microenvironment scores. Additionally, CYFIP2 exhibited a significant relationship with immune regulators and immune-related genes including chemokines, chemokines receptors, and MHC genes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that CYFIP2 may serve as a prognostic cancer biomarker for determining prognosis and might be a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy.
