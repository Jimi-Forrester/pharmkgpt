34323669|a|OBJECTIVE: Monoamine Oxidase (MAO), which catalyzes the oxidative deamination of amines present in the brain and peripheral tissues, is involved in the metabolism of monoamines and is vital for cognition. This study was designed to examine the protective effect of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) on MAO and amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), non-adrenaline (NA) levels. METHOD: In this experiment, out of five groups, three groups of animals were pretreated with one of the test drugs each i.e., Chrysin (10 mg/kg), ACV (0.7% v/v) and Rivastigmine (2.5 mg/kg) along with Zn with high fat diet (HFD) for 3 months and the rest two groups were that of control and disease induced. After the treatment period, mice were examined for MAO-A & B, DA, 5-HT and NA level estimation. RESULTS: The results showed that Zn with HFD had induced a significant increase (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) in MAO-A & B levels and a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the levels of 5-HT, DA, and NA. Pretreatment of test drugs with Zn with HFD caused a restoration activity and a significant decrease (p < 0.01, p < 0.05) in MAO-A & B levels and a significant increase (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001) in the level of DA, 5HT and NA as compared to the Zn treated group. Amongst all three test drugs mentioned above, the ACV-treated group showed the most improvement during pretreatment. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ACV, might prove to be a beneficial nutraceutical & provide a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurological diseases.
