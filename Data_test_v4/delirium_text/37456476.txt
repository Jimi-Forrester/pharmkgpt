37456476|t|Relationship Between Neck Circumference and Risk Factors of Metabolic Syndrome in a Bushehr Elderly Health Study.
37456476|a|Metabolic syndrome includes a set of metabolic disorders such as obesity, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, lipid disorders, and glucose intolerance. In this cross-sectional (descriptive-analytical) study, 2,426 people were selected from the 60 years old and above population of Bushehr for a second-phase investigation of the relationship between neck circumference (NC) and cardiometabolic risk factors in the elderly people. The data (mean and standard deviation) were analyzed using STATA MP Version 15 software. The results of the study showed that the average age of all elderly participants in the study was 69.34 +- 6.39 years. The mean and standard deviation of the NC index in men, women, and all participants were 39.31 +- 2.89, 34.86 +- 2.84, and 37.00 +- 3.62, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of most laboratory indicators (triglyceride [TG], total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) were significantly higher in women, and there was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) between men and women. NC index in the total population was significantly associated with all risk factors of metabolic syndrome (body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure) and laboratory indicators (FBG, TG, TC, LDLC, and HDL). The present study shows that the NC index can be a good predictor for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and visceral adipose tissue in the elderly.
