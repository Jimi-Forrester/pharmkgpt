34925994|a|Background Although subarachnoid block (SAB) is the most popular regional anesthesia (RA) technique for fixation of femur fractures, continuous lumbar epidural (CLE) anesthesia, and lumbosacral plexus blocks (LSPB) are also employed in specific situations. The choice of RA technique depends on either the choice of the anesthesiologist or based on the underlying comorbidities. At our institute, we anesthetize elderly patients who come for fixation of femur fracture with multiple comorbidities using RA techniques as mentioned based on comorbidities and overall general condition.  Methods In a cohort of 184 elderly patients, we analyzed RA techniques employed over a period of five years in elderly patients admitted with fractures of the proximal femur, its hemodynamic implications and thus attempted to find the suitable RA technique with minimal adverse events after ethics committee approval. We also compared the length of stay in the hospital in relation to RA techniques. Results The demographic data was comparable with no significant difference in administering the three RA techniques. SAB, CLE and LSPB was implemented at 33.33%, 35.96%, and 30.7% respectively. Perioperative noradrenaline infusion was a feature in patients who received SAB (p<0/001). The higher number of CLE and LSPB patients had a length of stay of fewer than 48 hours whereas most SAB patients had a length of stay of more than 48 hrs (p<0.001). Conclusion Elderly patients with multiple comorbidities should be offered CLE instead of SAB so as to maintain stable hemodynamics. RA technique in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities should be standardized so as to provide uneventful surgical anesthesia.
