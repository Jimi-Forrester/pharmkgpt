34688543|t|Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome for Anesthesiologists: A Narrative Review and a Pragmatic Approach to Clinical Care.
34688543|a|Post-acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome is a novel, poorly understood clinical entity with life-impacting ramifications. Patients with this syndrome, also known as "COVID-19 long-haulers," often present with nonspecific ailments involving more than one body system. The most common complaints include dyspnea, fatigue, brain fog, and chest pain. There currently is no single agreed-upon definition for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, but most agree that criterion for this syndrome is the persistence of mental and physical health consequences after initial infection. Given the millions of acute infections in the United States over the course of the pandemic, perioperative providers will encounter these patients in clinical practice in growing numbers. Symptoms of the COVID-19 long-haulers should not be minimized, as these patients are at higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications and perioperative mortality for up to seven weeks after initial illness. Instead, a cautious multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation should be performed. Perioperative care should be viewed through the prism of best practices already in use, such as avoidance of benzodiazepines in patients with cognitive impairment and use of lung-protective ventilation. Recommendations especially relevant to the COVID-19 long-haulers include assessment of critical care myopathies and neuropathies to determine suitable neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal, preoperative workup of insidious cardiac or pulmonary pathologies in previously healthy patients, and, thorough medication review, particularly of anticoagulation regimens and chronic steroid use. In this article, the authors define the syndrome, synthesize the available scientific evidence, and make pragmatic suggestions regarding the perioperative clinical care of COVID-19 long-haulers.
