23164550|t|Amyloid imaging and cognitive decline in nondemented oldest-old: the 90+ Study.
23164550|a|BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cognitive performance and beta amyloid (Abeta) load determined by florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (PET) in nondemented oldest-old. METHODS: Thirteen nondemented (normal or cognitively impaired nondemented) participants (median age, 94.2 years) from The 90+ Study underwent florbetapir-PET scanning within 3 months of baseline neuropsychological testing. Amyloid load was measured with a semi-automated quantitative analysis of average cortical-to-cerebellar standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) and a visual interpretation (Abeta- or Abeta+). Neuropsychological testing was repeated every 6 months. RESULTS: At baseline, SUVr correlated significantly with tests of global cognition and memory. During follow-up (median, 1.5 years), the Abeta+ group had steeper declines on most cognitive tests, particularly global cognitive measures. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that greater amyloid load is associated with poorer cognition and faster cognitive decline in nondemented oldest-old. Amyloid load may identify individuals at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
