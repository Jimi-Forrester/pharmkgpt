38293129|a|Lifespan is influenced by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Studying those factors in model organisms of a single genetic background limits their translational value for humans. Here, we mapped lifespan determinants in 85 genetically diverse C. elegans recombinant intercross advanced inbred lines (RIAILs). We assessed molecular profiles - transcriptome, proteome, and lipidome - and life-history traits, including lifespan, development, growth dynamics, and reproduction. RIAILs exhibited large variations in lifespan, which positively correlated with developmental time. Among the top candidates obtained from multi-omics data integration and QTL mapping, we validated known and novel longevity modulators, including rict-1, gfm-1 and mltn-1. We translated their relevance to humans using UK Biobank data and showed that variants in RICTOR and GFM1 are associated with an elevated risk of age-related heart disease, dementia, diabetes, kidney, and liver diseases. We organized our dataset as a resource (https://lisp-lms.shinyapps.io/RIAILs/) that allows interactive explorations for new longevity targets.
