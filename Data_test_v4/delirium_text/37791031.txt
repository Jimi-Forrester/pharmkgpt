37791031|a|Introduction: Dementia increases the risk of polypharmacy. Timely detection and optimal care can stabilize or delay the progression of dementia symptoms, which may in turn reduce polypharmacy. We aimed to evaluate the change in polypharmacy use among memory clinic patients living with dementia who participated in a dementia care program compared to those who did not. We hypothesized that patients in the dementia care program would reduce their use of polypharmacy compared to those who were not in standard care. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data extracted from electronic medical records from a university memory clinic. Data from a total of 381 patients were included in the study: 107 in the program and 274 matched patients in standard care. We used adjusted odds ratios to assess the association between enrollment in the program and polypharmacy use at follow-up (five or more concurrent medications), controlling for baseline polypharmacy use and stratified polypharmacy use by prescription and over-the-counter (OTC). Results: The two groups did not differ in the use of five or more overall and prescription medications at follow-up, controlling for the use of five or more of the respective medications at baseline and covariates. Being in the program was associated with a three-fold lower odds of using five or more OTC medications at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio = 0.30; p <0.001; 95% Confidence interval = 0.15-0.58) after controlling for using five or more OTC medications at baseline and covariates. Conclusions: Dementia care may reduce polypharmacy of OTC medications, potentially reducing risky drug-drug interactions. More research is needed to infer causality and understand how to reduce prescription medication polypharmacy.
