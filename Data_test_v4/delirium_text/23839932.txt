23839932|a|Cholesterol can be converted to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24SOHC) by neuronal cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing 24SOHC levels reduced AD pathology. However, mechanisms underlying the effects of 24SOHC on amyloid-beta (Abeta) production have remained unclear. Here we report that 24SOHC treatment reduces Abeta production and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident immature amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and CHO cells stably expressing human APP. Treatment with 1-10 muM 24SOHC (equivalent to the concentrations detected in human brain homogenates) diminished Abeta production (IC50=4.6 muM for Abeta40) without affecting secretase activities. To evaluate the intracellular APP transport, we established an in vitro vesicle formation assay. We found that APP budding via COPII vesicles was diminished by 70% in 24SOHC-treated cells. The proteomics and immunoblotting analysis revealed that 24SOHC induced the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an ER chaperone, through unfolded protein response pathways, and enhanced the formation of the APP/GRP78 complex. Knockdown of GRP78 diminished the inhibitory effects of 24SOHC on Abeta production. These results suggest that 24SOHC down-regulates APP trafficking via enhancement of the complex formation of APP with up-regulated GRP78 in the ER, resulting in suppression of Abeta production.
