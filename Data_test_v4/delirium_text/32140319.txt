32140319|t|Thyroid Storm and Diabetic Ketoacidosis Presenting to the Emergency Department.
32140319|a|This paper diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Previous literature describes these two disease states presenting together, but most reports describe the etiology as uncontrolled diabetes leading to thyroid storm. After literary review, we present what we believe to be the first case of thyroid storm and DKA occurring in the same person on multiple occasions with an insulin pump. Additionally, we provide evidence that points to the thyroid storm being caused by DKA versus the traditional teaching of DKA precipitating thyroid storm.
