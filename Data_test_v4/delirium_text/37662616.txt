37662616|t|Antibody-Mediated Clearance of Brain Amyloid-beta: Mechanisms of Action, Effects of Natural and Monoclonal Anti-Abeta Antibodies, and Downstream Effects.
37662616|a|Immunotherapeutic efforts to slow the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by lowering brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) have included Abeta vaccination, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products, and anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies. Neither Abeta vaccination nor IVIG slowed disease progression. Despite conflicting phase III results, the monoclonal antibody Aducanumab received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treatment of AD in June 2021. The only treatments unequivocally demonstrated to slow AD progression to date are the monoclonal antibodies Lecanemab and Donanemab. Lecanemab received FDA approval in January 2023 based on phase II results showing lowering of PET-detectable Abeta; phase III results released at that time indicated slowing of disease progression. Topline results released in May 2023 for Donanemab's phase III trial revealed that primary and secondary end points had been met. Antibody binding to Abeta facilitates its clearance from the brain via multiple mechanisms including promoting its microglial phagocytosis, activating complement, dissolving fibrillar Abeta, and binding of antibody-Abeta complexes to blood-brain barrier receptors. Antibody binding to Abeta in peripheral blood may also promote cerebral efflux of Abeta by a peripheral sink mechanism. According to the amyloid hypothesis, for Abeta targeting to slow AD progression, it must decrease downstream neuropathological processes including tau aggregation and phosphorylation and (possibly) inflammation and oxidative stress. This review discusses antibody-mediated mechanisms of Abeta clearance, findings in AD trials involving Abeta vaccination, IVIG, and anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies, downstream effects reported in those trials, and approaches which might improve the Abeta-clearing ability of monoclonal antibodies.
