38374743|t|A Phase 1 Single-Ascending-Dose Trial in Healthy Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity of Intravenous PNT001, a Novel Mid-domain Tau Antibody Targeting cis-pT231 Tau.
38374743|a|BACKGROUND: PNT001 is a humanized full-length IgG4 S228P monoclonal antibody that binds the cis conformation of the phosphorylated Thr231-Pro232 motif in human full-length (2N4R) tau (cis-pT231 tau) with high selectivity and affinity. It binds selectively to cis-pT231 tau in human tauopathy brain sections, inhibits aggregation of tau, and has shown efficacy in preclinical models of tauopathy. Good Laboratory Practice six-month toxicology studies in cynomolgous monkeys have shown no test article-related findings. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of single escalating intravenous doses of PNT001 in healthy volunteers. DESIGN: Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled 16-week study. SETTING: Subjects were recruited across three clinical research sites in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty healthy volunteer subjects enrolled, with 49 receiving the double-blind study drug. INTERVENTION: Six cohorts were administered single escalating doses of PNT001 (33, 100, 300, 900, 2,700, and 4,000 mg). The subjects were randomized 6:2 (PNT001:placebo). MEASUREMENTS: Safety was evaluated by the occurrence of adverse events, electrocardiography, physical examinations, neurological examinations, vital signs, and suicidality. Pharmacokinetics and biomarkers were assessed via serum and cerebrospinal fluid sample analyses. RESULTS: Dose continuation after review of sentinel group data and dose escalation after completion of full cohort data were determined by an external, independent safety board. There were no study pauses or safety concerns identified by the safety board. A total of 49 subjects received the study drugs, with 36 receiving PNT001 and 13 receiving placebo. There were three related non-serious adverse events, each Grade 1, which occurred at the lowest doses and resolved without sequelae. No maximum tolerated dose was identified, and no premature discontinuations, dose reductions, or interruptions due to treatment-related adverse events occurred. One unrelated serious adverse event occurred in a placebo subject with an undisclosed medical condition. No other safety findings were identified. Doses of 900-4,000 mg produced concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid exceeding the binding affinity constant of PNT001 for cis-pT231 tau (45 ng/mL), indicating that concentrations sufficient for target engagement can be obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid within the tested dose range. The serum pharmacokinetic profile was as expected for a monoclonal antibody. The terminal half-lives ranged from 23.8-33.8 days, and the cerebrospinal fluid exposures were approximately 0.1% of the plasma concentration and dose-proportional. Of the 36 subjects receiving PNT001, one post-baseline positive anti-drug antibody result was observed at Day 112 in a subject who received PNT001 (300 mg). CONCLUSIONS: Single doses of PNT001 were safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels studied, including those doses expected to produce therapeutic benefit. These results support multiple ascending dose trials in patients with neurodegenerative tauopathies for this novel mid-domain tau antibody.
