38329703|t|Insights into single-timepoint ASL hemodynamics: what visual assessment and spatial coefficient of variation can tell.
38329703|a|PURPOSE: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) represents a noninvasive perfusion biomarker, and, in the study of nonvascular disease, the use of the single-timepoint ASL technique is recommended. However, the obtained cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps may be highly influenced by delayed arterial transit time (ATT). Our aim was to assess the complexity of hemodynamic information of single-timepoint CBF maps using a new visual scale and comparing it with an ATT proxy, the "coefficient of spatial variation" (sCoV). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Individual CBF maps were estimated in a memory clinic population (mild cognitive impairment, dementia and cognitively unimpaired controls) and classified into four levels of delayed perfusion based on a visual rating scale. Calculated measures included global/regional sCoVs and common CBF statistics, as mean, median and standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare these measures across the four groups of delayed perfusion. Spearman correlation was used to study the association of global sCoV with clinical data and CBF statistics. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four participants (72 +- 7 years, 53% women) were included in the study. The proportion of maps with none, mild, moderate, and severe delayed perfusion was 15, 20, 37, and 28%, respectively. SCoV demonstrated a significant increase (p < 0.05) across the four groups, except when comparing none vs mild delayed perfusion groups (pBonf > 0.05). Global sCoV values, as an ATT proxy, ranged from 67 +- 4% (none) to 121 +- 24% (severe delayed) and were significantly associated with age and CBF statistics (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The impact of ATT delay in single-time CBF maps requires the use of a visual scale or sCoV in clinical or research settings.
