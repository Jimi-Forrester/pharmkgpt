35699795|a|BACKGROUND: Children with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) carry a higher risk of respiratory complications after adenotonsillectomy. Their altered sensitivity to opioids may be a significant contributor to respiratory morbidity. The purpose of this study was to identify how anesthesia without opioids affects perioperative opioid demand and postoperative course. METHODS: A chart review of children with severe OSA (apnea hypoxia index; AHI >= 10) undergoing adenotonsillectomies was performed. Comorbidities and perioperative medications were documented. Perioperative opioid doses within 48 h of procedure were calculated as morphine equivalents (mcg/kg). Pain scores, rescue medications, and postoperative complications in PICU and non-PICU settings were also documented. Anesthesia without opioid and with opioid groups were compared. RESULTS: The analysis included 225 children. A significantly higher percentage of children received no postoperative opioids in the anesthesia without opioid group compared to those with opioid (46 of 88 children vs. 43 of 137; P < 0.05). The incidence of severe postoperative pain between the two groups was not different in PICU (P = 0.88) or non-PICU setting (P = 0.84). Perioperative opioid administration was significantly lower in anesthesia without opioid (median, Q1, Q3: 0.0, 0.0, 83.0) compared to with opioid (144.4, 72.5, 222.2; P < 0.01). Anesthesia without opioid was one of the independent factors to achieve perioperative opioid avoidance (<50mcg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia without opioid for children with severe OSA for tonsillectomy significantly reduced perioperative demand for opioid and did not affect the occurrence of severe pain. Anesthesia without opioid is an effective strategy to minimalize opioid demand perioperatively for children with severe OSA for tonsillectomy.
