34927156|a|Background: Family meetings are used in palliative care to facilitate discussion between palliative patients, their families, and the clinical team. However, few studies have undertaken qualitative assessment of the impact of family meetings on patients and their families. Objectives: To explore inpatients receiving palliative care and their families' experiences of participation in a patient-centered family meeting ("Meeting"), where the patient sets the Meeting agenda. Design: This qualitative study used the constant comparative method for thematic content analysis of the data. Setting/Participants: The setting was a specialist palliative care (SPC) inpatient unit in Australia. Nine palliative care inpatients and nine family members were interviewed. Measurements: Semistructured interviews were used evaluate the patients' and their families' experiences and perceptions of the Meeting. Results: Three overarching themes described the experiences of participating in a patient-focused family meeting, namely that the Meeting: (1) provides a forum for inpatients receiving SPC to speak openly about their end-of-life concerns, clarify issues, and is of comfort to patients; (2) provides the family members with a voice, and an opportunity to discuss their concerns and have their needs addressed; and (3) helps to ensure that everyone is "on the same page" and patient care plans can be discussed. Conclusions: These Meetings are a potentially effective means of supporting certain palliative care patients and their families to articulate, confront, and address end-of-life issues in the presence of the interdisciplinary team. It is important to undertake further research to further examine the evidence for this Meeting model and to identify the patients and families who would most benefit from this type of Meeting.
