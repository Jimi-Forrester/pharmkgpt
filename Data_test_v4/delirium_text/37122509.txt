37122509|a|BACKGROUND: We report a rare case of full neurological recovery from severe nonexertional heat stroke in a 67-year-old woman with an initial Glasgow Coma Scale of 3. This report raises awareness among doctors that when heatstroke is diagnosed, comprehensive treatment should be implemented as soon as possible. Moreover, targeted temperature management, combination therapy with hemodialysis and hemoperfusion, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy may alleviate multiorgan failure and prevent neurological sequelae caused by heatstroke. CASE SUMMARY: A previously healthy 67-year-old woman with an initial Glasgow Coma Scale of 3 was found lying prone on the road at noon on a summer day. Laboratory tests revealed multiorgan failure. As soon as heatstroke was diagnosed, comprehensive treatment was implemented. On hospital Day 3, the patient was extubated. Her initial Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at hospitalization was 14 and decreased to 2 on hospital Day 4. On the seventh day following hospital admission, as the patient's general condition improved, the levels of laboratory test findings decreased rapidly. Finally, the patient gradually recovered with no other neurological symptoms (the Glasgow Coma Scale at discharge was 15, and her ability to walk independently was restored). CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated that targeted temperature management, combination therapy with hemodialysis and hemoperfusion, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy may alleviate multiorgan failure and prevent neurological sequelae caused by heatstroke.
