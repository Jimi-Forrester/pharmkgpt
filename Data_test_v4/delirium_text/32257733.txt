32257733|a|INTRODUCTION: Differentiating between a urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria is an important distinction to make, especially in noncommunicative patients. An algorithm meant to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in this population was implemented within a psychiatric emergency department in January 2019. The primary objective of this project was to assess the impact of the algorithm (the intervention) regarding symptom documentation and antibiotic use. Secondary objectives included assessing changes in inappropriate prescribing and urine culture orders. METHODS: Preintervention outcomes were measured from August 1, 2018, through November 30, 2018, while the postintervention cohort included patients admitted after January 31, 2019 and discharged before June 1, 2019. Adults admitted to psychiatry with a urinalysis ordered in the emergency department and an ICD-10 code representing dementia, delirium, autism spectrum disorder, or intellectual disability were included; pregnant patients were excluded. RESULTS: The preintervention (n = 56) and postintervention (n = 34) cohorts were well balanced with an average age of 66.5 and 70 years, respectively. Neurocognitive disorder was the diagnosis for inclusion in approximately two-thirds of both groups. Numerically, postalgorithm implementation, symptoms were documented more frequently (20.6% vs 10.7%, P = .23) and antibiotics used less often (2.9% vs 14.3%, P = .15). Inappropriate prescribing occurred in 12.5% of preintervention cohort compared to no patients postintervention (P = .04). DISCUSSION: The creation and implementation of an algorithm assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in noncommunicative patients was associated with a trend toward increased symptom documentation and decreased overall antibiotic use, and significantly increased appropriate antibiotic prescribing.
