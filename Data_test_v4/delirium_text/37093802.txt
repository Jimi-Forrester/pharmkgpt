37093802|t|Short report: A trend analysis of attitudes towards early diagnosis of dementia in Germany.
37093802|a|BACKGROUND: Early detection of dementia provides numerous benefits for those living with dementia and their relatives and healthcare systems at large. Methods available for early diagnosis have improved significantly over the past years. Therefore, we examined whether support for offering an early diagnosis of dementia and willingness to pursue a respective early diagnosis have changed in Germany over the last decade. METHOD: We compared findings from two representative telephone surveys conducted among older adults in Germany (>= 60 years of age) in 2011 and 2022, assessing support for offering an early diagnosis of dementia and willingness to pursue a respective early diagnosis in a sample of n = 879 individuals (mean age: 72.9, range: 60-98 years, % female: 58.8). Group comparisons using Chi2- and t-tests and multivariable regression analyses were conducted, regressing support of an early diagnosis of dementia and willingness to pursue a respective early diagnosis on age, gender, education, employment status, belief in preventability of dementia and time of survey. RESULTS: Support for offering an early diagnosis of dementia was high both in 2011 (90.7%) and 2022 (79.2%), but declined over time (OR: .39; 95% CI: .25; .63). Willingness to pursue an early diagnosis of dementia declined from 70.7% to 60.1% in the same period (OR: .62; 95% CI: .45; .86). Belief in preventability of dementia was linked to support for offering an early diagnosis (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.25; 2.83) and willingness to pursue an early diagnosis of dementia (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.12; 2.07). Older participants less often supported offering an early diagnosis of dementia (OR: .97, 95% CI: .95; .99). CONCLUSION: Support for offering an early diagnosis of dementia and willingness to pursue a respective diagnosis is high in the older German public, but lower than reported previously. Improving knowledge on modifiable risk factors and better understanding of individual motives underlying endorsement or refusal of an early diagnosis may increase acceptance in the general public.
