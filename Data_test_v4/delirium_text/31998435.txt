31998435|t|The Multifarious Link between Cytochrome P450s and Cancer.
31998435|a|Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cytochrome P450s (P450s) play an important role in the metabolism of endogenous as well as exogenous substances, especially drugs. Moreover, many P450s can serve as targets for disease therapy. Increasing reports of epidemiological, diagnostic, and clinical research indicate that P450s are enzymes that play a major part in the formation of cancer, prevention, and metastasis. The purposes of this review are to shed light on the current state of knowledge about the cancer molecular mechanism involving P450s and to summarize the link between the cancer effects and the participation of P450s.
