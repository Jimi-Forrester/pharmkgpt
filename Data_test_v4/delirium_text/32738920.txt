32738920|a|Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), a state of sleep disorder, is characterized by repetitive apnea, chronic hypoxia, oxygen desaturation, and hypercapnia. Previous studies have revealed that intermittent hypoxia (IH) conditions in OSAS patients elicited neuron injury (especially in the hippocampus and cortex), leading to cognitive dysfunction, a significant and extraordinary complication of OSAS patients. The repeated courses of airway collapse and obstruction in OSAS patients resulted in apnea and arousal during sleep, leading to IH and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and subsequently contributing to the development of inflammation. IH-mediated inflammation could further trigger various types of cognitive dysfunction. Many researchers have found that, besides continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment and surgery, anti-inflammatory substances might alleviate IH-induced neurocognitive dysfunction. Clarifying the role of inflammation in IH-mediated cognitive impairment is crucial for potentially valuable therapies and future research in the related domain. The objective of this article was to critically review the relationship between inflammation and cognitive deficits in OSAS.
