35025654|a|Filament assembly of amyloid-beta peptides ending at residue 42 (Abeta42) is a central event in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Abeta42 filaments from human brains. Two structurally related S-shaped protofilament folds give rise to two types of filaments. Type I filaments were found mostly in the brains of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and type II filaments were found in individuals with familial Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. The structures of Abeta42 filaments from the brain differ from those of filaments assembled in vitro. By contrast, in AppNL-F knock-in mice, Abeta42 deposits were made of type II filaments. Knowledge of Abeta42 filament structures from human brains may lead to the development of inhibitors of assembly and improved imaging agents.
