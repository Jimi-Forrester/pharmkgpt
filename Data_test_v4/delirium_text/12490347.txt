12490347|a|The purpose of this investigation was to explore the psychiatric complications of liver cirrhosis in a Nigerian general hospital setting. The mental state of 31 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis seen in a gastroenterology unit, from July 1996 to August 1998, was assessed using the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) and Present State Examination (PSE) and compared with those of 20 hypertensive patients and 20 apparently healthy controls. The socio-demographic characteristics of patients with liver cirrhosis who developed psychiatric complications were compared with those without such complications. The mental status of the cirrhosis patients in the present study was also compared with those of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and hemodialysis patients in earlier studies. About fifty-five percent of all the liver cirrhosis patients developed diagnosable psychiatric morbidity. This was significantly higher than that of the hypertensive patients (15%) or healthy controls (5%) (P=0.0001). The psychiatric conditions were depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, delirium and adjustment disorder. No socio-demographic parameter had a significant effect on the mental state of the patients with liver cirrhosis. The same proportion (55%) of hemodialysis and a lower proportion (30%) of COPD patients compared with cirrhosis patients had psychiatric morbidity. We found a high rate of psychiatric morbidity in the patients with liver cirrhosis compared with those of hypertension and normal subjects. None of the socio-demographic variables considered was found to be associated with psychiatric complications in the liver cirrhosis patients. Poor medical conditions seem to be associated with high levels of psychiatric morbidity.
