33769137|t|The effect of a performing arts intervention on caregivers of people with mild to moderately severe dementia.
33769137|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-modal performing arts intervention (MPAI) for caregivers of people with mild to moderately severe dementia. The secondary objective was to examine how MPAI might change caregiver burden, caregiver resiliency, and perceived quality of life (QoL) for care recipients. METHOD: The study features a mixed-methods design. Caregivers (N = 32) completed the Zarit Burden Interview (caregiver burden) Brief Resilience Scale (resiliency) and Quality of Life-Alzheimer's disease measure (care recipient QoL) at five study timepoints. Semi-structured interviews (N = 15) documented the intervention's acceptability and caregivers' subjective experiences. Feasibility was indexed through withdrawal and attendance analysis. Braun and Clarke (2006) thematic analysis guided the qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Caregiver burden significantly declined from baseline through final follow-up. Caregiver resiliency and care recipient QoL were not significantly changed but trended up during the intervention until it dropped at the end of the program. Qualitative data suggests the reversal in resiliency and QoL may be explained by caregivers' increased anxiety as the program ended. Acceptability data indicated caregivers were unanimously highly satisfied with the intervention, desiring to continue participation. Feasibility findings provide recommendations for intervention improvements. CONCLUSION: MPAI could reduce caregiver burden and increase resilience for informal caregivers of a person with dementia. Effects drop off quickly at the end of the program, indicating the need for ongoing interventions that provide social support, a respite from the pressures of care recipients' dependency, and the relief that caregivers experience when they perceive benefits to their care recipient's well-being.
