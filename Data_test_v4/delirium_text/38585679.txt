38585679|t|Leadless Pacemaker Implantation, Focusing on Patients With Conduction System Disorders Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Retrospective Analysis.
38585679|a|Background: Impairment of the conduction system is a common complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which is typically performed in elderly patients. A leadless pacemaker (LP) may be a suitable option in this frail population, but the available scientific data concerning the efficacy and safety of leadless pacing after TAVR are sparse. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LP implantation in patients with relevant bradycardias after TAVR, compared to other indications. Methods: Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled. Demographics, background heart diseases, interventional parameters, and follow-up data were collected. Results: A total of 257 consecutive patients who underwent LP implantation were included. In 26 patients, the device was implanted due to bradycardias after TAVR (TAVR group), whereas the remaining 231 patients were in the population without previous TAVR (non-TAVR group). The mean implantation duration (56 +- 22 minutes in the TAVR group vs 48 +- 20 minutes in the non-TAVR group; P = not significant [NS]) and the implantation success rate (100% in the TAVR group vs 98.7% in the non-TAVR group; P = NS) were similar in the 2 cohorts. No significant differences occurred in pacing parameters (sensing, impedance, and threshold, respectively) between the 2 groups, either at implantation or during follow-up. A total of 8 major periprocedural complications (3.1% of patients in total; 3.8% in the TAVR group vs 3.0% in the non-TAVR group; P = NS) occurred within 30 days, without significant difference between the 2 groups. Conclusions: LP implantation appears to be safe and effective in patients after TAVR, and therefore, this procedure is a suitable option for this often old and frail population.
