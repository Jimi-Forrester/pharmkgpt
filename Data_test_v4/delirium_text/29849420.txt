29849420|t|Wernicke's Encephalopathy in a Patient Without Chronic Alcohol Abuse.
29849420|a|Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is traditionally seen in the emergency department in patients with chronic alcohol abuse. WE can result in significant morbidity and mortality if untreated, making early diagnosis and intervention paramount. We discuss a case of WE in a 63-year-old female with no history of chronic alcohol abuse, who presented with bilateral opthalmoplegia that resolved after intravenous thiamine administration. This case report highlights the varied clinical settings other than chronic alcohol abuse in which the diagnosis of WE should be considered.
