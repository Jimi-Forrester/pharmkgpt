36832879|t|Apple Pomace as an Ingredient Enriching Wheat Pasta with Health-Promoting Compounds.
36832879|a|The global overproduction of apples is associated with large amounts of post-production waste, for which new forms of utilization should be sought. Therefore, we aimed to enrich wheat pasta with apple pomace in various percentages (10, 20, 30 and 50%). The content of total polyphenols, individual polyphenols (using UPLC-PDA-MS/MS methods) and dietary fibre, chemical composition and physical properties of the resulting pasta were determined. The addition of apple pomace to pasta resulted in increased levels of pro-health compounds: total polyphenols, phenolic acids, quercetin derivatives, flavon-3-ols and dihydrochalcones as well as dietary fibre. Decreases in hardness and maximum cutting energy were also observed in pasta supplemented with apple pomace compared to control pasta. Water absorption capacity was not influenced by the addition of apple pomace, with the exception of pasta made with 50% apple pomace.
