31444942|a|Research on the neural correlates of anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease varied according to methods and objectives: they compared different measures, used diverse neuroimaging modalities, explored connectivity between brain networks, addressed the role of specific brain regions or tried to give support to theoretical models of unawareness. We used resting-state fMRI connectivity with two different seed regions and two measures of anosognosia in different patient samples to investigate consistent modifications of default mode subnetworks and we aligned the results with the Cognitive Awareness Model. In a first study, patients and their relatives were presented with the Memory Awareness Rating Scale. Anosognosia was measured as a patient-relative discrepancy score and connectivity was investigated with a parahippocampal seed. In a second study, anosognosia was measured in patients with brain amyloid (taken as a disease biomarker) by comparing self-reported rating with memory performance, and connectivity was examined with a hippocampal seed. In both studies, anosognosia was consistently related to disconnection within the medial temporal subsystem of the default mode network, subserving episodic memory processes. Importantly, scores were also related to disconnection between the medial temporal and both the core subsystem (participating to self-reflection) and the dorsomedial subsystem of the default mode network (the middle temporal gyrus that might subserve a personal database in the second study). We suggest that disparity in connectivity within and between subsystems of the default mode network may reflect impaired functioning of pathways in cognitive models of awareness.
