34203942|t|Applications and Limitations of Neuro-Monitoring in Paediatric Anaesthesia and Intravenous Anaesthesia: A Narrative Review.
34203942|a|Safe management of anaesthesia in children has been one of the top areas of research over the last decade. After the large volume of articles which focused on the putative neurotoxic effect of anaesthetic agents on the developing brain, the attention and research efforts shifted toward prevention and treatment of critical events and the importance of peri-anaesthetic haemodynamic stability to prevent negative neurological outcomes. Safetots.org is an international initiative aiming at raising the attention on the relevance of a high-quality anaesthesia in children undergoing surgical and non-surgical procedures to guarantee a favourable outcome. Children might experience hemodynamic instability for many reasons, and how the range of normality within brain autoregulation is maintained is still unknown. Neuro-monitoring can guide anaesthesia providers in delivering optimal anaesthetic drugs dosages and also correcting underling conditions that can negatively affect the neurological outcome. In particular, it is referred to EEG-based monitoring and monitoring for brain oxygenation.
