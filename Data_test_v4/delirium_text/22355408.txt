22355408|a|Soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates of various sizes, ranging from dimers to large protofibrils, have been associated with neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To investigate the properties of biologically relevant Abeta species, brain extracts from amyloid beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) transgenic mice and AD patients as well as synthetic Abeta preparations were separated by size under native conditions with density gradient ultracentrifugation. The fractionated samples were then analyzed with atomic force microscopy (AFM), ELISA, and MTT cell viability assay. Based on AFM appearance and immunoreactivity to our protofibril selective antibody mAb158, synthetic Abeta42 was divided in four fractions, with large aggregates in fraction 1 and the smallest species in fraction 4. Synthetic Abeta aggregates from fractions 2 and 3 proved to be most toxic in an MTT assay. In AbetaPP transgenic mouse brain, the most abundant soluble Abeta species were found in fraction 2 and consisted mainly of Abeta40. Also in AD brains, Abeta was mainly found in fraction 2 but primarily as Abeta42. All biologically derived Abeta from fraction 2 was immunologically discriminated from smaller species with mAb158. Thus, the predominant species of biologically derived soluble Abeta, natively separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation, were found to match the size of the neurotoxic, 80-500 kDa synthetic Abeta protofibrils and were equally detected with mAb158.
