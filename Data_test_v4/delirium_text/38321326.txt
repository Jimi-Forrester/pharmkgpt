38321326|t|A systematic review of the impact of brain tumours on risk of motor vehicle crashes.
38321326|a|PURPOSE: Brain tumours are associated with neurocognitive impairments that are important for safe driving. Driving is vital to maintaining patient autonomy, despite this there is limited research on driving capacity amongst patients with brain tumours. The purpose of this review is to examine MVC risk in patients with brain tumours to inform development of clearer driving guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using Medline and EMBASE. Observational studies were included. The outcome of interest was MVC or measured risk of MVC in patients with benign or malignant brain tumours. Descriptive analysis and synthesis without meta-analysis were used to summarise findings. A narrative review of driving guidelines from Australia, United Kingdom and Canada was completed. RESULTS: Three studies were included in this review. One cohort study, one cross-sectional study and one case-control study were included (19,135 participants) across United States and Finland. One study evaluated the incidence of MVC in brain tumour patients, revealing no difference in MVC rates. Two studies measured MVC risk using driving simulation and cognitive testing. Patients found at higher risk of MVC had greater degrees of memory and visual attention impairments. However, predictive patient and tumour characteristics of MVC risk were heterogeneous across studies. Overall, driving guidelines had clear recommendations on selected conditions like seizures but were vague surrounding neurocognitive deficits. CONCLUSION: Limited data exists regarding driving behaviour and MVC incidence in brain tumour patients. Existing guidelines inadequately address neurocognitive complexities in this group. Future studies evaluating real-world data is required to inform development of more applicable driving guidelines. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO 2023 CRD42023434608.
