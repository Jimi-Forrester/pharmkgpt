33972303|a|Teprotumumab (Tepezza), an insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor antagonist, was approved for treatment of thyroid eye disease in 2020. Teprotumumab is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for a total of eight doses. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhoea, muscle spasms, hearing impairment, dysgeusia, headaches, dry skin, infusion reactions and hyperglycaemia. We report here a 76-year-old man with Graves-related thyroid eye disease who developed a rapidly progressive cognitive decline after receiving four out of eight doses of teprotumumab (cumulative dose 4620 mg). He was admitted for workup and teprotumumab infusions were discontinued. Intravenous glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin were given which showed no improvement in clinical symptoms. He subsequently underwent plasmapheresis with resolution of his symptoms, suggesting a teprotumumab-induced encephalopathy. Further studies involving larger populations and longer durations are needed.
