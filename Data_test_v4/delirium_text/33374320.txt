33374320|t|FRCaMP, a Red Fluorescent Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicator Based on Calmodulin from Schizosaccharomyces Pombe Fungus.
33374320|a|Red fluorescent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have expanded the available pallet of colors used for the visualization of neuronal calcium activity in vivo. However, their calcium-binding domain is restricted by calmodulin from metazoans. In this study, we developed red GECI, called FRCaMP, using calmodulin (CaM) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe fungus as a calcium binding domain. Compared to the R-GECO1 indicator in vitro, the purified protein FRCaMP had similar spectral characteristics, brightness, and pH stability but a 1.3-fold lower DeltaF/F calcium response and 2.6-fold tighter calcium affinity with Kd of 441 nM and 2.4-6.6-fold lower photostability. In the cytosol of cultured HeLa cells, FRCaMP visualized calcium transients with a DeltaF/F dynamic range of 5.6, which was similar to that of R-GECO1. FRCaMP robustly visualized the spontaneous activity of neuronal cultures and had a similar DeltaF/F dynamic range of 1.7 but 2.1-fold faster decay kinetics vs. NCaMP7. On electrically stimulated cultured neurons, FRCaMP demonstrated 1.8-fold faster decay kinetics and 1.7-fold lower DeltaF/F values per one action potential of 0.23 compared to the NCaMP7 indicator. The fungus-originating CaM of the FRCaMP indicator version with a deleted M13-like peptide did not interact with the cytosolic environment of the HeLa cells in contrast to the metazoa-originating CaM of the similarly truncated version of the GCaMP6s indicator with a deleted M13-like peptide. Finally, we generated a split version of the FRCaMP indicator, which allowed the simultaneous detection of calcium transients and the heterodimerization of bJun/bFos interacting proteins in the nuclei of HeLa cells with a DeltaF/F dynamic range of 9.4 and a contrast of 2.3-3.5, respectively.
