32234103|a|BACKGROUND: Post-cardiac surgery patients exhibit a higher incidence of postoperative delirium (PD) compared to non-cardiac surgery patients. Patients with various cardiac diseases suffer from preoperative sleep disorder (SPD) induced by anxiety, depression, breathing disorder, or other factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of sleep disorder on delirium in post-cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: We prospectively selected 186 patients undergoing selective cardiac valve surgery. Preoperative sleep quality and cognitive function of all eligible participants were assessed through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, respectively. The Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit was used to assess PD from the first to seventh day postoperatively. Patients were divided into two groups according to the PD diagnosis: (1) No PD group and (2) the PD group. RESULTS: Of 186 eligible patients, 29 (15.6%) were diagnosed with PD. A univariate analysis showed that gender (p = 0.040), age (p = 0.009), SPD (p = 0.008), intraoperative infusion volume (p = 0.034), postoperative intubation time (p = 0.001), and intensive care unit stay time (p = 0.009) were associated with PD. A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age (odds ratio (OR): 1.106; p = 0.001) and SPD (OR: 3.223; p = 0.047) were independently associated with PD. A receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that preoperative PSQI was predictive of PD (area under curve: 0.706; 95% confidence interval: 0.595-0.816). A binomial logistic regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between preoperative 6 and 21 PSQI scores and PD incidence (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative SPD was significantly associated with PD and a main predictor of PD.
