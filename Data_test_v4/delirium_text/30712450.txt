30712450|t|Kv2 channels create endoplasmic reticulum / plasma membrane junctions: a brief history of Kv2 channel subcellular localization.
30712450|a|The potassium channels Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 are widely expressed throughout the mammalian brain. Kv2.1 provides the majority of delayed rectifying current in rat hippocampus while both channels are differentially expressed in cortex. Particularly unusual is their neuronal surface localization pattern: while half the channel population is freely-diffusive on the plasma membrane as expected from the generalized Singer & Nicolson fluid mosaic model, the other half localizes into micron-sized clusters on the soma, dendrites, and axon initial segment. These clusters contain hundreds of channels, which for Kv2.1, are largely non-conducting. Competing theories of the mechanism underlying Kv2.1 clustering have included static tethering to being corralled by an actin fence. Now, recent work has demonstrated channel clustering is due to formation of endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions through interaction with ER-resident VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs). Interaction between surface Kv2 channels and ER VAPs groups channels together in clusters. ER/PM junctions play important roles in inter-organelle communication: they regulate ion flux, are involved in lipid transfer, and are sites of endo- and exocytosis. Kv2-induced ER/PM junctions are regulated through phosphorylation of the channel C-terminus which in turn regulates VAP binding, providing a rapid means to create or dismantle these microdomains. In addition, insults such as hypoxia or ischemia disrupt this interaction resulting in ER/PM junction disassembly. Kv2 channels are the only known plasma membrane protein to form regulated, injury sensitive junctions in this manner. Furthermore, it is likely that concentrated VAPs at these microdomains sequester additional interactors whose functions are not yet fully understood.
