8788080|a|This longitudinal study measured the rate of spontaneous speech decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at a 1-year follow-up and determined the effect of clinical and demographic factors on that rate. In addition the pattern of spontaneous speech impairment was examined. The expected pattern of spontaneous speech impairment with prominent disturbances of communication and semantics, moderate disturbances of automatic speech, but with retained phonematic structures, was found at baseline and at follow-up in the majority of our rather large sample (n = 63). This result is discussed in terms of intrafunctional homogeneity and of selective involvement of neuronal systems in AD. There was a trend for a more rapid language decline in patients with a family history of dementia. No relationship was detected between the rate of spontaneous speech decline and other clinical and demographic factors, with the exception of initial spontaneous speech impairment.
