30640984|a|Objective To evaluate the effect of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TEAS) on propofol usage in closed-loop anesthesia delivery system and pediatric hemodynamics. Methods Sixty children patients undergoing selective tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy surgeries were randomly allocated to the TEAS group (T) and the control group (C) , 30 in each group. Anesthesia maintenance in both groups was performed by propofol closed-loop anesthesia infusion system after induction of anesthesia. Patients in group T were treated with continuous TEAS (2/100 Hz sparsedense wave, 8 - 12 mA) at unilateral Hegu (L14) and Shenmen till the end of surgery. No TEAS was performed to patients in group C. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before anesthesia (TO), immediately after intubation ( T1) , 5 min after intubation (T2) , 10 min after intubation (T3) , 15 min after intubation (T4) , the time for intubation (T5) , respectively. The total dose of propofol, times for propofol dose adjustment, average target concentration, cases of patients with extra Fentanyl were recorded during anesthesia maintenance. Bispectral index (BIS) was recorded. Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale and Modified Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (MCHEOPS) were assessed at T5, 5 min after extubation (T6) , 10 min after extubation (T7) , 15 min after extubation (T8), 30 min after extubation (T9) , respectively. Epinephrine (NE) was measured at TO, T1, T5, and T9, concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were measured at TO, T5, 24 h after surgery ( T10) , 48 h after surgery (T11), respectively. Results Compared with group C, MAP at T4 and T5 and HR at T1-T5 all de- creased, PAED scale and MCHEOPS decreased at T5-T9, NE concentrations were significantly reduced at T5 and T9, concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 decreased at T5, T10, T1 1 in group T (P <0. 05, P <0. 01). Compared with group C, the total dose of propofol, times for propofol dose adjustment, average target concentration were reduced in group T during surgery (P <0. 05, P <0. 01). Twenty cases (67%) used propofol in group C and 9 cases (30% ) used propofol in group T during surgery, with statistical difference (P <0. 01). Changes of BIS was not statistically different between the two groups (P >0. 05). Conclusion TEAS could inhibit stress response and inflammatory response of children patients, stabilize their hemo- dynamics during surgery, thereby reducing propofol dose in closed-loop anesthesia delivery system.
