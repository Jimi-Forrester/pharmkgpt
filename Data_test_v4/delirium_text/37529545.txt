37529545|a|Objective: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, digital health technologies (DHTs) became increasingly important, especially for older adults. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the rapid implementation and use of DHTs among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A structured, electronic search was conducted on 9 November 2021, and updated on 5 January 2023, among five databases to select DHT interventional studies conducted among older adults during the pandemic. The bias of studies was assessed using Version 2 of the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Results: Among 20 articles included in the review, 14 (70%) focused on older adults with chronic diseases or symptoms, such as dementia or cognitive impairment, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. DHTs included traditional telehealth interventions via telephone, video, and social media, as well as emerging technologies such as Humanoid Robot and Laser acupuncture teletherapy. Using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I, four studies (20%) were evaluated as high or serious overall risk of bias. DHTs have shown to be effective, feasible, acceptable, and satisfactory for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to usual care. In addition, some studies also highlighted challenges with technology, hearing difficulties, and communication barriers within the vulnerable population. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, DHTs had the potential to improve various health outcomes and showed benefits for older adults' access to health care services.
