1233152|a|In the whole history of mankind, hallucinogenic drugs have played a big part in religious and cult practices and have transmitted special religious experiences during a drug-induced ecstasy. The present extension of drug consumption with a view to solving personal conflicts and transitory experience of happiness, as well as the unsuccessful 'quest for God' of many young drug consumers should be understood in the context of the specific drug effects, of the technological developments of our times, as well as of the change and breakdown of religious and cult traditions. This desperate quest for happiness and religious experience calls for a critical reflection about the present sociocultural developments and raises the question of the necessity of an authentic religious life.
