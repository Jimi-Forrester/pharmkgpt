38493225|a|The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a brain region that influences vital neurobehavioral processes, including executive functioning and the generation of sleep rhythms. TRN dysfunction underlies hyperactivity, attention deficits, and sleep disturbances observed across various neurodevelopmental disorders. A specialized sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2)-dependent Ca2+ signaling network operates in the dendrites of TRN neurons to regulate their bursting activity. Phospholamban (PLN) is a prominent regulator of SERCA2 with an established role in myocardial Ca2+-cycling. Our findings suggest that the role of PLN extends beyond the cardiovascular system to impact brain function. Specifically, we found PLN to be expressed in TRN neurons of the adult mouse brain, and utilized global constitutive and innovative conditional genetic knockout mouse models in concert with electroencephalography (EEG)-based somnography and the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) to investigate the role of PLN in sleep and executive functioning, two complex behaviors that map onto thalamic reticular circuits. The results of the present study indicate that perturbed PLN function in the TRN results in aberrant TRN-dependent phenotypes in mice (i.e., hyperactivity, impulsivity and sleep deficits) and support a novel role for PLN as a critical regulator of SERCA2 in the TRN neurocircuitry.
