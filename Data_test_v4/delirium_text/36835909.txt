36835909|t|Norepinephrine May Exacerbate Septic Acute Kidney Injury: A Narrative Review.
36835909|a|Sepsis, the most serious complication of infection, occurs when a cascade of potentially life-threatening inflammatory responses is triggered. Potentially life-threatening septic shock is a complication of sepsis that occurs when hemodynamic instability occurs. Septic shock may cause organ failure, most commonly involving the kidneys. The pathophysiology and hemodynamic mechanisms of acute kidney injury in the case of sepsis or septic shock remain to be elucidated, but previous studies have suggested multiple possible mechanisms or the interplay of multiple mechanisms. Norepinephrine is used as the first-line vasopressor in the management of septic shock. Studies have reported different hemodynamic effects of norepinephrine on renal circulation, with some suggesting that it could possibly exacerbate acute kidney injury caused by septic shock. This narrative review briefly covers the updates on sepsis and septic shock regarding definitions, statistics, diagnosis, and management, with an explanation of the putative pathophysiological mechanisms and hemodynamic changes, as well as updated evidence. Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury remains a major burden on the healthcare system. This review aims to improve the real-world clinical understanding of the possible adverse outcomes of norepinephrine use in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.
