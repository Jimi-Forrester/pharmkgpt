26258539|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a part of Lewy body inclusions and involves the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains unknown whether or not genetic variation at the GAPDH locus contributes to the risk for PD. METHODS: A total of 302 sporadic PD patients and 377 control subjects were recruited in our study for assessing two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3741918 and rs1060619) in the GAPDH gene. Both allelic association and additive models were used to analyze association between GAPDH variants and risk for PD. RESULTS: Both polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk for PD after correction by Bonferroni multiple testing. The minor allele of rs3741918 was associated with decreased risk of sporadic PD (allelic contrast, OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.93, corrected P = 0.028; additive model, OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58-0.92, corrected P = 0.018). While for the rs1060619 locus, the minor allele conferred increased risk for PD (allelic contrast, OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.14-1.75, corrected P = 0.007; additive model, OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.15-1.79, corrected P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that GAPDH variants confer susceptibility to sporadic PD in a Chinese Han population, which is consistent with the role of GAPDH protein in neuronal apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study of genetic association between GAPDH locus and risk for PD in the Chinese population.
