However, in real world, limited radiotherapist and equipment cannot meet the needs of a large patient population to obtain timely radiotherapy after the index spine surgery in developing countries. This study aimed to estimate the clinical risks of delayed radiotherapy after surgery in patients with spinal metastases in developing country. METHODS: Data from 89 patients who underwent surgery and postoperative radiotherapy at a single site in a developing country were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into the progression before radiotherapy (PBR) and no progression before radiotherapy (NPBR) groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare the local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) between groups. RESULTS: Within 1 month after surgery, only 20.2% of patients underwent radiotherapy. Risk of local progression before radiotherapy at 1, 3, and 6 months was 1.2%, 24.1%, and 45.1%, respectively. The LC rate at 1 year was lower in the PBR group than in the NPBR group (53.3% vs. 76.3%, P = 0.040). The OS rate at 1 year was 61.9% and 79.6% in the PBR and NPBR groups, respectively (P = 0.001). The Karnofsky performance status significantly improved only in the NPBR group (52.5 +- 17.6 vs. 66.8 +- 26.3, P < 0.001). The sphincter dysfunction significantly improved in the NPBR group (0.3 +- 0.5 vs. 0.1 +- 0.3, P = 0.007) but it tended to be deteriorated in the PBR group (0.1 +- 0.4 vs. 0.3 +- 0.5, P = 0.500). CONCLUSIONS: In real world, about 80% of patients had delayed radiotherapy 1 month after spine surgery for metastases in our developing country. Patients had a higher risk for radiographic local progression before radiotherapy and poorer LC, OS, and quality of life as time to radiotherapy increased.
