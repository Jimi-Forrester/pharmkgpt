26967463|a|The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we have investigated the effect of soluble and aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alphaS), associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively, on the Cu(2+)-catalyzed formation of ROS in vitro in the presence of a biological reductant. We find that the levels of ROS, and the rate by which ROS is generated, are significantly reduced when Cu(2+) is bound to Abeta or alphaS, particularly when they are in their oligomeric or fibrillar forms. This effect is attributed to a combination of radical scavenging and redox silencing mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the increase in ROS associated with the accumulation of aggregated Abeta or alphaS does not result from a particularly ROS-active form of these peptides, but rather from either a local increase of Cu(2+) and other ROS-active metal ions in the aggregates or as a downstream consequence of the formation of the pathological amyloid structures.
