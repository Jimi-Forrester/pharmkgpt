32488697|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there has been no disease-modifying treatment for AD. Recent studies suggest that trehalose may have beneficial effect on neurodegenerative diseases through regulating autophagy and facilitating aggregated protein clearance. However, the effects of trehalose on AD-related neuropathologies are still unknown. Western blot was performed to examine the effects of trehalose on APP processing in vitro and in vivo. ELISA and immunohistochemical staining were conducted to measure Abeta production in vitro and neuritic plaque formation in APP23 transgenic mice, respectively. Trehalose treatment significantly decreased Abeta generation in HAW and 20E2 cells. Furthermore, trehalose treatment increased the levels of APP and its CTFs, and significantly reduced Abeta generation and neuritic plaque formation in APP23 mice. Our study showed that trehalose affected the APP processing both in vitro and in vivo and suggests that trehalose treatment may offer as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate AD pathology by inhibiting Abeta generation and neuritic plaque formation.
