7884164|t|A nursing protocol to assess causes of delirium. Identifying delirium in nursing home residents.
7884164|a|Because delirium is often a harbinger of underlying physical illness in frail elders--which can cause further morbidity and functional decline--it is essential to accurately assess the causes of delirium. Nurses working in nursing homes are in the best position to make these assessments and advocate for the appropriate management of delirium. The implementation of the proposed nursing protocol may empower nurses and, thus, improve outcomes of nursing home residents suffering from delirium.
