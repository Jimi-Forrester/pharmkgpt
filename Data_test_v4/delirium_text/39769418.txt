39769418|t|Pharmacological Mechanisms of Bile Acids Targeting the Farnesoid X Receptor.
39769418|a|Bile acids (BAs), a category of amphiphilic metabolites synthesized by liver cells and released into the intestine via the bile duct, serve a vital role in the emulsification of ingested fats during the digestive process. Beyond their conventional emulsifying function, BAs, with their diverse structures, also act as significant hormones within the body. They are pivotal in facilitating nutrient absorption by interacting with the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and they serve as key regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as immune system balance. Consequently, BAs contribute to the metabolism of glucose and lipids, enhance the digestion and absorption of lipids, and maintain the equilibrium of the bile pool. Their actions are instrumental in addressing obesity, managing cholestasis, and treating diabetes, and are involved in the onset and progression of cancer. This paper presents an updated systematic review of the pharmacological mechanisms by which BAs target the FXR, incorporating recent findings and discussing their signaling pathways in the context of novel research, including their distinct roles in various disease states and populations. The aim is to provide a theoretical foundation for the continued research and clinical application of BAs.
