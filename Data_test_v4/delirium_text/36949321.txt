36949321|a|In this chapter, we conducted a systemic literature review for the anti-inflammatory effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) applying molecular mechanisms focusing on the neuroinflammation and gut-brain axis in three neuropsychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. We demonstrated the anti-inflammation or immunomodulation effects of TCM, including acupuncture, from basic and clinical research, including cellular and molecular approaches. In conclusion, inflammation plays a critical role in the neuropsychopathological process. At the same time, anti-inflammation seems to be the common biological pathway for the effects of TCM and acupuncture in depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
