33036256|t|Astrocytes: News about Brain Health and Diseases.
33036256|a|Astrocytes, the most numerous glial cells in the brains of humans and other mammalian animals, have been studied since their discovery over 100 years ago. For many decades, however, astrocytes were believed to operate as a glue, providing only mechanical and metabolic support to adjacent neurons. Starting from a "revolution" initiated about 25 years ago, numerous astrocyte functions have been reconsidered, some previously unknown, others attributed to neurons or other cell types. The knowledge of astrocytes has been continuously growing during the last few years. Based on these considerations, in the present review, different from single or general overviews, focused on six astrocyte functions, chosen due in their relevance in both brain physiology and pathology. Astrocytes, previously believed to be homogeneous, are now recognized to be heterogeneous, composed by types distinct in structure, distribution, and function; their cooperation with microglia is known to govern local neuroinflammation and brain restoration upon traumatic injuries; and astrocyte senescence is relevant for the development of both health and diseases. Knowledge regarding the role of astrocytes in tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease has grow considerably. The multiple properties emphasized here, relevant for the present state of astrocytes, will be further developed by ongoing and future studies.
