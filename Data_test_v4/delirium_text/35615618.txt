Thyroid storm is found in only 1-2% of hyperthyroid parturients (0.1-0.4% of all pregnancies). Burch and Wartofsky scoring system is useful for the identification of thyroid storms. Myxedema coma is an extremely rare complication of overt hypothyroidism with a 20% mortality rate. Diabetic ketoacidosis usually reported in the second and third trimesters carries a risk of fetal loss in 10-25% of cases. The size of the tumor rises in 2.7% of microprolactinomas and 22.9% of macroprolactinomas during pregnancy. Adrenal insufficiency in pregnancy is usually caused by primary adrenal failure, which is mostly autoimmune in origin. Pheochromocytoma may present as preeclampsia during pregnancy. Unrecognized pheochromocytoma is associated with a maternal mortality rate of 50%. Shared decision-making and close coordination between critical care, anesthesiology, obstetrics, and endocrinology can help in assuring good maternal and fetal outcomes.
