34852739|a|Elevated peripheral expression of homocysteine (Hcy) is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, diabetes, and cancer. It is also associated with cognitive impairment as it has been reported that high levels of Hcy cause cognitive dysfunction and memory deficit. Among several etiological factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Hcy seems to directly contribute to the generation of neurotoxicity factors. This study aims to hypothesize the molecular mechanism by which exercise can reduce the risk of neurological complications promoted by hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), and discuss how exercise could reduce the risk of developing AD by using bioinformatics network models. According to the genes network, there are connections between proteins and amino acids associated with Hcy, exercise, and AD. Studies have evidenced that exercise may be one of several processes by which acid nitric availability can be maximized in the human body, which is particularly important in reducing cell loss and tau pathology and, thereby, leading to a reduced risk of complications associated with HHcy and AD.
