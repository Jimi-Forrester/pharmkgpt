37011864|a|For the past 20 years, the majority of cell culture studies reported that increasing cholesterol level increases amyloid-beta (Abeta) production. Conversely, other studies and genetic evidences support that cellular cholesterol loss leads to Abeta generation. As a highly controversial issue in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis,the apparent contradiction prompted us to again explore the role of cellular cholesterol in Abeta production. Here, we adopted new neuronal and astrocytic cell models induced by 3beta-hydroxysterol-Delta24 reductase (DHCR24), which obviously differ from the widely used cell models with overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the majority of previous studies. In neuronal and astrocytic cell model, we found that deficiency of cellular cholesterol by DHCR24 knock-down obviously increased intracellular and extracellular Abeta generation. Importantly, in cell models with overexpressing APP, we found that APP overexpression could disrupt cellular cholesterol homeostasis and affect function of cells, coupled with the increase of APP beta-cleavage product, 99-residue transmembrane C-terminal domain (C99). Therefore, we suppose the results derived from the APP knock-in models will need to be re-evaluated. One rational explanation for the discrepancy between our outcomes and the previous studies could be attributed to the two different cell models. Mechanistically, we showed that cellular cholesterol loss obviously altered APP intracellular localization by affecting cholesterol-related trafficking protein of APP. Therefore, our outcomes strongly support cellular cholesterol loss by DHCR24 knockdown leads to Abeta production.
