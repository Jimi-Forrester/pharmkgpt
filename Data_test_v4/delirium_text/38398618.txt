38398618|t|Anti-Neuroinflammatory Effects of Adaptogens: A Mini-Review.
38398618|a|Introduction: Adaptogens are a group of plants that exhibit complex, nonspecific effects on the human body, increasing its ability to adapt, develop resilience, and survive in stress conditions. They are found in many traditional medicinal systems and play a key role in restoring the body's strength and stamina. Research in recent years has attempted to elucidate the mechanisms behind their pharmacological effects, but it appears that these effects are difficult to define precisely and involve multiple molecular pathways. Neuroinflammation: In recent years, chronic inflammation has been recognized as one of the common features of many central nervous system disorders (dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases, depression, anxiety, ischemic stroke, and infections). Because of the specific nature of the brain, this process is called neuroinflammation, and its suppression can result in an improvement of patients' condition and may promote their recovery. Adaptogens as anti-inflammatory agents: As has been discovered, adaptogens display anti-inflammatory effects, which suggests that their application may be broader than previously thought. They regulate gene expression of anti- and proinflammatory cytokines (prostaglandins, leukotriens) and can modulate signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kappaB). Aim: This mini-review aims to present the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of the most important plants classified as adaptogens: Schisandra chinensis, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Rhodiola rosea and Withania somnifera.
