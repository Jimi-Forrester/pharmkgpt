36145134|t|Significance of Gut Microbiota and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Heart Failure.
36145134|a|Heart failure (HF), as the terminal stage of various heart diseases, seriously threatens an individual's life, health, and quality of life. Emerging evidence has shown that the gut microbiota comprises an important component of human physiology and metabolic homeostasis, and can directly or indirectly affect the metabolic health of the host through metabolites. Upon in-depth study of intestinal microecology, the "gut-heart axis" appears to provide a novel direction for HF research. Thus, this review primarily focuses on the relationship between the gut microbiota and its major metabolites-i.e., short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-and HF. It explores the mechanisms underlying HF and its effective treatment by targeting SCFAs to optimize current HF treatment and thus improve the quality of patients' lives.
