36289905|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is an aggressive and devastating age-related disorder. Although the causes are still unclear, several factors, including genetic and environmental, are involved. Except for symptomatic drugs, there are not, to date, any real cures for PD. For this purpose, it is necessary develop a model to better study this disease. Neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, differentiated with retinoic acid represents a good in vitro model to explore PD, since it maintains growth cells to differentiated neurons. In the present study, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a neurotoxin that induces Parkinsonism, and the neuroprotective effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), delivered by functionalized liposomes in a blood-brain barrier fluid dynamic model, were evaluated. We demonstrated PACAP neuroprotective effects when delivered by gH625-liposome on MPP+-damaged SH-SY5Y spheroids.
