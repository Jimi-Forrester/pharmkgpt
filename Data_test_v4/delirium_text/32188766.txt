32188766|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using cross-sectional PET to identify cognitive decliners among beta-amyloid (Abeta)-negative cognitively normal (CN) elderly adults. METHODS: We determined the highest Abeta-affected region by ranking baseline and accumulation rates of florbetapir-PET regions in 355 CN elderly adults using 18F-florbetapir-PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The banks of the superior temporal sulcus (BANKSSTS) were found as the highest Abeta-affected region, and Abeta positivity in this region was defined as above the lowest boundary of BANKSSTS standardized uptake value ratio of Abeta+ (ADNI-defined COMPOSITE region) CN individuals. The entire CN cohort was divided as follows: stage 0, BANKSSTS-COMPOSITE-; stage 1, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE-; and stage 2, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE+. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models investigated subsequent longitudinal cognitive change, and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET was measured 4.8 +- 1.6 years later to track tau deposition. RESULTS: LME analysis revealed that individuals in stage 1 (n = 64) and stage 2 (n = 99) showed 2.5 (p < 0.05) and 4.8 (p < 0.001) times faster memory decline, respectively, than those in stage 0 (n = 191) over >4 years of mean follow-up. Compared to stage 0, both stage 1 (p < 0.05) and stage 2 (p < 0.001) predicted higher FTP in entorhinal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Nominally Abeta- CN individuals with high Abeta in BANKSSTS are at increased risk of cognitive decline, probably showing an earlier stage of Abeta deposition. Our findings may help elucidate the association between brain Abeta accumulation and cognition in Abeta- CN cohorts. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in elderly CN individuals those with high PET-identified superior temporal sulcus Abeta burden have an increased risk of cognitive decline.
