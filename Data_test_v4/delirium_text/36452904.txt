36452904|a|Background: Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair can be performed with an antireflux procedure. Routine use of an esophageal bougie has been advocated to avoid an excessively tight fundoplication. The use of an esophageal bougie carries a risk of iatrogenic complications, such as perforation or laceration of the viscera. However, there is equivocal evidence for the routine use in the surgical literature. Methods: We present a retrospective analysis of patients with Types 3 and 4 paraesophageal hiatal hernias who underwent laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication without the use of an esophageal bougie, between December 1, 2010 and February 28, 2020, by a single surgeon at a community-based, academic hospital. Patients with a diagnosis of achalasia and gastroesophageal dysmotility were excluded. Perioperative outcome measures included: recurrence; prolonged postoperative proton pump inhibitor use; dysphagia; re-operation, and mortality. Results: A total of 174 patients (34 males, 140 females) underwent laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication. The average age was 63-years old. Four patients (2.3%) developed dysphagia with narrowing of the gastroesophageal junction, with one patient (0.6%) requiring postoperative esophageal dilation with bougie and eventual re-operation. Postoperative proton pump inhibitor use was 31.0% after 1 month. Overall hernia recurrence rate was 14.9% and the rate of re-operation was 6.3%. Overall mortality was 0.6%. Conclusion: We conclude that laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with fundoplication without an esophageal bougie is safe, effective, and efficient. Furthermore, bougie related risks are obviated with a comparable reported incidence of postoperative dysphagia and hiatal hernia recurrence.
