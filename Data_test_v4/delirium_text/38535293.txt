38535293|t|Integrative Analysis of Cytokine and Lipidomics Datasets Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Rats.
38535293|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant source of disability in the United States and around the world and may lead to long-lasting cognitive deficits and a decreased quality of life for patients across injury severities. Following the primary injury phase, TBI is characterized by complex secondary cascades that involve altered homeostasis and metabolism, faulty signaling, neuroinflammation, and lipid dysfunction. The objectives of the present study were to (1) assess potential correlations between lipidome and cytokine changes after closed-head mild TBI (mTBI), and (2) examine the reproducibility of our acute lipidomic profiles following TBI. Cortices from 54 Sprague Dawley male and female rats were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in both positive and negative ionization modes and multiplex cytokine analysis after single (smTBI) or repetitive (rmTBI) closed-head impacts, or sham conditions. Tissue age was a variable, given that two cohorts (n = 26 and n = 28) were initially run a year-and-a-half apart, creating inter-batch variations. We annotated the lipidome datasets using an in-house data dictionary based on exact masses of precursor and fragment ions and removed features with statistically significant differences between sham control batches. Our results indicate that lipids with high-fold change between injury groups moderately correlate with the cytokines eotaxin, IP-10, and TNF-alpha. Additionally, we show a significant decrease in the pro-inflammatory markers IL-1beta and IP-10, TNF-alpha, and RANTES in the rmTBI samples relative to the sham control. We discuss the major challenges in correlating high dimensional lipidomic data with functional cytokine profiles and the implications for understanding the biological significance of two related but disparate analysis modes in the study of TBI, an inherently heterogeneous neurological disorder.
