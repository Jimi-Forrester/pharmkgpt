25937848|t|Design and Synthesis of Novel Arylketo-containing P1-P3 Linked Macro-cyclic BACE-1 Inhibitors.
25937848|a|A series of arylketo-containing P1-P3 linked macrocyclic BACE-1 inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and compared with compounds with a previously known and extensively studied corresponding P2 isophthalamide moiety with the aim to improve on permeability whilst retaining the enzyme- and cell-based activities. Several inhibitors displayed substantial increases in Caco-2 cell-based permeability compared to earlier synthesized inhibitors and notably also with retained activities, showing that this approach might yield BACE-1 inhibitors with improved properties.
