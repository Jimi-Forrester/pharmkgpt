8751323|t|Interactions between alcohol and other drugs.
8751323|a|More than 75% of people age 65 and older use medications. Of the drugs most commonly used by older people, many have potential to interact adversely with alcohol. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and effects of drugs or alcohol may be affected. The major adverse clinical outcomes of drug-alcohol interactions are altered blood levels of the medication or of alcohol, liver toxicity, gastrointestinal inflammation and bleeding, sedation and delirium, disulfiram-like reactions, and interference with the desired effect of medications. Since alcohol is commonly used by elderly people, educating patients about the potential for these interactions should be a routine part of health care visits.
