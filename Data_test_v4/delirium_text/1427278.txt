1427278|t|Caregiving: role engulfment and the loss of self.
1427278|a|"Loss of self" was examined in a sample of spouses and adult children caring for a relative with Alzheimer's disease. Defined as a loss of identity that comes about as a result of engulfment in the caregiver role, it was found to be more common among spouses, females, and younger caregivers. Limited social contact and lack of social roles outside that of caregiver were found to be related to greater loss of self. It is associated with lower self-esteem and mastery and with greater depressive symptomatology.
