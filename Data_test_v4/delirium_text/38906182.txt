38906182|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological ailment that causes cognitive decline and memory loss. Cholesterol metabolism dysregulation has emerged as a crucial element in AD pathogenesis, contributing to the formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau tangles, the disease's hallmark neuropathological characteristics. Thus, targeting cholesterol metabolism has gained attention as a potential therapeutic method for Alzheimer's disease. Phytoremedies, which are generated from plants and herbs, have shown promise as an attainable therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease. These remedies contain bioactive compounds like phytochemicals, flavonoids, and polyphenols, which have demonstrated potential in modulating cholesterol metabolism and related pathways. This comprehensive review explores the modulation of cholesterol metabolism by phytoremedies in AD. It delves into the role of cholesterol in brain function, highlighting disruptions observed in AD. Additionally, it examines the underlying molecular mechanisms of cholesterol-related pathology in AD. The review emphasizes the significance of phytoremedies as a potential therapeutic intervention for AD. It discusses the drawbacks of current treatments and the need for alternative strategies addressing cholesterol dysregulation and its consequences. Through an in-depth analysis of specific phytoremedies, the review presents compelling evidence of their potential benefits. Molecular mechanisms underlying phytoremedy effects on cholesterol metabolism are examined, including regulation of cholesterol-related pathways, interactions with Abeta pathology, influence on tau pathology, and anti-inflammatory effects. The review also highlights challenges and future perspectives, emphasizing standardization, clinical evidence, and personalized medicine approaches to maximize therapeutic potential in AD treatment. Overall, phytoremedies offer promise as a potential avenue for AD management, but further research and collaboration are necessary to fully explore their efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action.
