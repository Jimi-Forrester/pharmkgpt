37513454|t|A Bio-Indicator Pilot Study Screening Selected Heavy Metals in Female Hair, Nails, and Serum from Lifestyle Cosmetic, Canned Food, and Manufactured Drink Choices.

Heavy metals enter the body via the environment, daily lifestyle, foods, beverages, cosmetics, and other products. The accumulation of heavy metals in the human body leads to neurological issues, carcinogenesis, failure of multiple organs in the body, and a reduction in sensitivity to treatment. We screened for Cr, Al, Pb, and Cd in selected foods, beverages, and cosmetics products depending on questionnaire outcomes from female volunteers. We also screened for Cr, Al, Pb, and Cd on hair, nails, and serum samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) from the same volunteers, and we analyzed the serum cholinesterase and complete blood picture (CBC). We performed an AutoDock study on Cr, Al, Pb, and Cd as potential ligands. Our results indicate that the most elevated heavy metal in the cosmetic sample was Al. In addition, in the food and beverages samples, it was Pb and Al, respectively. The results of the questionnaire showed that 71 percent of the female volunteers used the studied cosmetics, food, and beverages, which were contaminated with Cr, Al, Pb, and Cd, reflecting the high concentration of Cr, Al, Cd, and Pb in the three different types of biological samples of sera, nails, and hair of the same females, with 29 percent of the female volunteers not using the products in the studied samples. Our results also show an elevated level of cholinesterase in the serum of group 1 that was greater than group 2, and this result was confirmed by AutoDock. Moreover, the negative variation in the CBC result was compared with the reference ranges. Future studies should concentrate on the actions of these heavy metal contaminations and their potential health consequences for various human organs individually.
