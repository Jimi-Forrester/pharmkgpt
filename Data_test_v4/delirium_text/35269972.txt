35269972|t|Multitask Quantum Study of the Curcumin-Based Complex Physicochemical and Biological Properties.
35269972|a|Density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and extended transition state natural orbitals for chemical valence (ETS-NOCV) have all been used to investigate the physicochemical and biological properties of curcumin and three complexes, i.e., Cur-M (M = Ni, Cu, and Mg). Based on DFT calculations, the enolic form (Cur-Enol) is more stable than the anti-diketone form (Cur-Anti diketone) favored for complexation. This enolic form stability was explained by the presence of three intramolecular hydrogen bonds according to the QTAIM analysis. Furthermore, the ETS-NOCV technique revealed that the enolic form had more significant antioxidant activity compared with the anti-diketone form. The calculations from the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Realistic Solvents (COSMO-RS) showed that the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent could dissolve all the curcumin tautomers Cur-Enol, Cur-Anti-diketone and Cur-Cu, Cur-Mg, and Cur-Ni complexes in contrast to benzene, acetone, octanol, ethanol, methanol, and water. Furthermore, except for Cur-Mg, which had a relatively low solubility (14 g/L), all complexes were insoluble in water. Cur-Anti-diketone was considerably more soluble than Cur-Enol in the examined solvents.
