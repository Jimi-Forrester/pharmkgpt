38353776|t|Delirium is associated with low levels of upright activity in geriatric inpatients-results from a prospective observational study.
38353776|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common in geriatric inpatients and associated with poor outcomes. Hospitalization is associated with low levels of physical activity. Motor symptoms are common in delirium, but how delirium affects physical activity remains unknown. AIMS: To investigate differences in physical activity between geriatric inpatients with and without delirium. METHODS: We included acutely admitted patients >= 75 years in a prospective observational study at a medical geriatric ward at a Norwegian University Hospital. Delirium was diagnosed according to the DSM-5 criteria. Physical activity was measured by an accelerometer-based device worn on the right thigh. The main outcome was time in upright position (upright time) per 24 h (00.00 to 23.59) on the first day of hospitalization with verified delirium status. Group differences were analysed using t test. RESULTS: We included 237 patients, mean age 86.1 years (Standard Deviation (SD) 5.1), and 73 patients (30.8%) had delirium. Mean upright time day 1 for the entire group was 92.2 min (SD 84.3), with 50.9 min (SD 50.7) in the delirium group and 110.6 min (SD 89.7) in the no-delirium group, mean difference 59.7 minutes, 95% Confidence Interval 41.6 to 77.8, p value < 0.001. DISCUSSION: Low levels of physical activity in patients with delirium raise the question if immobilization may contribute to poor outcomes in delirium. Future studies should investigate if mobilization interventions could improve outcomes of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of geriatric inpatients, the group with delirium had lower levels of physical activity than the group without delirium.
