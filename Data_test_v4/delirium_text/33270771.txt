33270771|a|A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with relative molar sensitivity (RMS) based on 1H quantitative NMR spectroscopy (1H-qNMR) has been developed for food ingredients such as acteoside (verbascoside) and pedaliin (pedalitin-6-O-glucoside) without requiring authentic and identical standards as the reliable analytical methods. This method is used methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (MHB) as an alternative reference standard. Each RMS is also calculated from the ratio of each analyte's molar absorption coefficient to that of MHB after correcting the purities of the analytes and reference standard by 1H-qNMR. Therefore, this method can quantify several analytes with metrological traceability to the International System of Units (SI) using the RMS and one alternative reference standard. In this study, the content of acteoside and pedaliin in several samples, such as dried sesame leaf powders and commercially processed foods, can be determined by the proposed RMS method and demonstrated in good agreement that obtained by a conventional method. Moreover, the proposed method yields analytical data with SI-traceability without the need for an authentic and identical analyte standard. Thus, the proposed RMS method is a useful and practical tool for determining acteoside and pedaliin in terms of the accuracy of quantitative values, the routine analysis, and the cost of reagents.
