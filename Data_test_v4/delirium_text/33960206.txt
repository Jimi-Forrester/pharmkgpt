33960206|t|Physician Palliative Education Associated With High Use of Hospice Care Service.
33960206|a|BACKGROUND: Taiwan's National Health Insurance provides coverage for palliative and hospice care. The following 10 types of diseases have been added to the National Health Insurance reimbursement regulation: end-stage cancer, motor neuron disease, organic psychosis, brain degeneration, heart failure, chronic airway obstruction diseases, other lung diseases, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, acute renal failure, and chronic renal failure. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between physicians' palliative education and use of hospice care in hospitalized patients at the end of life. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study in a Taipei community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who died between 2014 and 2019 were identified. The deceased had at least 1 of the 10 diseases covered by health insurance were included. Hospice care services included hospice ward care and hospice shared care. This study included 2,661 individuals. In total, 972 (36.5%) patients used hospice care services. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, physicians' palliative education was found to significantly associated with the use of hospice care (OR: 14.38, 95% CI: 10.90-18.98). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' palliative education was found to be an independent factor associated with higher use of hospice care. The findings suggest increasing palliative and hospice education among physicians so that they can ensure that their patients have high-quality end-of-life medical care in an aging society.
