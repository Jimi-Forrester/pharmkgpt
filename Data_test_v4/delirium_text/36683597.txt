36683597|t|The Hemoglobin-to-Red Cell Distribution Width Ratio to Predict All-Cause Mortality in Patients with Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy in the MIMIC-IV Database.
36683597|a|Objective: The hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is associated with the prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). This study aimed to determine the relationship between HRR and SAE and to clarify the possible mechanism of HRR as a prognostic factor for SAE. Methods: A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess the correlation between HRR and all-cause mortality. Piecewise linear regression and smooth-curve Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to observe whether there was a nonlinear relationship between HRR and all-cause mortality in SAE. Results: This study included 8853 patients with SAE. A nonlinear relationship between HRR and SAE was observed through a two-segment regression model. The left inflection point for the HRR threshold was calculated to be 15.54, which was negatively correlated with all-cause mortality (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.76-0.91, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions between white blood cell count, glucose, and patients who received dialysis and HRR. The inverse correlation between HRR and SAE was more pronounced in patients who did not receive vasopressin (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.87-0.96, p < 0.001) than in those who did receive vasopressin (HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.88-1.02, p=0.152) and was significantly more pronounced in patients without myocardial infarction (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.88-0.96, p < 0.001) than in those with myocardial infarction (HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.87-1.02, p < 0.114). Conclusion: This large retrospective study found a nonlinear relationship between all-cause mortality and HRR in patients with SAE in intensive care units, with low HRR being inversely associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with SAE.
