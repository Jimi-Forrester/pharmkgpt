29171997|t|Tau and Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Predict Driving Performance Among Older Adults with and without Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.
29171997|a|Abnormal levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, measured by positron emission tomography imaging using amyloid-based radiotracers and cerebrospinal fluid, are associated with impaired driving performance in older adults. We examined whether preclinical AD staging, defined using amyloid imaging and tau imaging using the radiotracer T807 (AKA flortaucipir or AV-1451), was associated with receiving a marginal/fail rating on a standardized road test (n = 42). Participants at Stage 2 (positive amyloid and tau scans) of preclinical AD were more likely to receive a marginal/fail rating compared to participants at Stage 0 or 1. Stage 2 preclinical AD may manifest in worse driving performance.
