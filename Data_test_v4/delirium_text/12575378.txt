12575378|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the regulatory effect and possible mechanism of Tiaoxin Recipe (TXR) on animal's Alzheimer disease related tau protein phosphorylation. METHODS: NG108 cell model was treated with Okadaic acid and related parameters were determined using MTT staining, immunoblot, coimmunoprecipitation assay, etc. RESULTS: Shown by MTT staining, NG108 cell activity decreased significantly after treated with Okadaic acid for 12 hrs, which could be ameliorated by TXR rat serum. Revealed by immunoblot method, the Okadaic acid induced elevation of phosphorylated tau protein could partly be reversed after co-treated with TXR rat serum. TXR extract could inhibit the binding of tau protein with presenilin-1, which may regulate the tau protein phosphorylation, and could be observed by coimmunoprocipitation. CONCLUSION: TXR could inhibit tau protein hyperphosphorylation, which might partially be due to the TXR caused binding of presenilin-1 with tau protein.
