23051135|t|Predictors of delayed identification of delirium in a general hospital liaison psychiatry service: A study from North India.
23051135|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the socio-clinical profile, treatment and outcome of patients diagnosed with ICD-10 delirium in a multi-specialty, tertiary care hospital setting. METHOD: Eighty consecutive referrals to the Department of Psychiatry were evaluated for ICD-10 delirium. Information was extracted retrospectively by chart review and documented in a semi-structured proforma for CL patients. RESULTS: Average time to referral was 5.3+-9.1 (range=0-56) days. Prevalent delirium at admission, sleep-wake disturbance, and specialty of referral were significant predictors of delayed diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Certain clinical variables that predict delayed identification of delirium in a hospital setting are targets for educational and clinical strategies designed to improve detection and management.
