26077686|a|Memory deficits are common among stroke survivors. Identifying neuroprotective agents that can prevent memory impairment or improve memory recovery is a vital area of research. Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is involved in several essential intracellular signaling pathways. Unlike many other kinases, GSK-3beta is active only when dephosphorylated and activation promotes inflammation and apoptosis. In contrast, increased phosphorylation leads to reduced GSK-3beta (pGSK-3beta) activity. GSK-3beta inhibition has beneficial effects on memory in other disease models. GSK-3beta regulates both the 5'AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase (TAK1) pathways. In this work, we examined the effect of GSK-3beta inhibition, both independently, in conjunction with a TAK inhibitor, and in AMPK-alpha2 deficient mice, after stroke to investigate mechanistic interactions between these pathways. GSK-3beta inhibition was neuroprotective and ameliorated stroke-induced cognitive impairments. This was independent of AMPK signaling as the protective effects of GSK-3beta inhibition were seen in AMPK deficient mice. However, GSK-3beta inhibition provided no additive protection in mice treated with a TAK inhibitor suggesting that TAK1 is an upstream regulator of GSK-3beta. Targeting GSK-3beta could be a novel therapeutic strategy for post-stroke cognitive deficits.
