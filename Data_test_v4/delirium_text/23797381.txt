23797381|a|BACKGROUND: Since the establishment of the European Association of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics in 1992, C/L psychiatry in European countries has been increasingly recognized as a subspecialty of clinical psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. The study explored the areas of work of the biopsychosocial oriented psychiatric consultation - liaison (C/L) service at the university hospital LKH Graz (Austria). METHODS: We conducted two prospective 1-year surveys over two years of observation. Survey I comprised 1,505 consecutive new consultations, and the more recent Survey II extended over 1,478 consecutive new referrals to our C/L service. Psychiatric referrals were analyzed with regard to demographic characteristics, referring departments, principal reasons for referral, diagnostic characteristics, and intervention patterns. RESULTS: In both surveys, the most common patient to be referred was a middle-aged woman. Internal medicine consistently accounted for almost one third of all referrals, followed by neurology. The most prominent reasons for biopsychosocial referral were any signs of abnormal mood, behaviour, psychotic symptoms or cognitive impairments. The most common mental disorders according to ICD-10 were adjustment disorders, depressive disorders, and delirium. Psychopharmacotherapy and combined psycho- and pharmacotherapy were the most frequent actions in both surveys, followed by biopsychosocial evaluation pretransplant. CONCLUSIONS: To ameliorate the provision of biopsychosocial care for general hospital patients, the need for specially planned biopsychosocial C/L services with equal involvement of specialists in medical psychology, C/L psychiatry, and clinical psychology should be underscored.
