28304292|t|Amyloid-beta Deposition and Long-Term Progression in Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease Defined with Amyloid PET Imaging.
28304292|a|The aim was to evaluate brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) using amyloid PET imaging and clarify the relationship between the annual change in Abeta deposition and disease progression. Forty-eight MCI patients underwent neuropsychological assessment and amyloid PET imaging using [11C]-PIB over a follow-up of 5.7+-1.5 years. Thirty-nine MCI patients who had an amyloid-positive scan were defined as MCI due to AD, and 9 MCI patients who had an amyloid-negative scan were included. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered MRI, and the PIB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) on the same regions was used over follow-up. Annual change in PIB SUVR was calculated. Patients with MCI due to AD had higher baseline PIB SUVR (1.81+-0.32, n = 39, p < 0.01) and a greater annual rate of change in PIB SUVR (0.044+-0.027, n = 39, p < 0.01) compared to amyloid-negative MCI patients. Twenty-eight (71.8%) progressed to AD. In patients who progressed during a short duration of 1.7+-0.8 years, the annual rate of increase in PIB SUVR was 0.101+-0.094 (n = 16, p < 0.05), which was greater compared to patients with long conversion or stable patients. There was a negative correlation between the annual rate of increase in PIB SUVR and duration of progression to AD among individual MCI converters (r = -0.47, n = 28, p < 0.05). The patients defined as MCI due to AD could progress to AD with a shorter period if they have a greater increased annual rate in brain Abeta deposition.
