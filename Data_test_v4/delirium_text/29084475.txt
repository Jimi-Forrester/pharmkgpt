29084475|a|The ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system are of fundamental importance to healthy brain function. Neuroimaging studies in humans have previously been conducted using various drugs that interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors, but no such studies have investigated AMPA receptor signalling. The recent approval of perampanel (Fycompa) for use in humans provides a means to specifically study the role of AMPA receptors in the pharmacological basis of neuroimaging signals. Twenty male subjects participated in this placebo-controlled crossover study that consisted of two study days separated by a minimum two-week washout period. On one occasion participants ingested a 6 mg dose of perampanel, and on the other a placebo. Ten minutes of wakeful rest was recorded before and after each dose using magnetoencephalography. Subjective ratings of intoxication were significantly higher following drug than placebo. Cluster-based randomisation testing of sensor-level magnetoencephalography data showed significant drug-induced increases in low frequency power (1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-13 Hz, 13-30 Hz), along with a significant decrease in the high gamma range (50-90 Hz). We also observed selective increases in functional connectivity in the alpha and beta bands. The findings are consistent with preclinical work and are similar to the spectral profile of other anti-epileptic drugs.
