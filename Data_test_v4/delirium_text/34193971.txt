34193971|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory loss, but the AD-associated neuropathological changes begin years before memory impairments. Investigation of the early molecular abnormalities in AD might offer innovative opportunities to target memory impairment prior to onset. Decreased protein synthesis plays a fundamental role in AD, yet the consequences of this dysregulation for cellular function remain unknown. We hypothesize that alterations in the de novo proteome drive early metabolic alterations in the hippocampus that persist throughout AD progression. Using a combinatorial amino acid tagging approach to selectively label and enrich newly synthesized proteins, we found that the de novo proteome is disturbed in young APP/PS1 mice prior to symptom onset, affecting the synthesis of multiple components of the synaptic, lysosomal, and mitochondrial pathways. Furthermore, the synthesis of large clusters of ribosomal subunits were affected throughout development. Our data suggest that large-scale changes in protein synthesis could underlie cellular dysfunction in AD.
