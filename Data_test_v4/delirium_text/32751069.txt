32751069|t|The Viral Hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease: Novel Insights and Pathogen-Based Biomarkers.
32751069|a|Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the identification of significant risk factors are necessary to better understand disease progression, and to develop intervention-based therapies prior to significant neurodegeneration. There is thus a critical need to establish biomarkers which can predict the risk of developing AD before the onset of cognitive decline. A number of studies have indicated that exposure to various microbial pathogens can accelerate AD pathology. Additionally, several studies have indicated that amyloid-beta possess antimicrobial properties and may act in response to infection as a part of the innate immune system. These findings have led some to speculate that certain types of infections may play a significant role in AD pathogenesis. In this review, we will provide an overview of studies which suggest pathogen involvement in AD. Additionally, we will discuss a number of pathogen-associated biomarkers which may be effective in establishing AD risk. Infections that increase the risk of AD represent a modifiable risk factor which can be treated with therapeutic intervention. Pathogen-based biomarkers may thus be a valuable tool for evaluating and decreasing AD risk across the population.
