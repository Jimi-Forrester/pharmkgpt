39359078|t|Diabetic peripheral neuropathy and neuromodulation techniques: a systematic review of progress and prospects.
39359078|a|Neuromodulation for diabetic peripheral neuropathy represents a significant area of interest in the management of chronic pain associated with this condition. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes, is characterized by nerve damage due to high blood sugar levels that lead to symptoms, such as pain, tingling, and numbness, primarily in the hands and feet. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of neuromodulatory techniques as potential therapeutic interventions for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, while also examining recent developments in this domain. The investigation encompassed an array of neuromodulation methods, including frequency rhythmic electrical modulated systems, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation. This systematic review suggests that neuromodulatory techniques may be useful in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Understanding the advantages of these treatments will enable physicians and other healthcare providers to offer additional options for patients with symptoms refractory to standard pharmacologic treatments. Through these efforts, we may improve quality of life and increase functional capacity in patients suffering from complications related to diabetic neuropathy.
