19751831|t|Animal models reveal role for tau phosphorylation in human disease.
19751831|a|Many proteins that are implicated in human disease are posttranslationally modified. This includes the microtubule-associated protein tau that is deposited in a hyperphosphorylated form in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The focus of this review article is on the physiological and pathological phosphorylation of tau; the relevance of aberrant phosphorylation for disease; the role of kinases and phosphatases in this process; its modeling in transgenic mice, flies, and worms; and implications of phosphorylation for therapeutic intervention.
