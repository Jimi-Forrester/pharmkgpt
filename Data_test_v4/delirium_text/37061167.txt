37061167|a|Medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions are differentially affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a specific involvement of the entorhinal cortex (ERC), perirhinal cortex and hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA)1. While amyloid (Abeta) and APOEepsilon4 are respectively the first molecular change and the main genetic risk factor in AD, their links with MTL atrophy remain relatively unclear. Our aim was to uncover these effects using baseline data from 130 participants included in the Age-Well study, for whom ultra-high-resolution structural MRI, amyloid-PET and APOEepsilon4 genotype were available. No volume differences were observed between Abeta + (n = 24) and Abeta- (n = 103), nor between APOE4+ (n = 35) and APOE4- (n = 95) participants. However, our analyses showed that both Abeta and APOEepsilon4 status interacted with age on CA1, which is known to be specifically atrophied in early AD. In addition, APOEepsilon4 status moderated the effects of age on other subregions (subiculum, ERC), suggesting a more important contribution of APOEepsilon4 than Abeta to MTL atrophy in cognitively unimpaired population. These results are crucial to develop MRI-based biomarkers to detect early AD.
