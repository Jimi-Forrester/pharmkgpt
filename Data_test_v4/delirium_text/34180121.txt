34180121|t|Puerarin attenuates intracerebral hemorrhage-induced early brain injury possibly by PI3K/Akt signal activation-mediated suppression of NF-kappaB pathway.
34180121|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can induce intensively oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and brain cell apoptosis. However, currently, there is no highly effective treatment available. Puerarin (PUE) possesses excellent neuroprotective effects by suppressing the NF-kappaB pathway and activating the PI3K/Akt signal, but its role and related mechanisms in ICH-induced early brain injury (EBI) remain unclear. In this study, we intended to observe the effects of PUE and molecular mechanisms on ICH-induced EBI. ICH was induced in rats by collagenase IV injection. PUE was intraperitoneally administrated alone or with simultaneously intracerebroventricular injection of LY294002 (a specific inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt signal). Neurological deficiency, histological impairment, brain edema, hematoma volume, blood-brain barrier destruction, and brain cell apoptosis were evaluated. Western blot, immunohistochemistry staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. PUE administration at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg could significantly reduce ICH-induced neurological deficits and EBI. Moreover, PUE could notably restrain ICH-induced upregulation of the NF-kappaB pathway, pro-inflammatory cytokines, ROS level, and apoptotic pathway and activate the PI3K/Akt signal. However, LY294002 delivery could efficaciously weaken these neuroprotective effects of PUE. Overall, PUE could attenuate ICH-induced behavioral defects and EBI possibly by PI3K/Akt signal stimulation-mediated inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway, and this made PUE a potential candidate as a promising therapeutic option for ICH-induced EBI.
