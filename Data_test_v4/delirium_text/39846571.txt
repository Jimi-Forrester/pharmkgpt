39846571|a|Introduction. Frailty is a common condition among older individuals and is associated with increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the impact of viral infections on frail populations. The present work aimed to determine frailty, functional and cognitive status, and clinical analysis of older persons in a long-term care facility in Chile, before and following the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods. A single-center, pre-post, and Pearson's correlational study was conducted in a cohort of 20 persons positive for COVID-19 from a total of 45 residents. Data on demographic, clinical, functional (Barthel Index (BI) and Katz) and cognitive (Mini mental Examination) status, and physiological function (hematology, lipidic and biochemical profiles) were collected. Results. The mean age was 84 +- 2.4 years, and 80% were females. The most common comorbidities were Arterial Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus type II, and Alzheimer's disease. Physical frailty was confirmed by body weight, body mass index, and calf circumference. Pre-infection, BI was negatively correlated with lipidic profile and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and positively with frailty (calf circumference). Pre-post analysis showed that frailty and most analytical results were not modified. However, functional dependence on daily live activities significantly increased as measured by BI, with worse grooming and bowel and bladder controls. Post-infection, correlations were lost except between BI and ESR, and decreased albumin levels were found. Conclusions. The worsening of specific functional limitations emphasizes the need for targeted interventions that can be correlated with ESR. Albumin appears as a potential biomarker for physiological dysfunction associated with their infectious/inflammatory processes.
