38703472|t|The role of heart rate variability in predicting delirium: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
38703472|a|Brain and heart interact through multiple ways. Heart rate variability, a non-invasive measurement is studied extensively as a predicting model for various health conditions including subarachnoid hemorrhage, cancer, and diabetes. There is limited evidence to predict delirium, an acute fluctuating disorder of brain dysfunction, as it poses a significant challenge in the intensive care unit (ICU) and post-operative setting. In this systematic review of 9 articles, heart rate variability indices were used to investigate the occurrence of post-operative and ICU delirium. This systematic review and meta-analysis reveal evidence of a strong predilection between postoperative and intensive care unit delirium and alterations in the heart rate variability, measured by mean differences for standard deviation of NN-intervals. Other heart rate variability indices [root mean squares of successive differences, low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), and LF:HF ratio] showed lack of or very weak association. A non-invasive tool of brain and heart interaction may refine diagnostic predictions for acute brain dysfunctions like delirium in such population and would be an important step in delirium research.
