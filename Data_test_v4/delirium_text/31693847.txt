31693847|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine post-operative physical performance factors associated with gait speed in patients surgically treated for hip fracture. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 59 patients (16 males and 43 females; mean age, 79.2+-9.1 years) who underwent hip fracture surgery were enrolled. Patients completed a 10-meter walk test (10MWT) to assess gait speed. Additional physical performance tests included the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors and flexors on the operated and non-operated sides as well as of the hip abductors (all tested using air-resistance weight machines), and analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters at about 6 weeks after hip surgery. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between the post-operative 10MWT and the post-operative TUG, age, swing phase duration, and gait cycle duration along with a significant negative correlation between post-operative BBS score, MVIC of the knee extensors and flexors on the operated and non-operated sides, MVIC of the hip abductors, and cadence and stance phase duration. Linear regression analyses revealed that the post-operative TUG (beta=0.85, p<0.01), gait cycle duration (beta=0.17, p=0.02), and osteoporosis (beta=-0.18, p=0.02) were associated with the post-operative 10MWT. CONCLUSION: The presence of osteoporosis, post-operative balance, and isometric muscle strength in the operated and non-operated legs were statistically associated with post-operative gait speed early after hip fracture surgery.
