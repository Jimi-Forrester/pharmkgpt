35453614|t|Group I mGluRs in Therapy and Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease: Focus on mGluR5 Subtype.
35453614|a|Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs; members of class C G-protein-coupled receptors) have been shown to modulate excitatory neurotransmission, regulate presynaptic extracellular glutamate levels, and modulate postsynaptic ion channels on dendritic spines. mGluRs were found to activate myriad signalling pathways to regulate synapse formation, long-term potentiation, autophagy, apoptosis, necroptosis, and pro-inflammatory cytokines release. A notorious expression pattern of mGluRs has been evident in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. Among the several mGluRs, mGluR5 is one of the most investigated types of considered prospective therapeutic targets and potential diagnostic tools in neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent research showed mGluR5 radioligands could be a potential tool to assess neurodegenerative disease progression and trace respective drugs' kinetic properties. This article provides insight into the group I mGluRs, specifically mGluR5, in the progression and possible therapy for PD.
