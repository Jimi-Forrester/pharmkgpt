12898042|t|[Psychopharmacological treatment in the pre-clinical emergency medicine].
12898042|a|Psychiatric emergencies are a common cause for a call for the pre-clinical emergency physician (EP). However, previous studies reported serious problems in diagnosing and particularly treating these patients. Although evidence-based treatment guidelines and algorithms exist for the most important somatic disorders the EP has to deal with, they do not for psychiatric emergencies. It is the aim of this review, subsequent to an extensive overview on the available literature, to provide the reader with differentiated suggestions for pharmacological crisis intervention as well as with treatment recommendations for different psychiatric disorders with an emphasis on the special needs in the pre-clinical emergency medicine. After conducting a literature research from 1971 to 2002, 31 double-blind trials were found comparing different antipsychotics and benzodiazepines for efficacy and tolerability. Further, pharmacological data and product information of the most commonly used drugs were evaluated. Following, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were generally assessed for their usefulness in the pre-clinical emergency medicine, the advantages of different drugs for specific indications are presented and dosage recommendations are given. As an antipsychotic, haloperidol still is the drug of choice. Within the benzodiazepines, lorazepam seems to have advantages over diazepam. An antipsychotic medication is particularly indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, mania, drug-induced psychoses and delirium whereas benzodiazepines are favourable for the treatment of anxiety, restlessness and agitation due to neurotic or reactive circumstances. There is some evidence suggesting that newer generation, so-called "atypical" antipsychotics may play a role in the treatment of psychiatric emergencies, however, controlled trials are necessary to substantiate their potential benefits in the preclinical emergency medicine.
