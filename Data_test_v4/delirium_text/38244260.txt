38244260|t|Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition affects the ratio of GluN2A/GluN2B receptor subunits through interaction with mGluR5 in the mouse brain.
38244260|a|N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) are the most studied receptors in mammalian brains. Their role in depression, cognition, schizophrenia, learning and memorization, Alzheimer's disease, and more is well documented. In the search for new drug candidates in depression, intensive studies have been conducted. Compounds that act by influencing NMDARs have been particularly intensively investigated following the success of ketamine in clinics. Unfortunately, the side effects associated with ketamine do not allow it to be useful in all cases. Therefore, it is important to learn about new unknown mechanisms related to NMDAR activation and study the impact of changes in the excitatory synapse environment on this receptor. Both direct and intermediary influence on NMDARs via mGluRs and COX-2 are effective. Our prior studies showed that both mGluRs ligands and COX-2 inhibitors are potent in depression-like and cognitive studies through mutual interactions. The side effects associated with imipramine administration, e.g., memory impairment, were improved when inhibiting COX-2. Therefore, this study is a trial that involves searching for modifications in NMDARs in mouse brains after prolonged treatment with MTEP (mGluR5 antagonist), NS398 (COX-2 inhibitor), or imipramine (tricyclic antidepressant). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) were selected for PCR and Western blot analyses. Altered expression of Gin2a or Grin2b genes after treatment was found. The observed effects were more potent when COX-2 was inhibited. The finding described here may be vital when searching for new drugs acting via NMDARs without the side effects related to cognition.
