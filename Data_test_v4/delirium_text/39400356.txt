39400356|a|AIMS: Although the neuroanatomical distribution of tau and amyloid-beta is well studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (non)-amnestic clinical variants, that of neuroinflammation remains unexplored. We investigate the neuroanatomical distribution of activated myeloid cells, astrocytes, and complement alongside amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau in a clinically well-defined prospectively collected AD cohort. METHODS: Clinical variants were diagnosed antemortem, and brain tissue was collected post-mortem. Typical AD (n = 10), behavioural/dysexecutive AD (n = 6), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) AD (n = 3), and controls (n = 10) were neuropathologically assessed for AD neuropathology, concurrent pathology including Lewy body disease, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), and vascular pathology. For quantitative assessment, we analysed the corticolimbic distribution of phosphorylated tau, amyloid-beta, CD68, MHC-II, C4b, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using digital pathology. RESULTS: Phosphorylated tau was distinctly distributed in each variant. In all variants, amyloid-beta was neocortical-dominant, with a notable increase in the middle frontal cortex of behavioural/dysexecutive AD. Typical AD and PCA AD had no concurrent Lewy body disease, whereas three out of six cases with behavioural/dysexecutive AD did. LATE-NC stage >0 was observed in three AD cases, two typical AD (stage 1/3), and one behavioural/dysexecutive AD (stage 2/3). Vascular pathology was present in each variant. In typical AD, CD68 and MHC-II were hippocampal-dominant. In behavioural/dysexecutive AD, C4b was elevated in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortex. In PCA AD, MHC-II was increased in the fusiform gyrus, and GFAP in parietal cortices. Correlations between AD neuropathology and neuroinflammation were distinct within variants. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that different involvement of neuroinflammation may add to clinical heterogeneity in AD, which has implications for neuroinflammation-based biomarkers and future therapeutics.
