39000025|t|Synthesis of 3,4-Disubstituted Maleimide Derivatives via Phosphine-Catalyzed Isomerization of alpha-Succinimide-Substituted Allenoates Cascade gamma'-Addition with Aryl Imines.
39000025|a|3,4-disubstituted maleimides find wide applications in various pharmacologically active compounds. This study presents a highly effective approach for synthesizing derivatives of 3,4-disubstituted maleimides through the direct isomerization of alpha-succinimide-substituted allenoates, followed by a cascade gamma'-addition and aryl imines using PR3 as a catalyst. The resulting series of 3,4-disubstituted maleimides exhibited excellent stereoselectivities, achieving yields of up to 86%. To our knowledge, the phosphine-mediated gamma'-addition reaction of allenoates is seldom reported.
