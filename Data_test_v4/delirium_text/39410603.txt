39410603|t|The Usefulness of the Regression-Based Normed SKT Short Cognitive Performance Test in Detecting Cognitive Impairment in a Community Sample.
39410603|a|Background: The SKT is a short cognitive performance test designed to assess impairments in memory and cognitive abilities such as attention and speed of information processing. In 2019, new regression-based norms for the English version of the SKT were calculated. This study has two aims: to establish valid cut-offs for distinguishing between no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (1) and to cross-validate the new norms for detecting MCI and dementia in a community sample of older adults with clinical diagnoses (2). Methods: The validation sample included 143 older adults (mean age = 87.7, SD = 3.55) from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (MAS Study). Participants were classified as having normal cognition, MCI, or dementia solely based on a consensus diagnosis; in addition, three tests (SKT, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III)) to measure cognitive impairment were applied. Sensitivity and specificity for all three tests, as well as bivariate correlations, were calculated. Results: The sensitivity of the SKT for the differentiation of cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) from normal cognition was 80.6%. The convergence between the SKT and the consensus diagnoses was 70.3% for all three diagnostic groups. All correlations between the three tests and the consensus diagnosis were significant (p < 0.01). Conclusions: In sum, it can be stated that the SKT is a valid tool for detecting early stages of cognitive impairment, performing very well in discriminating between no cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia).
