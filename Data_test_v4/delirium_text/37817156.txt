37817156|a|The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an evolutionarily conserved zinc-dependent metallopeptidase highly expressed in the brain, where its specific functions remain poorly understood. Besides insulin, IDE is able to cleave many substrates in vitro, including amyloid beta peptides, making this enzyme a candidate pathophysiological link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These antecedents led us to address the impact of IDE absence in hippocampus and olfactory bulb. A specific induction of microgliosis was found in the hippocampus of IDE knockout (IDE-KO) mice, without any effects in neither hippocampal volume nor astrogliosis. Performance on hippocampal-dependent memory tests is influenced by IDE gene dose in 12-month-old mice. Furthermore, a comprehensive characterization of the impact of IDE haploinsufficiency and total deletion in metabolic, behavioral, and molecular parameters in the olfactory bulb, a site of high insulin receptor levels, reveals an unambiguous barcode for IDE-KO mice at that age. Using wildtype and IDE-KO primary microglial cultures, we performed a functional analysis at the cellular level. IDE absence alters microglial responses to environmental signals, resulting in impaired modulation of phenotypic states, with only transitory effects on amyloid-beta management. Collectively, our results reveal previously unknown physiological functions for IDE in microglia that, due to cell-compartment topological reasons, cannot be explained by its enzymatic activity, but instead modulate their multidimensional response to various damaging conditions relevant to aging and AD conditions.
