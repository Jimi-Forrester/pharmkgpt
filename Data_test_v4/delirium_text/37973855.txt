37973855|a|The associations among Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade, medial meniscus extrusion (MME), and cartilage thickness in knee osteoarthritis (OA) remain insufficiently understood. Our aim was to determine these associations in early to moderate medial tibiofemoral knee OA. We included 469 subjects with no lateral OA from the Kanagawa Knee Study. KL grade was assessed using artificial intelligence (AI) software. The MME was measured by MRI, and the cartilage thickness was evaluated in 18 subregions of the medial femorotibial joint by another AI system. The median MME width was 1.4 mm in KL0, 1.5 mm in KL1, 2.4 mm in KL2, and 6.0 mm in KL3. Cartilage thinning in the medial femur occurred in the anterior central subregion in KL1, expanded inwardly in KL2, and further expanded in KL3. Cartilage thinning in the medial tibia occurred in the anterior and middle external subregions in KL1, expanded into the anterior and middle central subregions in KL2, and further expanded in KL3. The absolute correlation coefficient between MME width and cartilage thickness increased as the KL grade increased in some subregions. This study provides novel insights into the early stages of knee OA and potentially has implications for the development of early intervention strategies.
