36424548|t|Association between serum homocysteine and sarcopenia among hospitalized older Chinese adults: a cross-sectional study.
36424548|a|OBJECTIVE: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is considered to increase the risk of sarcopenia (S) and remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of S among older Chinese adults and explore whether homocysteine (Hcy) was independently associated with S. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed among older adults hospitalized in the Geriatric Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between June 2017 and December 2021. We measured all participants' serum Hcy levels, hand grip strength, gait speed and appendicular skeletal muscle index(ASMI) using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). S was defined based on the criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2 (AWGS2), which included muscle mass (ASMI< 7.0 kg/m2 for men and ASMI< 5.7 kg/m2 for women by BIA) and low muscle strength (handgrip strength < 28 kg for men and < 18 kg for women), and/or gait speed < 1.0 m/s. HHcy defined as Hcy >=10 mumol/L. The strength of the association between Hcy and the risk of S was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression using three models that adjusted for possible confounding variables to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among the 441 subjects, 161 (36.5%) were diagnosed with S, and 343 (77.8%) were diagnosed with HHcy. A significant association was detected between S and serum Hcy per 1-mumol/L increase after adjustment for age, gender, education, smoking, body mass index (BMI), Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), diabetes, kidney disease, and statin use (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-1.12, P = 0.002). The OR for S in the HHcy group (>=10 mumol/L) was nearly 5-fold that in the normal Hcy group (OR 4.96, 95% CI 2.67-9.24, P < 0.001). In a gender-based subgroup analysis that adjusted for age, education, smoking, BMI, MNA-SF, ALT, CRP, Hb, and ALB, female subjects with HHcy had an increased risk of S (OR 10.35, 95% CI 2.84-37.68, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that elevated Hcy levels have an independent association with S in older adults. This suggests that the downward adjustment of HHcy (cutoff value < 10 mumol/l) might decrease the risk of S.
