38234313|a|Aim: The aim of our study is to assess circadian rhythms in patients with chronic critical illness due to severe brain injury in intensive care unit by establishing the relation between melatonin and cortisol secretion, considering astronomical time and the sleep-wake cycle in chronic critical illness. Materials and methods: The study included 54 adult patients with chronic critical illness who resided in the intensive care unit for at least 30 days. The level of consciousness was determined using the CRS-R scale. We did the continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring with polygraphic leads for 24 h. Also, we determined the serum levels of cortisol and melatonin using the tandem mass spectrometry method with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Results: 90.74 % of patients had one acrophase in melatonin secretion curve, which suggests the preservation of the rhythmic secretion of melatonin. These acrophases of the melatonin rhythm occurred during the night time in 91.8 % of patients. Most of the patients (69.3 %) slept during the period from 2:00 to 4:00 a.m. The evening levels of cortisol and melatonin had an inverse relation (rs=0.61, p<0.05), i.e., a decrease in the level of cortisol secretion accompanies an increase in melatonin. Conclusions: We concluded from our study that the rhythmic secretion of melatonin and cortisol is preserved in patients with chronic critical illness that resulted from severe brain injury. No statistically significant discrepancy between melatonin and cortisol secretion, day-and-night time and the sleep-wake cycle are found. We may focus our future work on finding more reliable methods to stabilize the preservation of circadian rhythms to protect vital organ functions.
