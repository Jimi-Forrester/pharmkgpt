11098727|a|Memory troubles associated with age justify treatment and medical attention because they lead to real disabilities in daily living even without dementia, and also because they are early predictors of dementia in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the treatment of these troubles remains uncertain, badly codified and extremely variable depending on the health systems concerned. Moreover, the dominant idea of many physicians, in the general population and even in health authorities, is that it is normal to have memory troubles in the elderly. This fact explains the common attitude of therapeutic nihilism. However, recent progress in the treatment of AD demonstrates that this disease should not be considered as an irremediable phenomenon. Moreover, on the basis of the follow up of an elderly cohort, it is possible to determine subjects at high risk of dementia where preventive interventions could be undertaken.
