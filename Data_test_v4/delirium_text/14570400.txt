14570400|t|A metabolic basis for Alzheimer disease.
14570400|a|Most studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have focused on a single precipitating alteration as the etiological event rather than global changes closely linked to aging. Recent evidence suggests that the most significant of these global changes are metabolic. Here we present data indicating that metabolic rate, nutrition, and neuronal size are all early indicators of AD. Understanding the cellular and molecular basis for these changes may open a new dimension to understanding AD.
