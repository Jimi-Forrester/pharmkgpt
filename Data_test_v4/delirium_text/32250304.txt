32250304|a|BACKGROUND: Costs associated with early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD; mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and mild dementia [MILD]) are understudied. OBJECTIVE: To compare costs associated with MCI and MILD due to AD in the United States. METHODS: Data included baseline patient/study partner medical history, healthcare resource utilization, and outcome assessments as part of a prospective cohort study. Direct, indirect, and total societal costs were derived by applying standardized unit costs to resources for the 1-month pre-baseline period (USD2017). Costs/month for MCI and MILD cohorts were compared using analysis of variance models. To strengthen the confidence of diagnosis, amyloid-beta (Abeta) tests were included and analyses were replicated stratifying within each cohort by amyloid status [+ /-]. RESULTS: Patients (N = 1327) with MILD versus MCI had higher total societal costs/month ($4243 versus $2816; p < 0.001). These costs were not significantly different within each severity cohort by amyloid status. The largest fraction of overall costs were informal caregiver costs (45.1%) for the MILD cohort, whereas direct medical patient costs were the largest for the MCI cohort (39.0%). Correspondingly, caregiver time spent on basic activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, and supervision time was twice as high for MILD versus MCI (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Early AD poses a financial burden, and despite higher functioning among those with MCI, caregivers were significantly impacted. The major cost driver was the patient's clinical cognitive-functional status and not amyloid status. Differences were primarily due to rising need for caregiver support.
