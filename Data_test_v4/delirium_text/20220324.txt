20220324|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and associated factors of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients with balance and gait impairments. METHODS: Balance and gait impairments were assessed in 380 AD patients using the Tinetti test. RESULTS: A total of 120 (31.5%) patients had an abnormal Tinetti test, 96 (25.2%) had balance impairments, and 72 (18.9%) patients presented gait impairments. Global Tinetti score was associated with age [odds ratio (OR), 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.14], Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99), activities of daily living (ADL) score (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.83), and being man (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.78). Balance impairment was associated with age (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17), ADL score (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.84), and being female (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49). Gait impairment was associated with age (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15), MMSE score (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98), ADL score (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87), body mass index (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18), presence of comorbidities (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.96), and the Cornell score (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.12-7.89). CONCLUSIONS: AD patients are frequently concerned with balance and gait impairments. These impairments were associated to factors related to the severity of the disease (low MMSE and low ADL); nonmodifiable factors such as age or sex; and modifiable factors such as depression, obesity, and presence of comorbidities.
