8797211|t|[Case report of sodium valproate treatment of aggression associated with Alzheimer's disease].
8797211|a|Aggressive behaviors represent a major management problem in patients with dementia. Neuroleptics are commonly the selected psychotherapeutics for controlling severe aggression, especially the violent outbursts often seen in severely demented patients. But their efficacy for this problem is limited and their use is frequently complicated by side effects. Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine have been advocated as alternatives. Although sodium valproate can also be a potential alternative, only a few cases were reported. A 69-year-old man was admitted for the control of agitation, wandering and violence. He had an 8-year history of amnesia. The mental status examination revealed severe global cognitive loss. Cranial computed tomography showed moderate brain atrophy and dilatation of bilateral temporal ventricles. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was made. Initially he was treated with nuroleptics. Sulpride in doses up to 600 mg/day had no positive effect, but led to confusion and worsened aggressive behavior. Haloperidol in doses up to 4 mg/day or propericiazine 40 mg/day showed the same result as sulpiride. Carbamazepine had a moderate ameliorative effect on the agitation and violence, but the patient could not tolerate it because of muscle weakness. Then, we used sodium valproate 400mg/day and found this was effective. After one week muscle weakness appeared. Therefore, the dose was decreased to 200mg/day, achieving a blood level of 20.7 micrograms/ml. The patient's agitation was well controlled at that point and had no apparent side effects. Sodium valproate may be a useful agent in the treatment of aggression in patients with dementia.
