29880753|a|Butyrolactone-I (ZB5-1) from the coral-derived fungus Aspergillus terreus was investigated in this study to estimate its anti-neuroinflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglia cells. MTT assay indicated that ZB5-1 in tested concentrations had no cytotoxicity on BV-2 cells, and significantly reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), measured using Griess reagent, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ZB5-1 also down-regulated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a dose-dependent manner by Western blot analysis. Moreover, the effect of ZB5-1 on the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway was studied via the expression of phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 and inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB), and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 respectively. The results showed that ZB5-1 could inhibit the phosphorylation of p65 and IkappaB. Furthermore, molecular docking study suggested that ZB5-1 bound at the active sites of NF-kappaB to prevent its translocation to the nucleus. Therefore, we suggest ZB5-1 has a potential to reduce the anti-inflammatory response in LPS-induced BV-2 cells.
