31996371|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and its pathogenesis is associated with accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. Abeta is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) that is sequentially cleaved by beta- and gamma-secretases. Therefore, APP processing has been a target in therapeutic strategies for managing AD; however, no effective treatment of AD patients is currently available. Here, to identify endogenous factors that modulate Abeta production, we performed a gene microarray-based transcriptome analysis of neuronal cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, because Abeta production in these cells changes during neuronal differentiation. We found that expression of the glycophosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1) gene is associated with these changes in Abeta production. GPLD1 overexpression in HEK293 cells increased the secretion of galectin 3-binding protein (GAL3BP), which suppressed Abeta production in an AD model, neuroglioma H4 cells. Mechanistically, GAL3BP suppressed Abeta production by directly interacting with APP and thereby inhibiting APP processing by beta-secretase. Furthermore, we show that cells take up extracellularly added GAL3BP via endocytosis and that GAL3BP is localized in close proximity to APP in endosomes where amyloidogenic APP processing takes place. Taken together, our results indicate that GAL3BP may be a suitable target of AD-modifying drugs in future therapeutic strategies for managing AD.
