2146522|t|Involvement of free radicals in dementia of the Alzheimer type: a hypothesis.
2146522|a|We propose that increased formation of oxygen-derived free radicals, such as the superoxide and hydroxyl species, may be responsible for progressive neural degeneration in dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Several processes increase free radical formation and some of them (e.g., brain trauma, aging) are risk factors for DAT. There is some evidence for increased free radical formation in Down's syndrome which is associated with development of DAT pathology. Free radicals alone may induce cell death by damaging lipids or proteins while reactions between free radicals and neurotransmitters may lead to formation of endogenous neurotoxin(s). Recently, we have demonstrated that partial oxidation of serotonin by exposure to hydroxyl radicals results in formation of a novel neurotoxin, tryptamine-4,5-dione. Elucidation of the role of free radicals in DAT could open new avenues to prevention and treatment of this disease.
