36607598|a|The most common anesthetic approach in hepato-pancreatic-biliary (HPB) surgery is general anesthesia (GA), but it may result in increased morbidity and mortality and peri-operative risks especially in frail patients. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of neuraxial anesthesia (NA) in HPB in a pilot clinical series. This analysis was conducted on 46 consecutive patients undergoing HPB surgery in an Italian Tertial referral center. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA), combined spino-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) and peridural anesthesia (PA) were used in major and minor hepatectomies and bilio-pancreatic surgery instead of GA. NA was evaluated by analyzing the surgical and anesthesiological short-term outcomes. 46 patients were considered eligible for the study between February 2018 and May 2020. The average age was 69.07 (+-  9.95) years. 22 were males and 24 were females. According to the ASA score, 19 (41.30%) patients had ASA II, 22 (47.83%) had ASA III and 5 (10.87%) had ASA IV. 22 (47.83%) patients underwent CSA, 20 (43.48%) CSEA and 4 (8.69%) PA. We performed 8 major and 19 minor hepatectomies, 7 bilio-digestive derivations, 5 Whipple procedures, 4 iatrogenic biliary duct injuries, 2 splenopancreatectomies and 1 hepatic cyst fenestration. Clavien-Dindo >= 3 was observed in 3 patients. The conversion rate to endotracheal intubation occurring in 3 of 46 (6.52%) patients. After surgery, no local or pulmonary complications and delirium were reported in our series. The present study demonstrates that NA is a safe and feasible option in selected patients, if performed in referral centers by well-trained anaesthesiologists and surgeons.
