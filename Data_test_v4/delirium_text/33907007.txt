33907007|a|Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells that possess anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory properties. The effects of existing drugs for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are limited, thus mesenchymal stem cell therapy has been anticipated as a means of ameliorating neuronal dysfunction. Since mesenchymal stem cells are known to scarcely differentiate into neuronal cells in damaged brain after transplantation, paracrine factors secreted from mesenchymal stem cells have been suggested to exert therapeutic effects. Extracellular vesicles and exosomes are small vesicles released from mesenchymal stem cells that contain various molecules, including proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs. In recent years, administration of exosomes/extracellular vesicles in models of neurological disorders has been shown to improve neuronal dysfunctions, via exosomal transfer into damaged cells. In addition, various microRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells that regulate various genes and reduce neuropathological changes in various neurological disorders have been identified. This review summarizes the effects of exosomes/extracellular vesicles and exosomal microRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells on models of stroke, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and cognitive impairments, including Alzheimer's disease.
