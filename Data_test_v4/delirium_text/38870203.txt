38870203|a|BACKGROUND: Previous research has underscored the correlation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and erectile dysfunction (ED). However, due to inherent limitations of observational studies, the causative relationship remains inconclusive. METHODS: Utilizing publicly available data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, this study probed the potential causal association between AD and ED using univariate Mendelian randomization (MR). Further, the multivariable MR assessed the confounding effects of six cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The primary approach employed was inverse variance weighted (IVW), supplemented by three additional methods. A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the forward MR analysis, the IVW method revealed causal evidence of genetically predicted AD being a risk factor for ED (OR = 1.077, 95% CI 1.007~1.152, P = 0.031). Reverse analysis did not demonstrate any causal evidence linking ED to AD (OR = 1.018, 95% CI 0.974~1.063, P = 0.430). Multivariable MR analysis showed that after adjusting for coronary heart disease (OR = 1.082, 95% CI 0.009~1.160, P = 0.027), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.085, 95% CI 1.012~1.163, P = 0.022), atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.076, 95% CI 1.002~1.154, P = 0.043), heart failure (OR = 1.103, 95% CI 1.024~1.188, P = 0.010), ischemic stroke (OR = 1.079, 95% CI 1.009~1.154, P = 0.027), hypertension (OR = 1.092, 95% CI 1.011~1.180, P = 0.025), and all models (OR = 1.115, 95% CI 1.024~1.214, P = 0.012), the causal association between AD and ED persisted. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the absence of pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and outliers, validating the robustness of our results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This MR study consistently evidences a causal effect of genetically predicted AD on the risk of ED, independent of certain CVDs, yet offers no evidence for a reverse effect from ED.
