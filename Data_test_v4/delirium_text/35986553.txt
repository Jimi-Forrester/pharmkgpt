35986553|t|Neurologic complications after cardiopulmonary bypass - A narrative review.
35986553|a|Neurologic complications, associated with cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in adults, are common and can be devastating in some cases. This comprehensive review will not only consider the broad categories of stroke and neurocognitive dysfunction, but it also summarises other neurological complications associated with CPB, and it provides an update about risks, prevention and treatment. Where appropriate, we consider the impact of off-pump techniques upon our understanding of the contribution of CPB to adverse outcomes.
