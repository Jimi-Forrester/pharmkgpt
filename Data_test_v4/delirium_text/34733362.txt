34733362|t|Pathogenicity of the MAGE family.
34733362|a|The melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) protein family is a group of highly conserved proteins that share a common homology domain. Under normal circumstances, numerous MAGE proteins are only expressed in reproduction-related tissues; however, abnormal expression levels are observed in a variety of tumor tissues. The MAGE family consists of type I and II proteins, several of which are cancer-testis antigens that are highly expressed in cancer and serve a critical role in tumorigenesis. Therefore, this review will use the relationship between MAGEs and tumors as a starting point, focusing on the latest developments regarding the function of MAGEs as oncogenes, and preliminarily reveal their possible mechanisms.
