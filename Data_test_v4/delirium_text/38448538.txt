38448538|t|Brain connectivity analysis based classification of obstructive sleep apnea using electroencephalogram signals.
38448538|a|Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder which blocks the upper airway during sleep. The severity of OSA will lead heart attack, stroke and end of life. This proposed study explored the classification of OSA and healthy subjects using brain connectivity analysis from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Institute of System and Robotics-University of Coimbra (ISRUC) database were used for acquiring 50 EEG signals using 4 channels and noise removal has been accomplished by 50 Hz notch filter. The Institute of System and Robotics-University of Coimbra (ISRUC) database contained 50 EEG signals, with four channels, and a 50 Hz notch filter was applied to remove noise. Wavelet packet decomposition method was performing the segregation of EEG signals into five bands; Gamma (gamma), beta (beta), alpha (alpha), theta (theta) and delta (delta). A total of 4 electrode positions were used for the brain connectivity analysis for each EEG band. Pearson correlation method was effectively used for measuring the correlation between healthy and OSA subjects. The nodes and edges were highlighted the connection between brain and subjects. The highest correlation was achieved in delta band of OSA subjects which starts from 0.7331 to 0.9172 respectively. For healthy subjects, the positive correlation achieved was 0.6995. The delta band has been correlated well with brain when compared other bands. It has been noted that the positive correlation well associated with brain in OSA subjects, which classifies OSA from healthy subjects.
