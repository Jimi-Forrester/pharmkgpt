21615353|t|The role of IL-15 in central nervous system disorders.
21615353|a|IL-15 is a proinflammatory cytokine. It is produced by activated blood monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and activated glial cells. It promotes T-cell proliferation, induction of cytolytic effector cells including natural killer and cytotoxic cells and stimulates B-cell to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulins. Little information is available on the exact role of IL-15 in the neurological diseases. Microglial cells are the main regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS). IL-15 may be involved in the inflammatory reactions and microglial activation of some common CNS disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, but its exact role in their pathogenesis is not clear.
