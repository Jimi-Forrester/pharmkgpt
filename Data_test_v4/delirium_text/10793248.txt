10793248|t|No association between TAU haplotype and Alzheimer's disease in population or clinic based series or in familial disease.
10793248|a|We and others have previously identified two distinct haplotypes of the TAU gene in Caucasian populations. In this study, we have assessed whether these haplotypes show an association with Alzheimer's disease in a variety of populations. They do not. These data are consistent with the view that the involvement of TAU in Alzheimer's disease is a downstream event.
