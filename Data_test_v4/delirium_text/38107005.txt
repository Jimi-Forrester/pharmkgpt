38107005|a|Introduction: Spearmint essential oil is a valuable medical and food product. Spearmint essential oil is effective for the treatment of flatulence, indigestion, nausea, and colic along with Alzheimer, obesity, and fungal infections. Methods: This study evaluated the quality and quantity of spearmint essential oil by examining some extraction strategies. The procedures were hydro-distillation, hydro-steam distillation, microwave-assisted hydro-distillation, and open hydro-distillation. The hydro-distillation had five pH levels (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) and four NaCl concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2%). microwave-assisted hydro-distillation at a power of 225 W was applied for 60, 90, and 120 minutes for process durations. The solvent extraction of herbal distillate obtained by an open hydro-distillation system was done using n-pentane and n-hexane to achieve a recovered essential oil by a rotary evaporator. Results and discussion: The results showed that the lowest pH in the hydro-distillation process led to obtaining double yield compared to the control. Additionally, at 1 and 1.5% NaCl concentrations, the oil yield increased by 12.86 and 20.87%, respectively. Although the yield was reduced by microwave-assisted hydro-distillation, however within 120 minutes, carvone increased by 12.7% and limonene decreased by 42.3%. The best quality of spearmint oil belonged to solvent extraction followed by rotary evaporator.
