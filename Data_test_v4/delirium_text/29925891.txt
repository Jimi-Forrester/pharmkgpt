29925891|a|Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been associated with telomere dysfunction and alterations in mitochondrial activity, which seem to be co-regulated in human cells. To investigate this co-regulation in MDD, we assessed telomere length (TL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and selected immune cell subsets by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and mitochondrial respiratory activity in PBMC by high-resolution respirometry in a study cohort of 18 MDD patients and 21 non-depressed controls. We provide initial evidence for a differential vulnerability to telomere attrition in selected adaptive immune cell populations. Here we found the highest difference in TL between depressed and control subjects for memory cytotoxic T cells. Depression was associated with reduced mitochondrial activity (mitochondrial bioenergetics), but increased mitochondrial density (mitochondrial biogenesis) in PBMC. Exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated that the changes in TL and immune cell bioenergetics were most pronounced in MDD patients who reported experiences of childhood sexual abuse. Among MDD patients, PBMC TL was as a trend positively associated with mitochondrial density and negatively associated with mitochondrial leak respiration, but not with mitochondrial activity related to biological energy production. These initial findings support the hypothesis of a co-regulation between telomeres and mitochondrial biogenesis but not mitochondrial bioenergetics among MDD patients.
