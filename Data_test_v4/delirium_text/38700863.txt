38700863|t|Plasma Leptin and Alzheimer Protein Pathologies Among Older Adults.
38700863|a|Importance: Many epidemiologic studies have suggested that low levels of plasma leptin, a major adipokine, are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and cognitive decline. Nevertheless, the mechanistic pathway linking plasma leptin and AD-related cognitive decline is not yet fully understood. Objective: To examine the association of plasma leptin levels with in vivo AD pathologies, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition, through both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches among cognitively unimpaired older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a longitudinal cohort study from the Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer Disease. Data were collected from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020, and data were analyzed from July 11 to September 6, 2022. The study included a total of 208 cognitively unimpaired participants who underwent baseline positron emission tomography (PET) scans for brain Abeta deposition. For longitudinal analyses, 192 participants who completed both baseline and 2-year follow-up PET scans for brain Abeta deposition were included. Exposure: Plasma leptin levels as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline levels and longitudinal changes of global Abeta and AD-signature region tau deposition measured by PET scans. Results: Among the 208 participants, the mean (SD) age was 66.0 (11.3) years, 114 were women (54.8%), and 37 were apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers (17.8%). Lower plasma leptin levels had a significant cross-sectional association with greater brain Abeta deposition (beta = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.00; P = .046), while there was no significant association between plasma leptin levels and tau deposition (beta = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.02; P = .41). In contrast, longitudinal analyses revealed that there was a significant association between lower baseline leptin levels and greater increase of tau deposition over 2 years (beta = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.01; P = .03), whereas plasma leptin levels did not have a significant association with longitudinal change of Abeta deposition (beta = 0.006; 95% CI, 0.00-0.02; P = .27). Conclusions and Relevance: The present findings suggest that plasma leptin may be protective for the development or progression of AD pathology, including both Abeta and tau deposition.
