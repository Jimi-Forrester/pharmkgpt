39122825|a|The quest for better nutritious foods has encouraged novel scientific investigations to find trans-fat reduction methods. This research proposes an innovative approach for the production of healthier trans-fat-free margarine from palm oil by the use of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma technology with glycerol serving as the principal source of hydrogen. The effectiveness of DBD plasma in hydrogenating palm olein was investigated. By employing a methodical series of experiments and thorough analytical approaches, examination of the saturated fatty acid conversion experienced its iodine value (IV) reduction from 67.16 +- 0.70 to 31.61 +- 1.10 under the optimal process parameters of 1 L min-1 He flow rate, 35 W plasma discharge power, 10 mm gap size, ambient initial temperature, and 12 h reaction time with solid texture. According to the method for producing trans-fat-free margarine in the absence of a catalyst and H2 gas, the hydrogenation rate of the prepared mixture of palm olein-glycerol was remarkably improved; the trans-fat content in the produced product was zero; the efficacy of incorporating cis- and trans-isomerization was lowered, and the method has a promising industrial application prospect.
