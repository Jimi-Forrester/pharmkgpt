37760827|a|RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: To identify the frequency of opioid use in a group of patients diagnosed with migraine in Colombia. METHODS: Study of a retrospective cohort of patients with a diagnosis of migraine and a first prescription of antimigraine drugs from emergency services and a priority outpatient clinic. Sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacological variables were identified; a 12-month follow-up was carried out to identify the use of a new opioid. RESULTS: A total of 6309 patients with a diagnosis of migraine were identified, with a mean age of 35.5 +- 12.3 years, of which 81.3% were women. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (51.1%) were the most frequently prescribed medications, followed by ergotamine + caffeine (31.3%), acetaminophen (15.05%), and acetaminophen + codeine (14.4%). At the time of the index, 1300 (20.6%) patients received some opioid. During the follow-up, a total of 1437 (22.8%) patients received a new opioid, of which 31.8% belonged to the group that received an initial opioid and 20.4% to the group that did not receive one, which was statistically significant (OR:1.81; 95%CI:1.58-2.07; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The frequent use of opioids in the management of migraines is potentially inappropriate and can lead to problems of tolerance, abuse and dependence. This combined with the low prescription of triptans, offers an opportunity for improvements in medical practice.
