38003723|t|Topical Cellular/Tissue and Molecular Aspects Regarding Nonpharmacological Interventions in Alzheimer's Disease-A Systematic Review.
38003723|a|One of the most complex and challenging developments at the beginning of the third millennium is the alarming increase in demographic aging, mainly-but not exclusively-affecting developed countries. This reality results in one of the harsh medical, social, and economic consequences: the continuously increasing number of people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for up to 80% of all such types of pathology. Its large and progressive disabling potential, which eventually leads to death, therefore represents an important public health matter, especially because there is no known cure for this disease. Consequently, periodic reappraisals of different therapeutic possibilities are necessary. For this purpose, we conducted this systematic literature review investigating nonpharmacological interventions for AD, including their currently known cellular and molecular action bases. This endeavor was based on the PRISMA method, by which we selected 116 eligible articles published during the last year. Because of the unfortunate lack of effective treatments for AD, it is necessary to enhance efforts toward identifying and improving various therapeutic and rehabilitative approaches, as well as related prophylactic measures.
