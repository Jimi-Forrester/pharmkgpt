39061991|a|Unfortunately, cardiovascular diseases and cancers are still the leading causes of death in developed and developing countries despite the considerable progress made in the prevention and treatment of diseases. Maybe we missed something? Insulin resistance (IR) with associated hyperinsulinemia (Hypein) is a silent pandemic whose prevalence is continually growing in developed and developing countries, now exceeding 51% of the general population. IR/Hypein, despite the vast scientific literature supporting its adverse action on the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular alterations, tumors, neurological disorders, and cellular senescence, is not yet considered an independent risk factor and, therefore, is not screened in the general population and adequately treated. There are now numerous substances, drugs, and natural substances that, in association with the correction of a wrong lifestyle, can help to reduce IR/Hypein. We are convinced that the time has come to implement a prevention plan against this critical risk factor. Therefore, this manuscript aims to highlight IR/Hypein as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, cellular senescence, and neuropsychiatric disorders, supporting our conviction with the available scientific literature on the topic.
