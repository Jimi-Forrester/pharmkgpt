34362173|a|Traditionally, invasively ventilated children in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) are weaned using pneumatically-triggered ventilation modes with a fixed level of assist. The best weaning mode is currently not known. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), a newer weaning mode, uses the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) to synchronise ventilator support proportionally to the patient's respiratory drive. We aimed to perform a systematic literature review to assess the effect of NAVA on clinical outcomes in invasively ventilated children with non-neonatal lung disease. Three studies (n = 285) were included for analysis. One randomised controlled trial (RCT) of all comers showed a significant reduction in PICU length of stay and sedative use. A cohort study of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients (n = 30) showed a significantly shorter duration of ventilation and improved sedation with the use of NAVA. A cohort study of children recovering from cardiac surgery (n = 75) showed significantly higher extubation success, shorter duration of ventilation and PICU length of stay, and a reduction in sedative use. Our systematic review presents weak evidence that NAVA may shorten the duration of ventilation and PICU length of stay, and reduce the requirement of sedatives. However, further RCTs are required to more fully assess the effect of NAVA on clinical outcomes and treatment costs in ventilated children.
