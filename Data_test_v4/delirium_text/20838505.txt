20838505|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is gaining recognition as sequelae of heart failure and the ICCU environment adds to their worsening symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To determine cognitive dysfunctions in patients with heart disease admitted in intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) and to compare it with patients admitted in general medical wards with heart disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients admitted to ICCU with heart disease were taken for the study and compared to patients with heart disease admitted in general medicine wards (except ICCU). The tools used were SMMSE (Standardized Mini Mental State Examination) and BCRS (Brief Cognitive Rating Scale). Statistical tests used were Student 't' test and Chi-Square test. RESULTS: This study showed cognitive dysfunctions in the domains of orientation, attention and constructional ability as measured by SMMSE and cognitive dysfunction in the domain of concentration as measured by BCRS. Overall cognitive dysfunctions were present in the total score of both SMMSE and BCRS scale, which was statistically very highly significant. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the patients in ICCU had cognitive dysfunctions in the domains of orientation, attention, constructional ability and concentration. Overall cognitive dysfunctions were found in the total scores of SMMSE and BCRS, thus signifying a global cognitive deficit.
