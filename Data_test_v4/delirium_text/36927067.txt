36927067|t|The impact of electronic pathways and digital systems on neck of femur fracture outcomes globally: a systematic review.
36927067|a|INTRODUCTION: Electronic pathways (e-pathways) and digital systems are novel interventions with several uses in healthcare, ranging from clinical decision support systems to checklists for care delivery. Their application in the management of neck of femur (NOF) fractures is evolving and they may play a key role in facilitating improvements in care delivery. The primary aim of this review was to outline the impact of e-pathways/digital systems on NOF fracture outcomes. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A total of 698 citations were evaluated, of which 38 passed the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Six studies were then finalised following full-text review. Heterogenous data meant a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Risk of bias for each paper was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated for time to theatre (3/6 studies), length of hospital stay (2/6 studies) and secondary fracture prevention (2/6 studies). Although postoperative delirium and mortality improved with the introduction of e-pathways/digital systems, statistical significance was not achieved. No outcome measures were adversely affected. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of the literature demonstrates that e-pathways and digital systems are promising novel interventions, displaying a significant positive impact on several NOF fracture outcomes. Owing to the novel nature of e-pathways and digital systems in orthopaedics, a limited number of studies were identified for review, each with variable study design. More high quality homogenous prospective cohort studies with a standardised primary outcome measure are required for more definitive conclusions of efficacy to be drawn.
