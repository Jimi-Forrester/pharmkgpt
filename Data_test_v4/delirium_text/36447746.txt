36447746|a|Extensive evidence suggests that ambient air pollution contributes to a higher risk of hospital admissions for cerebrovascular diseases; however, its association with admissions for sequelae of stroke remains unclear. A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted among 31,810 older adults who were admitted to hospital for sequelae of stroke in Guangzhou, China during 2016-2019. For each subject, daily residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) was extracted from a validated grid data set. Conditional logistic regression models were used for exposure-response analyses. In single-pollutant models, each interquartile range (IQR) increase of lag 04-day exposure to CO (IQR: 0.25 mg/m3) and lag 3-day exposure to O3 (69.6 mug/m3) was significantly associated with a 4.53% (95% confidence interval: 1.67%, 7.47%) and 5.63% (1.92%, 9.48%) increase in odds of hospital admissions for sequelae of stroke, respectively. These associations did not significantly vary across age or sex. With further adjustment for each of the other pollutants in 2-pollutant models, the association for CO did not change significantly, while the association for O3 disappeared. We estimated that 7.72% of the hospital admissions were attributable to CO exposures. No significant or consistent association was observed for exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, or NO2. In conclusion, short-term exposure to ambient CO, even at levels below the WHO air quality guideline, was significantly associated with an increased odds of hospital admissions for sequelae of stroke, which may lead to considerable excess hospital admissions.
