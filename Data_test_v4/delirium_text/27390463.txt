27390463|t|Neurally adjusted ventilation assist in weaning difficulty: First case report from India.
27390463|a|Invasive mechanical ventilation is an integral component in the management of critically ill patients. In certain situations, liberation from mechanical ventilation becomes difficult resulting in prolonged ventilation. Patient-ventilator dyssynchrony is a frequently encountered reason for difficult weaning. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a novel mode of ventilation that utilizes the electrical activity of diaphragm to pick up respiratory signals and delivers assistance in proportion to the ventilatory requirement of a patient. It may, therefore, be associated with a better patient-ventilator synchrony thereby facilitating weaning. Herein, we report the first case from India describing the use of NAVA in successfully weaning a patient with difficult weaning.
