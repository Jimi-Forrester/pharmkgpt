34558997|t|Preintervention imaging and intraoperative management care of the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patient.
34558997|a|With an estimated overall mortality of less than 1 percent per year, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is the most common genetic cardiomyopathy. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is the standard of care for assessing patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing surgical septal myectomy, allowing surgical planning, intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring, and postprocedural assessment of the repair, including detection of immediate complications. At various phases during surgical septal myectomy, the changing hemodynamic conditions may lead to worsening or improvement in left ventricle outflow tract obstruction by change in preload or afterload, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, or sympathetic stimulation. These characteristics represent unique challenges in the management of these patients, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the management of all the conditions required to decrease the left ventricle outflow tract gradient avoiding obstruction, which include the maintenance of sinus rhythm, adequate rate avoiding tachycardia and bradycardia, and avoidance of systemic hypotension preserving preload and afterload, with adequate vasoactive agents. The aim of this review is to summarize the perioperative assessment and management of patients undergoing hypertrophic obstructive myopathy surgery.
