38888203|a|BACKGROUND: The Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 protein (TREM2) plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including osteoclast differentiation, and disease-associated microglia (DAM) activation to regulate neuroinflammation, and phagocytosis in the brain. Genetic variations in TREM2 are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Nasu-hakola disease (NHD), characterized by bone lesions, neuropsychiatric disorders, and early-onset dementia. METHODS: We studied 3 siblings with suspected NHD. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted on the proband to identify the possible genetic cause(s) and by Sanger sequencing to validate the identified variants in the two other affected siblings, a healthy sister, and the parents. RESULTS: We identified a novel homozygous deletion (c.549del; p.(Leu184Serfs*5)) in TREM2. Our literature review reveals 16 TREM2 mutations causing early-onset dementia and bone lesions. CONCLUSION: These findings, alongside previous research, elucidate the clinical spectrum of TREM2-related diseases, aiding accurate diagnosis and patient care. This knowledge is vital for understanding TREM2-dependent DAM and its involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders which can help to develop targeted therapies and improve outcomes for TREM2-affected individuals.
