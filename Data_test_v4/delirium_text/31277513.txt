31277513|t|Lessons on Differential Neuronal-Death-Vulnerability from Familial Cases of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases.
31277513|a|The main risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most common neurodegenerative pathologies, is aging. In contrast to sporadic cases, whose symptoms appear at >60 years of age, familial PD or familial AD affects younger individuals. Finding early biological markers of these diseases as well as efficacious treatments for both symptom relief and delaying disease progression are of paramount relevance. Familial early-onset PD/AD are due to genetic factors, sometimes a single mutation in a given gene. Both diseases have neuronal loss and abnormal accumulations of specific proteins in common, but in different brain regions. Despite shared features, the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological processes are not known. This review aims at finding, among the genetic-associated cases of PD and AD, common trends that could be of interest to discover reliable biomarkers and efficacious therapies, especially those aimed at affording neuroprotection, i.e., the prevention of neuronal death.
