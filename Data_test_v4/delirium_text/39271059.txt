39271059|a|Recent advances in clinical passive immunotherapy have provided compelling evidence that eliminating amyloid-beta (Abeta) slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the modest benefits and side effects observed in clinical trials indicate that current immunotherapy therapy is not a panacea, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of AD mechanisms and the significance of early intervention through optimized immunotherapy or immunoprevention. This review focuses on the centrality of Abeta pathology in AD and summarizes recent clinical progress in passive and active immunotherapies targeting Abeta, discussing their lessons and failures to inform future anti-Abeta biotherapeutics design. Various delivery strategies to optimize Abeta-targeting immunotherapies are outlined, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks in overcoming challenges such as poor stability and limited tissue accessibility of anti-Abeta biotherapeutics. Additionally, the perspectives and challenges of immunotherapy and immunoprevention targeting Abeta are concluded in the end, aiming to guide the development of next-generation anti-Abeta immunotherapeutic agents towards improved efficacy and safety.
