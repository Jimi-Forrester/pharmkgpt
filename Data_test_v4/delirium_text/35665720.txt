35665720|t|Updates in central nervous system malaria: literature review and considerations.
35665720|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cerebral malaria (CM) represents one of the most common and severe complications of Plasmodium falciparum infection, leading to high morbidity and mortality along with challenging sequelae, especially in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Although CM pathogenesis remains unclear due to the few studies made and the difficulty to analyze affected patients, there are valid theories involving P. falciparum endothelium interactions, and clinical manifestations have been better investigated and differentiated between adults and children. SUMMARY: At the time of writing, diagnostic management is based on fast severe malaria identification by blood smear (thin and thick). However, newer techniques involving molecular testing (such as PCR or LAMP) and biomarkers identification are now available. It is also important to check patients' cerebral functions. As regards therapeutic management, although we could rely on several options, artesunate represents the gold standard treatment. Cerebral complications such as seizures and coma need to be managed as well.
