38605327|a|BACKGROUND: Adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus suffer from diabetes distress and poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) since living with the condition that differentiates them from their peers. The present study investigated the effects of peer support and stress on diabetes distress and HRQOL and whether positive coping mediated the effects. METHODS: We used a prospective study design. A total of 201 adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus from 20 cities in 4 provinces were recruited.Participants complete two separate surveys at approximately 18-month intervals. The scales employed at both Time 1 and Time 2 included the Diabetes-Specific Peer Support Measure, Diabetes Stress Questionnaire for Youths, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, 5-item Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale, and the Diabetes Quality of Life for Youth scale. RESULTS: Baseline peer stress directly predicted diabetes distress and HRQOL at 18 months, even controlling for age, gender, and peer support. However, the direct effect of baseline peer support on 18-month diabetes distress and HRQOL was insignificant. Baseline peer support indirectly affected diabetes distress and HRQOL at 18 months through positive coping, indicating that positive coping plays a mediating role. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that peer social relationships, especially peer stress, and positive coping are promising intervention targets for adolescents facing challenges in psychosocial adaptation.
