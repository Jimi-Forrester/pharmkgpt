33467406|a|BACKGROUND: A major problem of aging is the disruption of metabolic homeostasis. This is particularly relevant in the brain where it provokes neurodegeneration. Caloric restriction is a physiologic intervention known to delay the deleterious consequences of aging in several species ranging from yeast to mammals. To date, most studies on experimental models have started this dietary intervention from weaning, which is very difficult to be translated to human beings. Here, we study the effects of a more realistic dietary regimen in rats, starting at an advanced age and lasting for six months. METHODS: we analyzed in the cortex and hippocampus, the proteins involved in the energetic balance of the cells, cholesterol metabolism, oxidative stress response, inflammation, synaptic impairment, and brain trophism. RESULTS: our results suggest that caloric restriction in late life can revert only some age-related changes studied here.
