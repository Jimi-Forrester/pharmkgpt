28792154|t|Proposal Guidelines for Standardized Operating Procedures of Brain Autopsy: Brain Bank in South Korea.
28792154|a|To obtain an in-depth understanding of brain diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric illnesses, and neoplasms, scientific approach and verification using postmortem human brain tissue with or without disease are essential. Compared to other countries that have run brain banks for decades, South Korea has limited experience with brain banking; nationwide brain banks started only recently. The goal of this study is to provide provisional guidelines for brain autopsy for hospitals and institutes that have not accumulated sufficient expertise. We hope that these provisional guidelines will serve as a useful reference for pathologists and clinicians who are involved and interested in the brain bank system. Also, we anticipate updating the provisional guidelines in the future based on collected data and further experience with the practice of brain autopsy in South Korea.
