38920679|t|Hypercalcemia in Cancer: Causes, Effects, and Treatment Strategies.
38920679|a|Calcium plays central roles in numerous biological processes, thereby, its levels in the blood are under strict control to maintain homeostatic balance and enable the proper functioning of living organisms. The regulatory mechanisms ensuring this balance can be affected by pathologies such as cancer, and as a result, hyper- or hypocalcemia can occur. These states, characterized by elevated or decreased calcium blood levels, respectively, have a significant effect on general homeostasis. This article focuses on a particular form of calcium metabolism disorder, which is hypercalcemia in neoplasms. It also constitutes a summary of the current knowledge regarding the diagnosis of hypercalcemia and its management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is estimated to affect over 40% of cancer patients and can be associated with both solid and blood cancers. Elevated calcium levels can be an indicator of developing cancer. The main mechanism of hypercalcemia development in tumors appears to be excessive production of parathyroid hormone-related peptides. Among the known treatment methods, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, steroids, and denosumab should be mentioned, but ongoing research promotes progress in pharmacotherapy. Given the rising global cancer prevalence, the problem of hypercalcemia is of high importance and requires attention.
