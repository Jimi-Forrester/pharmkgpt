38904065|a|Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological sensorimotor disorder characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. In the perioperative period, patients with RLS may experience an acute exacerbation of symptoms. Although studies on the exacerbation of RLS after brain surgery are limited, we present a case wherein symptoms worsened following left amygdalohippocampectomy. Case Presentation: A 58-year-old woman diagnosed with mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy accompanied by left hippocampal sclerosis underwent a left amygdalohippocampectomy. The patient reported uncomfortable sensations in the lower limbs preoperatively. However, the urge to move her legs was manageable and not distinctly diagnosed with RLS. The symptoms began to deteriorate on the fifth postoperative day primarily affecting the legs and back, with a notable emphasis on the right side. Pramipexole treatment effectively ameliorated these symptoms. Conclusion: No reports are available highlighting the exacerbation of RLS after amygdalohippocampectomy. Perioperative factors, such as anesthesia and iron deficiency due to hemorrhage, have been proposed as aggravating factors for RLS; however, the asymmetry of RLS, particularly the atypical right-sided exacerbation in this case, makes it unlikely that this was the primary cause. A negative correlation between opioid receptor availability in the amygdala and RLS severity has been reported, suggesting that amygdalohippocampectomy contributes to the exacerbation of RLS symptoms. This case provides valuable insights into the possible involvement of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of RLS and practical considerations for the clinical management of the condition.
