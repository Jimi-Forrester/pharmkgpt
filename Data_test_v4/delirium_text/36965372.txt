Ferroptosis and adaptive immunity have been proven to contribute to AD pathogenesis. Salidroside exhibits neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. However, the underlying mechanisms linking salidroside, ferroptosis, and adaptive immunity in AD remain uncertain. PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to explore the neuroprotective effects and the potential molecular mechanisms of salidroside against neuronal ferroptosis and CD8+ T cell infiltration in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SAMP8 mice were employed as an AD model and were treated with salidroside for 12 weeks. Behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry, HE and Nissl staining, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, quantitative proteomics, bioinformatic analysis, flow cytometry, iron staining, western blotting, and molecular docking were performed. RESULTS: Treatment with salidroside dose-dependently attenuated cognitive impairment, reduced the accumulation of Abeta plaques and restored neuronal damage. Salidroside also suppressed the infiltration of CD8+T cells, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines, and improved mitochondrial metabolism, iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in the SAMP8 mice brain. The administration of salidroside decreased iron deposition, reduced TFR1, and ACSL4 protein expression, upregulated SLC7A11, and GPX4 protein expression, and promoted the Nrf2/GPX4 axis activation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, neuronal ferroptosis and CD8+T cells are involved in the process of cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice. Salidroside alleviates cognitive impairment and inhibits neuronal ferroptosis. The underlying mechanisms may involve the Nrf2/GPX4 axis activation and reduction in CD8+T cells infiltration. This study provides some evidence for the roles of salidroside in adaptive immunity and neuronal ferroptosis in SAMP8 mice.
