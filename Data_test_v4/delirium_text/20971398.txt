20971398|t|Emergency orthogeriatrics: concepts and therapeutic alternatives.
20971398|a|Multidisciplinary orthogeriatric care can enhance prompt ED diagnosis, optimal pre- and postoperative care, and functional recovery in older adults with bony injuries. Emergency care providers should be cognizant of prevalent geriatric syndromes including delirium and standing level falls to minimize fracture-related morbidity. Recognizing the implications of aging physiology, acute care physicians should be aware of effective alternatives to analgesia, procedural sedation, and definitive imaging to promote early surgical management and postoperative recovery.
