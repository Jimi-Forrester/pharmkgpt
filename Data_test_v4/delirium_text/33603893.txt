33603893|a|For women in the postmenopausal period, age-related changes in the hormonal status are associated with a higher risk for type-2 diabetes and its complications. The tissue injury caused by diabetic vascular complications can induce a release of sialic acid (SA) into the general circulation leading to increased levels. The present study is a cross-sectional single center study of 77 women in the postmenopausal period. The subjects selected for the study were divided into two groups: i) The control group, which included postmenopausal women without type-2 diabetes mellitus (n=27); and ii) a group of postmenopausal women diagnosed with type-2 diabetes (n=50). By analyzing how the serum values of SA were correlated with glycemia and glycated hemoglobin in the subjects with diabetes, it was determined that both parameters exhibited a strong positive correlation (P<0.0001) in the group with type-2 diabetes. Therefore, SA may be considered as a potential marker for the screening, diagnosis or prognosis of type-2 diabetes for postmenopausal women.
