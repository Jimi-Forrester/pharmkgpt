35050123|t|Past Experiences for Future Applications of Metabolomics in Critically Ill Patients with Sepsis and Septic Shocks.
35050123|a|A disruption of several metabolic pathways in critically ill patients with sepsis indicates that metabolomics might be used as a more precise tool for sepsis and septic shock when compared with the conventional biomarkers. This article provides information regarding metabolomics studies in sepsis and septic shock patients. It has been shown that a variety of metabolomic pathways are altered in sepsis and septic shock, including amino acid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, phospholipid metabolism, glycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Based upon this comprehensive review, here, we demonstrate that metabolomics is about to change the world of sepsis biomarkers, not only for its utilization in sepsis diagnosis, but also for prognosticating and monitoring the therapeutic response. Additionally, the future direction regarding the establishment of studies integrating metabolomics with other molecular modalities and studies identifying the relationships between metabolomic profiles and clinical characteristics to address clinical application are discussed in this article. All of the information from this review indicates the important impact of metabolomics as a tool for diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic response, and prognostic assessment of sepsis and septic shock. These findings also encourage further clinical investigations to warrant its use in routine clinical settings.
