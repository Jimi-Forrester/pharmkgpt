36131855|t|Clinical Profile and Outcome in Patients of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: A Single-Center Prospective Observational Study.
36131855|a|Background: Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) is the one which is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract, thus increasing the risk of infection and failure of therapy. Aim: This study aims to determine the risk factors, changing trends in etiology, current treatment options, and outcomes in cUTI. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study was done on patients presenting with cUTI. Hematological, biochemical workup, urine routine, urine culture, blood culture, ultrasonography, and wherever necessary computerized tomography of the genitourinary tract was done. The medical/surgical interventions and outcomes in these patients were recorded. Results: A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Diabetes mellitus was the most common risk factor present in 53%. The most common organism isolated in urine culture was Escherichia coli (48%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (19%) and similar trend but lesser positive yield was there in blood culture (Escherichia coli - 26% followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae - 3%). The organisms were most susceptible to colistin/polymyxin (100%) followed by carbapenems (88%), and later were the most commonly used empirical antibiotics in our study, yielding 95% survival rate. Surgical interventions (percutaneous/endourological) were required in 28%, renal replacement therapy in 14%, intensive care in 40% and mechanical ventilation in 10%, with 4% overall mortality at the end of 1-month follow-up. The mean duration of hospital stay was 9.1 +- 2.7 days. Conclusion: Escherichia coli was the most common organism causing cUTI, with diabetes being the most common risk factor. Most of the patients were treated with carbapenems with excellent survival outcomes.
