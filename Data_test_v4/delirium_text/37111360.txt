37111360|t|Receptors Involved in Mental Disorders and the Use of Clozapine, Chlorpromazine, Olanzapine, and Aripiprazole to Treat Mental Disorders.
37111360|a|Mental illnesses are a global health challenge, and effective medicines are needed to treat these conditions. Psychotropic drugs are commonly prescribed to manage mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, but unfortunately, they can cause significant and undesirable side effects, such as myocarditis, erectile dysfunction, and obesity. Furthermore, some schizophrenic patients may not respond to psychotropic drugs, a condition called schizophrenia-treatment resistance. Fortunately, clozapine is a promising option for patients who exhibit treatment resistance. Unlike chlorpromazine, scientists have found that clozapine has fewer neurological side effects. Additionally, olanzapine and aripiprazole are well-known for their moderating effects on psychosis and are widely used in clinical practice. To further maximize drug efficacy, it is critical to deeply understand the receptors or signaling pathways central to the nervous system, such as serotonin, histamine, trace amines, dopamine, and G-protein coupled receptors. This article provides an overview of the receptors mentioned above, as well as the antipsychotics that interact with them, such as olanzapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, and chlorpromazine. Additionally, this article discusses the general pharmacology of these medications.
