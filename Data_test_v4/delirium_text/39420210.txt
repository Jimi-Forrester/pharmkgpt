39420210|t|Identification of tauopathy-associated lipid signatures in Alzheimer's disease mouse brain using label-free chemical imaging.
39420210|a|There is cumulative evidence that lipid metabolism plays a key role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visualising lipid content in a non-destructive label-free manner can aid in elucidating the AD phenotypes towards a better understanding of the disease. In this study, we combined multiple optical molecular-specific methods, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging, synchrotron radiation-infrared (SR-IR) microscopy, Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, and optical-photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) microscopy with multivariate data analysis, to investigate the biochemistry of brain hippocampus in situ using a mouse model of tauopathy (rTg4510). We observed a significant difference in the morphology and lipid content between transgenic (TG) and wild type (WT) samples. Immunohistochemical staining revealed some degree of microglia co-localisation with elevated lipids in the brain. These results provide new evidence of tauopathy-related dysfunction in a preclinical study at a subcellular level.
