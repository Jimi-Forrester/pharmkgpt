35187991|a|OBJECTIVES: To identify the characteristics of those who tend to hold stigmatising beliefs and behaviours towards people living with dementia to inform dementia education and the targeting of interventions to reduce dementia-related stigma. A nationally representative telephone survey of 1000 Australians aged 18-93 years was conducted to assess general knowledge of dementia and dementia-related stigma. A single open-ended question was used to assess participants' general knowledge of dementia. Modified items from the Lay Public Dimension of the Family Stigma in Alzheimer's Disease Scale were used to assess dementia-related stigma. Only 26% of participants demonstrated good dementia knowledge while almost half of the participants had a mixed understanding of dementia. Dementia-related negative cognitive attributions were found to be higher in (1) the older age cohorts, (2) amongst individuals who know someone with dementia, (3) speak a language other than English at home, and (4) have a better understanding of dementia. Older age cohorts, men, those who do not know someone with dementia, and those who speak a non-English language at home also reported significantly higher discriminatory behavioural reactions compared to the younger age cohorts, females, those who know someone with dementia, and those who speak English only at home. This study identifies a need for improved public education about dementia. A structured approach to the development of strategies that is specifically tailored to different age, gender and cultural groups may provide a beneficial approach to help improve dementia knowledge and reduce dementia-related stigma in the population.
