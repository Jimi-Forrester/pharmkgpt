28054997|t|Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Evaluation of Indol-3-yl-oxoacetamides as Potent Cannabinoid Receptor Type 2 Ligands.
28054997|a|A small series of indol-3-yl-oxoacetamides was synthesized starting from the literature known N-(adamantan-1-yl)-2-(5-(furan-2-yl)-1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxoacetamide (5) by substituting the 1-pentyl-1H-indole subunit. Our preliminary biological evaluation showed that the fluorinated derivative 8 is a potent and selective CB2 ligand with Ki = 6.2 nM.
