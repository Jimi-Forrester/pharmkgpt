38186410|t|Is Coffee and Tea a Threat or Ally to Cardiovascular Health?
38186410|a|Tea and coffee have become ingrained in our daily lives and have become the most widely consumed drinks after water. Their effects vary on an individual basis depending upon the amount of daily consumption, genetic polymorphisms, and the presence of comorbidities. Non-habitual individuals experience an initial, brief increase in blood pressure due to caffeine's vasoactive effects. Caffeine also appears to be protective against arrhythmias and heart failure. Along with having a generally cardioprotective profile, they have also demonstrated to have a favorable impact on insulin resistance and reduced risk of diabetes mellitus. Physicians often practice caution and advise patients with known cardiovascular diseases to refrain from drinking caffeine; however, studies have shown that drinking two to three cups a day has either no or some beneficial effects on both patients with or without cardiac disorders like arrhythmias. This article focuses on the effects of tea and coffee on the cardiovascular system as well as the potential mechanisms involved.
