33651127|t|Prediction of dose-dependent in vivo acetylcholinesterase inhibition by profenofos in rats and humans using physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling-facilitated reverse dosimetry.
33651127|a|Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are known to inhibit acetylcholine esterase (AChE), a critical effect used to establish health-based guidance values. This study developed a combined in vitro-in silico approach to predict AChE inhibition by the OP profenofos in rats and humans. A physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model was developed for both species. Parameter values for profenofos conversion to 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol (BCP) were derived from in vitro incubations with liver microsomes, liver cytosol, and plasma from rats (catalytic efficiencies of 1.1, 2.8, and 0.19 ml/min/mg protein, respectively) and humans (catalytic efficiencies of 0.17, 0.79, and 0.063 ml/min/mg protein, respectively), whereas other chemical-related parameter values were derived using in silico calculations. The rat PBK model was evaluated against literature data on urinary excretion of conjugated BCP. Concentration-dependent inhibition of rat and human AChE was determined in vitro and these data were translated with the PBK models to predicted dose-dependent AChE inhibition in rats and humans in vivo. Comparing predicted dose-dependent AChE inhibition in rats to literature data on profenofos-induced AChE inhibition revealed an accurate prediction of in vivo effect levels. Comparison of rat predictions (BMDL10 of predicted dose-response data of 0.45 mg/kg bw) and human predictions (BMDL10 of predicted dose-response data of 0.01 mg/kg bw) suggests that humans are more sensitive than rats, being mainly due to differences in kinetics. Altogether, the results demonstrate that in vivo AChE inhibition upon acute exposure to profenofos was closely predicted in rats, indicating the potential of this novel approach method in chemical hazard assessment.
