30899614|t|Acetaminophen Does Not Reduce Postoperative Opiate Consumption in Patients Undergoing Craniotomy for Cerebral Revascularization: A Randomized Control Trial.
30899614|a|Background Postoperative management in patients undergoing craniotomy is unique and challenging. We utilized a population of patients who underwent bilateral extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC bypass) revascularization procedures for moyamoya disease and hypothesized that 1 gram (gm) of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen given immediately after intubation and again 45 minutes prior to the end of craniotomy may be more effective than saline in minimizing opiate consumption and decreasing pain scores. Methods In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study, 40 craniotomies in 20 patients were studied. A random number generator assigned patients to receive either 1 gram of IV acetaminophen or an equal volume of normal saline immediately after intubation and again 45 minutes prior to the end of their first operation. For the second surgery, patients received the study drug (IV acetaminophen or normal saline) that they did not receive during their first surgery. Results In the IV acetaminophen group, the average 24-hour postoperative fentanyl equivalent consumption was decreased but the difference was not statistically significant: 228 micrograms compared to 312 micrograms in the placebo group (Figure 1; p = 0.09). Pain scores did not significantly differ between the IV acetaminophen group and the placebo group in postoperative hours 0-12 (Figure 2; p = 0.44) or 24 (Figure 3; p = 0.77). Conclusion Our study demonstrates that in patients receiving bilateral craniotomies for moyamoya disease, IV acetaminophen when given immediately after intubation and again 45 minutes prior to closure does not significantly decrease 12- or 24-hour postoperative opiate consumption.
