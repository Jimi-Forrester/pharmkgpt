38702945|t|Detection of delirium in older patients-A point prevalence study in surgical and non-surgical hospital wards.
38702945|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To (i) determine the prevalence of delirium and identify delirium subtypes in surgical and non-surgical patients aged >=65 years, (ii) determine whether certain precipitating factors affect the prevalence of delirium and (iii) review patients' medical records for description of delirium symptoms and the presence of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) coding for delirium in discharge summaries. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND JUSTIFICATIONS: Despite being a robust predictor of morbidity and mortality in older adults, delirium might be inadequately recognised and under-reported in patients' medical records and discharge summaries. A point prevalence study (24-h) of patients >=65 years from surgical and non-surgical wards was therefore conducted in a tertiary university hospital. ETHICAL ISSUES AND APPROVAL: The study was approved by the Data Protection Officer at the university hospital (2018/3454). RESEARCH METHODS, INSTRUMENTS AND/OR INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assessed for delirium with 4AT and delirium subtypes with the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale. Information about room transfers, need and use of sensory aids and medical equipment was collected onsite. Patients' medical records were reviewed for description of delirium symptoms and of ICD-10 codes. RESULTS: Overall, 123 patients were screened (52% female). Delirium was identified in 27% of them. Prevalence was associated with advanced age (>=85 years). The uncharacterised delirium subtype was most common (36%), followed by hypoactive (30%), hyperactive (24%) and mixed (9%). There were significant associations between positive screening tests and the need and use of sensory aids. Delirium symptoms were described in 58% of the patients who tested positive for delirium and the ICD-10 code for delirium was registered in 12% of these patients' discharge summaries. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of delirium and limited use of discharge codes highlight the need to improve the identification of delirium in hospital settings and at discharge. Increased awareness and detection of delirium in hospital settings are vital to improve patient care.
