12600050|a|Aluminum content is generally not high (less that 10 mg/kg) in most foods with the exception of a few such as tea, spinach, and so on, that contain more amounts of it. However, aluminum content is much high in foods in those aluminum-containing food additives are used. After drinking water is treated with aluminum-containing coagulant agent, it's aluminum concentration increases. The aluminum intake of residents from cookware in our country is 4 mg/(capit.d). The aluminum intake in adults is usually 10 mg/(capit.d), but it will rise up to tens to hundreds mg/(capit.d) when residents consume foods with a high aluminum concentration or aluminum-containing drugs. Aluminum is absorbed mainly via a duodenum, and this can be influenced by multiple factors. Absorbed aluminum is discharged primarily by renal excretion. Aluminum accumulation in human body might harm central nervous system, bone lesions, and hemopoietic system, and is a suspected causal factor to Alzheimer's disease.
