36993290|t|Distance-dependent reconfiguration of hubs in Alzheimer's disease: a cross-tissue functional network study.
36993290|a|The hubs of the intra-grey matter (GM) network were sensitive to anatomical distance and susceptible to neuropathological damage. However, few studies examined the hubs of cross-tissue distance-dependent networks and their changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using resting-state fMRI data of 30 AD patients and 37 normal older adults (NC), we constructed the cross-tissue networks based on functional connectivity (FC) between GM and white matter (WM) voxels. In the full-ranged and distance-dependent networks (characterized by gradually increased Euclidean distances between GM and WM voxels), their hubs were identified with weight degree metrics (frWD and ddWD). We compared these WD metrics between AD and NC; using the resultant abnormal WDs as the seeds, we performed seed-based FC analysis. With increasing distance, the GM hubs of distance-dependent networks moved from the medial to lateral cortices, and the WM hubs spread from the projection fibers to longitudinal fascicles. Abnormal ddWD metrics in AD were primarily located in the hubs of distance-dependent networks around 20-100mm. Decreased ddWDs were located in the left corona radiation (CR), which had decreased FCs with the executive network's GM regions in AD. Increased ddWDs were located in the posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) and the temporal-parietal-occipital junction (TPO), and their FCs were larger in AD. Increased ddWDs were shown in the sagittal striatum, which had larger FCs with the salience network's GM regions in AD. The reconfiguration of cross-tissue distance-dependent networks possibly reflected the disruption in the neural circuit of executive function and the compensatory changes in the neural circuits of visuospatial and social-emotional functions in AD.
