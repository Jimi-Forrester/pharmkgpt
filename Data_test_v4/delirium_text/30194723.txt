30194723|t|The role of chaperones in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.
30194723|a|Iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis is a complex process mediated by numerous proteins among which two from bacteria chaperones, called HscB and HscA in bacteria. They are highly conserved up to eukaryotes and homologous to DnaJ and DnaK, respectively, but with specific differences. As compared with other chaperones, HscB and HscA have escaped attention and relatively little is known about their functions. After briefly introducing the various chaperone families, we reviewed here the current structural and functional knowledge HscA and HscB and on their role in cluster formation. We critically evaluated the literature and highlighted the weak aspects which will require more attention in the future. We sincerely hope that this study will inspire new interest on this important and interesting system.
