20348021|a|An increasing number of results implicating cholesterol metabolism in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest cholesterol as a target for treatment. Research in genetics, pathology, epidemiology, biochemistry, and cell biology, as well as in animal models, suggests that cholesterol, its transporter in the brain, apolipoprotein E, amyloid precursor protein, and amyloid-beta all interact in AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, key questions remain unanswered due to the lack of sensitive and specific methods for assessing cholesterol levels in the brain at subcellular resolution. The aims of this review are not only to discuss the various methods for measuring cholesterol and its metabolites and to catalog results obtained from AD patients but also to discuss some new data linking high plasma membrane cholesterol with modifications of the endocytic compartments. These studies are particularly relevant to AD pathology, since enlarged endosomes are believed to be the first morphological change observed in AD brains, in both sporadic cases and Down syndrome.
