20026160|t|Acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase inhibition studies and antioxidant activities of 33 Scutellaria L. taxa from Turkey.
20026160|a|The members of Scutellaria L. (Lamiaceae) is known to be rich particularly in flavonoids and among them, S. baicalensis has been recorded to be used for memory-enhancing purpose. Therefore, we initiated a study to screen the methanol extracts prepared from the aerial parts of 33 Turkish Scutellaria species for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities, which are the key enzymes taking place in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Besides, the methanol extracts were tested in vitro against another enzyme, tyrosinase, which is associated with melanin hyperpigmentation. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenger effect, ferrous ion-chelating ability, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were also determined. AChE, BChE, and tyrosinase inhibition of the extracts were performed on ELISA microplate reader by spectrophotometric method. The extracts showed weak inhibition against AChE and BChE, while the best tyrosinase inhibition was caused by the methanol extract of S. brevibracteata subsp. subvelutina. The extracts had a very high DDPH radical scavenging effect and moderate antioxidant activity in ferrous ion-chelating and FRAP tests.
