37842922|a|Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere is easily accompanied by toxic and harmful substances, causing serious harm to human health, including cognitive impairment. Vitamin B12 (VitB12) is an essential micronutrient that is synthesized by bacteria and contributes to neurotransmitter synthesis as a nutrition and signaling molecule. However, the relationship between VitB12 attenuation of cognitive impairment and intestinal microbiota regulation in PM2.5 exposure has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that PM2.5 caused behavioral defects and neuronal damage in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), along with significant gene expression changes in neurotransmitter receptors and a decrease in VitB12 content, causing behavioral defects and neuronal damage in C. elegans. Methylcobalamin (MeCbl), a VitB12 analog, alleviated PM2.5-induced neurotoxicity in C. elegans. Moreover, using in vivo and in vitro models, we discovered that long-term exposure to PM2.5 led to changes in the structure of the gut microbiota, resulting in an imbalance of the VitB12-associated metabolic pathway followed by cognitive impairment. MeCbl supplementation could increase the diversity of the bacteria, reduce harmful substance contents, and restore the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and neurotransmitters to the level of the control group to some degree. Here, a new target to mitigate the harm caused by PM2.5 was discovered, supplying MeCbl for relieving intestinal and intracellular neurotransmitter disorders. Our results also provide a reference for the use of VitB12 to target the adjustment of the human intestinal microbiota to improve metabolic disorders in people exposed to PM2.5.
