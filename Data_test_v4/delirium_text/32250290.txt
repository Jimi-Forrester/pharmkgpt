32250290|a|BACKGROUND: Older surgical patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and delirium are at increased risk for accelerated long-term cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: Investigate associations between a probabilistic marker of preclinical AD, delirium, and long-term cognitive decline. METHODS: The Successful Aging after Elective Surgery cohort includes older adults (>=70 years) without dementia who underwent elective surgery. 140 patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and had>=6 months cognitive follow-up. Cortical thickness was measured in 'AD-Signature' regions. Delirium was evaluated each postoperative day by the Confusion Assessment Method. Cognitive performance was assessed using a detailed neuropsychological battery at baseline; months 1, 2, and 6; and every 6 months thereafter until 36 months. Using either a General Cognitive Performance composite (GCP) or individual test scores as outcomes, we performed linear mixed effects models to examine main effects of AD-signature atrophy and the interaction of AD-signature atrophy and delirium on slopes of cognitive change from post-operative months 2-36. RESULTS: Reduced baseline AD-signature cortical thickness was associated with greater 36-month cognitive decline in GCP (standardized beta coefficient, beta = -0.030, 95% confidence interval [-0.060, -0.001]). Patients who developed delirium who also had thinner AD signature cortex showed greater decline on a verbal learning test (beta = -0.100 [-0.192, -0.007]). CONCLUSION: Patients with the greatest baseline AD-related cortical atrophy who develop delirium after elective surgery appear to experience the greatest long-term cognitive decline. Thus, atrophy suggestive of preclinical AD and the development of delirium may be high-risk indicators for long-term cognitive decline following surgery.
