36997940|a|BACKGROUND: This prospective randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the effect of S-ketamine with sufentanil given intraoperatively and postoperatively on recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function and postoperative pain in gynecological patients undergoing open abdomen surgery. METHODS: One hundred gynecological patients undergoing open abdomen surgery were randomized into an S-ketamine group (group S) or placebo group (0.9% saline; group C). Anesthesia was maintained with S-ketamine, sevoflurane, and remifentanil-propofol target-controlled infusion in group S and with sevoflurane and remifentanil-propofol target-controlled infusion in group C. All patients were connected to patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pump at the end of the surgery with sufentanil, ketorolac tromethamine, and tropisetron in group C and additional S-ketamine in group S. The primary outcome was the time of first postoperative flatus, and the secondary outcome was postoperative pain score of patients. Postoperative sufentanil consumption within the first postoperative 24 h and adverse events such as nausea and vomiting were recorded. RESULTS: The time of first postoperative flatus in group S was significantly shorter (mean +- SD, 50.3 +- 13.5 h) than that in group C (mean +- SD, 56.5 +- 14.3 h, p = 0.042). The patient's visual analog scale (VAS) pain score 24 h after surgery at rest was significantly lower in group S than in group C (p = 0.032). There were no differences in sufentanil consumption within the first postoperative 24 h, postoperative complications related to PCIA between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: S-ketamine accelerated postoperative GI recovery and reduced 24 h postoperative pain in patients undergoing open gynecological surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2200055180.
