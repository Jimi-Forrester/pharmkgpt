31905978|t|Integrated Analytical Tools for Accessing Acridones and Unrelated Phenylacrylamides from Swinglea glutinosa.
31905978|a|In natural product studies, the purification of metabolites is an important challenge. To accelerate this step, alternatives such as integrated analytical tools should be employed. Based on this, the chemical study of Swinglea glutinosa (Rutaceae) was performed using two rapid dereplication strategies: Target Analysis (Bruker Daltonics , Bremen, Germany) MS data analysis combined with MS/MS data obtained from the GNPS platform. Through UHPLC-HRMS data, the first approach allowed, from crude fractions, a quick and visual identification of compounds already reported in the Swinglea genus. Aside from this, by grouping compounds according to their fragmentation patterns, the second approach enabled the detection of eight molecular families, which presented matches for acridonic alkaloids, phenylacrylamides, and flavonoids. Unrelated compounds for S. glutinosa have been isolated and characterized by NMR experiments, Lansamide I, Lansiumamide B, Lansiumamide C, and N-(2-phenylethyl)cinnamamide.
