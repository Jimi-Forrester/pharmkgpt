38274231|t|Association between human blood metabolome and the risk of delirium: a Mendelian Randomization study.
38274231|a|Background: Delirium significantly contributes to both mortality and morbidity among hospitalized older adults. Furthermore, delirium leads to escalated healthcare expenditures, extended hospital stays, and enduring cognitive deterioration, all of which are acknowledged detrimental outcomes. Nonetheless, the current strategies for predicting and managing delirium remain constrained. Our aim was to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal relationship between metabolites and delirium, as well as to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: We identified 129 distinct blood metabolites from three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted on the metabolome, involving a total of 147,827 participants of European descent. Genetic information pertaining to delirium was sourced from the ninth iteration of the Finngen Biobank, encompassing 359,699 individuals of Finnish ancestry. We conducted MR analyses to evaluate the connections between blood metabolites and delirium. Additionally, we extended our analysis to encompass the entire phenome using MR, aiming to uncover potential on-target consequences resulting from metabolite interventions. Results: In our investigation, we discovered three metabolites serving as causal mediators in the context of delirium: clinical low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.73, p = 3.92 x 10-6), sphingomyelin (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.25-1.74, p = 5.97 x 10-6), and X-11593-O-methylascorbate (OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.10-0.43, p = 1.86 x 10-5). Furthermore, utilizing phenome-wide MR analysis, we discerned that clinical LDL-C, sphingomyelin, and O-methylascorbate not only mediate delirium susceptibility but also impact the risk of diverse ailments. Limitations: (1) Limited representation of the complete blood metabolome, (2) reliance on the PheCode system based on hospital diagnoses may underrepresent conditions with infrequent hospital admissions, and (3) limited to European ancestry. Conclusion: The genetic prediction of heightened O-methylascorbate levels seems to correspond to a diminished risk of delirium, in contrast to the association of elevated clinical LDL-C and sphingomyelin levels with an amplified risk. A comprehensive analysis of side-effect profiles has been undertaken to facilitate the prioritization of drug targets. Notably, O-methylascorbate emerges as a potentially auspicious target for mitigating and treating delirium, offering the advantage of lacking predicted adverse side effects.
