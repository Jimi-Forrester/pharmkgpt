33526197|a|Diaries are written for patients in intensive care units by staff and relatives, especially when patients experience a disorder of their consciousness, such as delirium. Diary entries are written in common language, describing the situation of the patient. The diary can be read by the patient and the family and support the coping and understanding of what happened. It can function as a tool for supporting communication about different experiences and views of critical illness.
