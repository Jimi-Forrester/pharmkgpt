35053246|t|Anti-Planktonic and Anti-Biofilm Properties of Pentacyclic Triterpenes-Asiatic Acid and Ursolic Acid as Promising Antibacterial Future Pharmaceuticals.
35053246|a|Due to the ever-increasing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, research concerning plant-derived compounds with antimicrobial mechanisms of action has been conducted. Pentacyclic triterpenes, which have a broad spectrum of medicinal properties, are one of such groups. Asiatic acid (AA) and ursolic acid (UA), which belong to this group, exhibit diverse biological activities that include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, diuretic, and immunostimulatory. Some of these articles usually contain only a short section describing the antibacterial effects of AA or UA. Therefore, our review article aims to provide the reader with a broader understanding of the activity of these acids against pathogenic bacteria. The bacteria in the human body can live in the planktonic form and create a biofilm structure. Therefore, we found it valuable to present the action of AA and UA on both planktonic and biofilm cultures. The article also presents mechanisms of the biological activity of these substances against microorganisms.
