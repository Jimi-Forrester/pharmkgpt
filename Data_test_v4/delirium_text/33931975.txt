33931975|t|Alzheimer's disease: An evolving understanding of noradrenergic involvement and the promising future of electroceutical therapies.
33931975|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant global health concern over the next several decades. Multiple hypotheses have been put forth that attempt to explain the underlying pathophysiology of AD. Many of these are briefly reviewed here, but to-date no disease-altering therapy has been achieved. Despite this, recent work expanding on the role of noradrenergic system dysfunction in both the pathogenesis and symptomatic exacerbation of AD has shown promise. The role norepinephrine (NE) plays in AD remains complicated but pre-tangle tau has consistently been shown to arise in the locus coeruleus (LC) of patients with AD decades before symptom onset. The current research reviewed here indicates NE can facilitate neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects through beta adrenergic receptors, while alpha2A adrenergic receptors may exacerbate amyloid toxicity through a contribution to tau hyperphosphorylation. AD appears to involve a disruption in the balance between these two receptors and their various subtypes. There is also a poorly characterized interplay between the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. LC deterioration leads to maladaptation in the remaining LC-NE system and subsequently inhibits cholinergic neuron function, eventually leading to the classic cholinergic disruption seen in AD. Understanding AD as a dysfunctional noradrenergic system, provides new avenues for the use of advanced neural stimulation techniques to both study and therapeutically target the earliest stages of neuropathology. Direct LC stimulation and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have both demonstrated potential use as AD therapeutics. Significant work remains, though, to better understand the role of the noradrenergic system in AD and how electroceuticals can provide disease-altering treatments.
