1743529|t|Diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in the elderly: primary screening tests.
1743529|a|The recognition of cognitive disturbances in geriatric patients has important clinical implications for the primary care physician. Commonly seen cognitive dysfunctions include dementia, pseudodementia, delirium, and frontal lobe syndrome; these may be confounded by overlapping depression. The cognitive examination covers such intellectual and behavioral functions as attention, memory, and language. As many psychiatric disorders result from neurologic brain disease, a psychiatric examination is essential. Mental status questionnaires are useful for screening of high-risk populations for dementia and to quantify the degree of cognitive dysfunction for purposes of management planning and surveillance.
