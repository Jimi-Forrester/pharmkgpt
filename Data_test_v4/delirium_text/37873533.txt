37873533|t|Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Levels in Post-Stroke Depression: A Prospective Ischemic Stroke Cohort.
37873533|a|Background and Purpose: Increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels were found in cerebrovascular disease patients. The pathogenesis of depression after ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. Here, we aim to determine whether GFAP concentrations were associated with post-stroke depression (PSD) at 3 months. Methods: From March 2022 to September 2022, patients with first-ever ischemic stroke were prospectively recruited. GFAP concentrations were detected within 24 h using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The PSD was defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24-Item score >= 8. Results: A total of 206 subjects with ischemic stroke (mean age: 63.6 years; 49.0% female) were enrolled. During the 90-day follow-up, 57 participants (27.7%) were observed in PSD. The median serum GFAP concentrations were 0.67 ng/mL. After adjustment for the covariates, higher increased GFAP levels were associated with increased risk of PSD (odds ratio [OR], 7.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.29-15.44; P < 0.001). Also, the multivariate-adjusted OR of PSD associated with the fourth quartile of GFAP was 10.89 (95% CI, 3.53-33.60; P < 0.001) compared with the first quartile. Furthermore, the restricted cubic spline confirmed a linear association between GFAP and the risk of PSD (P for linearity < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results indicated that increased circulating GFAP concentrations were significantly correlated with the risk of PSD at 3 months. Measuring the GFAP levels after ischemic stroke may add some values for the risk stratifying of PSD.
