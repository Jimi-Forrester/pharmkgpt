30546844|t|Focused ultrasound and Alzheimer's disease A systematic review.
30546844|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of people, however, there is still no effective treatment. The use of focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS-MB) for the opening of the blood-brain barrier has been recently studied and may become a promising therapeutic target. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the use of FUS-MB for the treatment of AD and to present some of the techniques used. METHODS: A systematic review was performed of MEDLINE/PubMed and Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (BVS) services, using the keywords: focused ultrasound, Alzheimer, amyloid-b. Original articles were included in the study; studies that did not focus on Alzheimer's treatment were excluded. RESULTS: Fifteen original studies were selected. Preclinical trials were able to reduce amyloid-b plaques and tau phosphorylation, improving cognitive performance in AD animals. CONCLUSION: The results are very promising, but the therapy still requires maturation. Further studies are needed to systematize all the techniques used and their effects in order to enable use in humans.
