24713226|a|Public health and therapeutic measures to reduce cardiac and stroke risk may already be reducing risks of dementia in populations. In routine clinical care, dementia risk could be further reduced by optimized management of delirium, depressive disorders, traumatic brain injury and stroke. These are opportunities to minimize risk of progression to dementia during acute care and subsequent rehabilitation. Although interventions to protect against progress to dementia may be of small effect in each clinical situation, awareness of dementia risk and appropriate steps to reduce that risk should contribute to an overall reduction in the incidence of dementia.
