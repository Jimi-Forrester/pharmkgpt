32556424|a|PURPOSE: We aimed at assessing the potential of automated MR morphometry to assess individual basal ganglia and thalamus volumetric changes at the chronic phase after cortical stroke. METHODS: Ninety-six patients (mean age: 65 +- 18 years, male 55) with cortical stroke at the chronic phase were retrospectively included. Patients were scanned at 1.5 T or 3 T using a T1-MPRAGE sequence. Resulting 3D images were processed with the MorphoBox prototype software to automatically segment basal ganglia and thalamus structures, and to obtain Z scores considering the confounding effects of age and sex. Stroke volume was estimated by manual delineation on T2-SE imaging. Z scores were compared between ipsi- and contralateral stroke side and according to the vascular territory. Potential relationship between Z scores and stroke volume was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Basal ganglia and thalamus volume Z scores were lower ipsilaterally to MCA territory stroke (p values < 0.034) while they were not different between ipsi- and contralateral stroke sides in non-MCA territory stroke (p values > 0.37). In MCA territory stroke, ipsilateral caudate nucleus (rho = - 0.34, p = 0.007), putamen (rho = - 0.50, p < 0.001), pallidum (rho = - 0.44, p < 0.001), and thalamus (rho = - 0.48, p < 0.001) volume Z scores negatively correlated with the cortical stroke volume. This relation was not influenced by cardiovascular risk factors or time since stroke. CONCLUSION: Automated MR morphometry demonstrated atrophy of ipsilateral basal ganglia and thalamus at the chronic phase after cortical stroke in the MCA territory. The atrophy was related to stroke volume. These results confirm the potential role for automated MRI morphometry to assess remote changes after stroke.
