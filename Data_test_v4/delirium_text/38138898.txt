38138898|t|Post-Operative Thoracic Epidural Analgesia and Incidence of Major Complications according to Specific Safety Standardized Documentation: A Large Retrospective Dual Center Experience.
38138898|a|(1) Background: Thoracic epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard in post-operative pain management following thoracic surgery. This study was designed to explore the safety of thoracic epidural analgesia and to quantify the incidence of its post-operative complications and side effects in patients undergoing thoracotomy for major surgery, such as resection of lung malignancies and lung transplantation. (2) Methods: This is a retrospective, dual-center observational study including patients that underwent major thoracic surgery including lung transplantation and received concurrent placement of thoracic epidural catheters for post-operative analgesia. An electronic system of referral and documentation of complications was used, and information was retrieved from our electronic critical care charting system. (3) Results: In total, 1145 patients were included in the study. None of the patients suffered any major complication, including hematoma, abscess, or permanent nerve damage. (4) Conclusions: the present study showed that in experienced centers, post-operative epidural analgesia in patients with thoracotomy is a safe technique, manifesting minimal, none-serious complications.
