39868232|a|Background: A significant proportion of individuals maintain healthy cognitive function despite having extensive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, known as cognitive resilience. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect these individuals can identify therapeutic targets for AD dementia. This study aims to define molecular and cellular signatures of cognitive resilience, protection and resistance, by integrating genetics, bulk RNA, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data across multiple brain regions from AD, resilient, and control individuals. Methods: We analyzed data from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), including bulk (n=631) and multi-regional single nucleus (n=48) RNA sequencing. Subjects were categorized into AD, resilient, and control based on beta-amyloid and tau pathology, and cognitive status. We identified and prioritized protected cell populations using whole genome sequencing-derived genetic variants, transcriptomic profiling, and cellular composition distribution. Results: Transcriptomic results, supported by GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores, place cognitive resilience as an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Tissue-level analysis revealed 43 genes enriched in nucleic acid metabolism and signaling that were differentially expressed between AD and resilience. Only GFAP (upregulated) and KLF4 (downregulated) showed differential expression in resilience compared to controls. Cellular resilience involved reorganization of protein folding and degradation pathways, with downregulation of Hsp90 and selective upregulation of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110 families in excitatory neurons. Excitatory neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal cortex (ATP8B1+ and MEF2C high ) exhibited unique resilience signaling through neurotrophin (modulated by LINGO1) and angiopoietin (ANGPT2/TEK) pathways. We identified MEF2C, ATP8B1, and RELN as key markers of resilient excitatory neuronal populations, characterized by selective vulnerability in AD. Protective rare variant enrichment highlighted vulnerable populations, including somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons, validated through immunofluorescence showing co-expression of rare variant associated RBFOX1 and KIF26B in SST+ neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance emerges as a key characteristic of resilience. Conclusions: We identified molecular and cellular hallmarks of cognitive resilience, an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Resilience mechanisms include preservation of neuronal function, maintenance of excitatory/inhibitory balance, and activation of protective signaling pathways. Specific excitatory neuronal populations appear to play a central role in mediating cognitive resilience, while a subset of vulnerable SST interneurons likely provide compensation against AD-associated dysregulation. This study offers a framework to leverage natural protective mechanisms to mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognition in AD.
