27025082|a|Many neurodegenerative diseases accompanied by dementia are associated with the accumulation of protein aggregates. These aggregates are thought to be causes of progressive neurodegeneration and death of neurons. Recent studies indicated that these aggregates could propagate between cells in a prion like manner. Once a protein aggregate is formed it can transmit cell to cell and affect broad regions of brain. Some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are associated with the pathological aggregation of tau protein. Thus, these diseases are named as tauopathies. In the brain of these diseases, aggregated tau must also propagate in a prion like manner. Here, we discuss about the therapeutic approaches against dementia based on the prion like propagation of tau proteins.
