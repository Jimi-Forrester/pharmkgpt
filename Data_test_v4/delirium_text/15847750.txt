15847750|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze those factors predisposing to delirium in patients older than 84 years who were admitted because of hip fracture. We also compared the prevalence of delirium in this population with a younger group. PATIENTS AND METHOD: One hundred and thirty patients (mean age 91.8 years) and 50 controls aged 65 to 84 years were included. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (33%) developed delirium. A poor previous functional capacity was the best marker identifying those at risk for developing delirium. Although the prevalence of delirium was higher in those older than 84 years, statistically significant differences were not reached. CONCLUSIONS: Disability prior to admission is the main risk factor predisposing to delirium during hospitalization in patients older than 84 years who are admitted because of hip fracture.
