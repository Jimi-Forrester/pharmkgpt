38419924|t|Pattern of adult psychiatric emergencies at a tertiary care center before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
38419924|a|A gap exists in published data on psychiatric emergencies presenting to Indian centers over the entire pandemic. We assessed 2,048 consecutive adult psychiatric emergencies for the period April 2019-September 2021 to compare 18 months following the onset of the pandemic, with the pre pandemic year as the control. Mean age was 33.8 +- 13.6 years, with 55% females. The proportion with ICD-10 schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders (18.9% vs 15.3%; P = 0.031), mood disorders (21.8% vs 18.1%; P = 0.038), and personality disorders (3.8% vs 2%; P = 0.018) showed a significant increase during a pandemic, while those with no diagnosable illness reduced (28.6% vs 34.3%; P = 0.006). Suicidality was the reason for referral in 43%, comparable to pre pandemic year. Those with stay >=24 hours increased (14% vs 11%; P = 0.034). Benzodiazepines remained the commonly prescribed medication, but a notable rise was seen in mood stabilizer prescriptions.
