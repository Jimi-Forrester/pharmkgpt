31571887|a|BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is particularly important because DLB patients respond better to cholinesterase inhibitors but sometimes exhibit sensitivity to neuroleptics, which may cause worsening of clinical status. Antemortem voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using structural MRI has previously revealed that patients with DLB have normal hippocampal volume, but atrophy in the dorsal mesopontine area. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter study was to determine whether VBM of the brain stem in addition to that of medial temporal lobe structures improves the differential diagnosis of AD and DLB. METHODS: We retrospectively chose 624 patients who were clinically diagnosed with either DLB (239 patients) or AD (385 patients) from 10 institutes using different MR scanners with different magnetic field strengths. In all cases, VBM was performed on 3D T1-weighted images. The degree of local atrophy was calculated using Z-score by comparison with a database of normal volumes of interest (VOIs) in medial temporal lobe (MTL) and the dorsal brain stem (DBS). The discrimination of DLB and AD was evaluated using Z-score values in these two VOIs. MRI data from 414 patients were used as the training data set to determine the classification criteria, with the MRI data from the remaining 210 patients used as the test data set. RESULTS: The DLB and AD patients did not differ with respect to mean age or Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Z-index scores showed that there was significantly more atrophy in MTL of AD patients, compared to DLB patients and in DBS of DLB patients, compared to AD patients. The discrimination accuracies of VBM were 63.3% in the test data set and 73.4% in the training data set. CONCLUSION: VBM of DBS in addition to that of MTL improves the differentiation of DLB and AD.
