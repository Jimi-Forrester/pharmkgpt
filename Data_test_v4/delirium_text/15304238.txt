15304238|t|Identification of the role of presenilins beyond Alzheimer's disease.
15304238|a|Mutations in the genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) account for the majority of the cases of familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Presenilins (PSs) facilitate the intramembraneous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), coined gamma-secretase cleavage, which generates beta-amyloid peptides (A beta). Considerable evidence suggests that FAD-linked PS variants exert their pathogenic influence by selectively elevating the levels of highly fibrillogenic A beta 42 peptides. In addition, numerous other functions have been ascribed to PSs based on subcellular localization, protein interactions, loss of function studies, and intramembraneous gamma-secretase cleavage of growing number of substrates. This review summarizes the diverse physiological functions that are regulated by PSs beyond APP metabolism.
