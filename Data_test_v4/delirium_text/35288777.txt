35288777|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is becoming increasingly notable in neurological diseases including AD, and it has been suggested as a new peripherical biomarker of neurodegeneration. We aimed to compare plasma NfL levels among Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD patients and to evaluate relationships between NfL and CSF biomarkers and neuropsychological scores. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 110 patients (34 SCD, 53 MCI, and 23 AD), who underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluation, APOE genotyping, and plasma NfL analysis. Ninety-one patients underwent at least one amyloid burden biomarker (CSF and/or amyloid PET); 86 patients also underwent CSF phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and total-tau (t-tau) measurement. Patients were classified as A + if they presented at least one positive amyloid biomarker or A- if not. RESULTS: NfL levels were significantly increased in AD and MCI compared to SCD patients. These differences depend on A status, e.g., SCD A + had lower NfLs than MCI A + but comparable with MCI A-. Similarly, MCI A + had higher NfL levels than MCI A-, but comparable with AD. NfL levels correlated with p-tau in SCD, with all CSF biomarkers in MCI patients. No correlations were found in AD subgroup. In SCD, NfL levels were negatively correlated with memory test scores. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma NfL levels might be a promising biomarker for neurodegeneration to discriminate cognitive decline due to AD from other conditions causing cognitive impairment in prodromal stages. Considering correlations with CSF p-tau and memory tests in SCD, NfL might be a useful peripheral biomarker also in preclinical phases of AD.
