35585797|a|Dysregulation of amyloidogenic proteins and their abnormal processing and deposition in tissues cause systemic and localized amyloidosis. Formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils that deposit as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains is an earliest pathological hallmark. The polysulfated heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin (HP) is one of the non-protein components of Abeta deposits that not only modulates Abeta aggregation, but also acts as a receptor for Abeta fibrils to mediate their cytotoxicity. Interfering with the interaction between HS/HP and Abeta could be a therapeutic strategy to arrest amyloidosis. Here we have synthesized the 6-O-phosphorylated HS/HP oligosaccharides and reported their competitive effects on the inhibition of HP-mediated Abeta fibril formation in vitro using a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and a tapping mode atomic force microscopy.
