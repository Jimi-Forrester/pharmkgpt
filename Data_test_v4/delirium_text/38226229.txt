38226229|t|Choline kinase alpha genotype is related to hippocampal brain volume and cognition in postmenopausal women.
38226229|a|This study examined how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to choline synthesis and metabolism, processes largely regulated by estrogen, influenced hippocampal volume and neuropsychological function following menopause. We investigated the effect of choline kinase alpha (CHKA) genotype on brain volume and neuropsychological performance in postmenopausal women. The effect alleles of certain CHKA SNPs (rs6591331 T, rs10791957 A) are associated with varied responses to choline deficiency and delegation of choline to physiological pathways. The presence of these alleles was hypothesized to correlate with worse cognitive performance in women after menopause. Results from structural MRI scans revealed larger right hippocampal volumes in subjects with a T/T CHKA rs6591331 genotype compared to A/A subjects. Delayed memory scores from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) were lower in subjects with T/T genotypes compared to those with the A/T genotype and the A/A genotype. Based on these findings, we proposed a CHKA-dependent mechanism present within the brain to compensate for the decreased estrogen and biosynthesized choline associated with menopause.
