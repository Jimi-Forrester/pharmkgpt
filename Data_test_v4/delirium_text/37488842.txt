37488842|a|Adult neural stem cells are neurogenesis progenitor cells that play an important role in neurogenesis. Therefore, neural regeneration may be a promising target for treatment of many neurological illnesses. The regenerative capacity of adult neural stem cells can be characterized by two states: quiescent and active. Quiescent adult neural stem cells are more stable and guarantee the quantity and quality of the adult neural stem cell pool. Active adult neural stem cells are characterized by rapid proliferation and differentiation into neurons which allow for integration into neural circuits. This review focuses on differences between quiescent and active adult neural stem cells in nutrition metabolism and protein homeostasis. Furthermore, we discuss the physiological significance and underlying advantages of these differences. Due to the limited number of adult neural stem cells studies, we referred to studies of embryonic adult neural stem cells or non-mammalian adult neural stem cells to evaluate specific mechanisms.
