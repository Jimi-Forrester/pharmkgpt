38839039|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Map Reveals Molecular Signatures of Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome.
38839039|a|Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a complex neurovascular disorder characterized by repetitive thunderclap headaches and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction. The pathophysiological mechanism of this mysterious syndrome remains underexplored and there is no clinically available molecular biomarker. To provide insight into the pathogenesis of RCVS, this study reported the first landscape of dysregulated proteome of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with RCVS (n  =  21) compared to the age- and sex-matched controls (n  =  20) using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Protein-protein interaction and functional enrichment analysis were employed to construct functional protein networks using the RCVS proteome. An RCVS-CSF proteome library resource of 1054 proteins was established, which illuminated large groups of upregulated proteins enriched in the brain and blood-brain barrier (BBB). Personalized RCVS-CSF proteomic profiles from 17 RCVS patients and 20 controls reveal proteomic changes involving the complement system, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix, which may contribute to the disruption of BBB and dysregulation of neurovascular units. Moreover, an additional validation cohort validated a panel of biomarker candidates and a two-protein signature predicted by machine learning model to discriminate RCVS patients from controls with an area under the curve of 0.997. This study reveals the first RCVS proteome and a potential pathogenetic mechanism of BBB and neurovascular unit dysfunction. It also nominates potential biomarker candidates that are mechanistically plausible for RCVS, which may offer potential diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities beyond the clinical manifestations.
