38577203|a|Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a major public health issue which affects millions of people globally and consist a chronic relapsing condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and has emerged as a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is intimately linked to the development and progression of AUD, with alcohol consumption directly impacting its composition and function. This review article aims to explore the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and AUD, focusing on the implications for mental health outcomes and potential therapeutic strategies. We discuss the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain, highlighting the role of microbiota-derived metabolites in neuroinflammation, neurotransmission, and mood regulation. Furthermore, we examine the influence of AUD-related factors, such as alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, on mental health outcomes. Finally, we explore emerging therapeutic avenues targeting the gut microbiome in the management of AUD, including prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Understanding the complex interplay between the gut microbiome and AUD holds promise for developing novel interventions that could improve mental health outcomes in individuals with AUD.
