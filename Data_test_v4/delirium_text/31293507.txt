31293507|t|Neural Mechanisms of Visual Dysfunction in Posterior Cortical Atrophy.
31293507|a|Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is characterized predominantly by visual dysfunction that arises from bilateral impairments in occipital, parietal, and temporal regions of the brain. PCA is clinically identified based primarily on visual symptoms and neuroimaging findings. Region-specific gray and white matter deficits have been discussed in detail, and are associated with clinical manifestations that present with similar patterns of perfusion and metabolic findings. Here, we discuss both structural and functional changes in the ventral and dorsal visual streams along with their underlying relationships. We also discuss the most recent developments in neuroimaging characteristics and summarize correlations between distinct neuroimaging presentations.
