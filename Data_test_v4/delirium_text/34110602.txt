34110602|t|Neurological Implications of COVID-19: Role of Redox Imbalance and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.
34110602|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 or COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, this disease affected 159 million of the population and reported ~ 3.3 million deaths to the current date (May 2021). There is no definitive treatment strategy that has been identified, although this disease has prevailed in its current form for the past 18 months. The main challenges in the (SARS-CoV)-2 infections are in identifying the heterogeneity in viral strains and the plausible mechanisms of viral infection to human tissues. In parallel to the investigations into the patho-mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding the fundamental processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is very crucial for designing effective therapies. Since neurological symptoms are very apparent in COVID-19 infected patients, here, we tried to emphasize the involvement of redox imbalance and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of the COVID-19 infection. It has been articulated that mitochondrial dysfunction is very apparent and also interlinked to neurological symptoms in COVID-19 infection. Overall, this article provides an in-depth overview of redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction involvement in aggravating COVID-19 infection and its probable contribution to the neurological manifestation of the disease.
