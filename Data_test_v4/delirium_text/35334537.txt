35334537|t|Atrial Fibrillation and Dementia: Epidemiological Insights on an Undervalued Association.
35334537|a|Background and objectives: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia are growing causes of morbidity and mortality, representing relevant medical and socioeconomic burdens. In this study, based on data from the Global Burden of Disease Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we focused on AF and dementia distribution and investigated the potential correlation between the two epidemiological trends. Materials and Methods: Crude and age-standardized incidence, prevalence, mortality rate, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost, derived from GBD 2019, were reported for AF and dementia. Global features were also stratified by high and low sociodemographic-index (SDI) countries. Granger test analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between AF and dementia incidence time trends. Results: From 1990 to 2019 crude worldwide incidence and prevalence showed a dramatic increase for both conditions (from 43.24 to 61.01 and from 528.72 to 771.51 per 100,000 individuals for AF, respectively; from 54.60 to 93.52 and from 369.88 to 667.2 per 100,000 individuals for dementia, respectively). In the same timeframe, crude mortality rate doubled for AF and dementia (from 2.19 to 4.08, and from 10.49 to 20.98 per 100,000 individuals, respectively). Age-standardized estimate showed a substantial stability over the years, highlighting the key role of the progressively aging population. Crude estimates of all of the investigated metrics are greater in high SDI countries for both conditions. This association was still valid for age-standardized metrics, albeit by a reduced magnitude, suggesting the presence of higher risk factor burden in these countries. Finally, according to Granger test, we found a significant association between the historical trends of AF and dementia incidence (p = 0.004). Conclusions: AF and dementia burden progressively increased in the last three decades. Given the potential association between these two conditions, further clinical data assessing this relationship is needed.
