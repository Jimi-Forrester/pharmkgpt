33727584|t|A facile colorimetric method for the quantification of labile iron pool and total iron in cells and tissue specimens.
33727584|a|Quantification of iron is an important step to assess the iron burden in patients suffering from iron overload diseases, as well as tremendous value in understanding the underlying role of iron in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Current iron determination of total or labile iron, requires extensive sample handling and specialized instruments, whilst being time consuming and laborious. Moreover, there is minimal to no overlap between total iron and labile iron quantification methodologies-i.e. requiring entirely separate protocols, techniques and instruments. Herein, we report a unified-ferene (u-ferene) assay that enables a 2-in-1 quantification of both labile and total iron from the same preparation of a biological specimen. We demonstrate that labile iron concentrations determined from the u-ferene assay is in agreement with confocal laser scanning microscopy techniques employed within the literature. Further, this assay offers the same sensitivity as the current gold standard, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), for total iron measurements. The new u-ferene assay will have tremendous value for the wider scientific community as it offers an economic and readily accessible method for convenient 2-in-1 measurement of total and labile iron from biological samples, whilst maintaining the precision and sensitivity, as compared to ICP-MS.
