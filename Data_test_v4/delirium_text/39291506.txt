39291506|t|Quantitative Electroencephalography for Predication of Neurological Dysfunction in Type A Aortic Dissection: A Prospective Observational Study.
39291506|a|BACKGROUND: Type A aortic dissection presents challenges with postoperative cerebral complications, and this study evaluates the predictive value of quantitative electroencephalography for perioperative brain function prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) processes raw signals through filtering, amplitude integration, and time compression, displaying the data in a semilogarithmic format. Using this method, postoperative relative band power (post-RBP) alpha% and dynamic aEEG (DeltaaEEG) grade were significantly associated with neurological dysfunction in univariate and multivariable analyses, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.876 (95% CI, 0.825-0.926) for the combined model. Postoperative relative band power alpha% and DeltaaEEG were significantly associated with adverse outcomes, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.903 (95% CI, 0.835-0.971) for the combined model. Postoperative relative band power alpha% and DeltaaEEG were significantly associated with transient neurological dysfunction and stroke, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.818 (95% CI, 0.760-0.876) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.810-0.926) for transient neurological dysfunction, and 0.815 (95% CI, 0.743-0.886) and 0.831 (95% CI, 0.746-0.916) for stroke. Among 56 patients, the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score was superior to DeltaaEEG in predicting neurological outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.872 versus 0.708 [95% CI, 0.633-0.783]; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative quantitative electroencephalography monitoring offers valuable insights into brain function changes in patients with type A aortic dissection.  aEEG grades can aid in early detection of adverse outcomes, while postoperative relative band power and  aEEG grades predict transient neurological dysfunction. Quantitative electroencephalography can assist cardiac surgeons in assessing brain function and improving outcomes in patients with type A aortic dissection.
