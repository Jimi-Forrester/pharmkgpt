36991238|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics have received increasing attention over the years for their beneficial impact on the gut microbiome and for their systemic anti-inflammatory effects. They have also been shown to improve surgical outcomes. Here, we review the inflammatory effects of surgery as well as the data which suggests a benefit of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics taken in the perioperative period. RECENT FINDINGS: Synbiotics and fermented foods may have an even greater anti-inflammatory effect than probiotics or prebiotics alone. Recent data suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects and microbiome changes brought on by prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics have the potential to improve surgical outcomes. We highlight the potential to alter systemic inflammation, surgical and hospital-acquired infections, colorectal cancer formation, recurrence, and anastomotic leak. Synbiotics could also impact metabolic syndrome. Prebiotics, probiotics, and especially synbiotics may be extremely beneficial when taken in the perioperative period. Even short-term gut microbiome pre-habilitation could alter surgical outcomes significantly.
