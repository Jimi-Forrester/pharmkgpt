36882782|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertriglyceridemia is closely linked to atherosclerosis related inflammatory processes and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Using apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB-100) transgenic mice, an animal model of chronic hypertriglyceridemia, we analyzed BBB function and morphology in vitro and ex vivo. Our objective was to determine which BBB characteristics are produced mainly by interleukin (IL)-6, an atherosclerosis promoting cytokine, and whether these actions can be antagonized by IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. METHODS: Brain endothelial and glial cell cultures and brain microvessels were isolated from wild type (WT) and APOB-100 transgenic mice and were treated with IL-6, IL-10 and their combination. First, IL-6 and IL-10 production was measured in WT and APOB-100 microvessels using qPCR. Then functional parameters of endothelial cell cultures were analyzed and immunocytochemistry for key BBB proteins was performed. RESULTS: IL-6 mRNA levels were higher in brain microvessels than in brain parenchyma of APOB-100 transgenic mice. Transendothelial electric resistance and P-glycoprotein activity were lower, and paracellular permeability was higher in cultured APOB-100 brain endothelial cells. These features were sensitive to both IL-6 and IL-10 treatments. A decreased P-glycoprotein immunostaining was measured in transgenic endothelial cells under control conditions and in WT cells after treating them with IL-6. This effect was antagonized by IL-10. Changes in immunostaining for tight junction proteins were observed after IL-6 exposure, which were in part antagonized by IL-10. In glial cell cultures an increase in aquaporin-4 immunolabeling in the transgenic group and an increase in microglia cell density in WT glia cultures was detected after IL-6 treatment, which was antagonized by IL-10. In isolated brain microvessels a decrease in P-glycoprotein immunolabeled area fraction was measured in APOB-100 microvessels under control conditions and in WT microvessels after every cytokine treatment. ZO-1 immunolabeling showed characteristics similar to that of P-glycoprotein. No change was seen in claudin-5 and occludin immunoreactive area fractions in microvessels. A decrease in aquaporin-4 immunoreactivity was measured in WT microvessels treated by IL-6, which was antagonized by IL-10. CONCLUSION: IL-6 produced in microvessels contributes to BBB impairment observed in the APOB-100 mice. We showed that IL-10 partly antagonizes the effects of IL-6 at the BBB.
