38785750|t|Long COVID in Children, Adults, and Vulnerable Populations: A Comprehensive Overview for an Integrated Approach.
38785750|a|Long COVID affects both children and adults, including subjects who experienced severe, mild, or even asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have provided a comprehensive overview of the incidence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of persistent COVID-19 symptoms in both children and adults, encompassing vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and oncological patients. Our objective is to emphasize the critical significance of adopting an integrated approach for the early detection and appropriate management of long COVID. The incidence and severity of long COVID symptoms can have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and the course of disease in the case of pre-existing pathologies. Particularly, in fragile and vulnerable patients, the presence of PASC is related to significantly worse survival, independent from pre-existing vulnerabilities and treatment. It is important try to achieve an early recognition and management. Various mechanisms are implicated, resulting in a wide range of clinical presentations. Understanding the specific mechanisms and risk factors involved in long COVID is crucial for tailoring effective interventions and support strategies. Management approaches involve comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments and treatment of symptoms and comorbidities, such as autonomic dysfunction, as well as multidisciplinary rehabilitation. The overall course of long COVID is one of gradual improvement, with recovery observed in the majority, though not all, of patients. As the research on long-COVID continues to evolve, ongoing studies are likely to shed more light on the intricate relationship between chronic diseases, such as oncological status, cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, and the persistent effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This information could guide healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers in developing targeted interventions.
