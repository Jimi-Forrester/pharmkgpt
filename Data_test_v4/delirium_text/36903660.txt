36903660|t|Therapeutic Effects of Coumarins with Different Substitution Patterns.
36903660|a|The use of derivatives of natural and synthetic origin has gained attention because of their therapeutic effects against human diseases. Coumarins are one of the most common organic molecules and are used in medicine for their pharmacological and biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, antihypertensive, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective, among others. In addition, coumarin derivates can modulate signaling pathways that impact several cell processes. The objective of this review is to provide a narrative overview of the use of coumarin-derived compounds as potential therapeutic agents, as it has been shown that substituents on the basic core of coumarin have therapeutic effects against several human diseases and types of cancer, including breast, lung, colorectal, liver, and kidney cancer. In published studies, molecular docking has represented a powerful tool to evaluate and explain how these compounds selectively bind to proteins involved in various cellular processes, leading to specific interactions with a beneficial impact on human health. We also included studies that evaluated molecular interactions to identify potential biological targets with beneficial effects against human diseases.
