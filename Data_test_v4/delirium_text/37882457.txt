37882457|t|Reducing the use of psychotropics in a convalescent rehabilitation ward.
37882457|a|AIMS: Many patients who are transferred to the convalescent rehabilitation ward of Kawasaki Kokoro Hospital (hereinafter, our hospital) are on psychotropics prescribed for delirium by their physicians at acute care hospitals. In this study, psychiatrists and pharmacists collaborated with rehabilitation physicians to reduce the use of psychotropics. METHODS: The basic information and psychotropics prescription statuses of 88 patients discharged from the convalescent rehabilitation ward of our hospital between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022 were derived from their medical records. RESULTS: At admission, psychotropics were prescribed to 55 patients and the number of prescribed drugs was 2 (median). At discharge, psychotropics were prescribed to 41 patients and the number of prescribed drugs was 1 (median), showing a significant decrease (p < 0.05). Compared with those at admission, prescribed psychotropic doses at discharge were significantly higher for lemborexant but significantly lower for antipsychotics, benzodiazepine/nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, antidepressants, suvorexant, ramelteon, and sodium valproate (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that it may be possible to reduce the types and doses of psychotropics prescribed at acute care hospitals in convalescent rehabilitation wards. However, further investigation is needed because the number of patients in this study was limited, and selection bias due to different patient characteristics cannot be ruled out.
