37353980|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes in specific regions are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to non-PD controls, and to assess their impact on motor signs through cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. METHODS: A total of 50 PD participants and 47 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled. All PD participants were followed up for at least 2 years. To detect regions of greater WMH in the PD, the WMH volume of each region was compared with the corresponding region in the control group. Linear regression and linear mixed effects models were respectively used for cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the impact of increases in WMH volume on motor signs. RESULTS: The PD group had greater WMH volume in the occipital region compared with the control group. Cross-sectional analyses only detected a significant correlation between occipital WMH volume and motor function in PD. Occipital WMH volume positively correlated with the severity of tremor, and gait and posture impairments, in the PD group. During the follow-up period, the participants' motor signs progressed and the WMH volumes remained stable, no longitudinal association was detected between them. The baseline occipital WMH volume cannot predict the progression of signs after adjustment for baseline disease duration and the presence of vascular risk factors. INTERPRETATION: PD participants in this study were characterized by greater WMH at the occipital region, and greater occipital WMH volume had cross-sectional associations with worse motor signs, while its longitudinal impact on motor signs progression was limited.
