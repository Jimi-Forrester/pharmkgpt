29772744|t|Activities of Daily Living and Determinant Factors among Older Adult Subjects with Lower Body Fracture after Discharge from Hospital: A Prospective Study.
29772744|a|Fracture is a type of musculoskeletal injury that contributes to an inability to perform daily activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate activities of daily living (ADL) of older adult patients with lower body fracture and to determine factors influencing ADL. Patient's ADL was assessed at pre-fracture, ward admission and post-discharge phases using the Katz ADL questionnaire. There were 129 subjects at pre-fracture and ward phases and 89 subjects at discharge phase. There were four independent variables; age, gender, type of fracture and ability to walk before fracture. Logistic regression models showed that 'age' and 'ability to walk before fracture' were the determinant factors of dependent for 'bathing', 'dressing' and 'toileting'. The 'ability to walk before fracture' was the determinant factor of dependent for 'transferring'. 'Age' and 'gender' were the determinant factors of dependent for 'continence', while 'age' was the determinant factor of dependent for 'feeding'. The ADL score changes were significant across the phases with a reduction in ADL score in the ward admission phase and partial increment during the post-discharge phase. There were improvements in the health outcomes of subjects aged more than 50 years old after 3 months of being discharged from the hospital. In conclusion, age, being female, having a hip fracture and using a walking aid before fracture were the determinants identified in this study.
