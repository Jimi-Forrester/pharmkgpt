39424870|a|In patients with major depressive disorder, various functional areas are impaired, negatively impacting the quality of life. Remission can restore pre-depression functions; however, some patients may still have residual impairments. Distinguishing between near-normal recovery and residual impairment helps identify those at a high risk of relapse risk and helps tailor treatment. Accordingly, we aimed to discover and validate biomarkers that distinguish between near-normal recovery and residual impairment in remission states through serum proteome analysis. Pooled serum and individual serum samples from three groups (depression status, remission status with residual impairment, and remission status with normal recovery) were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The combination of four proteins-antithrombin-III, serum amyloid A4 protein, C1q subcomponent subunit B, and serum amyloid P-component-was selected as a candidate biomarker. The trend of protein changes suggests complement C1q subcomponent subunit B and serum amyloid P-component as potential biomarkers for distinguishing remission from residual impairment. Changes in complement C1q subcomponent subunit B and serum amyloid P-component suggest that the complement system and inflammation-related immune mechanisms are associated with residual impairment in remittent major depressive disorder.
