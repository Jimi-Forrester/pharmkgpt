36448030|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with millions of people affected worldwide. Pathophysiological manifestations of AD include the extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) pep-tides, products of the proteolytic cleavage of the amy-loid precursor protein APP. Increasing evidence sug-gests that Abeta peptides also accumulate intracellular-ly, triggering neurotoxic events such as mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the molecular factors driving formation and toxicity of intracellular Abeta are poorly understood. In our recent study [EMBO Mol Med 2022 - e13952], we used different eukaryotic model systems to identify such factors. Based on a genetic screen in yeast and subsequent molecular analyses, we found that both the yeast chaperone Ydj1 and its human ortholog DnaJA1 physically interact with Abeta, facili-tate the aggregation of Abeta peptides into small oli-gomers and promote their translocation to mitochon-dria. Deletion or downregulation of this chaperone pro-tected from Abeta-mediated toxicity in yeast and Dro-sophila AD models, respectively. Most importantly, the identified chaperone is found to be dysregulated in post-mortem human samples of AD patients. Here, we aim to outline our key findings, highlighting pathological functions of a heat shock protein (Hsp) family member, which are generally considered protective rather than toxic during neurodegeneration. Our results thus chal-lenge the concept of developing generalized chaperone activation-based therapies and call for carefully consid-ering also maladaptive functions of specific heat shock proteins.
