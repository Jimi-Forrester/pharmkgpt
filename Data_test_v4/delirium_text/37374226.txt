37374226|t|The Ethnopharmacological Properties of Green-Engineered Metallic Nanoparticles against Metabolic Disorders.
37374226|a|Metabolic syndrome is a multifaceted pathophysiologic condition that is largely caused by an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. The pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome is determined by an individual's genetic/epigenetics and acquired factors. Natural compounds, notably plant extracts, have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties and are considered to be a viable option for metabolic disorder treatment due to their low risk of side effects. However, the limited solubility, low bioavailability, and instability of these botanicals hinder their performance. These specific limitations have prompted the need for an efficient system that reduces drug degradation and loss, eliminates unwanted side effects, and boosts drug bioavailability, as well as the percentage of the drug deposited in the target areas. The quest for an enhanced (effective) drug delivery system has led to the formation of green-engineered nanoparticles, which has increased the bioavailability, biodistribution, solubility, and stability of plant-based products. The unification of plant extracts and metallic nanoparticles has helped in the development of new therapeutics against metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders, non-alcoholic fatty liver, and cancer. The present review outlines the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases and their cures with plant-based nanomedicine.
