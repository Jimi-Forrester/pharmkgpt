38240717|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk variants for Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, how the risk variants confer the risk of PD remains largely unknown. We conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) and summary-data-based mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis by integrating PD GWAS with proteome and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data from human brain, plasma and CSF. We also performed a large transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and Fine-mapping of causal gene sets (FOCUS), leveraging joint-tissue imputation (JTI) prediction models of 22 tissues to identify and prioritize putatively causal genes. We further conducted PWAS, SMR, TWAS, and FOCUS using a multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) to identify additional PD risk genes to boost statistical power. In this large-scale study, we identified 16 genes whose genetically regulated protein abundance levels were associated with Parkinson's disease risk. We undertook a large-scale analysis of PD and correlated traits, through TWAS and FOCUS studies, and discovered 26 casual genes related to PD that had not been reported in previous TWAS. 5 genes (CD38, GPNMB, RAB29, TMEM175, TTC19) showed significant associations with PD at both the proteome-wide and transcriptome-wide levels. Our study provides new insights into the etiology and underlying genetic architecture of PD.
