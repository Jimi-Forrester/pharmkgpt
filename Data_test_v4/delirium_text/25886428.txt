25886428|a|Huntington's chorea (HC) is a rare hereditary disorder of the nervous system. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and is characterized by progressive chorea, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. There are only a few case reports regarding the anesthetic management of a patient with HC and the best anesthetic technique is yet to be established for those patients which are at higher risk of perioperative complications. We report the anesthetic management of a 64-year-old patient with HC admitted for cataract surgery.
