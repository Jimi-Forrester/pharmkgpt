38610446|t|Unobtrusive Sensors for Synchronous Monitoring of Different Breathing Parameters in Care Environments.
38610446|a|Respiratory problems are common amongst older people. The rapid increase in the ageing population has led to a need for developing technologies that can monitor such conditions unobtrusively. This paper presents a novel study that investigates Wi-Fi and ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna sensors to simultaneously monitor two different breathing parameters: respiratory rate, and exhaled breath. Experiments were carried out with two subjects undergoing three breathing cases in breaths per minute (BPM): (1) slow breathing (12 BPM), (2) moderate breathing (20 BPM), and (3) fast breathing (28 BPM). Respiratory rates were captured by Wi-Fi sensors, and the data were processed to extract the respiration rates and compared with a metronome that controlled the subjects' breathing. On the other hand, exhaled breath data were captured by a UWB antenna using a vector network analyser (VNA). Corresponding reflection coefficient data (S11) were obtained from the subjects at the time of exhalation and compared with S11 in free space. The exhaled breath data from the UWB antenna were compared with relative humidity, which was measured with a digital psychrometer during the breathing exercises to determine whether a correlation existed between the exhaled breath's water vapour content and recorded S11 data. Finally, captured respiratory rate and exhaled breath data from the antenna sensors were compared to determine whether a correlation existed between the two parameters. The results showed that the antenna sensors were capable of capturing both parameters simultaneously. However, it was found that the two parameters were uncorrelated and independent of one another.
