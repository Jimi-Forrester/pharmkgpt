38496442|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common manifestation in septic patients that is associated with increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment. SAE is driven, at least in part, by brain endothelial dysfunction in response to systemic cytokine signaling. However, the mechanisms driving SAE and its consequences remain largely unknown. Here, we performed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq) from the brain endothelium to determine the transcriptional changes after an acute endotoxemic (LPS) challenge. We found that LPS induces a strong acute transcriptional response in the brain endothelium that partially correlates with the whole brain transcriptional response and suggested an endothelial-specific hypoxia response. Consistent with a critical role for the IL-6 pathway, loss of the main regulator of this pathway, SOCS3, leads to a broadening of the population of genes responsive to LPS, suggesting that an overactivation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway leads to an increased transcriptional response that could explain our prior findings of severe brain injury in these mice. To identify any potential sequelae of this acute response, we performed brain TRAP-seq following a battery of behavioral tests in mice after apparent recovery. We found that the transcriptional response returns to baseline within days post-challenge. Despite the transient nature of the response, we observed that mice that recovered from the endotoxemic shock showed mild, sex-dependent cognitive impairment, suggesting that the acute brain injury led to sustained, non-transcriptional effects. A better understanding of the transcriptional and non-transcriptional changes in response to shock is needed in order to prevent and/or revert the devastating consequences of septic shock.
