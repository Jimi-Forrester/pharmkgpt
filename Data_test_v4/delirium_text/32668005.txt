32668005|t|Effectiveness of a Technology-Enhanced Integrated Care Model for Frail Older People: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial in Nursing Homes.
32668005|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an information and communication technologies (ICT)-enhanced, multidisciplinary integrated care model, called Systems for Person-centered Elder Care (SPEC), on frail older adults at nursing homes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SPEC was implemented at 10 nursing homes in South Korea in random order using a stepped-wedge design. Data were collected on all participating older residents in the homes before the first implementation and until 6 months after the last implementation. The 21-month SPEC intervention guided by the chronic care model (CCM) consists of 5 strategies: comprehensive geriatric assessment, care planning, optional interdisciplinary case conferences, care coordination, and a cloud-based ICT tool along with a free messaging app. The primary outcome was quality of care measured by a composite quality indicator (QI) from the interRAI assessment system. Usual care continued over the control periods. Nursing home staff were not blinded to the intervention. RESULTS: There were a total of 482 older nursing home residents included in the analysis. Overall quality of care measured by the composite QI was significantly improved (adjusted mean difference: -0.025 [95% CI: -0.037 to -0.014, p < .0001]). The intervention effect was consistent in the subgroup analysis by cognition and activities of daily living. There were no important adverse events or side effects. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The SPEC, a CCM-guided, ICT-supported, multidisciplinary integrated care management intervention, can improve the quality of care measured by health and functional outcomes for frail older persons residing in nursing homes with limited health care provision.
