32015347|a|The long isoform of Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM-L) is a neuron-specific death receptor antagonist that modulates apoptotic cell death and mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. FAIM-L exerts its antiapoptotic action by binding to X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an inhibitor of caspases, which are the main effectors of apoptosis. XIAP levels are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. FAIM-L interaction with XIAP prevents the ubiquitination and degradation of the latter, thereby allowing it to inhibit caspase activation. This interaction also modulates non-apoptotic functions of caspases, such as the endocytosis of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) in hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). The molecular mechanism of action exerted by FAIM-L is unclear since the consensus binding motifs are still unknown. Here, we performed a two-hybrid screening to discover novel FAIM-L-interacting proteins. We found a functional interaction of SIVA-1 with FAIM-L. SIVA-1 is a proapoptotic protein that has the capacity to interact with XIAP. We describe how SIVA-1 regulates FAIM-L function by disrupting the interaction of FAIM-L with XIAP, thereby promoting XIAP ubiquitination, caspase-3 activation and neuronal death. Furthermore, we report that SIVA-1 plays a role in receptor internalization in synapses. SIVA-1 is upregulated upon chemical LTD induction, and it modulates AMPAR internalization via non-apoptotic activation of caspases. In summary, our findings uncover SIVA-1 as new functional partner of FAIM-L and demonstrate its role as a regulator of caspase activity in synaptic function.
