38813288|t|Delirium Knowledge, Risk Factors, and Attitude Among the General Public in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.
38813288|a|Introduction Delirium is a common and serious neuropsychiatric disorder, of acute onset, present at any age, but more common in older adults, and very common in clinical practice. It combines mental and behavioral symptoms with a fluctuating course, with worsening of the condition in the afternoon and at night, with important repercussions on increased mortality, greater risk of cognitive impairment, and hospitalization costs. Delirium's impact extends to patients, families, and healthcare systems, emphasizing the need for public awareness and education in Saudi Arabia. Methodology It is a cross-sectional conducted in Saudi Arabia that aims to assess knowledge, risk factors, and attitudes regarding delirium among all Saudi and non-Saudi residents aged 18 and older. A 36 self-administered questionnaire, standardized Nordic, was used. Data were cleaned in Microsft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, USA) and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). This study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from May 2023 till March 2024. Results Our study involved 1,470 participants from Saudi Arabia, primarily females (79.1%), Saudi nationals (89.9%), and unmarried individuals (65.4%). Most participants were aged 18-24 (59.5%) and held bachelor's degrees (57.3%). Commonly recognized delirium risk factors included increasing age (63.3%), dementia (58.2%), and longer ICU stays (48.7%). The participants showed moderate knowledge of delirium symptoms and consequences. Attitudes varied, with many agreeing that delirium requires intervention (30.7%) but fewer considering it preventable (17.1%). Sociodemographic factors, including gender and age, significantly influenced knowledge and attitudes, while education levels did not. Conclusion Our study found that gender and age influenced knowledge and attitudes, highlighting the importance of targeted education. Future research should further investigate the effectiveness of such interventions in enhancing knowledge and awareness and promoting preventive actions.
