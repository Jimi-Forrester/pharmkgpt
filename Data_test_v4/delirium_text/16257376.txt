16257376|t|Drug design using the example of the complement system inhibitors' development.
16257376|a|Undesired activation of the complement system, a part of the immune system, is a major pathogenic factor contributing to various diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis, asthma, allergic reactions, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia, multiple sclerosis and others. The history of the development of complement system inhibitors, preventing its destructive action on the body, represents the evolution of the main methods of drug design. This review illustrates the main approaches of drug design, ranging from screening and modification of natural products to structure-based ligand design, on the basis of complement inhibitors' creation. The current status of the field of complement inhibitors is also discussed.
