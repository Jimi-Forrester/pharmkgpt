38819047|t|P2Y1 receptor in Alzheimer's disease.
38819047|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau. Targeting amyloid-beta plaques has been a primary direction for developing Alzheimer's disease treatments in the last decades. However, existing drugs targeting amyloid-beta plaques have not fully yielded the expected results in the clinic, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence unravels that astrocyte morphology and function alter in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, with dysregulated astrocytic purinergic receptors, particularly the P2Y1 receptor, all of which constitute the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. These receptors are not only crucial for maintaining normal astrocyte function but are also highly implicated in neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. This review delves into recent insights into the association between P2Y1 receptor and Alzheimer's disease to underscore the potential neuroprotective role of P2Y1 receptor in Alzheimer's disease by mitigating neuroinflammation, thus offering promising avenues for developing drugs for Alzheimer's disease and potentially contributing to the development of more effective treatments.
