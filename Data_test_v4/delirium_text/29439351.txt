29439351|a|BACKGROUND: Histopathological studies have confirmed that soft drusen contains amyloid-beta (Abeta). OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the area of soft drusen in the macular area and cerebral Abeta accumulation or plasma Abeta level in elderly persons without dementia. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (18 eyes) aged >=50 years with macular soft drusen were studied prospectively. From color fundus photographs, the area of soft drusen (pixel) within a 6,000 mum diameter with the macula as center was measured. Standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was obtained from positron emission tomography using florbetapir, which indicates the ratio of cerebral cortical-to-cerebellar Abeta accumulation. Ratio of plasma Abeta1-42 to Abeta1-40 level was calculated. RESULTS: Mean age was 73.3+-7.6 years. The soft drusen area was 4.32+-2.42 mm2. The SUVR was 1.08+-0.15. Plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio was 0.17+-0.08. When SUVR >=1.10 was defined as positive and <1.10 as negative, the soft drusen area in SUVR-positive patients (6.19+-1.14 mm2) was significantly (p = 0.0043) larger than that in SUVR-negative patients (3.13+-2.27 mm2). Multivariate regression analysis showed that SUVR positivity correlated with soft drusen area (p = 0.0484) and with Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer's Disease score (p = 0.0360). However, there was no correlation with gender (p = 0.1921), age (p = 0.2361), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale score (p = 0.6310), Mini-Mental State Examination score (p = 0.4246), or plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio (p = 0.8398). CONCLUSION: Among elderly persons without dementia, the area of soft drusen was larger in those with more extensive cerebral Abeta accumulation. The area of soft drusen may be a biomarker of cerebral Abeta accumulation.
