37546022|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common psychological disorder in brain injury patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU), one of the leading causes of which can be sensory deprivation or sensory overload. This study aimed to determine the effect of implementing a sensory stimulation program by family members on the delirium status of ICU-hospitalized brain injury patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 66 brain injury patients hospitalized in the ICUs were assigned to intervention and control groups using stratified random sampling. For the intervention group, a sensory stimulation program was implemented by family members for 1 h a day during the ICU stay. The control group received routine care. Patients' delirium status was assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). Data were analyzed by the SPSS software version 22, using Chi-square, independent t-test, and Binary logistic regression model tests, at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Odds of delirium Incidence in the intervention group was 94% lower than in the control group (OR = 0.057, 95% CI 0.017, 0.19, P = 0.001). There is a significant difference between the two groups in terms of length of delirium (P = 0.001), stay in ICU (P = 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (P = 0.001). The mean of all three variables in the intervention group was lower than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing of sensory stimulation program by the family members, as a non-pharmacological method, can reduce the incidence of delirium in brain injury patients admitted to ICU.
