31416903|a|Storage of long-term memory requires not only protein synthesis but also protein degradation. In this article, we overview recent publications related to this issue, stressing that the balanced actions of protein synthesis and degradation are critical for long-term memory formation. We particularly focused on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling that leads to protein synthesis; proteasome- and autophagy-dependent protein degradation that removes molecular constraints; the role of Fragile X mental retardation protein in translational suppression; and epigenetic modifications that control gene expression at the genomic level. Numerous studies suggest that an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation leads to intellectual impairment and cognitive disorders.
