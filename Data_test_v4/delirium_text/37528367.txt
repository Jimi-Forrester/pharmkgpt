METHODS: This cross-sectional study used National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data (2014-2016, and 2018). Adults aged >= 50 years with pain were analyzed. Prescribing of opioid and concomitant sedative prescriptions (including benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, and barbiturates) were identified by the Multum lexicon code. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the risk of opioid prescribing or co-prescribing of opioid and sedative associated with ADRD in older adults with pain. RESULTS: There were 13,299 office visits in older adults with pain, representing 451.75 million visits. Opioid prescribing occurred in 27.19%; 30% involved co-prescribing of opioids and sedatives. ADRD was not associated with opioid prescribing or co-prescribing of opioid and sedative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid and sedatives are commonly prescribed in older adults with pain. Longitudinal studies need to understand the etiology and chronicity of opioid use in older patients, specifically with ADRD.
