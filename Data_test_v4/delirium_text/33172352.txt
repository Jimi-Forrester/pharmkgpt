33172352|t|Telehealth for the cognitively impaired older adult and their caregivers: lessons from a coordinated approach.
33172352|a|The Covid-19 pandemic forced providers to alter their delivery of care to special populations, including older adults with cognitive impairment. The Montefiore-Einstein Center for the Aging Brain, a specialty multidisciplinary center for the evaluation and management of patients with neurodegenerative disorders, developed a coordinated approach (Coordinated Care At Risk/Remote Elderly program [CCARRE]) to reach our diverse population during the initial Covid-19 crisis in New York City, USA. In the tele-evaluation of the first 85 patients seen with CCARRE, we recognized unique factors that could improve patient care, lessen burden and optimize access to community resources. Lessons learned from the experience are shared.
