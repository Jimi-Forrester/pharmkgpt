37998343|t|Age Is Just a Number: Progress and Obstacles in the Discovery of New Candidate Drugs for Sarcopenia.
37998343|a|Sarcopenia is a disease characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that occurs with aging. The progression of sarcopenia is correlated with the onset of physical disability, the inability to live independently, and increased mortality. Due to global increases in lifespan and demographic aging in developed countries, sarcopenia has become a major socioeconomic burden. Clinical therapies for sarcopenia are based on physical therapy and nutritional support, although these may suffer from low adherence and variable outcomes. There are currently no clinically approved drugs for sarcopenia. Consequently, there is a large amount of pre-clinical research focusing on discovering new candidate drugs and novel targets. In this review, recent progress in this research will be discussed, along with the challenges that may preclude successful translational research in the clinic. The types of drugs examined include mitochondria-targeting compounds, anti-diabetes agents, small molecules that target non-coding RNAs, protein therapeutics, natural products, and repositioning candidates. In light of the large number of drugs and targets being reported, it can be envisioned that clinically approved pharmaceuticals to prevent the progression or even mitigate sarcopenia may be within reach.
