34285724|t|The Effects of Yoga on Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
34285724|a|METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted by systematically searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases till August 2020 for studies published in English. The reference lists of eligible studies were also searched. The motor symptoms (UPDRS-Part III), balance function (BBS and BESTest), functional mobility (TUG), anxiety (HADS and BAI), depression (HADS and BDI), and the quality of life (PDQ-39 and PDQ-8) were the primary evaluation indexes. RESULTS: Ten studies including 359 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed significant difference between the yoga training group and the control group. Patients in the yoga training group had better functional outcomes in terms of motor status (MD = -5.64; 95% CI, -8.57 to -2.7), balance function (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.77), functional mobility (MD = -1.71; 95% CI, -2.58 to -0.84), anxiety scale scores (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.01 to -0.43), depression scale scores (SMD = -0.92; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.62), and QoL (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.11). CONCLUSION: Our pooled results showed the benefits of yoga in improving motor function, balance, functional mobility, reducing anxiety and depression, and increasing QoL in PD patients.
