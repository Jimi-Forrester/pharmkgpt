32718126|a|Liver surgery is one of the most complex surgical interventions with high risk and potential for complications. Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a serious complication of liver surgery that occurs in about 10% of patients undergoing major liver surgery. It is the main source of morbidity and mortality. Appropriate surgical techniques and intensive care management are important in preventing PHLF. Early start of the liver support systems is very important for the PHLF patient to recover, survive, or be ready for a liver transplant. Nonbiological  and  biological  liver  support  systems  should  be  used  in  PHLF  to  prepare  for  treatment  or  organ  transplantation.  The  definition of the state, underlying pathophysiology and treatment strategies will be reviewed here.
