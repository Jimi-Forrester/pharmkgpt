33804063|a|Besides its insulinotropic actions on pancreatic beta cells, neuroprotective activities of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have attracted attention. The efficacy of a GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4) for functional repair after sciatic nerve injury and amelioration of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has been reported; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the bioactivities of Ex-4 on immortalized adult rat Schwann cells IFRS1 and adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron-IFRS1 co-culture system were investigated. Localization of GLP-1R in both DRG neurons and IFRS1 cells were confirmed using knockout-validated monoclonal Mab7F38 antibody. Treatment with 100 nM Ex-4 significantly enhanced survival/proliferation and migration of IFRS1 cells, as well as stimulated the movement of IFRS1 cells toward neurites emerging from DRG neuron cell bodies in the co-culture with the upregulation of myelin protein 22 and myelin protein zero. Because Ex-4 induced phosphorylation of serine/threonine-specific protein kinase AKT in these cells and its effects on DRG neurons and IFRS1 cells were attenuated by phosphatidyl inositol-3'-phosphate-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, Ex-4 might act on both cells to activate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby promoting myelination in the co-culture. These findings imply the potential efficacy of Ex-4 toward DPN and other peripheral nerve lesions.
