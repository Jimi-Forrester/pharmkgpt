37122377|t|A post-transcriptional regulatory landscape of aging in the female mouse hippocampus.
37122377|a|Aging is associated with substantial physiological changes and constitutes a major risk factor for neurological disorders including dementia. Alterations in gene expression upon aging have been extensively studied; however, an in-depth characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory events remains elusive. Here, we profiled the age-related changes of the transcriptome and translatome in the female mouse hippocampus by RNA sequencing of total RNA and polysome preparations at four ages (3-, 6-, 12-, 20-month-old); and we implemented a variety of bioinformatics approaches to unravel alterations in transcript abundance, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation site selection. We observed mostly well-coordinated transcriptome and translatome expression signatures across age including upregulation of transcripts related to immune system processes and neuroinflammation, though transcripts encoding ribonucleoproteins or associated with mitochondrial functions, calcium signaling and the cell-cycle displayed substantial discordant profiles, suggesting translational control associated with age-related deficits in hippocampal-dependent behavior. By contrast, alternative splicing was less preserved, increased with age and was associated with distinct functionally-related transcripts encoding proteins acting at synapses/dendrites, RNA-binding proteins; thereby predicting regulatory roles for RBM3 and CIRBP. Only minor changes in polyadenylation site selection were identified, indicating pivotal 3'-end selection in young adults compared to older groups. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive resource of age-associated post-transcriptional regulatory events in the mouse hippocampus, enabling further examination of the molecular features underlying age-associated neurological diseases.
