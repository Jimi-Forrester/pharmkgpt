38142891|t|Bridging neurotrophic factors and bioactive peptides to Alzheimer's disease.
38142891|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. As the demographic shifting towards an aging population, AD has emerged as a prominent public health concern. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and there are no effective treatment methods for AD until now. In recent years, neurotrophic factors and bioactive peptides including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), irisin, melatonin, have been discovered to exert neuroprotective functions for AD. Bioactive peptides can be divided into two categories based on their sources: endogenous and exogenous. This review briefly elaborates on the pathogenesis of AD and analyzes the regulatory effects of endogenous and exogenous peptides on the pathogenesis of AD, thereby providing new therapeutic targets for AD and a theoretical basis for the application of bioactive peptides as adjunctive therapies for AD.
