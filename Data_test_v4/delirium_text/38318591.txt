38318591|t|Comparative Analysis of Intravenous Opioids Versus Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia in Fractured Rib Pain Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38318591|a|Rib fractures, common among trauma victims, lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing the associated pain is challenging, with IV opioids and thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) being utilized. While epidural analgesia is often preferred for fractured rib pain, existing data encompasses both lumbar and thoracic approaches. This review aimed to compare TEA and IV opioids for persistent rib fracture pain. A comprehensive search across five databases yielded 987 articles, of which seven met the eligibility criteria. Outcomes were categorized into primary (pain reduction) and secondary (mortality, hospital/ICU stays, analgesia-related complications) endpoints. Analyzed with Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.4.1 (2020; The Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom), the pooled data from two sources showed TEA significantly more effective in reducing pain than IV opioids (standardized mean difference (SMD): 2.23; 95%CI: 1.65-2.82; p < 0.00001). Similarly, TEA was associated with shorter ICU stays (SMD: 0.73; 95%CI: 0.33-1.13; p = 0.0004), while hospitalization duration showed no substantial difference (SMD: 0.82; 95%CI: -0.34-1.98). Mortality rates also did not significantly differ between TEA and IV opioids (risk ratio (RR): 1.20; 95%CI: 0.36-4.01; p = 0.77). Subgroup analysis revealed fewer pneumonia cases with TEA (RR: 2.06; 95%CI: 1.07-3.96; P = 0.03), with no notable disparities in other complications. While TEA's superiority in pain relief for rib fractures suggests it is the preferred analgesic, the recommendation's strength is tempered by the low methodological quality of supporting articles.
