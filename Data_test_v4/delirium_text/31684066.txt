31684066|t|The Practical Use of White Cell Inflammatory Biomarkers in Prediction of Postoperative Delirium after Cardiac Surgery.
31684066|a|: Introduction: Postoperative delirium (POD) is associated with unfavorable outcomes. It may result from neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of routinely available inflammatory markers derived from white blood cell count (WBC), for prognostic value in diagnosing delirium after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We performed an analysis of data collected from patients undergoing planned coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Differential WBC and CRP concentration were evaluated preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at day 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 5 (T5) after CABG. Differences in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and platelet-to-WBC ratio (PWR) between patients with (Del+) and without delirium (Del-) were evaluated. Patients were screened using CAM-ICU. RESULTS: We included 968 patients in the study. Incidence of delirium was 13.3%. In the group with POD, the majority of patients were men (87/129, 67.44%), and the mean age was 72 years. Preoperative WBC (8.21 +- 3.04 G/l vs. 7.55 +- 1.86 G/l, p = 0.029) were higher and mean platelet count was lower (217.7 +- 69.07 G/l vs. 227.44 +- 59.31 G/l, p = 0.031) in patients with POD. Lower pre-operative PLR values (109.87 +- 46.38 vs. 120.36 +- 52.98, p = 0.026) and PWR values (27.69 7.50 vs. 31.32 9.88 p < 0.001) were found in patients with POD. Association was strongest for PWR and remained significant at T1 (p < 0.001), T3 (p < 0.001) and T5 (p < 0.001). Basing on coefficients of logistic regression a model for optimal prediction of POD was calculated: CARDEL Index = 0.108 x Age + 0.341 x HBA1C - 0.049 x PWR with AUC of 0.742 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that lower pre-operative levels of PLR and PWR were associated with POD after cardiac surgery. Pre-operative PWR showed strongest correlation with POD and may be a potential new biomarker associated with postoperative delirium. CARDEL prognosis index composed of age, HbA1c and PWR is good at predicting development of delirium after CABG.
