37623212|t|Alzheimer's Disease beyond Calcium Dysregulation: The Complex Interplay between Calmodulin, Calmodulin-Binding Proteins and Amyloid Beta from Disease Onset through Progression.
37623212|a|A multifactorial syndrome, Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of dementia, but there is no existing therapy to prevent it or stop its progression. One of the earliest events of Alzheimer's disease is the disruption of calcium homeostasis but that is just a prelude to the disease's devastating impact. Calcium does not work alone but must interact with downstream cellular components of which the small regulatory protein calmodulin is central, if not primary. This review supports the idea that, due to calcium dyshomeostasis, calmodulin is a dominant regulatory protein that functions in all stages of Alzheimer's disease, and these regulatory events are impacted by amyloid beta. Amyloid beta not only binds to and regulates calmodulin but also multiple calmodulin-binding proteins involved in Alzheimer's. Together, they act on the regulation of calcium dyshomeostasis, neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, memory formation, neuronal plasticity and more. The complex interactions between calmodulin, its binding proteins and amyloid beta may explain why many therapies have failed or are doomed to failure unless they are considered.
