35327657|t|A Systematic Review of Common and Brain-Disease-Specific RNA Editing Alterations Providing Novel Insights into Neurological and Neurodegenerative Disease Manifestations.
35327657|a|RNA editing contributes to transcriptome diversification through RNA modifications in relation to genome-encoded information (RNA-DNA differences, RDDs). The deamination of Adenosine (A) to Inosine (I) or Cytidine (C) to Uridine (U) is the most common type of mammalian RNA editing. It occurs as a nuclear co- and/or post-transcriptional event catalyzed by ADARs (Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) and APOBECs (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like genes). RNA editing may modify the structure, stability, and processing of a transcript. This review focuses on RNA editing in psychiatric, neurological, neurodegenerative (NDs), and autoimmune brain disorders in humans and rodent models. We discuss targeted studies that focus on RNA editing in specific neuron-enriched transcripts with well-established functions in neuronal activity, and transcriptome-wide studies, enabled by recent technological advances. We provide comparative editome analyses between human disease and corresponding animal models. Data suggest RNA editing to be an emerging mechanism in disease development, displaying common and disease-specific patterns. Commonly edited RNAs represent potential disease-associated targets for therapeutic and diagnostic values. Currently available data are primarily descriptive, calling for additional research to expand global editing profiles and to provide disease mechanistic insights. The potential use of RNA editing events as disease biomarkers and available tools for RNA editing identification, classification, ranking, and functional characterization that are being developed will enable comprehensive analyses for a better understanding of disease(s) pathogenesis and potential cures.
