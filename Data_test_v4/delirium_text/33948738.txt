33948738|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing attention has been paid in recent decades to social determinants of health as a risk factor for disease development and disease severity. While traditionally heart disease, family history, lipid profile, and tobacco use have all been associated with increased risk of neurological disease, numerous studies now show that the influence of poverty may be just as strong a risk factor. This study summarizes the recent literature on poverty as it contributes to neurological disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Children growing up in poverty have increased risk for cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders as reported by Noble et al. (Dev Sci. 9(6):642-54, 2006) and Farah et al. (Brain Res. 1110(1):166-74, 2006) as well as worse outcomes when it comes to epilepsy management and disease course as discussed by Camfield et al. (Epilepsia. 57(11):1826-33, 2016). In adulthood, as the number of social determinants of health increases, the incidence of stroke and severe stroke increases significantly as reported by Reshetnyak et al. (Stroke. 51:2445-53, 2020) as does exposure to neurologically significant infectious diseases and incidence of dementia as reported by Sumilo et al. (Rev Med Virol. 18(2):81-95, 2008) and Zuelsdorff et al. (Alzheimer's Dement. 6(1):e12039, 2020). Social determinants of health including poverty should be considered a risk factor for disease. More attention is needed from clinicians as well as from a public health perspective to address this disparity.
