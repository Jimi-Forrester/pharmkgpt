38323249|t|Nurses' Knowledge and Subjective Strain in Delirium Care: Impact of a Web-based Instructional Module on Nurses Competence.
38323249|a|Background: Delirium, a prevalent condition among elderly individuals admitted to hospitals, particularly in intensive care settings, necessitates specialized medical intervention. The present study assessed the proficiency of nurses in the management of delirium and their subjective experience of stress while providing care for patients with delirium in emergency rooms and critical care units. Materials and methods: The study adopted a quantitative descriptive approach, utilizing standardized self-reporting measures that assessed the nurses' expertise and perceived burden of care. A cohort of 86 nurses from a tertiary care hospital in North India participated in the study. Additionally, the impact of the web-based instructional module in enhancing the nurses' knowledge in delirium management was assessed by one group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study. Findings: The research revealed that nurses exhibited significant deficiencies in their knowledge, particularly in relation to the symptoms and causes of delirium. The most significant source of subjective stress was attributed to hyperactive delirium-associated behaviors, characterized by uncooperative and aggressive conduct. The utilization of the web-based instructional program significantly enhanced the comprehension of nurses about the management of delirium. Conclusion: This study revealed a significant knowledge gap among nurses in delirium management and emphasizes the considerable subjective stress, particularly in dealing with hyperactive delirium-associated behaviors. The positive impact of the web-based instructional program underscores its potential as a valuable tool for enhancing nurses' knowledge and addressing these challenges in healthcare settings.
