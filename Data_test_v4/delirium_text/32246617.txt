32246617|a|In rodents, well characterized neurogenic niches of the adult brain, such as the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus, support the maintenance of neural/stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) and the production of new neurons throughout the lifespan. The adult neurogenic process is dependent on the intrinsic gene expression signatures of NSPCs that make them competent for self-renewal and neuronal differentiation. At the same time, it is receptive to regulation by various extracellular signals that allow the modulation of neuronal production and integration into brain circuitries by various physiological stimuli. A drawback of this plasticity is the sensitivity of adult neurogenesis to alterations of the niche environment that can occur due to aging, injury or disease. At the core of the molecular mechanisms regulating neurogenesis, several transcription factors have been identified that maintain NSPC identity and mediate NSPC response to extrinsic cues. Here, we focus on REST, Egr1 and Dbx2 and their roles in adult neurogenesis, especially in the subventricular zone. We review recent work from our and other laboratories implicating these transcription factors in the control of NSPC proliferation and differentiation and in the response of NSPCs to extrinsic influences from the niche. We also discuss how their altered regulation may affect the neurogenic process in the aged and in the diseased brain. Finally, we highlight key open questions that need to be addressed to foster our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms controlling adult neurogenesis.
