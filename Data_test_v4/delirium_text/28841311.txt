28841311|t|Peptidomimetics That Inhibit and Partially Reverse the Aggregation of Abeta1-42.
28841311|a|The peptide sequence KLVFF resembles the hydrophobic core of the Abeta peptide known to form amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Starting from its retro-inverso peptide, we have synthesized three generations of peptidomimetics. Step by step natural amino acids have been replaced by aromatic building blocks accessible from the Pd-catalyzed Catellani reaction. The final compound 18 is stable against proteolytic decay and largely prevents the aggregation of Abeta1-42 over extended periods of time. The activity of the new inhibitors was tested first by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. For closer examination of compound 18, additional techniques were also applied: laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy, thioflavin T fluorescence, and gel electrophoresis. Compound 18 not only retards the aggregation of chemically synthesized Abeta but also can partially dissolve the oligomeric structures. Thioflavin binding mature fibrils, however, seem to resist the inhibitor.
