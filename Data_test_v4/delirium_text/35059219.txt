35059219|t|Relationship between in-hospital mortality and abdominal angiography among patients with blunt liver injuries: a propensity score-matching from a nationwide trauma registry of Japan.
35059219|a|AIM: To assess relationships between abdominal angiography and outcomes in adults with blunt liver injuries. METHODS: A retrospective observational study carried out from January 2004 to December 2018. Adult blunt-trauma patients with AAST grade III-V were analyzed with in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome using propensity-score-(PS) matching to seek associations with abdominal angiography findings. RESULTS: A total of 1,821 patients were included, of which 854 had available abdominal angiography data (AA+) and 967 did not (AA-). From these, 562 patients were selected from each group by propensity score matching. In-hospital mortality was found to be lower in the AA+ than in the AA- group (15.1% [87/562] versus 25.4% [143/562]; odds ratio 0.544, 95% confidence interval 0.398-0.739). CONCLUSION: Abdominal angiography is shown to be of benefit for adult patients with blunt liver injury in terms of their lower in-hospital mortality.
