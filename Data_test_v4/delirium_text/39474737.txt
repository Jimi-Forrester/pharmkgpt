39474737|t|Amyloid-Beta, Tau, and Microglial Activation in Aged Felid Brains.
39474737|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its associated pathology have been primarily identified in humans, who have relatively large brains and long lifespans. To expand what is known about aging and neurodegeneration across mammalian species, we characterized amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau lesions in five species of aged felids (n = 9; cheetah, clouded leopard, African lion, serval, Siberian tiger). We performed immunohistochemistry to detect Abeta40 and Abeta42 in plaques and vessels and hyperphosphorylated tau in the temporal lobe gyrus sylvius and in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. We also quantified the densities and morphological types of microglia expressing IBA1. We found that diffuse Abeta42 plaques, but not dense-core plaques, were present more frequently in the temporal cortex and tended to be more common than Abeta40 plaques across species. Conversely, vascular Abeta was labeled more consistently with Abeta40 for each species on average. Although all individuals showed some degree of Abeta40 and/or Abeta42 immunoreactivity, only the cheetahs and clouded leopards exhibited intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau (i.e., pretangles), which was more common in the hippocampus. Reactive, intermediate microglia were significantly associated with total Abeta40 vessel area and pretangle load in the hippocampus. This study demonstrates the co-occurrence of Abeta and tau pathology in two felid species, cheetahs and clouded leopards. Overall, these results provide an initial view of the manifestation of Abeta and tau pathology in aged, large-brained felids, which can be compared with markers of neurodegeneration across different taxa, including domestic cats, nonhuman primates, and humans.
