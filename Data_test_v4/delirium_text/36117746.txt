36117746|t|Survey on Current Practice of Canadian Physicians Regarding the Investigation in Older Patients with Delirium.
36117746|a|Background: The current literature provides heterogeneous recommendation regarding the investigation of older delirious patients, which may lead to over-testing. Our study aims to describe Canadian physicians' current practice for the investigation of older patients with delirium. Our secondary objective is to define specific indications for performing a CT head scan in this population. Methods: Design: cross-sectional online survey. Participants: physicians who conduct their clinical practice in Canada and who care for older patients with delirium. Potential study participants were reached through Canadian associations: Canadian Geriatrics Society, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, the Association des Medecins d'Urgence du Quebec, and members of Choosing Wisely Canada. Results: We received 296 survey responses. More than 80% of respondents always order complete blood count, urea, and creatinine and electrolytes. Extended electrolytes, TSH, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, urinalysis and urinary culture tests tend to be ordered somewhat frequently. Physicians mostly agreed to order a head CT scan for loss of consciousness, altered mental status, fall, and anticoagulation. Conclusions: Physicians' investigations for older patients with delirium are highly variable, even with the lack of evidence supporting a broad workup. Also, respondents mostly align with current recommendations of indications for CT head scans.
