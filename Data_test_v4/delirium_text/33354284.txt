33354284|t|SPIKES-D: a proposal to adapt the SPIKES protocol to deliver the diagnosis of dementia.
33354284|a|Dementia is a life-threatening and stigmatizing condition, with devastating impacts on the patient's personal identity and caregivers. There are many barriers to an effective diagnosis disclosure of dementia, including fear of causing distress, uncertainty of diagnosis, caregivers' objection and lack of training in communication skills in undergraduate medical schools. Although some studies have been published on how to help physicians deliver an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, no specific protocol has been published yet. The SPIKES protocol is a didactic approach designed to deliver bad news related to cancer, but it has been used globally and in a variety of clinical settings, including the teaching of communication skills to medical students and residents. It is known, however, that the cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias may limit the understanding of the diagnosis' complexity; hence, a few adaptations of this model were made after reviewing the current literature on dementia diagnosis disclosure. The suggested SPIKES-D protocol seems to encompass current guidelines about the communication of the diagnosis of dementia, keeping its didactic approach on breaking bad news and helping fulfill the gaps in this topic.
