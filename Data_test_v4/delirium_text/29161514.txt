29161514|t|Discovery of an Orally Bioavailable Benzofuran Analogue That Serves as a beta-Amyloid Aggregation Inhibitor for the Potential Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
29161514|a|We developed an orally active and blood-brain-barrier-permeable benzofuran analogue (8, MDR-1339) with potent antiaggregation activity. Compound 8 restored cellular viability from Abeta-induced cytotoxicity but also improved the learning and memory function of AD model mice by reducing the Abeta aggregates in the brains. Given the high bioavailability and brain permeability demonstrated in our pharmacokinetic studies, 8 will provide a novel scaffold for an Abeta-aggregation inhibitor that may offer an alternative treatment for AD.
