39700074|t|Comorbidity Among Adults With Epilepsy - United States, 2021-2022.
39700074|a|While it is known that epilepsy often co-occurs with psychiatric disorders, few studies have examined nonpsychiatric comorbidity. We analyzed 2021 and 2022 National Health Interview Survey Sample Adult data. Compared with adults with no epilepsy, the 1.2% of US adults (about 3.0 million) with active epilepsy had a higher prevalence of nearly all 21 conditions examined and were more likely to have 4 or more co-occurring chronic conditions. Health care and social service providers can promote healthy behaviors and preventive screening for common comorbidities, improve access to care, and refer people with epilepsy to evidence-based self-management programs.
