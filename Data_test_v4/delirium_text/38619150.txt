38619150|t|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction: Review of pathophysiology, diagnostics and preventive strategies.
38619150|a|Postoperative cognitive impairment is a common disorder after major surgery. Advances in medicine and treatment have resulted in an increasingly ageing population undergoing major surgical procedures. Since age is the most important risk factor for postoperative cognitive decline, it is not surprising that impairment of cognitive functions after surgery was recorded in almost a third of elderly patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is part of the spectrum of postoperative cognitive impairment and researchers often confuse it with postoperative delirium and delayed neurocognitive recovery. This is the cause of great differences in the results of research that is focused on the incidence and possible prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In this review, we focused on current recommendations for a uniform nomenclature of postoperative cognitive impairment and diagnosis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, the presumed pathophysiology of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and recommendations for its treatment and possible prevention strategies.
