15038935|a|The early detection and prevention of postoperative delirium and confusion has become an important issue in surgical ward management. With the aim of determining an objective technique for early detection of delirium, 64 patients admitted to a surgical ward before surgery were examined using the NEECHAM confusion scale. On the 2nd postoperative day they were tested again and divided into 3 groups on the basis of their NEECHAM scores: high risk, low risk, and no risk, for confusion. The trends of the NEECHAM scores in the 3 groups were compared, and the relationship between the NEECHAM scores and suspected clinical risk factors for delirium was investigated. Use of NEECHAM scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the NEECHAM confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward.
