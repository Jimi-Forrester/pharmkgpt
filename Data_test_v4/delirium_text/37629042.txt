37629042|t|The Roles of Periodontal Bacteria in Atherosclerosis.
37629042|a|Atherosclerosis (AS) is an inflammatory vascular disease that constitutes a major underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and stroke. Infection is a contributing risk factor for AS. Epidemiological evidence has implicated individuals afflicted by periodontitis displaying an increased susceptibility to AS and CVD. This review concisely outlines several prevalent periodontal pathogens identified within atherosclerotic plaques, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. We review the existing epidemiological evidence elucidating the association between these pathogens and AS-related diseases, and the diverse mechanisms for which these pathogens may engage in AS, such as endothelial barrier disruption, immune system activation, facilitation of monocyte adhesion and aggregation, and promotion of foam cell formation, all of which contribute to the progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. Notably, the intricate interplay among bacteria underscores the complex impact of periodontitis on AS. In conclusion, advancing our understanding of the relationship between periodontal pathogens and AS will undoubtedly offer invaluable insights and potential therapeutic avenues for the prevention and management of AS.
