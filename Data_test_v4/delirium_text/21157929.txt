21157929|t|123I-NKJ64: a novel single photon emission computed tomography radiotracer for imaging the noradrenaline transporter in brain.
21157929|a|Dysregulation of noradrenergic function has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including depression and Alzheimer's disease. The noradrenaline transporter (NAT) is a major target for antidepressant drugs, including reboxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. Therefore, the development of a radiotracer for imaging of the NAT is desirable. In this study, NKJ64, a novel iodinated analog of reboxetine, was radiolabeled and evaluated as a potential single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) radiotracer for imaging the NAT in brain. Biological evaluation of the novel radiotracer, 123/125I-NKJ64, was carried out in rats using: in vitro ligand binding assays; in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography; in vivo biodistribution studies and ex vivo pharmacological blocking studies. 125I-NKJ64 displayed saturable binding with high affinity for NAT in cortical homogenates (K(D) = 4.82 +- 0.87 nM, mean +- SEM, n = 3). In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography showed the regional distribution of 123I-NKJ64 binding to be consistent with the known density of NAT in brain. Following i.v. injection there was rapid uptake of 123I-NKJ64 in brain, with maximum uptake of 2.93% +- 0.14% (mean +- SEM, n = 3) of the injected dose. The specific to nonspecific ratio (locus coeruleus:caudate putamen) of 123I-NKJ64 uptake measured by ex vivo autoradiography was 2.8 at 30 min post i.v. injection. The prior administration of reboxetine significantly reduced the accumulation of 123I-NKJ64 in the locus coeruleus (>50% blocking). The data indicate that further evaluation of 123I-NKJ64 in nonhuman primates is warranted in order to determine its utility as a SPECT radiotracer for imaging of NAT in brain.
