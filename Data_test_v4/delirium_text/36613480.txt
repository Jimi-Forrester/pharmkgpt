36613480|t|Emerging Role of MicroRNA-30c in Neurological Disorders.
36613480|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of target genes by interacting with 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational repression. The miR-30 family members are involved in the development of many tissues and organs and participate in the pathogenesis of human diseases. As a key member of the miR-30 family, miR-30c has been implicated in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Mechanistically, miR-30c may act as a multi-functional regulator of different pathogenic processes such as autophagy, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, oxidative stress, thrombosis, and neurovascular function, thereby contributing to different disease states. Here, we review and discuss the biogenesis, gene regulation, and the role and mechanisms of action of miR-30c in several neurological disorders and therapeutic potential in clinics.
