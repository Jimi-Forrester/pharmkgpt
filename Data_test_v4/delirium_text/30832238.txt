30832238|t|The Effectiveness of Exercise on Cognitive Performance in Individuals with Known Vascular Disease: A Systematic Review.
30832238|a|Patients with known vascular disease are at increased risk for cognitive impairments. Exercise has been shown to improve cognition in healthy elderly populations and those with mild cognitive impairments. We explored the literature to understand exercise as a modality to improve cognition in those with vascular disease, focusing on dose-responses. A systematic review was conducted through 2017 using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, Ovid Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE databases. Eligible studies examined effects of exercise on memory and cognition in cardiovascular (CVD) or cerebrovascular disease (CBVD). Data extracted included group characteristics, exercise dosage and outcomes measures employed. Twenty-two studies (12 CVD, 10 CBVD) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included aerobic, resistance, or mixed training, with neuropsychological test batteries assessing cognition. In CVD populations, five studies demonstrated improved cardiovascular fitness and cognition with aerobic training, and another seven studies suggested a dose-response. In CBVD trials, four studies reported improved cognition, with no effects observed in the fifth study. Another study found enhanced cognition with resistance training and four demonstrated a positive association between functional capacity and cognition following combined aerobic and resistance training. Exercise is able to positively affect cognitive performance in those with known vascular disease. There is evidence to suggest a dose-response relationship. Further research is required to optimize prescription.
