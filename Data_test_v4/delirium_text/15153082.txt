15153082|t|Do statins slow down Alzheimer's disease? A review.
15153082|a|More than 4 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States. The prevalence increases with age as the rate is 3% in those between 65 and 74 years compared with 47% among those over 85 years of age. Some epidemiological studies have reported a decrease in the incidence of AD with the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). Other studies have shown statins to decrease Abeta peptides, but data regarding cognitive benefits is lacking in this patient population. There are also concerns that statins, which cross the blood-brain barrier may cause more side-effects, but more information is needed. Adverse events were either infrequently noted or not reported in most of the published studies, and at this time there is insufficient evidence to suggest the use of statins for cognitive improvements in patients with AD.
