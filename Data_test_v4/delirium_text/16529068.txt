16529068|a|Dementia--this is a clear reduction of obtained mental level fitness which make difficult to function independently in normal conditions of life. It is assumed that 50% of dementia makes up Alzheimer's disease (AS), 17% is cerebrovascular dementia and 18% is so called mixed type. The degree of patient's dementia intensifications depends on the intellectual level and mental activity. The neurophysiological examinations which were tried to use for diagnosis are: brain bioelectrical activity, transcranial Doppler sonography, evoked potentials, cerebral refraction time. It was tried to estimate above mentioned neurophysiological methods from the point of view of their avalibility, simplicity of examination, repetition and usefulness in distinguishing states of dementia.
