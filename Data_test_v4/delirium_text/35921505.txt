35921505|t|Timely Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease.
35921505|a|Diagnosing early-stage Alzheimer disease can lead to prompt initiation of treatment and slow down symptom progression. However, clinicians are not providing a diagnosis to over half of individuals who meet criteria for dementia. Tests for biomarkers, new symptomatic treatments and disease-modifying agents, and the addition of the preclinical stage to the diagnostic criteria for AD can aid in earlier disease recognition and developing treatment plans. Communicating diagnosis and information on next steps with patients and caregivers can lead to patient and caregiver involvement in decision-making and planning as well as participation in clinical trials and maximizing benefits and lifestyle interventions.
