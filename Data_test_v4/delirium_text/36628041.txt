36628041|t|Wernicke's Encephalopathy Presenting With Confusion in a Patient With Schizophrenia.
36628041|a|Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neuropsychiatric condition caused by thiamine deficiency often associated with alcoholism. Other less common causes include prolonged gastroenterology problems or dietary insufficiencies associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, bariatric surgery, and eating disorders. Prolonged WE without proper treatment can lead to the chronic and irreversible condition, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Despite being known for its classic triad of clinical symptoms (nystagmus/ophthalmoplegia, gait ataxia, and confusion), WE patients more commonly present with non-specific symptoms of altered mental status. Obscure clinical presentations often led to delays in the appropriate of patients with WE. We are presenting a case of WE that is unusual because the underlying cause is schizophrenia and the lack of alcohol use. For a punctual diagnosis, a high index of suspicion is essential to prevent further exacerbation of neuronal death seen in WE. IV thiamine should be administered to any patient with acute encephalopathy or altered mental status, given its low cost and lack of side effects.
