38389776|t|Identification of early delirium and its outcomes after cardiopulmonary bypass among adult patients with cardiovascular disease: a prospective observational study.
38389776|a|Purpose: To identify the incidence and outcomes of postoperative delirium after cardiopulmonary bypass machine in adult cardiac surgery patients. Method: A prospective observational study was conducted in a single-center institution in the Republic of China. This study included 273 patients who underwent cardiac surgical procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass machine utilization. Results: This study used the Confusion Assessment Method to screen for delirium. Univariate analysis identified advanced age, emergency surgery and prolonged aortic cross-clamping time as significant predisposing factors for delirium, which occurred in 19.8% (n = 54) of cases and typically developed in average of 4.8 +- 3.28 days after the surgery. The analysis also identified that delirium was associated with increased complications and external referrals. A total of 142 patients (52.1%) were discharged to their homes, wherein the discharge rate in the delirium group was notably lower, with only 35.2% (n = 19) of patients, than in the delirium-free group with 56.2% (n = 123) of patients. Conclusion: Considering the increased probability of delirium-related complications following cardiac surgery, it is important to develop effective preventive strategies for patients with perioperative risk factors, such as advanced age, emergency surgery and prolonged cross-clamp time, by implementing practical measures to minimize the risk of delirium.
