38562724|a|Background: Quantitative transport mapping (QTM) of blood velocity, based on the transport equation has been demonstrated higher accuracy and sensitivity of perfusion quantification than the traditional Kety's method-based blood flow (Kety flow). This study aimed to investigate the associations between QTM velocity and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using multiple post-labeling delay arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Methods: A total of 128 subjects (21 normal controls (NC), 80 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 27 AD) were recruited prospectively. All participants underwent MRI examination and neuropsychological evaluation. QTM velocity and traditional Kety flow maps were computed from multiple delay ASL. Regional quantitative perfusion measurements were performed and compared to study group differences. We tested the hypothesis that cognition declines with reduced cerebral blood flow with consideration of age and gender effects. Results: In cortical gray matter (GM) and the hippocampus, QTM velocity and Kety flow showed decreased values in AD group compared to NC and MCI groups; QTM velocity, but not Kety flow, showed a significant difference between MCI and NC groups. QTM velocity and Kety flow showed values decreasing with age; QTM velocity, but not Kety flow, showed a significant gender difference between male and female. QTM velocity and Kety flow in the hippocampus were positively correlated with cognition, including global cognition, memory, executive function, and language function. Conclusion: This study demonstrated an increased sensitivity of QTM velocity as compared with the traditional Kety flow. Specifically, we observed only in QTM velocity, reduced perfusion velocity in GM and the hippocampus in MCI compared with NC. Both QTM velocity and Kety flow demonstrated reduction in AD vs controls. Decreased QTM velocity and Kety flow in the hippocampus were correlated with cognitive measures. These findings suggest QTM velocity as an improved biomarker for early AD blood flow alterations.
