21029250|t|Serum ghrelin is inversely associated with cognitive function in a sample of non-demented elderly.
21029250|a|AIM: The orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, is linked to learning and memory in animal studies. No previous study has investigated whether cognition is related to ghrelin in the non-demented elderly. METHODS: Thirty-five older adults underwent neuropsychological testing and fasting blood draw with subsequent serum ghrelin quantification. RESULTS: Ghrelin was negatively correlated with several cognitive domains, including verbal memory, working memory, and naming. CONCLUSION: Areas of cognition associated with ghrelin level were similar to the pattern of deficits observed in early Alzheimer's disease. Findings suggest a potential moderational role of ghrelin in pathological cognitive decline. Further work investigating mechanisms is needed.
