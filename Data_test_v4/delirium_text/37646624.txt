37646624|a|The apolipoprotein E e4 allele (APOE4) is universally acknowledged as the most potent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 promotes the initiation and progression of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms are unclearly understood, differences in lipid-bound affinity among the three APOE isoforms may constitute the basis. The protein APOE4 isoform has a high affinity with triglycerides and cholesterol. A distinction in lipid metabolism extensively impacts neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. APOE4 carriers exhibit phenotypic differences from non-carriers in clinical examinations and respond differently to multiple treatments. Therefore, we hypothesized that phenotypic classification of AD patients according to the status of APOE4 carrier will help specify research and promote its use in diagnosing and treating AD. Recent reviews have mainly evaluated the differences between APOE4 allele carriers and non-carriers from gene to protein structures, clinical features, neuroimaging, pathology, the neural network, and the response to various treatments, and have provided the feasibility of phenotypic group classification based on APOE4 carrier status. This review will facilitate the application of APOE phenomics concept in clinical practice and promote further medical research on AD.
