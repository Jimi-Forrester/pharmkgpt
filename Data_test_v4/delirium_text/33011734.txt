33011734|t|The Potential Role of Lung-Protective Ventilation in Preventing Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Prone Spinal Surgery: A Preliminary Study.
33011734|a|BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication in elderly patients, usually occurring within a few days after surgery. This study investigated the effect of lung-protective ventilation (LPV) on POD in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery and the mechanism by which LPV suppresses POD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-one patients aged >=65 years were randomized to receive LPV or conventional mechanical ventilation (MV), consisting of intermittent positive pressure ventilation following induction of anesthesia. The tidal volume in patients who received MV was 8 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW), and the ventilation frequency was 12 times/min. The tidal volume in patients who received LPV was 6 ml/kg PBW, the positive end-expiratory pressure was 5 cmH2O, and the ventilation frequency was 15 times/min, with a lung recruitment maneuver performed every 30 min. Blood samples were collected immediately before anesthesia induction (T0), 10 min (T1) and 60 min (T2) after turning over, immediately after the operation (T3), and 15 min after extubation (T4) for blood gas analysis. Simultaneous cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and cerebral desaturation were recorded. Preoperative and postoperative serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured by ELISA. POD was assessed by nursing delirium screening score. RESULTS Compared with the MV group, pH was lower and PaCO2 higher in the LPV group at T2. In addition PaO2, SaO2, and PaO2/FiO2 were higher at T1, and T4, and rSO2 was higher at T3, and T4 in the LPV than in the MV group (P<0.05 each). Postoperative serum GFAP and IL-6 were lower and IL-10 higher in the LPV group. The incidences of cerebral desaturation and POD were significantly lower in the LPV group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS LPV may reduce POD in elderly patients undergoing spinal surgery by inhibiting inflammation and improving cerebral oxygen metabolism.
