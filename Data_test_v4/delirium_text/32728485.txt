The focus of the statements included in this article is toward PAC providers located in nursing facilities. Contributions were integrated in a single document that underwent several reviews by each author and then underwent a final review by the lead and senior authors. After this process was completed, the document was appraised by reviewers from IGFS. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: A total of 15 statements were crafted. These statements summarize the best available evidence and is intended to help PAC facilities managing older adults with hip fractures more efficiently, aiming toward overall better outcomes in the areas of function, quality of life, and with less complications that could interfere with their optimal recovery.
