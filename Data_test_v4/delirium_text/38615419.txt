38615419|t|A novel di-functional fluorescent probe for ONOO- and Zn2+ imaging in cells.
38615419|a|Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is one of the most significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells. Zn2+ in living cells plays an essential part in different physiological processes. The abnormal concentration of ONOO- and Zn2+ in living cells are related to many kinds of diseases, such as anemia, epilepsy, diarrhea, Alzheimer's disease, and so on. The relationship of ONOO- and Zn2+ in living cells when the relative disease occurs remains unknown. So we develop the first probe H-1 for detecting ONOO- and Zn2+ at the same time. The probe H-1 shows high selectivity, good anti-interference capability, low detection limit and short response time to ONOO- and Zn2+. When the probe was applied to detect ONOO- and Zn2+ in HeLa cells, we could observe the fluorescence changing in the green and blue channels separately without interference in real time. It has the potential to employ the relation of ONOO- and Zn2+ in some disease mechanism research.
