38867110|t|Sex-Specific Entorhinal Cortex Functional Connectivity in Cognitively Normal Older Adults with Amyloid-beta Pathology.
38867110|a|Sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype have been shown to influence the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the impact of these factors on the functional connectivity of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) in clinically unpaired older adults (CUOA) with amyloid-beta (Abeta +) pathology remains unclear. A total of 1022 cognitively normal older adults with Abeta + (603 females and 586 APOE epsilon4 +) from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study were included in this study. The 2 x 2 (gender, 2 APOE genotypes) analysis of covariance was performed to compare the demographic information, cognitive performance, and volumetric MRI data among these groups. Voxel-wise comparisons of bilateral ERC functional connectivity (FC) were conducted, and partial correlation analyses were used to explore the associations between cognitive performance and ERC-FC strength. We found that the APOE genotype influenced ERC functional connectivity mainly in the sensorimotor network (SMN). Males exhibited higher ERC-FC in the salience network (SN), while females displayed higher ERC-FC in the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and reward network. The interplay of sex and APOE genotype on ERC-FC was observed in the SMN and cerebellar lobe. The ERC-FC was associated with executive function and memory performance in individuals with CUOA-Abeta + . Our findings provide evidence of sex-specific ERC functional connectivity compensation mechanism in cognitively normal older adults with Abeta + pathology. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the early stages of AD and may help develop personalized interventions in preclinical AD.
