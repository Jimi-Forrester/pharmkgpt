38933078|t|Expressive amusia and aphasia: the story of Maurice Ravel.
38933078|a|The French composer, Maurice Ravel, at the peak of his career, showed signs of a progressive disorder that affected his ability to function with verbal and musical language, as noted by the neurologist Theophile Alajouanine. The worsening of the disease led to a craniotomy, performed in 1937, which failed to reveal the cause of his illness, and he died shortly thereafter. A lack of post-mortem neuropathological evidence precluded a definitive diagnosis of the illness, which remained enigmatic. Speculations about the precise diagnosis of Ravel's neurological disease have been largely based on Alajouanine's observations, which included aphasia and amusia, mostly expressive, and ideomotor apraxia, while musical judgement, taste, and memory remained relatively intact, implying different neuroanatomical substrates. A possible subform of frontotemporal lobar degeneration complex was the diagnostic suggestion of many authors. His untimely death deprived the world of this remarkable musician, and the music that remained trapped in his mind.
