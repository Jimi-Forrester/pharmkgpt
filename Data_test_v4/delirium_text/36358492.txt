36358492|t|Vitamin D3 and Ischemic Stroke: A Narrative Review.
36358492|a|Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of death and permanent disability worldwide. The only efficient treatment to date is anticoagulant therapy and thrombectomy, which enable restitution of blood flow to ischemic tissues. Numerous promising neuroprotectants have failed in clinical trials. Given the complex pathomechanism of stroke, a multitarget pharmacotherapy seems a more rational approach in stroke prevention and treatment than drugs acting on single molecular targets. Recently, vitamin D3 has emerged as a potential treatment adjunct for ischemic stroke, as it interferes with the key prosurvival pathways and shows neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, regenerative and anti-aging properties in both neuronal and vascular tissue. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of vitamin D3 on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and neuroplasticity may play a role not only in the recovery of neurological functions, but also in ameliorating post-stroke depression and anxiety. This narrative review presents advances in research on the biochemical mechanisms of stroke-related brain damage, and the genomic and non-genomic effects of vitamin D3 which may interfere with diverse cell death signaling pathways. Next, we discuss the results of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on the neuroprotective potential of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in brain ischemia models. Finally, the outcomes of clinical trials on vitamin D3 efficiency in ischemic stroke patients are briefly reviewed. Despite the mixed results of the clinical trials, it appears that vitamin D3 still holds promise in preventing or ameliorating neurological and psychiatric consequences of ischemic stroke and certainly deserves further study.
