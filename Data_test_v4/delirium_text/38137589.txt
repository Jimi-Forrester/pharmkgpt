38137589|t|Risk Factors for Spinal Cord Injury during Endovascular Repair of Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm: Review of the Literature and Proposal of a Prognostic Score.
38137589|a|Despite recent improvements, spinal cord ischemia remains the most feared and dramatic complication following extensive aortic repair. Although endovascular procedures are associated with a lower risk compared with open procedures, this risk is still significant and must be considered. A combined medical and surgical approach may help to optimize the tolerance of the spinal cord to ischemia. The aim of this review is to describe the underlying mechanism involved in spinal cord injury during extensive endovascular aortic repair, to describe the different techniques used to improve spinal cord tolerance to ischemia-including the prophylactic or curative use of spinal drainage-and to propose our algorithm for spinal cord protection and the rational use of spinal drainage.
