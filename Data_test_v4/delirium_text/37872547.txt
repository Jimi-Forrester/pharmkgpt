37872547|a|BACKGROUND: To retrospectively analyse postoperative adverse events in oldest-old patients (aged 90 years and older) with intertrochanteric fractures treated under various anaesthetic techniques. METHODS: A total of 153 consecutive patients participated in this study, of which 127 patients who underwent surgery with neuraxial anaesthesia or general anaesthesia for intertrochanteric fractures between October 2019 and October 2022 were eligible and evaluated. They were divided into the neuraxial anaesthesia and general anaesthesia groups. The demographic characteristics and postoperative adverse events were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (10.24%), including 6 in the neuraxial anaesthesia group (8.22%) and 7 in the general anaesthesia group (12.96%), died within 30 days after surgery. No significant differences between the two groups were observed. Postoperative delirium occurred in 40 patients (31.49%), including 17 (23.29%) in the neuraxial anaesthesia group and 23 (42.59%) in the general anaesthesia group; there was a significant difference between the two groups [P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) = 0.41]. The other postoperative adverse events, including heart failure, acute stroke, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary disease, anaemia, deep vein thrombosis, hypoproteinaemia, and electrolyte disorders, were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that different anaesthesia methods do not affect the incidence of adverse events, such as death within 30 days after surgery in oldest-old patients with intertrochanteric fractures. However, more patients developed delirium after surgery in the general anaesthesia group (23, 42.59%) than in the neuraxial anaesthesia group (17, 23.29%); this may indicate that spinal anaesthesia reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium (P = 0.02, OR = 0.41). TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered.
