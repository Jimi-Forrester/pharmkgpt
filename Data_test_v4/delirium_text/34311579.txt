34311579|a|Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) is a leading cause of central nervous system (CNS) infection-related mortality worldwide, with surviving patients often developing neurological deficiencies. While CNS inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CM, little is known about the relative contribution of the specific inflammatory/immune pathways to CNS pathology versus fungal clearance. Increased cerebrospinal fluid level of C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) ligand CCL2 is associated with disease deterioration in patients with CM. Using a murine model, we investigated the role of the CCR2 pathway in the development of CNS inflammation and pathology during CM. We found that CCR2-deficient mice exhibited improved 28-day survival and alleviated neurological disease scores despite a brain fungal burden higher than that of the WT mice. Reduced CM pathology in CCR2-deficient mice was accompanied by markedly decreased neuronal cell death around cryptococcal microcysts and restored expression of genes involved in neurotransmission, connectivity, and neuronal cell structure in the brains. Results show that CCR2 axis is the major pathway recruiting CD45hiCD11b+Ly6C+ inflammatory monocyte to the brain and indirectly modulates the accumulation of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. In particular, CCR2 axis promotes recruitment of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing CD4+ T cells and classical activation of myeloid cells. In this context, CCR2 deletion limits the immune network dysregulation we see in CM and attenuates neuropathology. Thus, the CCR2 axis is a potential target for interventions aimed to limit inflammatory CNS pathology in CM patients. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) causes nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide each year, and survivors frequently develop long-lasting neurological sequelae. The high rate of mortality and neurologic sequelae in CM patients indicate that antifungal therapies alone are often insufficient to control disease progression. Here, we reveal that CM disease progression in mice is accompanied by inflammatory monocytes infiltration at the periphery of the infected foci that overlap locally perturbed neuronal function and death. Importantly, we identified that CCR2 signaling is a critical pathway driving neuroinflammation, especially inflammatory monocyte recruitment, as well as CNS pathology and mortality in CM mice. Our results imply that targeting the CCR2 pathway may be beneficial as a therapy complementary to antifungal drug treatment, helping to reduce CNS damage and mortality in CM patients.
