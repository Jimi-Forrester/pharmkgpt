39685859|t|The Association Between Delirium Upon Admission to a Rehabilitation Hospital and Motor Rehabilitation Outcomes Among Hip Fracture Surgery Patients: A Historical Cohort Study.
39685859|a|Background: Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by the acute and fluctuating impairment of cognition, attention, and consciousness, which is prevalent in older adults following surgical procedures. Despite the recognized impact of delirium on recovery, its specific effects on motor rehabilitation outcomes in the geriatric population remain underexplored. This historical cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between the presence of delirium upon admission to a rehabilitation hospital and the motor functional gain at discharge among older patients following hip fracture surgery. Methods: The collected data included socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medications, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Motor rehabilitation outcomes were assessed using Motor Absolute Functional Gain (mAFG), the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (mMRFS), and Rehabilitation Efficiency (mRE). Results: Of the 143 hip fracture patients admitted for rehabilitation, 38 (26.6%) were diagnosed with delirium. Patients with delirium had lower MMSE scores (18.1 +- 5.8 vs. 22.4 +- 6.0, p < 0.001), higher benzodiazepine prescription rates (50.0% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001), and longer lengths of stay in acute care and rehabilitation (42.7 +- 10.4 vs. 37.3 +- 11.2 days, p = 0.01). Despite significant improvements in the FIM scores for both groups (p < 0.001), patients with delirium had lower mAFG (11.87 +- 7.26 vs. 15.91 +- 8.73, p = 0.01), mMRFS (0.22 +- 0.14 vs. 0.31 +- 0.15, p = 0.001), and mRE (0.28 +- 0.17 vs. 0.44 +- 0.25, p < 0.001). However, the multivariate regression models showed no association between delirium and functional improvement after adjusting for confounders. Conclusions: While both patients with and without delirium showed improvement in their motor functions by the time they were discharged from a rehabilitation hospital, patients with delirium showed lower absolute and relative improvements. Tailored programs addressing the special needs of patients with delirium after hip fracture surgery may enhance outcomes for this vulnerable population. A specialized, multidisciplinary approach tailored to the patient's cognitive status and overall condition is key to maximizing the recovery of older hip fracture patients with delirium.
