23934553|a|Isoflurane anesthesia can cause post-operative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. As an isomer of isoflurane, enflurane may also account for cognitive dysfunction. However, the mechanism of enflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effects of enflurane anesthesia on cognitive function and the possible roles of beta-amyloid protein and phosphorylated tau protein in response to enflurane anesthesia in aged rats. After intraperitoneal injection of enflurane, the Morris water maze and the step-down passive avoidance tests were conducted to test the cognitive ability and memory. The enflurane group showed prolonged escape latency, extended space exploration time and increased number of errors at early stage after enflurane anesthesia, suggesting that enflurane should be responsible for the impairment of cognition in aged rats. In addition, we analyzed the expression level of beta-amyloid and phosphorylation level of tau in the hippocampus by immunoblotting. Interestingly, the levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus increased significantly at early stage and then restored to pre-anesthetic levels. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing of beta-amyloid and phosphorylation of tau are important to cause cognitive decline in aged rats during initial stage after enflurane anesthesia.
