9204657|t|Severe opioid toxicity and somatization of psychosocial distress in a cancer patient with a background of chemical dependence.
9204657|a|A case of severe opioid toxicity is described in a 52-year-old cancer patient. The patient presented with classical clinical features of central hyperexcitability associated with opioid toxicity: delirium, myoclonus, hallucinations, hyperalgesia, and a possible seizure. This patient had a background of severe psychosocial distress and somatization in addition to a history of benzodiazepine dependence and alcohol abuse. The occurrence of opioid toxicity in this patient highlights the risks of a unidimensional approach to cancer pain, which ignores the non-organic components of pain, such as psychosocial distress, which will not respond to escalating doses of opioid medication.
