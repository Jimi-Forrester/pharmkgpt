36555133|t|Neural Regeneration in Regenerative Endodontic Treatment: An Overview and Current Trends.
36555133|a|Pulpal and periapical diseases are the most common dental diseases. The traditional treatment is root canal therapy, which achieves satisfactory therapeutic outcomes-especially for mature permanent teeth. Apexification, pulpotomy, and pulp revascularization are common techniques used for immature permanent teeth to accelerate the development of the root. However, there are obstacles to achieving functional pulp regeneration. Recently, two methods have been proposed based on tissue engineering: stem cell transplantation, and cell homing. One of the goals of functional pulp regeneration is to achieve innervation. Nerves play a vital role in dentin formation, nutrition, sensation, and defense in the pulp. Successful neural regeneration faces tough challenges in both animal studies and clinical trials. Investigation of the regeneration and repair of the nerves in the pulp has become a serious undertaking. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the key stem cells, signaling molecules, and biomaterials that could promote neural regeneration as part of pulp regeneration. We also discuss the challenges in preclinical or clinical neural regeneration applications to guide deep research in the future.
