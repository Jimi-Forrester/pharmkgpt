29992050|t|Neuroprotective Effect of ZnT3 Knockout on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.
29992050|a|BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is poorly understood. The present study evaluates the influence of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) knockout and the depletion of vesicular zinc on EBI. METHODOLOGY: SAH was induced in ZnT3 KO mice by internal carotid artery perforation. The changes in behavior were recorded at 24 hours after SAH. Hematoxylin-eosin, Nissl and TUNEL staining were performed to evaluate neuronal apoptosis. Data from mice with a score of 8-12 in intracerebral bleeding (i.e. moderate SAH), were analyzed. RESULTS: The degree of SAH-induced neuronal injury was directly correlated to the amount of blood lost, which in turn was negatively reflected in their behavior. The Wild Type (WT)-SAH group behaved poorly when compared to the knockout (KO)-SAH mice and their poor neurological score was accompanied by an increase in the number of apoptotic neurons. Conversely, the improvement of behavior in the KO-SAH group was associated with a marked reduction in apoptotic neurons. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ZnT3 knockout may have played a vital role in the attenuation of neuronal injury after SAH and that ZnT3 may prove to be a potential therapeutic target for neuroprotection in EBI.
