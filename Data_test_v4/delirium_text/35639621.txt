35639621|a|BACKGROUND: Delayed return to gut function and prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) delay recovery after colorectal surgery. Prucalopride is a selective serotonin-4-receptor agonist that may improve gut motility. METHODS: This was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled randomized trial of 2 mg prucalopride versus placebo in patients undergoing elective colorectal resection. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and planned ileostomy formation were excluded, but colostomy formation was allowed. The study medication was given 2 h before surgery and daily for up to 6 days after operation. The aim was to determine whether prucalopride improved return of gut function and reduced the incidence of PPOI. The primary endpoint was time to passage of stool and tolerance of diet (GI-2). Participants were allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio, in blocks of 10. Randomization was computer-generated. All study personnel, medical staff, and patients were blinded. RESULTS: This study was completed between October 2017 and May 2020 at two tertiary hospitals in New Zealand. A total of 148 patients were randomized, 74 per arm. Demographic data were similar in the two groups. There was no difference in median time to GI-2 between prucalopride and placebo groups: 3.5 (i.q.r. 2-5) versus 4 (3-5) days respectively (P = 0.124). Prucalopride improved the median time to passage of stool (3 versus 4 days; P = 0.027) but not time to tolerance of diet (2 versus 2 days; P = 0.669) or median duration of hospital stay (4 versus 4 days; P = 0.929). In patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery (125, 84.5 per cent), prucalopride improved median time to GI-2: 3 (2-4) days versus 4 (3-5) days for placebo (P = 0.012). The rate of PPOI, complications, and adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Prucalopride did not improve time to overall recovery of gut function after elective colorectal surgery.
