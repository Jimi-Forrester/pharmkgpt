34484732|a|INTRODUCTION: Emergence agitation is a common problem that can occur after administration of general anesthesia and during recovery time especially in pediatric patients, which can result in life-threatening events if not managed adequately and timely. Usage of modern inhalational anesthetic agents like sevoflurane, isoflurane, and also halothane is a common cause for emergence agitation. Currently, the use of propofol is gaining acceptance largely on decreasing emergence agitation in addition to prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of prophylaxis administration of propofol on incidence & severity of emergence agitation on pediatric patients undergo ENT & ophthalmic surgery under general anesthesia. METHODS AND MATERIAL: An institutional-based prospective cohort study was conducted on 90 patients. Patients who take 1 mg/kg of propofol were grouped into exposed while if propofol were not given grouped to non-exposed. Data were collected through intraoperative observation & by using WATCH & PAED score the patients were observed at 5, 15 & 30 min in the recovery room. Incidence of emergence agitation was analyzed by chi-square test & Mann Whitney U test was applied for the severity of emergence agitation. A P-value less than 0.05 was declared as statistically significant. RESULT: From a total of 90 study participants 64% of the non-exposed group & 31% of the exposed group were developed emergence agitation which was statistically significant with p = 0.002. The severity of agitation was also higher in the non-exposed group than the exposed group at 5, 15 & 30 min with p = 0.009, 0.013, and 0.011 respectively. CONCLUSION: Administering 1 mg/kg propofol before the end of surgery in pediatrics ENT & ophthalmic procedure under general anesthesia is effective in reducing incidence & severity of emergence agitation. Based on our findings we recommend using 1 mg/kg propofol at the end of surgery to reduce the occurrence of emergency agitation.
