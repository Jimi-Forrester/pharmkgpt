9539411|t|Brain volumes and regional cerebral blood flow in carriers of the Swedish Alzheimer amyloid protein mutation.
9539411|a|As a preliminary part of a longitudinal clinical study of carriers of the Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) 670/671 mutation, 13 members of a family were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain volumetry and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements. Five of the family members were mutation carriers; eight were not carriers. Two carriers were younger than 40 years of age and had no evidence of cognitive dysfunction or structural or functional brain changes. One carrier with 4 years to expected disease onset showed poor performance in episodic memory tests and also slightly low temporal lobe CBF, although there were no clearly abnormal findings. One carrier with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) had no clear structural brain changes, although CBF measurements showed clear reduction of temporal lobe CBF. One carrier with severe AD had both temporal lobe atrophy and CBF reduction. This indicates that in carriers of the APP 670/671 mutation, reduction of regional CBF is more severe than regional atrophy. The clearest change related to development of clinical AD was a reduction of CBF in the basal and lateral temporal lobes. Further longitudinal studies of these subjects are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, which might provide important data regarding early brain changes in AD.
