34441882|t|Regional Nerve Block Decreases the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Hip Fracture.
34441882|a|Postoperative delirium is common in elderly patients with hip fracture. Pain is a major risk factor for delirium, and regional nerve blocks (RNBs) effectively control pain in hip fractures. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of RNB on delirium after hip surgery in elderly patients. This retrospective comparative study was performed in a single institution, and the data were collected from medical records between March 2018 and April 2021. Patients aged >=60 years who underwent proximal femoral fracture surgery were included, while those with previous psychiatric illness and cognitive impairment were excluded. Two hundred and fifty-two patients were enrolled and divided into an RNB or a control group according to RNB use. Delirium was assessed as the primary outcome and postoperative pain score, pain medication consumption, and rehabilitation assessment as the secondary outcomes. Between the RNB (n = 129) and control groups (n = 123), there was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics. The overall incidence of delirium was 21%; the rate was lower in the RNB group than in the control group (15 vs. 27%, respectively, p = 0.027). The average pain score at 6 h postoperatively was lower in the RNB group than in the control group (2.8 +- 1.5 vs. 3.3 +- 1.6, respectively, p = 0.030). There was no significant difference in the pain score at 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, amount of opioids consumed for 2 postoperative days, and time from injury to wheelchair ambulation. We recommend RNB as a standard procedure for elderly patients with hip fracture due to lower delirium incidence and more effective analgesia in the early postoperative period.
