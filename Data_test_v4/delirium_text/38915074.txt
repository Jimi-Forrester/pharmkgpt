38915074|a|BACKGROUND: Daily activities have been recommended to minimize the long-term complications of coronary artery bypass as one of the strategies to return to the normal activity level, the effectiveness of which needs further investigation. This study aims to determine the quality of life and activities of daily living one year after CABG. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 206 patients who had undergone CABG for more than one year in 2018 in the north of Iran. The research instrument was a questionnaire including five sections, Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi2, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and a Logistic regression model. RESULT: The mean score of quality of life was 31.7 +- 2.04 of 12 to 48 possible scores. About Activities of Daily Living results showed 99.5% and 84.7% of the samples needed help with many of these activities respectively. The mean score of quality of life was significantly different based on sex (p < 0.018) and instrumental activity of daily living (p < 0.0001). A logistic regression model was used to determine the factors related to quality of life. The final model showed cross-clamp duration (OR = 0.33,p = 0.014), length of stay(LOS)in the intensive care unit(OR = 0.42,p = 0.05), and instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 0.08,p = 0.001) predicted patients' quality of life one year after coronary artery bypass grafting. CONCLUSION: Although more than half of the samples had a good average quality of life score, due to the lack of definitive treatment for coronary artery disease, it is suggested to consider predictive variables to help plan to improve the quality of life of these patients.
