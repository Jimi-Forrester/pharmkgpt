36275416|t|Prevalence of Comorbid Dementia in Late-life Depression and Bipolar Disorder: A Retrospective Inpatient Study.
36275416|a|Background: Dementia in patients with late-life mood disorders is clinically important. Objective: We aimed to investigate the prevalence of dementia in patients with late-life major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) and to clarify the clinical characteristics associated with the diagnosis of dementia. Methods: The prevalence of dementia at hospital discharge and the clinical characteristics at hospitalization who are diagnosed with MDD or BD over 65 years of age, from the medical records of 684 patients who had been admitted from 2015 to 2020 were investigated. Results: A total of 66 patients with MDD (n = 50) and BD (n = 16) were analyzed. The prevalence of dementia was significantly higher in MDD than in BD (24.0% versus 0%; p = 0.026). The mean age at onset of MDD was significantly older in the MDD with dementia group than in the MDD without (76.9+-6.3 years versus 62.2+-14.0 years; p < 0.001). The rate of first depressive episode at this admission was significantly higher in the MDD with dementia group (91.7% versus 30.3%; p < 0.001). The diagnosis of dementia was significantly associated with lower scores for "insomnia early" (p = 0.019) and higher scores for "insight" (p = 0.049) on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD-17) subscales and lower scores for "recall" (p = 0.003) on the MMSE subscales. Conclusion: The older age of first onset of depression, "insomnia early", "insight" and "recall" may be useful indicators for a diagnosis of dementia in late-life depression.
