36118898|t|Interpreting the spectrum of gamma-secretase complex missense variation in the context of hidradenitis suppurativa-An in-silico study.
36118898|a|Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit characterized by recurrent nodules, abscesses and draining tunnels with a predilection to intertriginous skin. The pathophysiology of HS is complex. However, it is known that inflammation and hyperkeratinization at the hair follicle play crucial roles in disease manifestation. Genetic and environmental factors are considered the main drivers of these two pathophysiological processes. Despite a considerable proportion of patients having a positive family history of disease, only a minority of patients suffering from HS have been found to harbor monogenic variants which segregate to affected kindreds. Most of these variants are in the gamma secretase complex (GSC) protein-coding genes. In this manuscript, we set out to characterize the burden of missense pathogenic variants in healthy reference population using large scale genomic dataset thereby providing a standard for comparing genomic variation in GSC protein-coding genes in the HS patient cohort.
