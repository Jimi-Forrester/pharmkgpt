37623897|t|Metabolic Profile of Alzheimer's Disease: Is 10-Hydroxy-2-decenoic Acid a Pertinent Metabolic Adjuster?
37623897|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant public health concern in modern society. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), which includes diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity, represents a modifiable risk factor for AD. MetS and AD are interconnected through various mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, insulin resistance (IR), vascular impairment, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Therefore, it is necessary to seek a multi-targeted and safer approach to intervention. Thus, 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), a unique hydroxy fatty acid in royal jelly, has shown promising anti-neuroinflammatory, blood-brain barrier (BBB)-preserving, and neurogenesis-promoting properties. In this paper, we provide a summary of the relationship between MetS and AD, together with an introduction to 10-HDA as a potential intervention nutrient. In addition, molecular docking is performed to explore the metabolic tuning properties of 10-HDA with associated macromolecules such as GLP-1R, PPARs, GSK-3, and TREM2. In conclusion, there is a close relationship between AD and MetS, and 10-HDA shows potential as a beneficial nutritional intervention for both AD and MetS.
