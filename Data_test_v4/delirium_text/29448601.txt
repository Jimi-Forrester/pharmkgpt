29448601|t|Probing Amyloid beta and the Antibody Interaction Using Atomic Force Microscopy.
29448601|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is considered to be the critical causative factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because the hydrophilic molecules accumulated outside of the neural cells and results in the formation of highly toxicity amyloid plaque. In this study, we probed the interaction between Abeta and the antibody using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We compared two kinds of antibodies which are the antibody for Abeta 1-42 (antibody42) and the antibody for Abeta 1-16 (antibody16). To detect the interaction between Abeta and the antibodies, the single molecular force spectroscopy was carried out using Abeta modified glass substrate and the antibodies modified AFM probes. In the results, the single Abeta-antibody42 dissociation constant was estimated to be 5.2 x 10-3 s-1 and the single Abeta-antibody16 dissociation constant was 2.8x10-2 s-1. The Abeta-antibody42 showed 5.3 times longer bond life time compare with Abeta-antibody16. It suggested that antibody42 is better choice for the Abeta sensor development.
