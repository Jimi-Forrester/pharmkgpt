39218292|a|BACKGROUND: 40 Hz light flickering has shown promise as a non-invasive therapeutic approach for alleviating both pathological features and cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and AD patients. Additionally, vision may influence olfactory function through cross-modal sensory interactions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of 40 Hz light flickering on olfactory behavior in AD model mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms of this intervention. METHODS: We used immunofluorescence techniques to observe the activation of the olfactory bulb (OB) in C57BL/6J mice under 40 Hz light flickering. A buried food test was conducted to evaluate olfactory behavior in AD mice. Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology was employed to detect transcriptional alterations in the OBs of AD mice following light stimulation. RESULTS: 40 Hz light flickering was found to effectively activate the OB. This stimulation led to enhanced olfactory behavior and did not alter P-tau protein mRNA levels within the OBs of AD mice. RNA sequencing revealed significant transcriptional changes in the OBs under flickering, particularly related to immune responses. CONCLUSION: Vision can influence olfactory function through cross-modal sensory interactions in rodent models. 40 Hz light stimulation improved olfactory performance in AD mice. However, the improvement in olfaction in AD mice is not related to changes in P-tau mRNA levels. Instead, it may be associated with an altered immune response, providing a scientific basis for the clinical treatment of olfactory disorders in Alzheimer's disease.
