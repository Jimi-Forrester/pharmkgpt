29887142|t|Prion-like mechanisms in Alzheimer disease.
29887142|a|Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the principal histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. The essential constituents of these lesions are structurally abnormal variants of normally generated proteins: Abeta protein in plaques and tau protein in tangles. At the molecular level, both proteins in a pathogenic state share key properties with classic prions, i.e., they consist of alternatively folded, beta-sheet-rich forms of the proteins that autopropagate by the seeded corruption and self-assembly of like proteins. Other similarities with prions include the ability to manifest as polymorphic and polyfunctional strains, resistance to chemical and enzymatic destruction, and the ability to spread within the brain and from the periphery to the brain. In Alzheimer disease, current evidence indicates that the pathogenic cascade follows from the endogenous, sequential corruption of Abeta and then tau. Therapeutic options include reducing the production or multimerization of the proteins, uncoupling the Abeta-tauopathy connection, or promoting the inactivation or removal of anomalous assemblies from the brain. Although aberrant Abeta appears to be the prime mover of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, once set in motion by Abeta, the prion-like propagation of tauopathy may proceed independently of Abeta; if so, Abeta might be solely targeted as an early preventive measure, but optimal treatment of Alzheimer disease at later stages of the cascade could require intervention in both pathways.
