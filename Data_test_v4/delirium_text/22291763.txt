22291763|t|Is 8860 variation a rare polymorphism or associated as a secondary effect in HCM disease?
22291763|a|INTRODUCTION: mtDNA defects, both deletions and point mutations, have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. The aim of this study was to establish a spectrum for mtDNA mutations in Iranian hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The control group was chosen among the special medical centre visitors who did not have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or any related heart disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is widely accepted as a pluricausal or multifactorial disease. Because of the linkage between energy metabolism in the mitochondria and cardiac muscle contraction, it is reasonable to assume that mitochondrial abnormalities may be responsible for some forms of HCM. Point mutations and deletions in the two hot spot regions of mtDNA were investigated by PCR and sequencing methods. RESULTS: Some unreported point mutations have been found in this study but no deletion was detected. Meanwhile some of these point mutations have been investigated among HCM patients for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: A8860G transition was detected in a high proportion, raising the question whether this rare polymorphism is associated as a secondary effect in HCM disease.
