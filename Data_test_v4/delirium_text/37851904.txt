37851904|t|Exploring the Pathophysiology of Delirium: An Overview of Biomarker Studies, Animal Models, and Tissue-Engineered Models.
37851904|a|Delirium is an acute brain disorder associated with disorganized thinking, difficulty focusing, and confusion that commonly follows major surgery, severe infection, and illness. Older patients are at high risk for developing delirium during hospitalization, which may contribute to increased morbidity, longer hospitalization, and increased risk of institutionalization following discharge. The pathophysiology underlying delirium remains poorly studied. This review delves into the findings from biomarker studies and animal models, and highlights the potential for tissue-engineered models of the brain in studying this condition. The aim is to bring together the existing knowledge in the field and provide insight into the future direction of delirium research.
