36557203|t|Human Gut Microbiota in Coronary Artery Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36557203|a|In recent years, the importance of the gut microbiome in human health and disease has increased. Growing evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis might be a crucial risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether or not CAD is associated with specific changes in the gut microbiome. The V3-V4 regions of the 16S rDNA from fecal samples were analyzed to compare the gut microbiome composition between CAD patients and controls. Our search yielded 1181 articles, of which 21 met inclusion criteria for systematic review and 7 for meta-analysis. The alpha-diversity, including observed OTUs, Shannon and Simpson indices, was significantly decreased in CAD, indicating the reduced richness of the gut microbiome. The most consistent results in a systematic review and meta-analysis pointed out the reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and Lachnospiraceae in CAD patients. Moreover, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus taxa demonstrated an increased trend in CAD patients. The alterations in the gut microbiota composition are associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in bacterial metabolites, many of which have pro-atherogenic effects on endothelial cells, increasing the risk of developing and progressing CAD.
