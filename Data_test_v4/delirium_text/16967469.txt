16967469|t|Association of tagSNPs in the urokinase-plasminogen activator (PLAU) gene with Alzheimer's disease and associated quantitative traits.
16967469|a|The gene coding for urokinase-plasminogen activator (PLAU) is a strong biological and positional candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously some studies have examined the role of common variation in the PLAU gene with AD risk but the results have been inconsistent and this inconsistency could have been due to the use of relatively small sample sizes. In this study we evaluated the distribution of four tagSNPs (rs2227562 in intron 5, rs2227564 in exon 6, rs2227571 in intron 9, and rs4065 in 3'UTR) in the PLAU gene in a large case-control study consisting of up to 1,000 AD patients and 697 white control subjects. We examined the role of these tagSNPs with AD risk and quantitative traits of AD, including age-at-onset (AAO), disease duration, and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores. The 3'UTR SNP revealed modest significant association with risk (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.95; P = 0.02), AAO (P = 0.036) and disease duration (P = 0.04) of AD. In addition, the intron 9 SNP also revealed a significant association with AAO (P = 0.01) and disease duration (P = 0.006). Our data on a large number of AD cases and controls suggest that genetic variation in PLAU may affect the risk and AAO of AD.
