24855834|a|Amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity has been identified as a major cause of Alzheimer's disease. Acorus tatarinowii Schott is one of the most frequently used Chinese herbs for Alzheimer's disease treatment. However, the effects of Acorus tatarinowii Schott on amyloid-beta mediated nerve cell damage remains unknown. In the present study, neuronal differentiated PC12 cells were used as a model to evaluate the effects of A. tatarinowii Schott extract (ATSE) against Abeta25-35 induced neurotoxicity. The results showed pretreatment with ATSE significantly protected PC12 cells from Abeta25-35 induced cell death, lactate dehydrogenase release, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In addition, pretreatment with ATSE also significantly inhibited Abeta25-35 induced caspase-3 activation and reactive oxygen species generation in PC12 cells. These observations suggested that ATSE protects PC12 cells from amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity.
