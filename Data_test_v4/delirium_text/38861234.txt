38861234|t|Circulating Chemokines and Short- and Long-Term Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke.
38861234|a|Chemokines are vital in post-cerebral ischemia inflammatory reactions. We investigate the possible relationship between plasma chemokines and short-term and long-term outcomes after stroke. This study included 235 patients (median age, 72 years; 49.8% female) suffering from ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack admitted to the hospital within 24 h of onset. We evaluated chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in plasma samples collected upon admission. Further, we assessed functional outcomes at 3- and 12-months, all-cause fatality over 5 years, and episodes of delirium within the first 7 days of admission. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between higher CXCL10 levels and an increased risk of poor functional outcomes at 3 months (OR: 3.02, 95%CI: 1.22-7.46, p = 0.016) and 12 months (OR: 2.32, 95%CI: 1.03-5.26, p = 0.043), as well as an increased death risk (HR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.04-3.07, p = 0.036). High CXCL8 levels independently predicted poor functional outcomes at 12 months (OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.39-6.31, p = 0.005) and a higher 5-year case fatality rate (HR: 1.90, 95%CI: 1.23-2.93, p = 0.004). Elevated CXCL9 levels also predicted unfavourable functional outcomes at 12 months (OR: 2.45, 95%CI: 1.07-5.61, p = 0.034). In univariate analysis, increased levels of CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed an association with delirium, although this link was not evident in the multivariate analysis. Plasma CXCL8 and CXCL10 show potential as prognostic biomarkers for stroke outcomes and as therapeutic targets suitable for reverse translation.
