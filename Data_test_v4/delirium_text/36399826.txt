36399826|a|Nasal administration of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history of applications. With the gradual maturing of technology and pharmacological advances, nasal preparations of TCM have undergone significant changes. Nasal TCM formulations are used not only for treatment of pneumonia, asthma, sinusitis and allergic rhinitis but also Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as antidepressants and antiepileptics, and in ischemia reperfusion. However, according to the analysis of nasal preparations of TCM currently on the market, most of them were compound preparations, which were used to treat allergic rhinitis (AR), common cold, headache and other local treatments, with a small range of diseases. At the same time, the dosage forms were mainly traditional dosage forms, aerosols and sprays, but there were no new dosage forms, which can not meet the clinical needs in terms of variety number, variety diversity and disease types. In this manuscript, we reviewed the development and applications of different nasal preparations of TCM from the aspects of nasal structure, origin, factors affecting absorption and common dosage forms, pharmacodynamics, targeting of nasal delivery and safety. In the near future, we expect that more nasal preparations of Chinese medicine with independent intellectual property rights will be marketed to meet the needs of clinical disease management.
