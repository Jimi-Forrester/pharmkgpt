32600331|a|BACKGROUND: The network pharmacology method was used to predict the active components of Banxia Xiexin decoction, its targets and the key signalling pathways that are activated in the treatment of depression and ulcerative colitis to explore the common mechanism. METHODS: The active components and targets of Banxia Xiexin decoction were obtained by searching the ETCM,TCMSP and TCMIP database. The disease targets of depression and ulcerative colitis were obtained by combining the following the DisGeNET, OMIM,Drugbank,CTD and PharmGKB disease databases. The drug and disease target genes were obtained from the intersection of the herbal medicine targets and the disease targets and were imported into the STRING platform for the analysis of PPI network. The network modules were constructed using Cytoscape software. An analysis of the functional annotations of GO terms and KEGG signalling pathways was performed for each network module. Then, the tissue distribution, sub-cellular distribution and protein attributes of the key targets in the pathway were analysed by the BioGPS, Genecards and DisGeNET databases. RESULTS: The mechanism of Banxia Xiexin Decoction in the treatment of depression and ulcerative colitis is related to drug reaction, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, oxidative stress response, cell response to lipopolysaccharide, insulin secretion regulation, estradiol response and other biological functions, mainly through the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine synaptic, arachidonic acid metabolism, HIF-1 signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway can achieve the effect of same treatment for different diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of Banxia Xiexin Decoction in treating different diseases involves direct or indirect correlation of multiple signal pathways, mainly involved in drug metabolism and lipid metabolism, but also through comprehensive intervention of the body's nervous system, immune system, digestive system and other systems. The effective components of Banxia Xiexin Decoction are mainly act on eight key target proteins (such as ALB, IL6, VEGFA, TNF, PTGS2, MAPK1, STAT3, EGFR) to carry out multi-target effect mechanism, biological mechanism of treating different diseases with the same treatment, and related mechanism of overall treatment, which provide theoretical reference for further research on the material basis and mechanism of Banxiaxiexin decoction on antidepressant and prevention and treatment of ulcerative colitis.
