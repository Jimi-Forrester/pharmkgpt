34668770|a|The Pharmacological Management of Emergencies in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Abstract. Emergencies in child and adolescent psychiatry are highly prevalent and often pose significant challenges to physicians, since substantial danger to the patient or others must be avoided through the application of largely moderate interventions. Besides using de-escalating strategies and exploiting psychotherapeutic options, the physician frequently employs psychopharmacological interventions. because of a lack of systematically assessed data, however, in emergencies in child and adolescent psychiatry most administrations of psychotropic drugs occur "off label." This review deduces practice-relevant recommendations for the pharmacological management of occurring child and adolescent emergencies such as acute suicidality, acute psychotic episodes, delirium, disorders of consciousness, acute intoxication, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We discuss the issue of quality and safety in pharmacological emergency strategies.
