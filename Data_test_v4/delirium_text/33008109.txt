33008109|t|Investigating Association between Intraoperative Hypotension and Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders in Non-Cardiac Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.
33008109|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive decline (deficit) (POCD) are related to a higher risk of postoperative complications and long-term disability. Pathophysiology of POD and POCD is complex, elusive and multifactorial. Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) constitutes a frequent and vital health hazard in the perioperative period. Unfortunately, there are no international recommendations in terms of diagnostics and treatment of neurocognitive complications which may arise from hypotension-related hypoperfusion. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature evaluating the association between IOH and POD/POCD in the non-cardiac setting. We have concluded that available data are quite inconsistent and there is a paucity of high-quality evidence convincing that IOH is a risk factor for POD/POCD development. Considerable heterogeneity between studies is the major limitation to set up reliable recommendations regarding intraoperative blood pressure management to protect the brain against hypotension-related hypoperfusion. Further well-designed and effectively-performed research is needed to elucidate true impact of intraoperative blood pressure variations on postoperative cognitive functioning.
