We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of cyanidin-3-glucoside-rich Oryza sativa L. (black rice) extract on cognitive function. METHODS: A 12-weeks double-blind randomized, placebo controlled trial assessed safety and cognitive outcomes in participants with subjective memory impairment (n=48) following consumption of 6 black rice extract capsules or a placebo. Cognitive function was assessed using the ADAS-cog and the CERAD-K. Subjective memory impairment also assessed. Safety was assessed by hematologic blood test, urine analysis, and participant reports of adverse events. RESULTS: There was significant improvement on subjective memory in intervention group. There was no statistically significant difference in objective cognitive outcomes following 12 weeks of consuming black rice extract. ADAS-cog scores, however, trended toward improvement in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. There was no adverse event. CONCLUSION: Although significant improvement in objective cognitive function was not proved, we found that C3G-rich Oryza sativa L. extract improves subjective memory in this study. Therefore the results may be informative of the possible effectiveness of the C3G-rich Oryza sativa L. on cognitive function.
