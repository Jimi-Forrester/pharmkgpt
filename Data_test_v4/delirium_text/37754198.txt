37754198|t|New Glycosalen-Manganese(III) Complexes and RCA120 Hybrid Systems as Superoxide Dismutase/Catalase Mimetics.
37754198|a|Reactive oxygen species are implicated in several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, inflammation, hereditary diseases, and ageing. MnIII-salen complexes are superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) mimetics, which have shown beneficial effects in various models for oxidative stress. These properties make them well-suited as potential therapeutic agents for oxidative stress diseases. Here, we report the synthesis of the novel glycoconjugates of salen complex, EUK-108, with glucose and galactose. We found that the complexes showed a SOD-like activity higher than EUK-108, as well as peroxidase and catalase activities. We also investigated the conjugate activities in the presence of Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120) lectin. The hybrid protein-galactose-EUK-108 system showed an increased SOD-like activity similar to the native SOD1.
