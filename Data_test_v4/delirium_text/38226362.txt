38226362|t|National and international collaborations to advance research into vascular contributions to cognitive decline.
38226362|a|Cerebrovascular disease is the second most common cause of cognitive disorders, usually referred to as vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and makes some contribution to about 70 % of all dementias. Despite its importance, research into VCID has lagged as compared to cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. There is an increasing appreciation that closing this gap requires large national and international collaborations. This paper highlights 24 notable large-scale national and international efforts to advance research into VCID (MarkVCID, DiverseVCID, DISCOVERY, COMPASS-ND, HBC, RHU SHIVA, UK DRI Vascular Theme, STROKOG, Meta VCI Map, ISGC, ENIGMA-Stroke Recovery, CHARGE, SVDs@target, BRIDGET, CADASIL Consortium, CADREA, AusCADASIL, DPUK, DPAU, STRIVE, HARNESS, FINESSE, VICCCS, VCD-CRE Delphi). These collaborations aim to investigate the effects on cognition from cerebrovascular disease or impaired cerebral blood flow, the mechanisms of action, means of prevention and avenues for treatment. Consensus groups have been developed to harmonise global approaches to VCID, standardise terminology and inform management and treatment, and data sharing is becoming the norm. VCID research is increasingly a global collaborative enterprise which bodes well for rapid advances in this field.
