31217489|a|Growing evidence suggests that peripheral factors to the brain driving neuro-inflammation could affect Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection has been associated with AD while other related viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Bar virus and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), are known to infect neurons. Here we compare gene expression profiles between AD or PD patients to those afflicted with herpes viral infections as to discover novel potential neuro-inflammation pathways. We found multiple significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between AD/PD and viral infections including SESN3 which has a genetic association for increased AD risk. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed viruses shared Oxidative Stress Defense System and LRRK2 pathways with AD and PD, respectively. We further processed our data to identify novel target and drug-repurposing opportunities including anti-inflammatory therapy, immune-modulators and cholinesterase inhibitors which could lead to new therapeutics paradigms for these neurodegenerative diseases.
