36293531|t|Bis(Benzofuran-1,3-N,N-heterocycle)s as Symmetric and Synthetic Drug Leads against Yellow Fever Virus.
36293531|a|The yellow fever virus (YFV) is an emerging RNA virus and has caused large outbreaks in Africa and Central and South America. The virus is often transmitted through infected mosquitoes and spreads from area to area because of international travel. Being an acute viral hemorrhagic disease, yellow fever can be prevented by an effective, safe, and reliable vaccine, but not be eliminated. Currently, there is no antiviral drug available for its cure. Thus, two series of novel bis(benzofuran-1,3-imidazolidin-4-one)s and bis(benzofuran-1,3-benzimidazole)s were designed and synthesized for the development of anti-YFV lead candidates. Among 23 new bis-conjugated compounds, 4 of them inhibited YFV strain 17D (Stamaril) on Huh-7 cells in the cytopathic effect reduction assays. These conjugates exhibited the most compelling efficacy and selectivity with an EC50 of <3.54 muM and SI of >15.3. The results are valuable for the development of novel antiviral drug leads against emerging diseases.
