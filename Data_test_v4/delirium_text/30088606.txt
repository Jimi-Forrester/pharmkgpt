30088606|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the multiprofessional care for the management of critical patients in delirium in the ICU from the evidences found in the literature. METHODS: This integrative review was carried out in the period from February 1 to June 30, 2016 through searches on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL, with the following descriptors: delirium, critical care e intensive care units, which brought up 17 original papers. RESULTS: A bundle and a guideline, two systematic reviews, evidence 1a and four clinical trials, evidence 1b and 2b, cohort and observational studies were found. The multiprofessional care was presented to better understand the diagnosis of delirium, sedation pause, early mobilization, pain, agitation and delirium guidelines, psychomotor agitation, cognitive orientation, sleep promotion, environment and family participation. CONCLUSION: The care for delirium is wide and not specific, which determines its multifactorial aspect.
