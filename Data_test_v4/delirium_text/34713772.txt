34713772|a|The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has been associated with commonly used biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, prior studies have typically utilized small and poorly characterized samples, and they have not analyzed the subtests of the RBANS. The current study sought to expand on prior work by examining the relationship between the Indexes and subtest scores of the RBANS and three AD biomarkers: amyloid deposition via positron emission tomography, hippocampal volume via magnetic resonance imaging, and APOE epsilon4 status. One-hundred twenty-one older adults across the AD continuum (intact, amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, mild AD), who were mostly Caucasian and well-educated, underwent assessment with the RBANS and collection of the three biomarkers. Greater amyloid deposition was significantly related to lower scores on all five Indexes and the Total Scale score of the RBANS, as well as 11 of 12 subtests. For bilateral hippocampal volume, significant correlations were observed for 4 of the 5 Indexes, Total Scale score, and 9 of 12 subtests, with smaller hippocampi being related to lower RBANS scores. Participants with at least one APOE epsilon4 allele had significantly lower scores on 3 of the 5 Indexes, Total Scale score, and 8 of the 12 subtests. In this sample of participants across the dementia spectrum, most RBANS Indexes and subtests showed relationships with the amyloid deposition, hippocampal volumes, and APOE status, with poorer performance on the RBANS being associated with biomarker positivity. Although memory scores on the RBANS have traditionally been linked to biomarkers in AD, other Index and subtest scores also hold promise as indicators of AD. Replication in a more diverse sample is needed.
