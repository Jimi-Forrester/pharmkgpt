33941559|t|Exploring Potential Biomarkers Underlying the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease by Bioinformatics Gene Analysis.
33941559|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of AD by bioinformatic gene analysis. The gene expression profiles of GSE16759 and GSE28146 were downloaded, and co-differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) were identified by R software. Subsequently, the data were analyzed using a combined bioinformatics approach and predicted the microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the key gene using miRNA databases. Based on the results of these analyses, ADAMTS1, CITED2, and GABRA2 were identified as co-DEGs. They were all associated with learning disorders (inference Score: 103.22, 140.41, and 96.26, respectively) and memory disorders (inference Score: 102.77, 132.68, and 81.80, respectively). The hub-genes of ADAMTS1, CITED2, and GABRA2 may be associated with AD. Additionally, miR-548c- 3p is probably a common target for ADAMTS1, CITED2, and GABRA2.
