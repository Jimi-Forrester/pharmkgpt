36361896|a|The rationale to define the biological and molecular parameters derived from structure-activity relationships (SAR) is mandatory for the lead selection of small drug compounds. Several series of small molecules have been synthesized based on a computer-assisted pharmacophore design derived from two series of compounds whose scaffold originates from chloroquine or amodiaquine. All compounds share similar biological activities. In vivo, Alzheimer's disease-related pathological lesions are reduced, consisting of amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary degeneration, which restore and reduce cognitive-associated impairments and neuroinflammation, respectively. Screening election was performed using a cell-based assay to measure the repression of Abeta1-x peptide production, the increased stability of APP metabolites, and modulation of the ratio of autophagy markers. These screening parameters enabled us to select compounds as potent non-competitive beta-secretase modulators, associated with various levels of lysosomotropic or autophagy modulatory activities. Structure-activity relationship analyses enabled us to define that (1) selectively reducing the production of Abeta1-x, and (2) little Abetax-40/42 modification together with (3) a decreased ratio of p62/(LC3-I/LC3-II) enabled the selection of non-competitive beta-secretase modulators. Increased stability of CTFalpha and AICD precluded the selection of compounds with lysosomotropic activity whereas cell toxicity was associated with the sole p62 enhanced expression shown to be driven by the loss of nitrogen moieties. These SAR parameters are herein proposed with thresholds that enable the selection of potent anti-Alzheimer drugs for which further investigation is necessary to determine the basic mechanism underlying their mode of action.
