32152789|a|Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase's (GAPDH) proapoptotic response to cellular oxidative stress has suspected implication for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, the overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can initiate oxidative stress responses within mammalian cell lines. Here, APP695 and APP770 overexpression significantly increased the level of GAPDH, while no effect was observed when the APP homologues APLP1 or APLP2 were used. Heterologous expression of APP695 was shown to increase the level of GAPDH within the cytoplasm by over 100% and within the mitochondria by approximately 50%. Moreover, a shift in organelle distribution from cytoplasm > nucleus > mitochondria in control cell lines to cytoplasm > mitochondria > nucleus in the APP695 overexpressing cell line was also observed. Further, the overexpression of APP695 increased GAPDH aggregation temperature by 3.09 +- 0.46  C, indicative of greater thermal stability. These results demonstrate a clear correlation between APP overexpression and GAPDH levels, organelle distribution and thermal stability.
