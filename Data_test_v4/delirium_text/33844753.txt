33844753|t|[Aseptic meningitis caused by brucellosis. Report of one case].
33844753|a|Aseptic meningitis represents a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. Cytological and chemical parameters are key in the differential diagnosis. Hypoglycorrhachia is a strong predictor of a bacterial origin for aseptic meningitis. We report a 44-year-old male with a history of recurrent febrile headaches admitted with fever and delirium. The initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed low glucose levels. Magnetic resonance imaging did not show abnormalities. The patient was discharged but was admitted again three weeks later with fever, headache and a stiff neck. The CSF was inflammatory with low glucose levels. Serology for brucellosis was positive. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and rifampicin with a good clinical response.
