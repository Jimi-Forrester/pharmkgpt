39113560|t|Role of AMBRA1 in mitophagy regulation: emerging evidence in aging-related diseases.
39113560|a|Aging is a gradual and irreversible physiological process that significantly increases the risks of developing a variety of pathologies, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and immune system diseases. Mitochondria are the energy-producing organelles, and their proper functioning is crucial for overall cellular health. Over time, mitochondrial function declines causing an increased release of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA, which leads to oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular damage, common features associated with various age-related pathologies. The impairment of mitophagy, the selective removal of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy, is relevant to the development and progression of age-related diseases. The molecular mechanisms that regulates mitophagy levels in aging remain largely uncharacterized. AMBRA1 is an intrinsically disordered scaffold protein with a unique property of regulating the activity of both proliferation and autophagy core machineries. While the role of AMBRA1 during embryonic development and neoplastic transformation has been extensively investigated, its functions in post-mitotic cells of adult tissues have been limited due to the embryonic lethality caused by AMBRA1 deficiency. Recently, a key role of AMBRA1 in selectively regulating mitophagy in post-mitotic cells has emerged. Here we summarize and discuss these results with the aim of providing a comprehensive view of the mitochondrial roles of AMBRA1, and how defective activity of AMBRA1 has been functionally linked to mitophagy alterations observed in age-related degenerative disorders, including muscular dystrophy/sarcopenia, Parkinson diseases, Alzheimer diseases and age-related macular degeneration.
