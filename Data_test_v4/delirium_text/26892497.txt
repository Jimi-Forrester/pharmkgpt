26892497|t|Transient Microneedle Insertion into Hippocampus Triggers Neurogenesis and Decreases Amyloid Burden in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
26892497|a|Targeted microlesions of the hippocampus have been reported to enhance neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ). The potential therapeutic impact of transient insertion of a microneedle was investigated in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the hypothesis that transient microinjury to the brain elicits cellular responses that mediate beneficial regenerative processes. Brief stereotaxic insertion and removal of a microneedle into the right hippocampus of 14-month-old APP/PS1 mouse brains resulted in (a) stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and (b) reduction of amyloid-beta plaque number in the CA-1 region. This treatment also resulted in a trend toward improved performance in the radial arm water maze (RAWM). Further studies of fundamental cellular mechanisms of the brain's response to microinjury will be useful for investigation of potential neuroprotective and deleterious effects of targeted microlesions and deep brain stimulation in AD.
