38367922|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), undergoing a faster increase in occurrence than any other type of dementia, lacks a curative remedy despite advanced discoveries. To explore the realm of non-pharmacologic therapies, our study evaluates the 12-week impact of non-invasive Photobiomodulation (PBM) on cognitive and psychological aspects in individuals with AD and minimal cognitive impairment (MCI). The urgency of exploring innovative interventions is underscored by the rising occurrence of AD, particularly in regions with aging populations like Iran. METHOD: 13 patients (6 case patients and 7 control patients) participated in the study. Sham treatment was administered to seven individuals, while another six received PBM treatment over 12 weeks, with daily at-home LED (810 nm wavelength) device usage lasting 20 min. Initially, the patient and their caregiver participated in two hospital sessions to acquaint them with the device's operation. RESULTS: The mean reduction of Hamilton's anxiety questionnaire score was 3.33+-6.08 in the intervention group and 2.00+-3.46 in the control group (p-value=0.836). The mean score reduction of the Hamilton depression questionnaire was 3.16+-3.86 in the intervention group and 4.85+-6.20 in the control group (p-value=0.836). The mean score of the DAD questionnaire in the intervention group before the study was 25.50+-13.13 and after the intervention was 29.83+-12.12 (p-value=0.084) and in the control group it was 29.71+-8.19 and after the study was 29+-0.972 (p-value = 0.526). The mean changes in the DAD questionnaire score in the intervention group increased by 4.33+-4.92 and decreased by 0.71+-2.81 in the control group (p-value=0.041). CONCLUSION: In general, PBM appears to hold promise as a potentially safe method for enhancing the cognitive, functional, and psychological status of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, though further research with larger sample size and cautious interpretation are warranted.
