28968242|t|Huntington's Disease and Diabetes: Chronological Sequence of its Association.
28968242|a|Although Huntington's disease (HD) is primarily considered a rare neurodegenerative disorder, it has been linked to glucose metabolism alterations and diabetes, as has been described in other neuro syndromes such as Friedreich's ataxia or Alzheimer's disease. This review surveys the existing literature on HD and its potential relationship with diabetes, glucose metabolism-related indexes and pancreas morphology, in humans and in animal's models. The information is reported in chronological sequence. That is, studies performed before and after the identification of the genetic defect underlying HD (CAG: encoding glutamine >=36 repeats located in exon 1 of the HTT gene) and with the development and evolution of HD animal models. The aim of the review is to evaluate whether impaired glucose metabolism contributes to the development of HD, and whether optimized glycemic control may ameliorate the symptoms of HD.
