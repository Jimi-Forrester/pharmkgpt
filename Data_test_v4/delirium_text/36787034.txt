36787034|a|PURPOSE: Surgical site occurrences after transversus abdominis release in ventral hernia repair are still reported up to 15%. Evidence is rising that preoperative improvement of risk factors might contribute to optimal patient recovery. A reduction of complication rates up to 40% has been reported. The aim of this study was to determine whether prehabilitation has a favorable effect on the risk on wound and medical complications as well as on length of stay. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary referral center for abdominal wall surgery. All patients undergoing ventral hernia repair discussed at multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings between 2015 and 2019 were included. Patients referred for a preconditioning program by the MDT were compared to patients who were deemed fit for operative repair by the MDT, without such a program. Endpoints were patients, hernia, and procedure characteristics as well as length of hospital stay, wound and general complications. RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were included of which 126 received a preconditioning program. Baseline characteristics between the two groups were statistically significantly different as the prehabilitated group had higher median BMI (28 vs 30, p < 0.001), higher HbA1c (41 vs 48, p = 0.014), more smokers (4% vs 25%, p < 0.001) and higher HPW classes due to more patient factors (14% vs 48%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in intra-operative and postoperative outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed prehabilitation facilitates patients with relevant comorbidities achieving the same results as patients without those risk factors. The indication of a preconditioning program might be effective at the discretion of an MDT meeting. Further research could focus on the extent of such program to assess its value.
