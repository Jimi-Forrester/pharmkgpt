21971403|a|In this report, we confirm our previous findings of increased concentrations of soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor (sAbetaPP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a large cohort of patients (n = 314), not overlapping with those of our previous study, and we extend our observations by including a control group of participants with normal cognition. In addition, we investigate the effects of age, the APOEepsilon4 genotype, and the blood-CSF barrier function on the concentrations of sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta. The study participants were categorized according to clinical-neuropsychological criteria, supported by CSF neurochemical dementia diagnostics (NDD) analyses. sAbetaPPalpha concentrations in the AD group (132.0 +- 44.8) were significantly higher than in the control group (105.3 +- 37.3, p < 0.0005) but did not differ from the MCI-AD group (138.5 +- 39.5, p = 0.91). The MCI-AD group differed significantly from the MCI-O (97.3 +- 34.3, p < 0.05) group. There was no difference between the control and the MCI-O groups (p = 0.94). Similarly, sAbetaPPbeta concentrations in the AD group (160.2 +- 54.3) were significantly higher than in the control group (129.9 +- 44.6, p < 0.005) but did not differ from the MCI-AD group (184.0 +- 56.4, p = 0.20). The MCI-AD group differed significantly from the MCI-O (127.8 +- 46.2, p < 0.05) group. There was no difference between the control and the MCI-O groups (p > 0.99). We observed highly significant correlation of the two sAbetaPP forms. Age and the CSF-serum albumin ratio were significant albeit weak predictors of the sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta concentrations, while carrying the APOEepsilon4 allele did not influenced the levels of the sAbetaPP forms. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that CSF sAbetaPP concentrations may be considered as an extension of already available NDD tools.
