31638153|a|BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever is endemic in Fiji. We sought to describe the epidemiology, clinical features and case fatality risk of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever from January 2014 through December 2015. METHODS: Blood culture-positive patients were identified from a typhoid surveillance line list. A standardised case investigation form was used to record data from patients' medical records. RESULTS: Of 542 patients, 518 (95.6%) were indigenous Fijians (iTaukei) and 285 (52.6%) were male. The median (IQR) age was 25 (16-38) y. Mean (SD) time from the onset of illness to admission was 11.1 (6.9) d. Of 365 patients with clinical information, 346 (96.9%) had fever, 239 (66.9%) diarrhoea, 113 (33.5%) vomiting, and 72 (30.2%) abdominal pain. There were 40 (11.0%) patients with complications, including 17 (4.7%) with shock, and 11 (3.0%) with hepatitis. Nine patients died for a case fatality risk of 1.7%. Of the 544 Salmonella Typhi isolates tested, none were resistant to first line antimicrobials; 3(0.8%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 5(1.4%) to nalidixic acid. CONCLUSIONS: In Fiji, most blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases were in young adults. Common clinical manifestations were fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Further studies are required to elucidate the factors associated with complications and death.
