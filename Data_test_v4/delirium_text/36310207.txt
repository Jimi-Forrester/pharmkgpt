36310207|t|Study of Tau Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation In Vitro.
36310207|a|Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is one of the major pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders. Recent reports have demonstrated that purified tau can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, forming liquid droplets. The protein within these droplets was also found to undergo accelerated transition to fibrillar aggregates, suggesting that LLPS may play an important role in pathological aggregation of tau in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we describe several protocols for studying LLPS behavior of the recombinant full-length tau by turbidimetric and light microscopy-based methods.
