38800469|t|Global trends in research on aging associated with periodontitis from 2002 to 2023: a bibliometric analysis.
38800469|a|Background: Aging has been implicated in many chronic inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis. Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by long-term irritation of the periodontal tissues by the plaque biofilm on the surface of the teeth. However, only a few bibliometric analyses have systematically studied this field to date. This work sought to visualize research hot spots and trends in aging associated with periodontitis from 2002 to 2023 through bibliometric approaches. Methods: Graphpad prism v8.0.2 was used to analyse and plot annual papers, national publication trends and national publication heat maps. In addition, CtieSpace (6.1.6R (64-bit) Advanced Edition) and VOSviewer (version 1.6.18) were used to analyse these data and visualize the scientific knowledge graph. Results: The number of documents related to aging associated with periodontitis has steadily increased over 21 years. With six of the top ten institutions in terms of publications coming from the US, the US is a major driver of research in this area. journal of periodontology is the most published journal in the field. Tonetti MS is the most prolific authors and co-cited authors in the field. Journal of Periodontology and Journal of Clinical Periodontology are the most popular journals in the field with the largest literature. Periodontitis, Alzheimer's disease, and peri-implantitis are current hot topics and trends in the field. Inflammation, biomarkers, oxidative stress cytokines are current research hotspots in this field. Conclusion: Our research found that global publications regarding research on aging associated with periodontitis increased dramatically and were expected to continue increasing. Inflammation and aging, and the relationship between periodontitis and systemic diseases, are topics worthy of attention.
