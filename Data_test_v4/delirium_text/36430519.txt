36430519|t|Tiron Has Negative Effects on Osteogenic Differentiation via Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Human Periosteum-Derived Cells.
36430519|a|Tiron is a potent antioxidant that counters the pathological effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production due to oxidative stress in various cell types. We examined the effects of tiron on mitochondrial function and osteoblastic differentiation in human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs). Tiron increased mitochondrial activity and decreased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity in hPDCs; however, it had a detrimental effect on osteoblastic differentiation by reducing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and alizarin red-positive mineralization, regardless of H2O2 treatment. Osteoblast-differentiating hPDCs displayed increased ROS production compared with non-differentiating hPDCs, and treatment with tiron reduced ROS production in the differentiating cells. Antioxidants decreased the rates of oxygen consumption and ATP production, which are increased in hPDCs during osteoblastic differentiation. In addition, treatment with tiron reduced the levels of most mitochondrial proteins, which are increased in hPDCs during culture in osteogenic induction medium. These results suggest that tiron exerts negative effects on the osteoblastic differentiation of hPDCs by causing mitochondrial dysfunction.
