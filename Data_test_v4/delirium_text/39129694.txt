Apathy, a common symptom in Alzheimer's disease, refers to a lack of motivation, interest, and emotional responsiveness. It can significantly impact patients' quality of life and increase caregiver burden. This study aimed to determine the effects of a diversified rehabilitation program combined with donepezil on apathy, cognitive function, and family caregiver burden of Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: A total of 105 Alzheimer's disease patients treated at our hospital between January 2020 and January 2023 were selected and analyzed retrospectively. They were assigned to the control group (n = 50) or the observation group (n = 55). The two groups did not differ in terms of general data such as age and sex. All patients were treated with donepezil orally. The control group was given routine nursing, whereas the observation group was given a diversified rehabilitation program intervention, including cognitive training and emotional support. The Hasegawa's dementia scale, mini-mental state examination, and Montreal cognitive assessment scale were adopted to evaluate the cognitive function of the two groups before and after treatment. A caregiver burden scale, the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the Apathy Evaluation Scale Informant version (AES-I) were used to evaluate the caregiver burden and apathy of the two groups. RESULTS: A significantly higher overall response rate to treatment was found in the observation group (94.55%) than in the control group (80.00%) (p = 0.024). After treatment, scores on the Hasegawa's dementia scale, mini-mental state examination, and Montreal cognitive assessment scale of the two groups increased to varying degrees, with greater increases in the observation group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The ZBI and AES-I scores of the two groups decreased to different degrees after treatment, with greater decreases in the observation group than in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A diversified rehabilitation program combined with donepezil can substantially alleviate the apathy of Alzheimer's disease patients, improve their cognitive function, and reduce the burden on their families.
