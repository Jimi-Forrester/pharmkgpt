8903316|t|Apoptosis induced by HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system.
8903316|a|Apoptosis plays a role in AIDS pathogenesis in the immune system, but its role in HIV-1-induced neurological disease is unknown. In this study, we examine apoptosis induced by HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in an in vitro model and in brain tissue from AIDS patients. HIV-1 infection of primary brain cultures induced apoptosis in neurons and astrocytes in vitro as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and propidium iodide staining and by electron microscopy. Apoptosis was not significantly induced until 1-2 wk after the time of peak virus production, suggesting induction by soluble factors rather than by direct viral infection. Apoptosis of neurons and astrocytes was also detected in brain tissue from 10/11 AIDS patients, including 5/5 patients with HIV-1 dementia and 4/5 nondemented patients. In addition, endothelial cell apoptosis was frequently detected in the brain of AIDS patients and was confirmed by electron microscopy. Most of the apoptotic cells were not localized adjacent to HIV-1-infected cells, providing further evidence for induction by soluble factors. In six non-AIDS control patients with normal brain, apoptotic cells were absent or limited to rare astrocytes. However, TUNEL-positive neurons and astrocytes were frequently detected in seven patients with Alzheimer's disease or abundant senile plaques. These studies suggest that apoptosis is a mechanism of CNS injury in AIDS which is likely to be induced by soluble factors. The apoptosis of endothelial cells in the CNS raises the possibility that some of these factors may be blood-derived.
