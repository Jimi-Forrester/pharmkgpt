38840995|t|The Burden of Stroke Mimics Among Hyperacute Stroke Unit Attendees with Special Emphasis on Migraine: A 10-Year Evaluation.
38840995|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stroke and migraine are common neurological illnesses that cause tremendous suffering for patients. Certain diseases can mimic the clinical manifestations of an actual stroke. Migraine is one of the most commonly reported stroke mimics. The main goals of this study are to look at the prevalence of stroke mimics on the stroke pathway of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals and how many of them are migraines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective service evaluation was conducted at the hyperacute stroke unit (HASU) of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (RHH) in the United Kingdom. The total admissions from 2013 to 2022 were collected from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme database, and the number of stroke mimics was evaluated each year. The burden of migraine stroke mimics was also evaluated. Then, a one-year sample of stroke mimics was extracted to look for the types of each mimic. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2022, 45.75% (n = 12156) of the stroke pathway patients (n = 26573) were stroke mimics, with an increment of up to 55% in the years 2021 and 2022. During these 10 years, migraine stroke mimics accounted for 10.21% of admissions (n = 1240). The three most common mimics in a one-year sample of stroke pathway patients were migraine (14.70%) (n = 373), functional neurological disorders (FNDs) (7.17%) (n = 182), and Guillain-Barre syndrome (6.66%) (n = 169). Seizures, syncope, and metabolic derangements were reported as mimics in 4.17% (n = 106), 3.14% (n = 80), and 1.77% (n = 45), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: About half of the HASU attendees were stroke mimics rather than actual strokes, and the most common mimics were migraines.
