36971193|t|Updated insights on dementia-related risk of sacubitril/valsartan: A real-world pharmacovigilance analysis.
36971193|a|AIM: Sacubitril/valsartan is a new cardiovascular agent characterized by its dual inhibition on the reninangiotensin system (RAS) and the neprilysin. As neprilysin also involved itself in the degradation of amyloid-beta, there is an ongoing concern about the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on cognition, especially in case of long-term administration. METHODS: The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was mined between 2015Q3 and 2022Q4 to analyze the association between sacubitril/valsartan and adverse events (AEs) involving dementia. Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQs) with "broad" and "narrow" preferred terms (PTs) relevant to dementia was applied to systematically search demented AE reports. The Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) from Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) and proportional reporting ratio with Chi-square (PRR, chi2 ) were used to calculate the disproportionality. RESULTS: We filtered the query for indication and identified 80,316 reports with heart failure indication in FAERS during the analytical period. Among all the reports, sacubitril/valsartan was listed as primary suspected or secondary suspected drug in 29,269 cases. No significantly elevated reporting rates of narrow dementia were evident with sacubitril/valsartan. The EBGM05 for narrow dementia-related AEs associated with sacubitril/valsartan was 0.88 and the PRR (chi2 ) was 1.22 (2.40). Similarly, broad demented complications were not over-reported in the heart failure patients administrated with sacubitril/valsartan (EBGM05 1.11; PRR 1.31, chi2 109.36). CONCLUSION: The number of dementia-related cases reported to FAERS generate no safety signal attributable to sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart failure for now. Further follow-ups are still warranted to address this question.
