37940560|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) is widely applied in clinical therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the associated molecular mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The current study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of EA in neurologic repair after SCI. First, we investigated the role of EA in the neurologic repair of the SCI rat model. The expression levels of human antigen R (HuR) and Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) in spinal cord tissues were quantified after treatment. Second, we conducted bioinformatics analysis, RNA pull-down assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter gene assay to verify the binding of HuR and KLF9 mRNA for mRNA stability. Last, HuR inhibitor CMLD-2 was used to verify the enhanced effect of EA on neurologic repair after SCI via the HuR/KLF9 axis. Our data provided convincing evidence that EA facilitated the recovery of neuronal function in SCI rats by reducing apoptosis and inflammation of neurons. We found that EA significantly diminished the SCI-mediated upregulation of HuR, and HuR could bind to the 3' untranslated region of KLF9 mRNA to protect its decay. In addition, a series of in vivo experiments confirmed that CMLD-2 administration increased EA-mediated pain thresholds and motor function in SCI rats. Collectively, the present study showed that EA improved pain thresholds and motor function in SCI rats via impairment of HuR-mediated KLF9 mRNA stabilization, thus providing a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms regarding EA-mediated neurologic repair after SCI.
