39077280|t|Role of the Glymphatic System in Alzheimer's Disease and Treatment Approaches: A Narrative Review.
39077280|a|Currently, there is unavailability of disease-modifying medication for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a debilitating neurological disorder. The pathogenesis of AD appears to be complex and could be influenced by the glymphatic system present in the central nervous system (CNS). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and other metabolic wastes are eliminated from the brain interstitium by the glymphatic system, which encompasses perivascular channels and astroglial cells. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system, which could occur due to decreased aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expression, aging-related alterations in the human brain, and sleep disruptions, may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and also accelerate the development of AD by causing a buildup of harmful proteins like Abeta. Promising approaches have been examined for reducing AD pathology, including non-pharmacological therapies that target glymphatic function, like exercise and sleep regulation. In addition, preclinical research has also demonstrated the therapeutic potential of pharmaceutical approaches targeted at augmenting AQP4-mediated glymphatic flow. To identify the precise processes driving glymphatic dysfunction in AD and to find new treatment targets, more research is required. Innovative diagnostic and treatment approaches for AD could be made possible by techniques such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which promises to evaluate glymphatic function in neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment options for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases may be improved by comprehending and utilizing the glymphatic system's function in preserving brain homeostasis and targeting the mechanisms involved in glymphatic functioning. This review intends to enhance the understanding of the complex link between AD and the glymphatic system and focuses on the function of AQP4 channels in promoting waste clearance and fluid exchange.
