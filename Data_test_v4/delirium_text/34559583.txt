34559583|t|Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Induced Anti-Neuroinflammation Against Traumatic Brain Injury.
34559583|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a pervasive and damaging form of acquired brain injury (ABI). Acute, subacute, and chronic cell death processes, as a result of TBI, contribute to the disease progression and exacerbate outcomes. Extended neuroinflammation can worsen secondary degradation of brain function and structure. Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has surfaced as a viable approach as a TBI therapeutic due to its immunomodulatory and regenerative features. This article examines the role of inflammation and cell death in ABI as well as the effectiveness of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (BM-MSC) transplants as a treatment for TBI. Furthermore, we analyze new studies featuring transplanted BM-MSCs as a neurorestorative and anti-inflammatory therapy for TBI patients. Although clinical trials support BM-MSC transplants as a viable TBI treatment due to their promising regenerative characteristics, further investigation is imperative to uncover innovative brain repair pathways associated with cell-based therapy as stand-alone or as combination treatments.
