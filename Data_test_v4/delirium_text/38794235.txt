38794235|t|Exploring the Wound Healing Potential of a Cuscuta chinensis Extract-Loaded Nanoemulsion-Based Gel.
38794235|a|Cuscuta chinensis (C. chinensis) presents many pharmacological activities, including antidiabetic effects, and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties. However, the wound care properties of this plant have not yet been reported. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate C. chinensis extracts. The phytochemical markers in the extracts were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Then, the selected C. chinensis extract was developed into a nanoemulsion-based gel for wound care testing in rats. The results showed that both of the C. chinensis extracts exhibited antioxidant activity when tested using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays. They reduced the expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in RAW264.7 cells induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The ethyl acetate extract also had antibacterial properties. Kaempferol was found in both extracts, whereas hyperoside was found only in the ethanol extract. These compounds were found to be related to the biological activities of the extracts, confirmed via molecular docking. The C. chinensis extract-loaded nanoemulsions had a small particle size, a narrow polydispersity index (PDI), and good stability. Furthermore, the C. chinensis extract-loaded nanoemulsion-based gel had a positive effect on wound healing, presenting a better percentage wound contraction Fucidin cream. In conclusion, this formulation has the potential for use as an alternative wound treatment and warrants further study in clinical trials.
