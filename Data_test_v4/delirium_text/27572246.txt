27572246|t|Characterization of FRM-36143 as a new gamma-secretase modulator for the potential treatment of familial Alzheimer's disease.
27572246|a|BACKGROUND: Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin (PS). Most PS mutations, which account for the majority of FAD cases, lead to an increased ratio of longer to shorter forms of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. The therapeutic rationale of gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) for Alzheimer's disease is based on this genetic evidence as well as on enzyme kinetics measurements showing changes in the processivity of the gamma-secretase complex. This analysis suggests that GSMs could potentially offset some of the effects of PS mutations on APP processing, thereby addressing the root cause of early onset FAD. Unfortunately, the field has generated few, if any, molecules with good central nervous system (CNS) drug-like properties to enable proof-of-mechanism studies. METHOD: We characterized the novel GSM FRM-36143 using multiple cellular assays to determine its in vitro potency and off-target activity as well as its potential to reverse the effect of PS mutations. We also tested its efficacy in vivo in wild-type mice and rats. RESULTS: FRM-36143 has much improved CNS drug-like properties compared to published GSMs. It has an in vitro EC50 for Abeta42 of 35 nM in H4 cells, can reduce Abeta42 to 58 % of the baseline in rat cerebrospinal fluid, and also increases the non-amyloidogenic peptides Abeta37 and Abeta38. It does not inhibit Notch processing, nor does it inhibit 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) activity. Most interestingly, it can reverse the effects of presenilin mutations on APP processing in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: FRM-36143 possesses all the characteristics of a GSM in terms of Abeta modulation Because FRM-36143 was able to reverse the effect of PS mutations, we suggest that targeting patients with this genetic defect would be the best approach at testing the efficacy of a GSM in the clinic. While the amyloid hypothesis is still being tested with beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies in sporadic AD, we believe it is not a hypothesis for FAD. Since GSMs can correct the molecular defect caused by PS mutations, they have the promise to provide benefits to the patients when treated early enough in the course of the disease.
