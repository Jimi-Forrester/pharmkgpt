22531418|t|Amyloid-beta(1-15/16) as a marker for gamma-secretase inhibition in Alzheimer's disease.
22531418|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) producing enzymes are key targets for disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies since Abeta trafficking is at the core of AD pathogenesis. Development of such drugs might benefit from the identification of markers indicating in vivo drug effects in the central nervous system. We have previously shown that Abeta(1-15) is produced by concerted beta-and alpha-secretase cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Here, we test the hypothesis that this pathway is more engaged upon gamma-secretase inhibition in humans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta(1-15/16) represent a biomarker for this effect. Twenty healthy men were treated with placebo (n = 5) or the gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat (100 mg [n = 5], 140 mg [n = 5], or 280 mg [n = 5]). CSF samples were collected hourly over 36 hours and 10 time points were analyzed by immunoassay for Abeta(1-15/16), Abeta(x-38), Abeta(x-40), Abeta(x-42), sAbetaPPalpha, and sAbetaPPbeta. The CSF concentration of Abeta(1-15/16) showed a dose-dependent response over 36 hours. In the 280 mg treatment group, a transient increase was seen with a maximum of 180% relative to baseline at 9 hours post administration of semagacestat. The concentrations of Abeta(x-38), Abeta(x-40), and Abeta(x-42) decreased the first 9 hours followed by increased concentrations after 36 hours relative to baseline. No significant changes were detected for CSF sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta. Our data shows that CSF levels of Abeta(1-15/16) increase during treatment with semagacestat supporting its feasibility as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for drug candidates aimed at inhibiting gamma-secretase-mediated AbetaPP-processing.
