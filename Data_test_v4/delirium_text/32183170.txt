32183170|t|Real-Time 3D Imaging and Inhibition Analysis of Various Amyloid Aggregations Using Quantum Dots.
32183170|a|Amyloidosis refers to aggregates of protein that accumulate and are deposited as amyloid fibrils into plaques. When these are detected in organs, they are the main hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other related diseases. Recent medical advances have shown that many precursors and proteins can induce amyloidosis even though the mechanism of amyloid aggregation and the relationship of these proteins to amyloidosis remains mostly unclear. In this study, we report the real-time 3D-imaging and inhibition analysis of amyloid beta (Abeta), tau, and alpha-synuclein aggregation utilizing the affinity between quantum dots (QD) and amyloid aggregates. We successfully visualized these amyloid aggregations in real-time using fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy simply by adding commercially available QD. The observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that QD particles bound to all amyloid fibrils. The 3D-imaging with QD revealed differences between amyloid aggregates composed of different amyloid peptides that could not be detected by TEM. We were also able to quantify the inhibition activities of these proteins by rosmarinic acid, which has high activity for Abeta aggregation, from fluorescence micrographs as half-maximal effective concentrations. These imaging techniques with QD serve as quick, easy, and powerful tools to understand amyloidosis and to discover drugs for therapies.
