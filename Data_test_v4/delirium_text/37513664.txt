37513664|t|High Prevalence of Energy and Nutrients Inadequacy among Brazilian Older Adults.
37513664|a|Poor nutrition increases the risk of diseases and adverse health outcomes in older adults. We evaluated the potential inadequacy of nutrient intake among older adults in Brazil and its association with body anthropometry and composition outcomes. Dietary intake was obtained from 295 community-living older adults (>60 years old), of both genders, using a seven-day food record. Nutrient inadequacy was further identified based on the Dietary Reference Intakes and European Guidelines. Skeletal muscle mass (SM), strength and performance, and the diagnosis of sarcopenia were assessed using reference methods. Nutritional inadequacy was high, with energy, dietary fiber, and six micronutrients exhibiting the greatest inadequacy levels (>80%). Energy intake was correlated with SM strength (p = 0.000) and performance (p = 0.001). Inadequate energy, fiber, and protein intakes influenced BMI, while inadequate intake of vitamin B6 directly affected the diagnosis of sarcopenia (p <= 0.005). Further research is required to investigate whether these inadequacies can be associated with other clinical health outcomes.
