33240424|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a poor prognosis and its recurrence and mortality rates are high. At present, there is no effective clinical method to control its progression and recurrence. Traditional Chinese Medicine has a high status not only in China, but also in the world. Certain drugs are also used in the clinical treatment of tumor diseases. In clinical practice, Huang-Lian-Tang (HLT) has proven efficacy in treating brain diseases and preventing tumor recurrence. However, the mechanisms of action have remained elusive. The present study explored the potential mechanisms of HLT in the treatment of gliomas based on network pharmacology. First, information on the composition of HLT was obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, and the composition and targets of the chemical substances contained in the herbs were analyzed. Subsequently, a pharmacological interaction network for HLT was built. Furthermore, the expressed genes of patients with GBM were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database and screened. A protein-protein interaction network was then constructed for both sets of data and they were combined with a topology method for analysis. Finally, the screened genes were subjected to enrichment analysis and pathway analysis. A total of 386 candidate targets and 7 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were screened, which were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and KEGG signal pathway analysis indicated that these targets are involved in anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidative stress, multicellular biological processes and other physiological and pathological processes related to the occurrence and development of GBM. In conclusion, the present results indicated that the mechanisms of action of HLT against GBM involve multiple targets and signaling pathways that are related to tumorigenesis and progression. The present study not only provided a novel theoretical basis for Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat tumors but also novel ideas for the treatment of GBM.
