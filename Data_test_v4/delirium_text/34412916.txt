34412916|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in serum levels of S100beta, neuron-specific enolase, glial fibrillary acidic protein in living donors and recipients after kidney transplantation. METHODS: We enrolled 56 patients into the study. Of these, 27 underwent donor nephrectomy (group D), and the remaining 29 underwent kidney transplantation (recipient, group R). Neuromarkers were measured in samples obtained before the procedure, on postoperative day 7, and at 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative kidney functions were impaired in patients who underwent living donor nephrectomy compared with their preoperative levels (P < .001), although no significant difference was observed in their neuromarkers. The postoperative delirium rating scale was also impaired after living donor nephrectomy compared with preoperative levels (P < .05). Postoperative kidney functions were improved (P < .001), and a progressive decrease in neuromarker levels (P < .05) was observed in kidney transplant recipients compared with their preoperative levels. Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between neuron-specific enolase, glial fibrillary acidic protein levels and kidney functions in recipients. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that neuron-specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels decrease in kidney transplant recipients and do not change in donors. This result indicated that there is no evidence of neurotoxicity in either recipients and donors in kidney transplantation.
