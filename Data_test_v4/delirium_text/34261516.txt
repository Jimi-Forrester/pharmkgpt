34261516|t|Kluver-Bucy syndrome secondary to a nondominant middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke: a case report and review of the literature.
34261516|a|BACKGROUND: Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a rare and complex neurobehavioral cluster that occurs in humans and results from a temporal lobe lesion. It can be associated with a variety of causes. Stroke is a rarely reported cause of this syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the case of a 68-year-old Saudi male who developed Kluver-Bucy syndrome subsequent to a nondominant middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke involving right temporal lobe. The patient manifested most of the Kluver-Bucy syndrome clinical features, including hypersexuality, hyperphagia, hyperorality, and visual hypermetamorphosis (excessive tendency to react to every visual stimulation with a tendency to touch every such stimulus). These neurobehavioral manifestations improved after he was started on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course, anatomical association relying on pathophysiology, and potential treatment have all been deliberated in regard to the rare occurrence of Kluver-Bucy syndrome resulting from temporal lobe pathology.
