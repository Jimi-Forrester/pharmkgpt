27843614|a|On the occasion of receiving the ESMO 2015, Prof Nathan Cherny reflects on the potential of the individual clinician to address issues of consequence on a wider scale through the auspices of a professional medical society. He describes his 20 year relationship with ESMO illustrating the potential of harnessing the power of ESMO to influence care, professional behaviours and distributional justice in the provision of care. He urges oncologists to be inspired by the credos that he was nurtured on emphasising professional and personal integrity and the audacity to push boundaries.
