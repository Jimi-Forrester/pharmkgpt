37973882|t|Clinical complications after a traumatic brain injury and its relation with brain biomarkers.
37973882|a|We aimed to find out which are the most frequent complications for patients who suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its relation with brain biomarker levels. We conducted a hospital cohort study with patients who attended the Hospital Emergency Department between 1 June 2018 and 31 December 2020. Different variables were collected such as biomarkers levels after 6 h and 12 h of TBI (S100, NSE, UCHL1 and GFAP), clinical and sociodemographic variables, complementary tests, and complications 48 h and 7 days after TBI. Qualitative variables were analysed with Pearson's chi-square test, and quantitative variables with the Mann-Whitney U test. A multivariate logistic regression model for the existence of complications one week after discharge was performed to assess the discriminatory capacity of the clinical variables. A total of 51 controls and 540 patients were included in this study. In the TBI group, the mean age was 83 years, and 53.9% of the patients were male. Complications at seven days were associated with the severity of TBI (p < 0.05) and the number of platelets (p = 0.016). All biomarkers except GFAP showed significant differences in their distribution of values according to gender, with significantly higher values of the three biomarkers for women with respect to men. Patients with complications presented significantly higher S100 values (p < 0.05). The patient's baseline status, the severity of the TBI and the S100 levels can be very important elements in determining whether a patient may develop complications in the few hours after TBI.
