37110659|t|Switch-on Fluorescence Analysis of Protease Activity with the Assistance of a Nickel Ion-Nitrilotriacetic Acid-Conjugated Magnetic Nanoparticle.
37110659|a|Heterogeneous protease biosensors show high sensitivity and selectivity but usually require the immobilization of peptide substrates on a solid interface. Such methods exhibit the disadvantages of complex immobilization steps and low enzymatic efficiency induced by steric hindrance. In this work, we proposed an immobilization-free strategy for protease detection with high simplicity, sensitivity and selectivity. Specifically, a single-labeled peptide with oligohistidine-tag (His-tag) was designed as the protease substrate, which can be captured by a nickel ion-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-conjugated magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) through the coordination interaction between His-tag and Ni-NTA. When the peptide was digested by protease in a homogeneous solution, the signal-labeled segment was released from the substrate. The unreacted peptide substrates could be removed by Ni-NTA-MNP, and the released segments remained in solution to emit strong fluorescence. The method was used to determine protease of caspase-3 with a low detection limit (4 pg/mL). By changing the peptide sequence and signal reporters, the proposal could be used to develop novel homogeneous biosensors for the detection of other proteases.
