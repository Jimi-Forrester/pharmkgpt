38300883|t|Focusing on Earlier Management of Alzheimer Disease: Expert Opinion Based on a Modified Nominal Group Technique.
38300883|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the number of people living with Alzheimer disease (AD), awareness of the early stages of this condition, including mild cognitive impairment due to AD-which poses management challenges-continues to be low. To identify areas for improvement in early AD management, dementia specialists convened in a virtual roundtable meeting. METHODOLOGY: A modified version of the nominal group technique was followed to prioritize specific topics and allow experts to provide their opinions. The overarching topics prioritized and discussed were (1) education and support for primary care physicians on cognitive assessment, detection of mild cognitive impairment, and patient monitoring; (2) nonpharmacological interventions; (3) and the introduction of disease-modifying therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was achieved regarding the need for educating primary care physicians on identifying people with cognitive impairment and for better diagnostic tools for its detection and early management. Management of mild cognitive impairment due to AD should encompass an adequate follow-up schedule aiming to maintain function for as long as possible, and primary care physicians and patients should be aware of the benefits of nonpharmacological interventions.
