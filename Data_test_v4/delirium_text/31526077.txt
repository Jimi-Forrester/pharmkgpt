METHOD: One hundred forty three patients with AD and their caregivers were included in the study. Sixty-five patients without AD who needed care due to their disability and their caregivers were enrolled for the comparison. Depression in caregivers was diagnosed using The Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (SCID-I). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale were used to evaluate the severity of AD. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess the NPSs of patients. Caregiver burden was evaluated using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). RESULTS: Inappropriate sexual behaviors were found in 13 (9.1%) of the AD group. Inappropriate sexual behaviors were more common in moderate or severe AD (P = .009, chi2 = 9.396). The prevalence of depression (n = 38, 26.6%) was higher in caregivers of AD group with ISBs (P = .000, chi2 = 24.69). The ZBI scores of caregivers of patients with AD were higher than the comparison group. In addition, the ZBI scores of caregivers of patients with AD were significantly higher in the AD group with ISB, a high total score of NPI, and a low score of MMSE. The caregivers of AD group with depression had higher ZBI scores (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of AD, the presence of NPSs in patients, and major depression in caregivers were risk factors for an increased caregiver burden.
