36625236|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) cannot currently be diagnosed by a blood test. One reason may be gender differences. Another may be the statistical methods used. The authors evaluate these possibilities. Objective: The authors applied serum lipidomics to find AD biomarkers in men and women. They hypothesized that AD biomarkers would differ between genders and that machine-learning algorithms would improve diagnostic performance. Methods: Serum lipids were analyzed by mass spectrometry for a training set of AD cases and controls and in a blinded test set. Statistical analyses considered gender differences. Results: Lipids best classifying AD subjects differed significantly between men and women. Robust statistical algorithms did not improve diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Poor performance of AD biomarkers appears to be due primarily to inherent variability in AD patients.
