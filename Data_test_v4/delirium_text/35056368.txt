35056368|t|YKL-40 as a Potential Biomarker for the Differential Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.
35056368|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, associated with extensive neuronal loss, dendritic and synaptic changes resulting in significant cognitive impairment. An increased number of studies have given rise to the neuroinflammatory hypothesis in AD. It is widely accepted that AD brains show chronic inflammation, probably triggered by the presence of insoluble amyloid beta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and is also related to the activation of neuronal death cascade. In the present study we aimed to investigate the role of YKL-40 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the diagnosis of AD, and to discuss whether there are further potential roles of this protein in the management and treatment of AD. We conducted an online search on PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library databases from 1990 to 2021. The quantitative analysis showed that the levels of YKL-40 were significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease compared to controls, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) AD (MCI-AD) and to stable MCI. They were also increased in MCI-AD compared to stable MCI. The present study shows that the CSF levels of YKL-40 could be potentially used as a biomarker for the prognosis of mild cognitive impairment and the likelihood of progression to AD, as well as for the differential diagnosis between AD and MCI.
