16023559|t|Error processing in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
16023559|a|Patients with dementia are prone to make errors while they perform a task. To evaluate error detection and action monitoring in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) at a relatively early stage of the illness, error negativity (Ne) and error positivity (Pe) of event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained by averages time-locked to error response were studied using a lexical recognition paradigm composed of Japanese 'kanji' ideogram characters. In the DAT patients, reaction times were significantly slower and error rates were higher. Not only in healthy elderly subjects but also in the DAT patients, the Ne component obtained by averages time-locked to error response showed a larger amplitude than negativity for correct response (Nc). The Ne and Pe amplitudes were significantly smaller for the DAT patients than for the healthy elderly subjects, whereas there were no significant differences in the Nc amplitude between the two subject groups. Latencies of the Ne, Pe and positivity for correct response (Pc) were prolonged in the DAT patients. These findings suggest that information processing and error detection are slower and somewhat impaired at a relatively early stage of DAT, although error detection and awareness are still preserved.
