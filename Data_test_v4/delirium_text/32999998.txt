32999998|t|Alignment of Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta-peptide and klotho.
32999998|a|The cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood. In 1991, the amyloid hypothesis postulated that beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation is a key element. It follows that clearing the brain of Abeta would be beneficial, which has not been the case. Therefore, Abeta is likely a result, not a cause, of AD and may be protective rather than harmful. The apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. Klotho (KL), encoded by the KL gene, may be another AD-related protein. FGF21 is a circulating endocrine hormone, mainly secreted by the liver, mostly during fasting. FGF21 acts by binding to its receptor FGFR1 and co-receptor beta-klotho. FGF21 is neuroprotective and could delay onset of AD. In the present study, the KL protein structure was examined to determine whether it may interact with Abeta. Protein data bank (pdb) entries for klotho and Abeta were searched on the RCSB Protein Data Bank for beta-KL and AD amyloid beta-peptide. The protein structures were superimposed and aligned on PYMOL v2.3.4 with the super command, which super aligns two protein selections. To evaluate the conservation and alignment of the Abeta and KL genomes across species, BLAT, the Blast-Like Alignment Tool of the UCSC Genome Browser, was used. The amino acid residues phe76-val96 of KL aligned closely with residues asp7-asn27 of Abeta. Cross-species comparison of KL revealed a high degree of alignment and conservation in the chimp and 27 other primates; however, less alignment and conservation were observed in the mouse, dog and elephant, even less in the chicken, western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), zebrafish and lamprey. The current finding of amino acid residues phe76-val96 of klotho aligning closely with residues asp7-asn27 of Abeta suggests that Abeta can enhance the ability of klotho to draw FGF21 to regions of incipient neurodegeneration in AD. The problem arises with age. Older individuals do not heal or repair tissue damage as well as younger individuals. As neurodegeneration advances in an older individual, perhaps caused by neuroinflammation related to herpes simplex virus type 1, increasing amounts of amyloid are produced, forming an adhesive web, as the brain tries to hold the pathologic process in check. Meanwhile, the damage increases and spreads. Progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline are the outcome.
