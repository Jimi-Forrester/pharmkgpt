35718823|t|Associations of 24 h urinary excretions of alpha- and gamma-carboxyethyl hydroxychroman with plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol and dietary vitamin E intake in older adults: the Lifelines-MINUTHE Study.
35718823|a|BACKGROUND: Urinary metabolites of vitamin E, i.e., alpha- and gamma-carboxyethyl hydroxychroman (alpha- and gamma-CEHC), have gained increasing attention and have been proposed as novel biomarkers of vitamin E intake and status. However, there are insufficient data on the relationship of plasma alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol and dietary vitamin E intake with 24 h urinary excretions of alpha- and gamma-CEHC. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (1) investigate the associations of urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios and 24 h urinary excretions of alpha- and gamma-CEHC with plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, respectively; (2) investigate the associations of urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios and 24 h urinary excretions of alpha- and gamma-CEHC with dietary vitamin E intake, and we hypothesize that 24 h urinary excretions of alpha- and gamma-CEHC will better correlate with vitamin E intake than urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios. DESIGN: 24 h Urine and plasma samples were collected from 1519 participants (60-75 years, male: 50%) included in the Lifelines-MINUTHE Study for the assessments of urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios and 24 h urinary excretions of alpha- and gamma-CEHC, and plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol. Among those participants, dietary vitamin E intake data from 387 participants were available from an externally validated Flower-Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The associations of plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, dietary vitamin E intake, with urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC were assessed using multivariate linear regressions. RESULTS: 24 h Urinary excretion of alpha-CEHC (median (IQR): 0.9 (0.3-2.4) micromol) was less than that of gamma-CEHC (median (IQR): 1.5 (0.5-3.5) micromol). After adjustment for covariates, we found that 24 h urinary alpha-CEHC excretion and urinary alpha-CEHC/creatinine ratio were both positively associated with plasma alpha-tocopherol (std.beta: 0.06, p = 0.02; std.beta: 0.06, p = 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, the sum of 24 h urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC excretions was positively associated with dietary vitamin E intake (std.beta: 0.08; p = 0.03), whereas there was no relation between urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios and vitamin E intake. No association was observed neither between plasma alpha- and gamma-tocopherol and dietary vitamin E intake, nor between urinary gamma-CEHC and plasma gamma-tocopherol. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed our hypothesis that 24 h urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC excretions would be a better marker for dietary vitamin E intake than urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios. Considering that both 24 h urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC excretions and alpha- and gamma-CEHC/creatinine ratios were also associated with plasma alpha-tocopherol status, we suggest that 24 h urinary alpha- and gamma-CEHC excretions could be used to assess overall vitamin E status.
