33539891|a|The anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is considered the keystone of periodontitis diseases, a set of inflammatory conditions that affects the tissues surrounding the teeth. In the recent years, the major virulence factors exploited by P. gingivalis have been identified and characterized, including a cocktail of toxins, mainly proteases called gingipains, which promote gingival tissue invasion. These effectors use the Sec pathway to cross the inner membrane and are then recruited and transported across the outer membrane by the type IX secretion system (T9SS). In P. gingivalis, most secreted effectors are attached to anionic lipopolysaccharides (A-LPS), and hence form a virulence coat at the cell surface. P. gingivalis produces additional virulence factors to evade host immune responses, such as capsular polysaccharide, fimbriae and outer membrane vesicles. In addition to periodontitis, it is proposed that this broad repertoire of virulence factors enable P. gingivalis to be involved in diverse human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative, Alzheimer, and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we review the major virulence determinants of P. gingivalis and discuss future directions to better understand their mechanisms of action.
