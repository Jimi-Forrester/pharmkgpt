29962343|a|BACKGROUND: Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) often experience feelings of lack of support and information from specialists when operating in real scenarios, inclusive of old-age psychiatric wards, care homes, community, and patient's home. OBJECTIVE: AD caregivers can provide narrative about what issues need to be addressed in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to capture real-time and real-scenario needs in AD caregiving, and Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) as online e-learning to assist in areas of concerns. METHOD: Twelve focus group discussions took place with AD caregivers for a total of 62 people interviewed. Once major themes in surveys and learning were identified by using discourse analysis, AD caregivers expressed the likelihood that these themes (where 0 meant "nil" and 1 meant "completely") would address their focal needs in caregiving and topics in learning. Z scores for proportions and Cohen's d effect size were calculated for each item reporting the averaged scores. RESULTS: AD caregivers indicated that the major areas of concern that could benefit from an EMA/EMI online platform were: support (d=3.08), collaboration (d=1.85), medication review (d=1.21), dealing with grief and mourning, and time (d=0.97). Moreover, they identified personal resources available to provide help to colleagues: support (d=1.34), information (d=0.97), collaboration (d=2.06), hospital admission (d=3.08), and hospital discharge (d=5.50). CONCLUSION: Focus groups and narratives can be the initial stage in creating a dedicated AD app supporting EMA/EMI in AD care.
