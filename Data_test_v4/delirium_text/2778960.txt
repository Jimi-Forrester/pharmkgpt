2778960|t|[A case of adenocarcinoma of the nasal cavity associated with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone(SIADH)].
2778960|a|An inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has been recognized as the cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, and the occurrence of this syndrome, accompanied by an ADH-producing adenocarcinoma in the nasal cavity, is reported. In February, 1987, a 50-year-old male, showing sights of delirium, disorientation, and irritability was admitted to the hospital. The patient was observed to be healthy, except for a neck lymphnode metastasis that was present up to the time of his hospitalization. The hyponatremia was incidentally found, although dehydration or intravascular volume depletion were not noted. These neuropsychiatric symptoms were considered to be associated with hyponatremia due to SIADH. He had had a partial maxillectomy, a neck dissection, and irradiation to the nose and nasal cavity 32 months earlier, and then underwent a surgical resection of the neck metastasis; he had a total of 10 other operations before the onset of the symptoms. Upon initial inspection, since neither an intracranial invasion nor a brain metastasis was found, we diagnosed that his symptoms were due to an autonomic disturbance caused by surgical and mental "stress". When he died of cardiac failure due to a mediastinal invasion 8 months after the onset of SIADH, tumor tissues was extirpated in an autopsy and was then cultured. In this manner, it was proved that the tumor cells had been producing ADH. This procedure clarified that the syndrome had resulted from an ADH-producing tumor of the nasal cavity.
