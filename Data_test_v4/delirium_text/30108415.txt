30108415|t|Insights from the sequence similarity of Zika virus proteins with the Human nerve proteins.
30108415|a|Massive peptide sharing between the Zika virus polyprotein and host tissue proteins could elicit significant host-pathogen interactions and cross-reactions leading to autoimmune diseases. This study found similarities in the Zika V proteins and human nerve tissue proteins. 63 human nerve proteins were screened for similarities with the Zika V of which Neuromodulin, Nestin, Galanin, Bombesin, Calcium-binding protein were found to have similarities to the Zika V poly protein C at different sequence regions. These sequence similarities could be significant in regulating pathogenic interactions/autoimmunity, as Polyprotein C is known to be a virulent factor.
