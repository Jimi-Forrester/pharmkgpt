38875039|t|Eye Adult Changes in Thought (Eye ACT) Study: Design and Report on the Inaugural Cohort.
38875039|a|Background: Conflicting research on retinal biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) is likely related to limited sample sizes, study design, and protocol differences. Objective: The prospective Eye Adult Changes in Thought (Eye ACT) seeks to address these gaps. Methods: Eye ACT participants are recruited from ACT, an ongoing cohort of dementia-free, older adults followed biennially until AD/ADRD, and undergo visual function and retinal imaging assessment either in clinic or at home. Results: 330 participants were recruited as of 03/2023. Compared to ACT participants not in Eye ACT (N = 1868), Eye ACT participants (N = 330) are younger (mean age: 70.3 versus 71.2, p = 0.014), newer to ACT (median ACT visits since baseline: 3 versus 4, p < 0.001), have more years of education (17.7 versus 16.2, p < 0.001) and had lower rates of visual impairment (12% versus 22%, p < 0.001). Compared to those seen in clinic (N = 300), Eye ACT participants seen at home (N = 30) are older (77.2 versus 74.9, p = 0.015), more frequently female (60% versus 49%, p = 0.026), and have significantly worse visual acuity (71.1 versus 78.9 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, p < 0.001) and contrast sensitivity (-1.9 versus -2.1 mean log units at 3 cycles per degree, p = 0.002). Cognitive scores and retinal imaging measurements are similar between the two groups. Conclusions: Participants assessed at home had significantly worse visual function than those seen in clinic. By including these participants, Eye ACT provides a unique longitudinal cohort for evaluating potential retinal biomarkers of dementia.
