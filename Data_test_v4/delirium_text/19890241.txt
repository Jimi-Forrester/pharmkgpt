19890241|a|A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial abnormalities are involved in aging and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancer, diabetes, and several other diseases known to be affected by mitochondria. Causal factors for most age-related neurodegenerative diseases-including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Friedrich ataxia (FRDA)-are largely unknown. Genetic defects are reported to cause a small number of neurodegenerative diseases, but cellular, molecular, and pathological mechanisms of disease progression and selective neuronal cell death are not understood fully in these diseases. However, based on several cellular, molecular, and animal model studies of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, FRDA, cancer, and diabetes, aging may play a large role in cell death in these diseases. Age-dependent, mitochondrially-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been identified as important factors responsible for disease progression and cell death, particularly in late-onset diseases, in which genetic mutations are not causal factors.
