20641523|a|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease associated with an irreversible decline of mental functions and with cognitive impairment (1, 2). It is characterized by the presence, in the brain, of senile plaques of b-amyloid (Ab) peptides with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of filaments containing the hyperphosphorylated protein tau (3, 4). Accelerated deposition of Ab deposits seems to be a key risk factor associated with AD, and although the mechanisms of the disease are still not fully understood, reducing the deposition of amyloid plaques seems to benefit patients. Several radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed (5-7) and tested in humans as <i>in vivo</i> diagnostic tools for imaging and measuring the formation and Ab deposits (7). The first successful agent used in human studies was [<sup>18</sup>F]FDDNP (8), a malonitrile derivative found to bind to both neurofibrillary tangles and b-amyloid plaques. The second successful attempt was made with [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB (9), also known as Pittsburgh Compound B or [<sup>11</sup>C]6-OH-BTA-1. [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB showed marked retention in areas of association cortex known to contain substantial amounts of Ab deposits. The third PET radioligand tested in humans was [<sup>11</sup>C]4-<i>N</i>-methylamino-4 -hydroxystilbene, a stilbene derivative commonly named [<sup>11</sup>C]SB-13. SB-13 can be labeled with either I-123 or C-11 for <i>in vivo</i> imaging using photon emission computerized tomography or PET. Research studies reported in the literature showed that [<sup>11</sup>C]SB-13 has selective high-affinity binding to amyloid plaques and demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> properties similar to those of [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB when used in AD patients.
