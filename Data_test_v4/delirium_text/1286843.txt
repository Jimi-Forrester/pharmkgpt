1286843|t|[Importance of the EEG in early and differential diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type].
1286843|a|The development of new parameters in the quantitative evaluation of EEG provides new diagnostic opportunities for the clinician. Reviewing all published papers on EEG and dementia over the last 10 years revealed 30 out of 428 studies discussing EEG alterations in relation to the severity of the disease. This approach provides useful information for early and differential diagnosis of dementia. Besides a generalised slowing-down represented by an increase of delta and theta and a decrease of alpha and beta in the frequency spectrum (also characterised by a reduction of the peak frequency), the topography of the alterations changes depending on the severity of the disease. For instance, the alpha activity loses its normally occipital orientation. In early stages of the disease, it is measured parietally ("anteriorized"). In advanced stages, the activity is equally distributed over the scalp. Some studies found significant alterations even in early stages of the disease, most pronounced in theta and beta activity, making the EEG a useful tool for the early diagnosis of dementia. But studies on the differential diagnostic value are lacking. The value of EEG could be improved after parameters like the EEG segmentation or the traditional parameters combined with cognitive stimulation have been sufficiently evaluated.
