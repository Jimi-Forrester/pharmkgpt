38339955|a|The network nature of the brain is gradually becoming a consensus in the neuroscience field. A set of highly connected regions in the brain network called "rich-club" are crucial high efficiency communication hubs in the brain. The abnormal rich-club organization can reflect underlying abnormal brain function and metabolism, which receives increasing attention. Diabetes is one of the risk factors for neurological diseases, and most individuals with prediabetes will develop overt diabetes within their lifetime. However, the gradual impact of hyperglycemia on brain structures, including rich-club organization, remains unclear. We hypothesized that the brain follows a special disrupted pattern of rich-club organization in prediabetes and diabetes. We used cross-sectional baseline data from the population-based PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events (PRECISE) study, which included 2218 participants with a mean age of 61.3 +- 6.6 years and 54.1% females comprising 1205 prediabetes, 504 diabetes, and 509 normal control subjects. The rich-club organization and network properties of the structural networks derived from diffusion tensor imaging data were investigated using a graph theory approach. Linear mixed models were used to assess associations between rich-club organization disruptions and the subjects' glucose status. Based on the graphical analysis methods, we observed the disrupted pattern of rich-club organization was from peripheral regions mainly located in frontal areas to rich-club regions mainly located in subcortical areas from prediabetes to diabetes. The rich-club organization disruptions were associated with elevated glucose levels. These findings provided more details of the process by which hyperglycemia affects the brain, contributing to a better understanding of the potential neurological consequences. Furthermore, the disrupted pattern observed in rich-club organization may serve as a potential neuroimaging marker for early detection and monitoring of neurological disorders in individuals with prediabetes or diabetes.
