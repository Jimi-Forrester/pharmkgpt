We conducted a study to determine the relationship between cognition evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and poor functional outcomes assessed by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (mRS >= 2) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)-16(SIS-16<25%). METHODS: The data of this study come from the impairment of cognition and Sleep (ICONS) after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in Chinese patients study. A total of 1675 minor stroke patients and TIA patients were finally recruited. Patients' cognition were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale at 2-week (2w), 3 months (3 m) and 1 year(1y). Cognitive impairment (CI) was defined as MoCA score <= 22. According to MoCA score, patients were divided into 4 groups: no PSCI group: with MoCA-2w>22 and MoCA-3 m>22; improved PSCI group: with MoCA-2w <= 2 and MoCA-3 m>22;delayed PSCI group: MoCA-2w>22 and MoCA-3 m <= 22; persisting PSCI group: with MoCA-2w <= 22 and MoCA-3 m <= 22. RESULTS: A total of 1675 stroke patients were recruited in this study. There were 818 patients (48.84%) who had PSCI at baseline. Of these, 123 patients (15%) had mRS >=2 at 3 months. The persisting PSCI group was a significant predictor of functional dependence at 3 months and 1 year after stroke and when adjusted for covariates such as gender, age, history of stroke, depression and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, stroke subtype and acute infarction type. CONCLUSION: Persisting PSCI increased the risk of poor functional outcome after 3 months and 1 year follow-up. These high-risk individuals should be identified for targeted rehabilitation and counseling to improve longer-term post-stroke outcome.
