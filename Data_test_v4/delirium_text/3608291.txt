3608291|t|Neurofibrillary neuronal degeneration in dialysis dementia: a feature of aluminum toxicity.
3608291|a|Neurofibrillary material was found in cortical neurons in two patients who died with dialysis encephalopathy. The cytoplasm of these neurons contained large amounts of aluminum and whole-brain and blood aluminum levels were high. These findings suggest that in dialysis encephalopathy aluminum has a specific effect on neuronal protein synthesis, resulting in the accumulation of neurofilaments in cortical neurons. This neurofibrillary neuronal degeneration resembles that found in experimental aluminum toxicity, but differs in several respects from the neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.
