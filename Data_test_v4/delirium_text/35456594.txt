35456594|t|Dendrimers as Antiamyloid Agents.
35456594|a|Dendrimer-protein conjugates have significant prospects for biological applications. The complexation changes the biophysical behavior of both proteins and dendrimers. The dendrimers could influence the secondary structure of proteins, zeta-potential, distribution of charged regions on the surface, the protein-protein interactions, etc. These changes offer significant possibilities for the application of these features in nanotheranostics and biomedicine. Based on the dendrimer-protein interactions, several therapeutic applications of dendrimers have emerged. Thus, the formation of stable complexes retains the disordered proteins on the aggregation, which is especially important in neurodegenerative diseases. To clarify the origin of these properties and assess the efficiency of action, the mechanism of protein-dendrimer interaction and the nature and driving force of binding are considered in this review. The review outlines the antiamyloid activity of dendrimers and discusses the effect of dendrimer structures and external factors on their antiamyloid properties.
