37834358|t|Analysis of Potential Biomarkers in Frontal Temporal Dementia: A Bioinformatics Approach.
37834358|a|Frontal temporal dementia (FTD) is a neurological disorder known to have fewer therapeutic options. So far, only a few biomarkers are available for FTD that can be used as potential comorbidity targets. For example, genes such as VCP, which has a role in breast cancer, and WFS1, which has a role in COVID-19, are known to show a role in FTD as well. To this end, in the present study, we aim to identify potential biomarkers or susceptible genes for FTD that show comorbidities with diseases such as COVID-19 and breast cancer. A dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus containing FTD expression profiles from African American and white ethnicity backgrounds was included in our study. In FTD samples of the GSE193391 dataset, we identified 305 DEGs, with 168 genes being up-regulated and 137 genes being down-regulated. We conducted a comorbidity analysis for COVID-19 and breast cancer, followed by an analysis of potential drug interactions, pathogenicity, analysis of genetic variants, and functional enrichment analysis. Our results showed that the genes AKT3, GFAP, ADCYAP1R1, VDAC1, and C4A have significant transcriptomic alterations in FTD along with the comorbidity status with COVID-19 and breast cancer. Functional pathway analysis revealed that these comorbid genes were significantly enriched in the pathways such as glioma, JAK/STAT signaling, systematic lupus erythematosus, neurodegeneration-multiple diseases, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Overall, from these results, we concluded that these genes could be recommended as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of comorbidities (breast cancer and COVID-19) in patients with FTD.
