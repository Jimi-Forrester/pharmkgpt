34844648|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis is often associated with multiple organ failure; however, changes in brain volume with sepsis are not well understood. We assessed brain atrophy in the acute phase of sepsis using brain computed tomography (CT) scans, and their findings' relationship to risk factors and outcomes. METHODS: Patients with sepsis admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and who underwent at least two head CT scans during hospitalization were included (n = 48). The first brain CT scan was routinely performed on admission, and the second and further brain CT scans were obtained whenever prolonged disturbance of consciousness or abnormal neurological findings were observed. Brain volume was estimated using an automatic segmentation method and any changes in brain volume between the two scans were recorded. Patients with a brain volume change < 0% from the first CT scan to the second CT scan were defined as the "brain atrophy group (n = 42)", and those with >= 0% were defined as the "no brain atrophy group (n = 6)." Use and duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and mortality were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Analysis of all 42 cases in the brain atrophy group showed a significant decrease in brain volume (first CT scan: 1.041 +- 0.123 L vs. second CT scan: 1.002 +- 0.121 L, t (41) = 9.436, p < 0.001). The mean percentage change in brain volume between CT scans in the brain atrophy group was -3.7% over a median of 31 days, which is equivalent to a brain volume of 38.5 cm3. The proportion of cases on mechanical ventilation (95.2% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.02) and median time on mechanical ventilation (28 [IQR 15-57] days vs. 15 [IQR 0-25] days, p = 0.04) were significantly higher in the brain atrophy group than in the no brain atrophy group. CONCLUSIONS: Many ICU patients with severe sepsis who developed prolonged mental status changes and neurological sequelae showed signs of brain atrophy. Patients with rapidly progressive brain atrophy were more likely to have required mechanical ventilation.
