32168511|t|Implementing the ABCDE Bundle, Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool, and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale to Reduce Ventilation Time.
32168511|a|Prolonged mechanical ventilation of patients in intensive care units across the United States consumes billions of health care dollars every year. Using the awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management, and early mobility (ABCDE) bundle along with the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale combines the best available evidence to optimize outcomes for critically ill patients. This study is the first to examine the effects of implementing the ABCDE bundle, the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool, and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale together in a coordinated effort across multiple disciplines. The aim of using this combination of evidence-based tools is to reduce ventilation time by reducing oversedation, decreasing the incidence of delirium, and improving pain management.
