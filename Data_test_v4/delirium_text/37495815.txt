37495815|a|Aluminum (Al) is a neurotoxic substance associated with cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms for aluminum neurotoxicity remain to be identified. In this work, we try to investigate a novel potential biomarker of cognitive dysfunction following aluminum exposure and the mechanism involved. Recently, miR-134-3p was reported as a novel regulator of cognitive function. To address this, we investigate the expression level of miR-134-3p in plasma from 280 aluminum factory workers and analyzed the correlation between miRNA-134-3p, blood Al concentration, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA scale) score. The results implied that occupational aluminum exposure elevated miR-134-3p expression in the plasma of workers accompanied by cognitive impairment. Our experiment studies using both animal models and PC12 cells validated the upregulation of miR-134-3p caused by aluminum. In addition, we identified that palmitoylation enzyme zDHHC3 was the target of miR-134-3p, and the decreasing AMPAR receptor (AMPAR) trafficking was related to the learning and memory impairment induced by aluminum. More importantly, using transfection and interference approaches in PC12 cells, inhibition of miR-134-3p resulted in a recovery of zDHHC3-AMPARs axis to a certain extent in response to aluminum. In summary, miR-134-3p was found to be involved in aluminum neurotoxicity by targeting zDHHC3-AMPARs axis and could serve as a potential biomarker or helpful target.
