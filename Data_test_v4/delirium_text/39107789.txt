39107789|a|Lewy body dementia (LBD), a class of disorders comprising Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), features substantial clinical and pathological overlap with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The identification of biomarkers unique to LBD pathophysiology could meaningfully advance its diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we measured over 9,000 proteins across 138 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues from a University of Pennsylvania autopsy collection comprising control, Parkinson's disease (PD), PDD, and DLB diagnoses. We then analyzed co-expression network protein alterations in those with LBD, validated these disease signatures in two independent LBD datasets, and compared these findings to those observed in network analyses of AD cases. The LBD network revealed numerous groups or "modules" of co-expressed proteins significantly altered in PDD and DLB, representing synaptic, metabolic, and inflammatory pathophysiology. A comparison of validated LBD signatures to those of AD identified distinct differences between the two diseases. Notably, synuclein-associated presynaptic modules were elevated in LBD but decreased in AD relative to controls. We also found that glial-associated matrisome signatures consistently elevated in AD were more variably altered in LBD, ultimately stratifying those LBD cases with low versus high burdens of concurrent beta-amyloid deposition. In conclusion, unbiased network proteomic analysis revealed diverse pathophysiological changes in the LBD frontal cortex distinct from alterations in AD. These results highlight the LBD brain network proteome as a promising source of biomarkers that could enhance clinical recognition and management.
