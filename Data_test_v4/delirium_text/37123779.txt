37123779|a|Background Gender-affirming pelvic surgery (GAPS) can be associated with significant postoperative pelvic pain. Given the lack of available peripheral nerve blocks to the perineum, intrathecal morphine (ITM) injection could offer a potent analgesic modality for this patient population. No prior studies to date have been performed examining the analgesic effects of intrathecal morphine for these patients. Methods This retrospective case-control study aims to understand the postoperative analgesic effects of intrathecal morphine for these patients with a historical comparison group of patients who did not receive intrathecal morphine. Results Fourteen patients presented for gender-affirming pelvic surgery over an eight-month period at a single institution and were offered intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia. Their analgesic results were compared to a similar historical group of 13 patients who were not offered or declined intrathecal morphine. Conclusions Intrathecal morphine injection is a potent analgesic modality for patients presenting for gender-affirming pelvic surgery.
