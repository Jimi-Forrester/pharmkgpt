38612989|a|Insulin resistance (IR)-related miRNAs have been associated with the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The dietary modulation of these miRNAs could become a potential strategy to manage AD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD), which aggravates AD-related pathogenic processes, on serum, cortex and hippocampus IR-related miRNA expression. C57BL/6J WT and APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice were fed either an HFD or a conventional diet till 6 months of age. The mice fed with the HFD showed a significant increase in body weight and worsening glucose and insulin metabolism. miR-19a-3p was found to be up-regulated in the cortex, hippocampus and serum of APP/PS1 mice and in the serum and hippocampus of WT mice fed with the HFD. miR-34a-5p and miR-146a-5p were up-regulated in the serum of both groups of mice after consuming the HFD. Serum miR-29c-3p was overexpressed after consuming the HFD, along with hippocampal miR-338-3p and miR-125b-5p, only in WT mice. The HFD modulated the expression of peripheral and brain miRNAs related to glucose and insulin metabolism, suggesting the potential role of these miRNAs not only as therapeutic targets of AD but also as peripheral biomarkers for monitoring AD.
