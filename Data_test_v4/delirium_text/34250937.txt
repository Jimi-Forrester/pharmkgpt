34250937|a|BACKGROUND: Possible benefits of makeup therapy, in terms of immediate and late effects on cognitive and affective functions, have not been fully proved for dementia patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate effect of makeup therapy on dementia patients. METHODS: Female nursing home residents with dementia received either only skin care treatment (control group, n = 17) or skin care plus makeup therapy treatment (makeup therapy group, n = 19). Cognitive, affective, and activity of daily living (ADL) scores were evaluated before and just after treatments. Apparent age and emotion were also evaluated with artificial intelligence (AI) software. RESULTS: Makeup therapy significantly improved Abe's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) score (ABS, *p < 0.05). AI software judged that makeup therapy significantly made the apparent age younger (*p < 0.05). In particular, patients with moderate ADL scores had a significantly higher happiness score in makeup therapy (*p < 0.05), with a modest correlation to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, r = 0.42, *p < 0.05). The severe baseline MMSE group reported a greater feeling of satisfaction following makeup therapy (*p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present makeup therapy is a promising non-pharmacological approach to immediately alleviate BPSD in female dementia patients, and the present AI software quickly and quantitatively evaluated the beneficial effects of makeup therapy on facial appearance.
