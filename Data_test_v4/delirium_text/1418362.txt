1418362|a|Dosage and tolerance are critical issues in successful drug therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A clear distinction among patient populations and AD patient subpopulations is necessary to ensure a thorough assessment of new central nervous system-active compounds. Phase I inpatient trials, in which tolerance and safety are evaluated under double-blind conditions in the target population, provide valuable information for use in planning multicenter outpatient trials. In similar studies, even those involving the elderly, tolerance and safety outcomes in healthy volunteers are not always predictable. An early trial of the effects of velnacrine in healthy, elderly, male volunteers was followed by a trial in the target population. A group of volunteers, aged 60 to 74 years who did not have AD, received 300 mg of velnacrine each day. This dosage was well tolerated for 28 days. Diarrhea, generally of moderate severity, was the only reported adverse effect. No subjects were required to discontinue taking velnacrine. In contrast, a similar trial showed a dosage of 300 mg of velnacrine each day intolerable among patients with AD. Adverse reactions to dosages greater than 225 mg/day included dizziness, fainting, nausea and/or vomiting, headache, and severe diarrhea. A velnacrine dosage of 225 mg/day appeared to be safe and well tolerated in a small population of healthy patients with AD. Based on the inpatient experience with AD subjects, a maximum dose of 225 mg/day was adopted for outpatient studies. Although factors that may contribute to drug sensitivity in patients with AD vary beyond conclusive parameters, the observed sensitivity within the target AD group may indicate a safety/tolerance study as a worthwhile antecedent to multicenter efficacy trials.
