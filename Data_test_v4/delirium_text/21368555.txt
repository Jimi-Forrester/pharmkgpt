21368555|a|We report the case of a male gastric cancer patient who had undergone outpatient chemotherapy with TAXOTAL+TS-1 for adrenal and lung metastases.The disease was in progress.Next, we performed home chemotherapy with TAXOL.However, this chemotherapy also was not effective either.Therefore, the patient was started on Campto with the premedication including NaseaOD, GasterD and Decadron.The 17-course was performed in the period of 12 months.However, his condition did not improve.He experienced delirium and was hospitalized and the chemotherapy was discontinued.Later, his disease was advanced further and he died.Because of our close relationship with the general hospital, this patient had undergone home chemotherapy as long as 13 months, so that if a seamless cooperation was insured, chemotherapy could have been more safely and effectively performed at the patient's home.This study suggests that home chemotherapy is an important treatment modality.
