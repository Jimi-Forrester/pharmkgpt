29757991|t|A Review: The Bioactivities and Pharmacological Applications of Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharides.
29757991|a|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used in China and is regarded as the most important therapeutic. Polygonatum sibiricum (PS), a natural plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, has various functions associated with a number of its components. There are many compositions in PS including polysaccharides, steroids, anthraquinone, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, lignin, vitamins, various acids, and so on. Of these, polysaccharides play a significant role in PS-based therapeutics. This article summarizes Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharides (PSP) have many pharmacological applications and biological activities, such as their antioxidant activity, anti-aging activity, an anti-fatigue effect, immunity enhancement effect, antibacterial effect, anti-inflammatory effect, hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic effects, anti-osteoporosis effect, liver protection, treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), anti-cancer effect, and may help prevent Alzheimer's disease, and so on. This review summarized the extraction method, purification method, compositions, pharmacological applications, biological activities, biosynthesis, and prospects of PSP, providing a basis for further study of PS and PSP.
