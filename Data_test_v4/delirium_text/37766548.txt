37766548|t|Middle aged CAMKII-Cre:CBSfl/fl mice: a new model for studying perioperative neurocognitive disorders.
37766548|a|Postoperative complications, such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), have become a major issue affecting surgical outcomes. However, the mechanism of PND remains unclear, and stable animal models of middle-aged PND are lacking. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) allosteric activator, can reduce the level of plasma homocysteine and prevent the occurrence of PND. However, the time and resource-intensive process of constructing models of PND in elderly animals have limited progress in PND research and innovative therapy development. The present study aimed to construct a stable PND model in middle-aged CAMKII-Cre:CBSfl/fl mice whose CBS was specifically knocked out in CAMKII positive neurons. Behavioral tests showed that these middle-aged mice displayed cognitive deficits which were aggravated by exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Compared with typical PND mice which were 18-month-old, these middle-aged mice showed similar cognitive deficits after undergoing exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Though there was no significant difference in the number of neurons in either the hippocampus or the cortex, a significant increase in numbers of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus was observed. These indicate that middle-aged CAMKII-Cre:CBSfl/fl mice can be used as a new PND model for mechanistic studies and therapy development for PND.
