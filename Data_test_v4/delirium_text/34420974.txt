34420974|t|Incremental Healthcare Utilization and Cost Burden of Comorbid Insomnia in Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
34420974|a|BACKGROUND: Insomnia is associated with worsened clinical outcomes among Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) patients, increased caregiver burden, and healthcare utilization. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the incremental healthcare burden of insomnia in AD using real-world data. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on AD patients selected from the IBM  MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. AD patients with claims-based evidence of insomnia were direct matched to a non-insomnia cohort based on demographic factors. Healthcare utilization and associated costs were assessed for a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 3,500 insomnia AD patients and 9,884 non-insomnia AD patients were analyzed. The insomnia cohort had a higher comorbidity burden at baseline (mean score on Charlson Comorbidity Index 2.5 versus 2.2, p < 0.001) and higher proportions of patients with baseline diagnoses for other conditions including depression: 40%, insomnia cohort versus 25%, non-insomnia (p < 0.001). AD patients with insomnia were more likely to have a claim for inpatient hospitalizations (39.8%versus 32.3%), emergency room services (56.4%versus 48.0%), and skilled-nursing services (42.6%versus 31.9%) (all p < 0.05). Mean total annual healthcare costs during the 12-month follow-up period were significantly higher among AD patients with insomnia as compared to those without. (Mean costs: $37,356 versus $27,990, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: AD patients with comorbid insomnia are more likely to use higher-cost healthcare services such as inpatient hospitalization, and skilled nursing, and have higher total healthcare costs. This real-world analysis provides evidence that AD disease management should consider proper treatment of comorbid insomnia due to the incremental burden and cost implications.
