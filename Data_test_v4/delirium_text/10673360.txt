10673360|t|Implication of novel biochemical property of beta-amyloid.
10673360|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder with a variety of molecular pathologies converging predominantly on abnormal amyloid deposition particularly in the brain. beta-Amyloid aggregation into senile plaques is one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. beta-Amyloid is generated by a proteolytic cleavage of a large membrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP). We have observed a new property of beta-amyloid. The amyloid 1-42 beta fragment, when aggregated, possesses proteolytic and esterase-like activity, in vitro. Three independent methods were used to test the new property of beta-amyloid. While esterase activity involves imidazole catalysis, proteolytic activity is consistent with participation of a serine peptidase triad: catalytic Ser, His and Glu (or Asp). Although the amino acid triad is a necessary requirement for the protease reactivity, it is not sufficient since the secondary structure of the protein significantly contributes to the proteolytic activity. The ability of beta-amyloid to cleave peptide or ester bonds could be thus responsible for either inactivation of other proteins and/or APP proteolysis itself. This property may be responsible for early pathogenesis of AD since there is emerging evidence that non-plaque amyloid is elevated in Alzheimer patients.
