39856764|a|BACKGROUND: Exosomes, as extracellular membrane vesicles, play important roles in intercellular communication and can influence tumour progression. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported in various malignancies and are also important components of exosomes. However, the role of exosomal circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) progression has not been completely clarified. METHODS: The exosomal circRNAs enriched in GC were identified using exosomal circRNA sequencing. The biological function of circMAN1A2 in GC was investigated using a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. PKH-67 staining was used to label the exosomes. The molecular mechanism of exosomal circMAN1A2 was investigated via mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data analyses. RESULTS: In our study, we determined that circMAN1A2 (hsa_circ_0000118) was enriched in GC-derived exosomes. Higher circMAN1A2 expression was related to poor survival in GC patients (HR = 2.917, p = 0.0120). Exosomal circMAN1A2 promoted GC progression in vitro and in vivo and suppressed the antitumour activity of T cells. Moreover, circMAN1A2 bound to SFPQ in GC cells and T cells, promoting the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle in GC cells while inhibiting the activation of the T cell receptor signalling pathway in T cells to decrease antitumour activity. Mechanistically, circMAN1A2 competed with FBXW11 for binding to SFPQ, preventing FBXW11-mediated k48-linked ubiquitination and SFPQ protein degradation, thereby stabilizing SFPQ expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our work confirms the critical role of exosomal circMAN1A2 in the progression and immunosuppression of GC. This novel axis of circMAN1A2-SFPQ provides new insights into exosomal circRNA-based GC diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
