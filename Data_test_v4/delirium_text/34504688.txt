34504688|a|Background: Non-communicable diseases, the major cause of death and disability, are susceptible to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by 4-5 times and can lead to cardiovascular mortality. This study was conducted to assess the effects of different sociodemographic factors on stroke development in patients with AF. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and June 2018 on patients recruited from Lebanese community pharmacies. The CHA 2DS 2-VASc scoring system is utilized as a stroke risk stratification tool in AF patients. Participants with a previous physician diagnosis of AF, documented on medical records, were included in this study. Results: A total of 524 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 58.75 (+- SD) +- 13.59 years with hypertension (78.38%) being the most predominant disease. The results showed that obesity (Beta=0.610, p-value =0.011), retirement and unemployment compared to employment (Beta=1.440 and 1.440, p-value=0.001 respectively), divorced/widow compared to married (Beta=1.380, p-value =0.001) were significantly associated with higher CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores whereas high versus low socio-economic status (Beta=-1.030, p=0.009) and high school education versus primary education level (Beta=-0.490, p-value=0.025) were significantly associated with lower CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores. Conclusions: The study highlights that the CHA 2DS 2-VASc score is affected by the presence of various sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics in patients with AF. Thus, screening for those factors may predict the progression of cardiovascular disease and may provide an optimal intervention.
