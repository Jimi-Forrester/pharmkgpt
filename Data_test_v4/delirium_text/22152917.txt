22152917|a|Research into the human genome has undoubtedly opened up a new perspective in medicine. The ability to identify the cause of specific diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases, will definitively change the concepts of disease and treatment, while advances such as antibiotic therapy and anesthesia will be relegated to history. However, the arrival of genome medicine poses major bioethical challenges, many of which remain to be resolved. We review the applicability, results and consequences of predictions based on genetic tests for presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, as well as the dilemmas and contradictions that are already arising as a result of the commercialization of predictive tests for public use with little or no medical supervision. Given that there is currently no effective treatment of Alzheimers disease, the greatest challenge and contradiction lies in managing the results of predictive tests. There are no indications for the performance of predictive genetic tests in late or sporadic Alzheimer's disease or for counselling of persons requesting these tests. The PICOGEN program provides a safe, effective, reliable and satisfactory option for persons requesting these tests who meet the inclusion criteria. Currently, caution should be the norm when considering the performance of predictive tests in presymptomatic dementia.
