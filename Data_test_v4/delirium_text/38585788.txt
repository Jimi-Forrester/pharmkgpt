38585788|t|Dynamic fibrillar assembly of alphaB-crystallin induced by perturbation of the conserved NT-IXI motif resolved by cryo-EM.
38585788|a|alphaB-crystallin is an archetypical member of the small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) vital for cellular proteostasis and mitigating protein misfolding diseases. Gaining insights into the principles defining their molecular organization and chaperone function have been hindered by intrinsic dynamic properties and limited high-resolution structural analysis. To disentangle the mechanistic underpinnings of these dynamical properties, we mutated a conserved IXI-motif located within the N-terminal (NT) domain of human alphaB-crystallin. This resulted in a profound structural transformation, from highly polydispersed caged-like native assemblies into a comparatively well-ordered helical fibril state amenable to high-resolution cryo-EM analysis. The reversible nature of the induced fibrils facilitated interrogation of functional effects due to perturbation of the NT-IXI motif in both the native-like oligomer and fibril states. Together, our investigations unveiled several features thought to be key mechanistic attributes to sHSPs and point to a critical significance of the NT-IXI motif in alphaB-crystallin assembly, dynamics and chaperone activity.
