38202104|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fractures are the most common fracture leading to hospitalization and are associated with high costs, mortality rates and functional decline. Although several guidelines exist for preventing new fractures and promoting functional recovery, they tend to focus on osteoporosis treatment and do not take into account the complexity of frailty in older adults and geriatric syndromes, which are important factors in individuals at risk of suffering from frailty fractures. Moreover, most health systems are fragmented and are incapable of providing appropriate management for frail and vulnerable individuals who are at risk of experiencing fragility fractures. Multicomponent interventions and physical exercise using tele-rehabilitation could play a role in the management of hip fracture recovery. However, the effectiveness of exercise prescription and its combination with a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is still unclear. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial will be conducted at the Hospital Universitario de Navarra (Pamplona, Spain). A total of 174 older adults who have suffered a hip fracture and fulfil the criteria for inclusion will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive a multicomponent intervention consisting of individualized home-based exercise using the @ctive hip app for three months, followed by nine months of exercise using Vivifrail. Additionally, the intervention group will receive nutrition intervention, osteoporosis treatment, polypharmacy adjustment and evaluation of patient mood, cognitive impairment and fear of falling. The control group will receive standard outpatient care according to local guidelines. This research aims to evaluate the impact of the intervention on primary outcome measures, which include changes in functional status during the study period based on the Short Physical Performance Battery. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will offer valuable insights into the efficacy of a comprehensive approach that considers the complexity of frailty in older adults and geriatric syndromes, which are important factors in individuals at risk of suffering from frailty fractures. This study's findings will contribute to the creation of more effective strategies tailored to the requirements of these at-risk groups.
