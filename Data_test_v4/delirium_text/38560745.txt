38560745|t|Use of Dexamethasone for Severe Fatigue in the Advanced Cancer Population: A Brief Report.
38560745|a|Background: Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom for palliative care patients. Although the current literature emphasizes nonpharmacological management, dexamethasone is reportedly used in clinical practice. This study helps to characterize its use, efficacy, and adverse effects in a real-world setting. Objective: To improve the evidence base by exploring the use, efficacy, and side effect profile of dexamethasone for fatigue management. Methods: This international multisite prospective observational case series assessed the benefit and adverse effects of dexamethasone at baseline (T0) and at five to seven days postbaseline (T1). Fatigue scores were assessed using the symptom assessment scale (SAS) and visual analogue fatigue scale (VAFS). Adverse events were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). The related samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare before and after scores. Results: All 18 patients (male-female, 11:7) had advanced metastatic cancer with most in the deteriorating palliative care phase (56%). The most common dose of dexamethasone was 4 mg daily orally. At T1 (n = 12), improvement was seen in all measures of fatigue; the median SAS scores decreased from 7 to 5.5 (p = 0.007), the median VAFS scores increased from 3 to 5 (p = 0.126), and the median NCI-CTCAE fatigue scores were reduced from 3 to 2.5 (p = 0.18). Dexamethasone was well tolerated; one participant experienced grade 3 delirium. Conclusion: The small number of participants recruited for this study suggests that dexamethasone is not widely used specifically for fatigue. Our results suggest an improvement in fatigue scores from T0 to T1.
