34095990|t|Optimized Propofol Anesthesia Increases Power of Subthalamic Neuronal Activity in Patients with Parkinson's Disease Undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation.
34095990|a|INTRODUCTION: Propofol is a general anesthetic option for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its effects on STN activity and neuropsychological outcomes are controversial. The optimal propofol anesthesia for asleep DBS is unknown. This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of an optimized propofol anesthesia regimen in asleep DBS. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 68 PD patients undergoing bilateral STN-DBS surgery. All patients received local scalp anesthesia, with (asleep group, n = 35) or without (awake group, n = 33) propofol-remifentanil general anesthesia by target-controlled infusion under electroencephalogram monitoring. The primary outcome was subthalamic neuronal spiking characterization during microelectrode recording. The secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes including motor, cognition, mind, sleep, and quality of life at 6 months. RESULTS: Significantly increased delta and theta power were obtained under propofol anesthesia (awake vs. asleep group, mean +- standard deviation; delta: 31.97 +- 9.87 vs. 39.77 +- 10.56, p < 0.01; theta: 21.09 +- 5.55 vs. 24.82 +- 6.63, p = 0.01). After excluding the influence of confounding factors of age and preoperative motor scores, there was a statistically significant influence on the delta, theta, and alpha power of STN neuronal activity under different anesthesia regimens (delta: beta = 2.64, p < 0.01; theta: beta = 2.11, p < 0.01; alpha: beta = 1.42, p = 0.01). There were no differences in modified burst index, firing rate, tract numbers of microelectrode recording, and other clinical outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Optimized propofol anesthesia enhanced the delta, theta, and alpha power in STN compared with the awake technique and likely contributed to target recognition under propofol anesthesia. These results demonstrate that propofol is suitable, but needs to be optimized, for asleep STN-DBS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identification number: ChiCTR2100045942.
