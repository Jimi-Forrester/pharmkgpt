29865063|t|Sex Moderates the Impact of Diagnosis and Amyloid PET Positivity on Hippocampal Subfield Volume.
29865063|a|We examined moderation effects of sex and diagnosis on the effect of positive florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-beta (Abeta) scan (A+) on hippocampus subfield volumes in 526 normal control (NC) and early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI2; ADNI-GO). Regression moderation models showed that women- but not men- with NC designation did not show reduced subiculum volumes despite A+. At the eMCI stage, A+ was detrimental across sexes. Findings were significant while accounting for the effects of age, cognition at screening, education, and APOE4 carrier status. These findings suggest that women with A+ have early neural resistance to Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid burden.
