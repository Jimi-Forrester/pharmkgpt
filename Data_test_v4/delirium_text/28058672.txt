28058672|a|BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin (Ig) treatment is known to alleviate behavioral deficits and increase survival in the experimentally induced model of sepsis. To delineate the mechanisms by which IVIg treatment prevents neuronal dysfunction, an array of immunological and apoptosis markers was investigated. METHODS: Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation perforation (CLP) in rats. The animals were divided into five groups: sham, control, CLP + saline, CLP + immunoglobulin G (IgG) (250 mg/kg, iv), and CLP + immunoglobulins enriched with immunoglobulin M (IgGAM) (250 mg/kg, iv). Blood and brain samples were taken in two sets of experiments to see the early (24 h) and late (10 days) effects of treatment. Total complement activity, complement 3 (C3), and soluble complement C5b-9 levels were measured in the sera of rats using ELISA-based methods. Cerebral complement, complement receptor, NF-kappaB, Bax, and Bcl-2 expressions were analyzed by western blot and/or RT-PCR methods. Immune cell infiltration and gliosis were examined by immunohistochemistry using CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD19, and glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies. Apoptotic neuronal death was investigated by TUNEL staining. RESULTS: IVIgG and IgGAM administration significantly reduced systemic complement activity and cerebral C5a and C5a receptor expression. Likewise, both treatment methods reduced proapoptotic NF-kappaB and Bax expressions in the brain. IVIgG and IgGAM treatment induced considerable amelioration in glial cell proliferation and neuronal apoptosis which were increased in non-treated septic rats. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that IVIgG and IgGAM administration ameliorates neuronal dysfunction and behavioral deficits by reducing apoptotic cell death and glial cell proliferation. In both treatment methods, these beneficial effects might be mediated through reduction of anaphylatoxic C5a activity and subsequent inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis pathways.
