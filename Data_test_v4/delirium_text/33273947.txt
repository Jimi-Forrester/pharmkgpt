33273947|a|BACKGROUND: Qiaoshao (QS) formula, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) comprising seven herbs, has been clinically proven to have a favorable treatment effect on premature ejaculation (PE). However, its underlying pharmacological mechanisms in the treatment of PE need to be further clarified. METHODS: In the present study, a network pharmacology-based strategy was adopted. The active compounds of QS formula were obtained from the Chinese medicine database, and the potential targets of these compounds were collected from the DrugBank database to construct compound-compound targets network. PE-related targets were identified from human disease databases and used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Compound-disease target PPI network was constructed by merging the PPI network of disease-targets and compound-targets. Cluster and enrichment analyses were performed on the PPI network of disease targets and compound-disease targets. The influence of QS formula on serum 5-HT, NO, oxytocin, and thyroid hormones of PE patients was verified. RESULTS: Four primary pharmacological networks of QS formula were constructed, including the compound-compound targets network, PPI network of PE-related targets and compound-disease targets, and the QS-PE mechanism network. The module and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the QS formula had the potential to affect varieties of biological process and pathways, such as nitric oxide biosynthetic process, oxytocin, thyroid hormone, TNF, PI3K-Akt, and the HIF-1 signaling pathway, that play an important role in the pathogenesis of PE. Meanwhile, the QS formula has been clinically confirmed to regulate the serum level of 5-HT, NO, oxytocin, and TT in PE patients. CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily discovered the potential targets and pathways of QS formula in the treatment of PE, which laid a good foundation for further experimental research.
