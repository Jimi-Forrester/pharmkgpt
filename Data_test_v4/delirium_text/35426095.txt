35426095|t|Caveolins: Expression of Regulating Systemic Physiological Functions in Various Predicaments.
35426095|a|Caveolins are membrane proteins which contains caveolae. They are present in the plasma membrane. Many researchers found that caveolae have been associated with expression of the caveolins in major physiological networks of mammalian cells. Subtypes of caveolin including caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 have been found in micro arteries of rat brain, while caveolin-3 has been found in astrocytes. Caveolin-1 and caveolae play important roles in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, ischemic preconditioning-mediated cardio-protection, postmenopausal alterations in women, and age-related neurodegeneration. Caveolin-1 may modify fatty acid transmembrane flux in adipocytes. The discovery of a link between ischemia preconditioning, cardio-protection, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase has supported cardiovascular research tremendously. Therefore, caveolins are effective in regulation of cellular, cardiovascular, brain, and immune processes. They ascertain new signalling pathways and link the functionalities of these pathways. This review paper focuses on contribution of caveolins in various conditions, caveolin expression at the molecular level and their physiological effects in many organ systems.
