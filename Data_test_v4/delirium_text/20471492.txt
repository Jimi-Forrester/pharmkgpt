20471492|a|Three neuropathological features attracted the attention of Alzheimer in his examination of the brain of Auguste Deter: abnormal fibrillary structures, cortical depositions now termed "plaques," and glial proliferation, whereby he noted remarkable lipid granule accumulation in the glia. These features were also recorded by Perusini and Kraepelin, but by 1930 the lipoid deposits were no longer regarded by neuropathologists with great interest.
