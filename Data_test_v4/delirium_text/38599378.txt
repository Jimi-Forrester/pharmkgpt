38599378|a|BACKGROUND: Ceramides are sphingolipids that act as signaling molecules involved in regulating cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation, and metabolism. Deregulation of ceramide metabolism contributes to cancer development and progression. Therefore, regulation of ceramide levels in cancer cells is being explored as a new approach for cancer therapy. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: This review discusses the multiple roles of ceramides in cancer cells and strategies to modulate ceramide levels for cancer therapy. Ceramides attenuate cell survival signaling and metabolic pathways, while activating apoptotic mechanisms, making them tumor-suppressive. Approaches to increase ceramide levels in cancer cells include using synthetic analogs, inhibiting ceramide degradation, and activating ceramide synthesis. We also highlight combination therapies such as use of ceramide modulators with chemotherapies, immunotherapies, apoptosis inducers, and anti-angiogenics, which offer synergistic antitumor effects. Additionally, we also describe ongoing clinical trials evaluating ceramide nanoliposomes and analogs. Finally, we discuss the challenges of these therapeutic approaches including the complexity of ceramide metabolism, targeted delivery, cancer heterogeneity, resistance mechanisms, and long-term safety. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Ceramide-based therapy is a potentially promising approach for cancer therapy. However, overcoming hurdles in pharmacokinetics, specificity, and resistance is needed to optimize its efficacy and safety. This requires comprehensive preclinical/clinical studies into ceramide signaling, formulations, and combination therapies. Ceramide modulation offers opportunities for developing novel cancer treatments, but a deeper understanding of ceramide biology is vital to advance its clinical applications.
