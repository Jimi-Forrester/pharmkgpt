38313266|a|Impaired glucose uptake in the brain is one of the earliest presymptomatic manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The absence of symptoms for extended periods of time suggests that compensatory metabolic mechanisms can provide resilience. Here, we introduce the concept of a systemic 'bioenergetic capacity' as the innate ability to maintain energy homeostasis under pathological conditions, potentially serving as such a compensatory mechanism. We argue that fasting blood acylcarnitine profiles provide an approximate peripheral measure for this capacity that mirrors bioenergetic dysregulation in the brain. Using unsupervised subgroup identification, we show that fasting serum acylcarnitine profiles of participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative yields bioenergetically distinct subgroups with significant differences in AD biomarker profiles and cognitive function. To assess the potential clinical relevance of this finding, we examined factors that may offer diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. First, we identified a genotype affecting the bioenergetic capacity which was linked to succinylcarnitine metabolism and significantly modulated the rate of future cognitive decline. Second, a potentially modifiable influence of beta-oxidation efficiency seemed to decelerate bioenergetic aging and disease progression. Our findings, which are supported by data from more than 9,000 individuals, suggest that interventions tailored to enhance energetic health and to slow bioenergetic aging could mitigate the risk of symptomatic AD, especially in individuals with specific mitochondrial genotypes.
