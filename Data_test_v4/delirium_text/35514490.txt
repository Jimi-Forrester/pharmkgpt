35514490|a|Maca has attracted considerable attention owing to its neuroprotective effects in vitro and vivo. Macamides, a series of nonpolar and long-chain fatty acid N-benzylamides, are considered unique constituents in maca. This study investigated the protective effects of ethanol extracts of maca (EEM) and macamides on corticosterone-induced (CORT) neurotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. CORT reduced cell viability and increased LDH release, intracellular ROS levels, and MMP decline rate, and induced mitochondrial apoptosis. However, pretreatment with EEM and macamides ameliorated CORT-induced neurotoxicity. EEM increased the cell viability and reduced the LDH release. M 18:1, M 18:2, and M 18:3 increased cell viability and reduced LDH release and intracellular ROS generation. M 18:2 and M 18:3 inhibited MMP reduction and reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratios. M 18:1 reduced the intracellular ROS without affecting other factors. Moreover, M 18:3 prevented CORT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, restrained the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, namely, Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP, and increased the expression levels of Bcl-2. In addition, M 18:3 increased Akt phosphorylation and the ability of M 18:3 to protect against CORT-induced cytotoxicity was remarkably reduced by LY294002, a PI3K phosphorylation inhibitor. M 18:3 also elevated the phosphorylation of CREB and activated the BDNF protein levels in CORT-induced PC12 cells. In conclusion, macamides, especially M 18:3, exert protective effects on CORT-induced PC12 cells. The cellular mechanism of M 18:3 against CORT-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis, and activation of Akt and CREB phosphorylation. Overall, macamides may potentially treat neuronal damage induced by CORT.
