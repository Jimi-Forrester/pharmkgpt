38357524|a|Nanoscale drug delivery systems (nDDS) have been employed widely in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs against diseases with reduced side effects. Although several nDDS have been successfully approved for clinical use up to now, biological barriers between the administration site and the target site hinder the wider clinical adoption of nDDS in disease treatment. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modification (or PEGylation) has been regarded as the gold standard for stabilising nDDS in complex biological environment. However, the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) of PEGylated nDDS after repeated injections becomes great challenges for their clinical applications. Zwitterionic polymer, a novel family of anti-fouling materials, have evolved as an alternative to PEG due to their super-hydrophilicity and biocompatibility. Zwitterionic nDDS could avoid the generation of ABC phenomenon and exhibit longer blood circulation time than the PEGylated analogues. More impressively, zwitterionic nDDS have recently been shown to overcome multiple biological barriers such as nonspecific organ distribution, pressure gradients, impermeable cell membranes and lysosomal degradation without the need of any complex chemical modifications. The realization of overcoming multiple biological barriers by zwitterionic nDDS may simplify the current overly complex design of nDDS, which could facilitate their better clinical translation. Herein, we summarise the recent progress of zwitterionic nDDS at overcoming various biological barriers and analyse their underlying mechanisms. Finally, prospects and challenges are introduced to guide the rational design of zwitterionic nDDS for disease treatment.
