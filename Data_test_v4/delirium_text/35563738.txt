35563738|t|Moving beyond the Tip of the Iceberg: DJ-1 Implications in Cancer Metabolism.
35563738|a|DJ-1, also called Parkinson's protein 7 (PARK7), is ubiquitously expressed and plays multiple actions in different physiological and, especially, pathophysiological processes, as evidenced by its identification in neurodegenerative diseases and its high expression in different types of cancer. To date, the exact activity of DJ-1 in carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated, however several recent studies disclosed its involvement in regulating fundamental pathways involved in cancer onset, development, and metastatization. At this purpose, we have dissected the role of DJ-1 in maintaining the transformed phenotype, survival, drug resistance, metastasis formation, and differentiation in cancer cells. Moreover, we have discussed the role of DJ-1 in controlling the redox status in cancer cells, along with the ability to attenuate reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cell death, as well as to mediate ferropotosis. Finally, a mention to the development of therapeutic strategies targeting DJ-1 has been done. We have reported the most recent studies, aiming to shed light on the role played by DJ-1 in different cancer aspects and create the foundation for moving beyond the tip of the iceberg.
