39297726|t|Nanotechnology-driven therapies for neurodegenerative diseases: a comprehensive review.
39297726|a|Neurological diseases, characterized by neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, impose a significant global burden, contributing to substantial morbidity, disability and mortality. A common feature of these disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease, is the impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a critical structure for maintaining brain homeostasis. The compromised BBB in neurodegenerative conditions poses a significant challenge for effective treatment, as it allows harmful substances to accumulate in the brain. Nanomedicine offers a promising approach to overcoming this barrier, with nanoparticles (NPs) engineered to deliver therapeutic agents directly to affected brain regions. This review explores the classification and design of NPs, divided into organic and inorganic categories and further categorized based on their chemical and physical properties. These characteristics influence the ability of NPs to carry and release therapeutic agents, target specific tissues and ensure appropriate clearance from the body. The review emphasizes the potential of NPs to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases through targeted delivery, improved drug bioavailability and real-time therapeutic efficacy monitoring. By addressing the challenges of the compromised BBB and targeting inflammatory biomarkers, NPs represent a cutting-edge strategy in managing neurological disorders, promising better patient outcomes.
