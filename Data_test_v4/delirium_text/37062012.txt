37062012|t|Lewy bodies, iron, inflammation and neuromelanin: pathological aspects underlying Parkinson's disease.
37062012|a|Since the description of some peculiar symptoms by James Parkinson in 1817, attempts have been made to define its cause or at least to enlighten the pathology of "Parkinson's disease (PD)." The vast majority of PD subtypes and most cases of sporadic PD share Lewy bodies (LBs) as a characteristic pathological hallmark. However, the processes underlying LBs generation and its causal triggers are still unknown. alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn, encoded by the SNCA gene) is a major component of LBs, and SNCA missense mutations or duplications/triplications are causal for rare hereditary forms of PD. Thus, it is imperative to study alpha-syn protein and its pathology, including oligomerization, fibril formation, aggregation, and spreading mechanisms. Furthermore, there are synergistic effects in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of PD, and multiple factors-contributing with different ratios-appear to be causal pathological triggers and progression factors. For example, oxidative stress, reduced antioxidative capacity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteasomal disturbances have each been suggested to be causal for alpha-syn fibril formation and aggregation and to contribute to neuroinflammation and neural cell death. Aging is also a major risk factor for PD. Iron, as well as neuromelanin (NM), show age-dependent increases, and iron is significantly increased in the Parkinsonian substantia nigra (SN). Iron-induced pathological mechanisms include changes of the molecular structure of alpha-syn. However, more recent PD research demonstrates that (i) LBs are detected not only in dopaminergic neurons and glia but in various neurotransmitter systems, (ii) sympathetic nerve fibres degenerate first, and (iii) at least in "brain-first" cases dopaminergic deficiency is evident before pathology induced by iron and NM. These recent findings support that the alpha-syn/LBs pathology as well as iron- and NM-induced pathology in "brain-first" cases are important facts of PD pathology and via their interaction potentiate the disease process in the SN. As such, multifactorial toxic processes posted on a personal genetic risk are assumed to be causal for the neurodegenerative processes underlying PD. Differences in ratios of multiple factors and their spatiotemporal development, and the fact that common triggers of PD are hard to identify, imply the existence of several phenotypical subtypes, which is supported by arguments from both the "bottom-up/dual-hit" and "brain-first" models. Therapeutic strategies are necessary to avoid single initiation triggers leading to PD.
