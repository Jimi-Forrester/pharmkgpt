37375291|t|Capsaicin Changes the Pattern of Brain Rhythms in Sleeping Rats.
37375291|a|The heat and capsaicin sensor TRPV1 ion channels were originally discovered in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, and later found in many other tissues and organs. However, whether TRPV1 channels are present in brain regions other than the hypothalamus has been a subject of debate. Here, we addressed this issue with an unbiased functional test by recording electroencephalograms (EEGs) to examine whether capsaicin injection directly into the rat lateral ventricle could alter brain electrical activity. We observed that EEGs during the sleep stage could be significantly perturbed by capsaicin, whereas EEGs during the awake stage did not show a detectable change. Our results are consistent with TRPV1 expression in selective brain regions whose activities are dominative during the sleep stage.
