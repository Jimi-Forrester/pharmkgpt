30154697|t|Region-Resolved Quantitative Proteome Profiling Reveals Molecular Dynamics Associated With Chronic Pain in the PNS and Spinal Cord.
30154697|a|To obtain a thorough understanding of chronic pain, large-scale molecular mapping of the pain axis at the protein level is necessary, but has not yet been achieved. We applied quantitative proteome profiling to build a comprehensive protein compendium of three regions of the pain neuraxis in mice: the sciatic nerve (SN), the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and the spinal cord (SC). Furthermore, extensive bioinformatics analysis enabled us to reveal unique protein subsets which are specifically enriched in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and SC. The immense value of these datasets for the scientific community is highlighted by validation experiments, where we monitored protein network dynamics during neuropathic pain. Here, we resolved profound region-specific differences and distinct changes of PNS-enriched proteins under pathological conditions. Overall, we provide a unique and validated systems biology proteome resource (summarized in our online database painproteome.em.mpg.de), which facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory biology and chronic pain-a prerequisite for the identification of novel therapeutic targets.
