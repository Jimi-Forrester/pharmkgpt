36597758|a|The cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, remain major unanswered questions in medical science. Oral bacteria, especially those species associated with chronic periodontitis and particularly Porphyromonas gingivalis, are being linked causally to AD pathophysiology in a subpopulation of susceptible individuals. P. gingivalis produces large amounts of proteolytic enzymes, haem and iron capture proteins, adhesins and internalins that are secreted and attached to the cell surface and concentrated onto outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). These enzymes and adhesive proteins have been shown to cause host tissue damage and stimulate inflammatory responses. The ecological and pathophysiological roles of P. gingivalis OMVs, their ability to disperse widely throughout the host and deliver functional proteins lead to the proposal that they may be the link between a P. gingivalis focal infection in the subgingivae during periodontitis and neurodegeneration in AD. P. gingivalis OMVs can cross the blood brain barrier and may accelerate AD-specific neuropathology by increasing neuroinflammation, plaque/tangle formation and dysregulation of iron homeostasis, thereby inducing ferroptosis leading to neuronal death and neurodegeneration.
