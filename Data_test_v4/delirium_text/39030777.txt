39030777|a|OBJECTIVES: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with altered mental status (AMS: dementia, delirium and delirium superimposed on dementia) were profoundly affected by an abrupt transformation in healthcare systems. Here, we evaluated quality-care outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, early readmission and mortality after hospital discharge, in older adults admitted for AMS during the pandemic and compared them to patients admitted prior to the pandemic. METHODS: Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine changes to admissions for AMS before and during the pandemic, and their outcomes. Logistic regression analyses, with reference to pre-pandemic data, were conducted to examine the impact of the pandemic on outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective data of 21,192 non-COVID admissions to an acute general medical department in a Surrey (UK) hospital were collected from patients admitted before (1st April 2019 to 29th February 2020) and during the pandemic (1st March 2020 to 31st March 2021). RESULTS: There were 10,173 (47.7% men) from the pre-pandemic and 11,019 (47.5% men) from the pandemic periods; overall mean age  =  68.3yr. During the pandemic AMS patients had significantly higher admission rates (1.1% vs 0.6%, P < 0.001). However, median LOS in hospital was shorter (9.0 days [IQR = 5.3-16.2] vs 15.5 days [IQR  =  6.2-25.7], P < 0.001) and thus were less likely to stay in hospital >3 weeks: adjusted OR  =  0.26 (95%CI  =  0.12-0.57). In-hospital mortality and readmission within 28 days of discharge did not change during the pandemic, but were less likely to die within 30 days of discharge: adjusted OR = 0.32 (95%CI = 0.11-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: This combination of higher admission rate, shorter LOS, and an unchanging early readmission suggests a higher admission-discharge turnover of different patients with AMS and provides important insights into the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery to individuals with AMS.
