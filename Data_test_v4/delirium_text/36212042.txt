36212042|a|The relationship between geriatric depression and dementia has been widely debated, and the neurological mechanisms underlying subjective cognitive decline (SCD) associated with social relationships remain elusive. Subclinical geriatric depression (SGD) is common in patients with SCD, and close friends (CFs) have a great influence on a person's social life. Studies have proven that communication or leisure activities with CFs can improve the cognitive performance of elderly. However, it remains unclear whether the engagement of specific brain regions mediates having CFs, SGD, and SCD. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between social relationships (that is, CFs), SGD, and SCD from the perspective of brain function. We examined the data of 66 patients with SCD and 63 normal controls (NC). Compared with NC, SGD was significantly inversely correlated with the number of CFs in the SCD group. We calculated regional homogeneity (ReHo) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of each subject. At a corrected threshold, the right occipital gyrus (SOG.R) and right fusiform gyrus (FFG.R) exhibited positive correlation with SGD in patients with SCD. Mediation analyses to query the inter-relationships between the neural markers and clinical variables exhibited a best fit of the model with CFs   FFG.R   SGD   SOG.R   SCD. These findings suggested a pathway whereby social relationships alter the function of specific brain regions, and SGD may be an early symptom of SCD. We observed that the FFG.R mediate social relationships and SGD, and the abnormality of the SOG.R may be a key factor in the SCD caused by depression. Moreover, a greater number of CFs may reduce the risk of developing SGD.
