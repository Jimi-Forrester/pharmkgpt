30655505|t|Characterizing acyl-carnitine biosignatures for schizophrenia: a longitudinal pre- and post-treatment study.
30655505|a|Subjects with schizophrenia have high risks of metabolic abnormalities and bioenergetic dysfunction. Acyl-carnitines involved in bioenergetic pathways provide potential biomarker targets for identifying early changes and onset characteristics in subjects with schizophrenia. We measured 29 acyl-carnitine levels within well-characterized plasma samples of adults with schizophrenia and healthy controls using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Subjects with schizophrenia were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. A total of 225 subjects with schizophrenia and 175 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled and 156 subjects completed the 8-week follow-up. With respect to plasma acyl-carnitines, the individuals with schizophrenia at baseline showed significantly higher levels of C4-OH (C3-DC) and C16:1, but lower concentrations of C3, C8, C10, C10:1, C10:2, C12, C14:1-OH, C14:2, and C14:2-OH when compared with healthy controls after controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and drinking. For the comparison between pretreatment and posttreatment subjects, all detected acyl-carnitines were significantly different between the two groups. Only the concentration of C3 and C4 were increased after selection by variable importance in projection (VIP) value >1.0 and false discovery rate (FDR) q value <0.05. A panel of acyl-carnitines were selected for the ability to differentiate subjects of schizophrenia at baseline from controls, pre- from post-treatment, and posttreatment from controls. Our data implicated acyl-carnitines with abnormalities in cellular bioenergetics of schizophrenia. Therefore, acyl-carnitines can be potential targets for future investigations into their roles in the pathoetiology of schizophrenia.
