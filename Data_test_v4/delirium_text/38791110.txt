38791110|t|Pericytes Are Immunoregulatory Cells in Glioma Genesis and Progression.
38791110|a|Vascular co-option is a consequence of the direct interaction between perivascular cells, known as pericytes (PCs), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells (GBMcs). This process is essential for inducing changes in the pericytes' anti-tumoral and immunoreactive phenotypes. Starting from the initial stages of carcinogenesis in GBM, PCs conditioned by GBMcs undergo proliferation, acquire a pro-tumoral and immunosuppressive phenotype by expressing and secreting immunosuppressive molecules, and significantly hinder the activation of T cells, thereby facilitating tumor growth. Inhibiting the pericyte (PC) conditioning mechanisms in the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) results in immunological activation and tumor disappearance. This underscores the pivotal role of PCs as a key cell in the TME, responsible for tumor-induced immunosuppression and enabling GBM cells to evade the immune system. Other cells within the TME, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and microglia, have also been identified as contributors to this immunomodulation. In this paper, we will review the role of these three cell types in the immunosuppressive properties of the TME. Our conclusion is that the cellular heterogeneity of immunocompetent cells within the TME may lead to the misinterpretation of cellular lineage identification due to different reactive stages and the identification of PCs as TAMs. Consequently, novel therapies could be developed to disrupt GBM-PC interactions and/or PC conditioning through vascular co-option, thereby exposing GBMcs to the immune system.
