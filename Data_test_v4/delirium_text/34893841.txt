METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-nine individuals were recruited in the present study. The olfactory-related regions were defined as the regions of interest, and the grey matter volume (GMV), low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity (FC) were compared for exploring the changing pattern of structural and functional abnormalities across AD, MCI, SCD, and normal controls. RESULTS: From the SCD, MCI to AD groups, the reduced GMV, increased low-frequency fluctuation, increased ReHo, and reduced FC of olfactory-related regions became increasingly severe, and only the degree of reduced GMV of hippocampus and caudate nucleus clearly distinguished the 3 groups. SCD participants exhibited reduced GMV (hippocampus, etc.), increased ReHo (caudate nucleus), and reduced FC (hippocampus-hippocampus and hippocampus-parahippocampus) in olfactory-related regions compared with normal controls. Additionally, reduced GMV of the bilateral hippocampus and increased ReHo of the right caudate nucleus were associated with OI dysfunction and global cognitive impairment, and they exhibited partially mediated effects on the relationships between OI and global cognition across all participants. CONCLUSION: Structural and functional abnormalities of olfactory-related regions present early with SCD and deepen with disease severity in the AD spectrum. The hippocampus and caudate nucleus may be the hub joining OI and cognitive function in the AD spectrum.
