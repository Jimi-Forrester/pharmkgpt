34410605|a|Several preclinical and clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanism associated with spinal cord injury. However, investigations have been unable to define the precise related mechanisms, and this has led to the lack of effective therapeutic agents for the condition. Neuroinflammation is one of the predominant processes that hinder spinal cord injury recovery. Resveratrol is a compound that has several biological features, such as antioxidation, antibacterial, and antiinflammation. Herein, we reviewed preclinical and clinical studies to delineate the role of toll-like receptors, nod-like receptors, and astrocytes in neuroinflammation. In particular, the alteration of astrocytes in SCI causes glial scar formation that impedes spinal cord injury recovery. Therefore, to improve injury recovery would be to prevent the occurrence of this process. Resveratrol is safe and effective in the significant modulation of neuroinflammatory factors, particularly those mediated by astrocytes. Thus, its potential ability to enhance the injury recovery process and ameliorate spinal cord injury.
