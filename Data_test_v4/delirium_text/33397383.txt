33397383|a|BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is one of the most common female reproductive system tumors. Ninjurin2 (NINJ2) is a new adhesion factor. As a vascular susceptibility gene, it is highly expressed in other cancers and promotes the growth of cancer cells. We conducted an association analysis between NINJ2 gene polymorphism and endometrial cancer risk. METHODS: Five SNPs rs118050317, rs75750647, rs7307242, rs10849390 and rs11610368 of NINJ2 gene were genotyped in 351 endometrial cancer patients and 344 healthy controls. The clinical index difference between cases and controls were tested by one-way analysis of variance. The allele and genotype frequency of cases and controls were been compared by Chi square test. The odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were examined by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The SNP rs118050317 mutant allele C and homozygote CC genotype were significant increased the endometrial cancer risk (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04-2.06, p = 0.028; OR 8.43, 95% CI 1.05-67.89, p = 0.045). In the clinical index analysis, there were significant higher quantities of CEA, CA125 and AFP in cases serum than controls. CONCLUSION: The NINJ2 gene polymorphism loci rs118050317 mutant allele C was associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. CEA, CA125 and AFP quantities were significant higher in endometrial cancer patients.
