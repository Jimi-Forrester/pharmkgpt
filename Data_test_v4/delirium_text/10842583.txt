10842583|t|Calpain inhibitors as therapeutic agents in nerve and muscle degeneration.
10842583|a|It seems plausible to hypothesize that in all forms of neurodegeneration or other forms of tissue degeneration, a common pathway exists that, when deciphered, could lead to our understanding of a variety of diseases that result in tissue necrosis, as well as offer potential for therapeutic intervention. In recent years progress toward elucidating this common pathway has been accelerated through the studies of a number of laboratories, including our own, on the role of the protease calpain in this process. Thus, in a variety of disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic nerve injury, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, cataract formation, unregulated calpain proteolysis, initiated via dysregulation of calcium ion homeostasis, participates in the pathogenesis and is a potentially unifying mechanistic event. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach we have taken in using the calpain inhibitor leupeptin as a therapeutic agent, I will describe two areas of research in which we have been engaged over the past 20 years. One is our long-standing interest in muscular dystrophy. The other is of more recent vintage, and involves the use of calpain inhibitors to protect sensory hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons from damage associated with acoustic trauma, this latter in collaboration with Dr. R. Salvi at SUNY-Buffalo and Dr. A. Shulman at SUNY-Downstate.
