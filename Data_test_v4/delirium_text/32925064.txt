Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is a non-invasive ophthalmic technique that detects neuronal loss in peripheral and central neurodegenerative disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of CCM for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia compared to medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) rating on MRI. METHODS: Subjects aged 60-85 with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and dementia based on the ICD-10 criteria were recruited. Subjects underwent cognitive screening, CCM, and MTA rating on MRI. RESULTS: 182 subjects with NCI (n = 36), MCI (n = 80), and dementia (n = 66), including AD (n = 19, 28.8%), VaD (n = 13, 19.7%), and mixed AD (n = 34, 51.5%) were studied. CCM showed a progressive reduction in corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD, fibers/mm2) (32.0+-7.5 versus 24.5+-9.6 and 20.8+-9.3, p < 0.0001), branch density (CNBD, branches/mm2) (90.9+-46.5 versus 59.3+-35.7 and 53.9+-38.7, p < 0.0001), and fiber length (CNFL, mm/mm2) (22.9+-6.1 versus 17.2+-6.5 and 15.8+-7.4, p < 0.0001) in subjects with MCI and dementia compared to NCI. The area under the ROC curve (95% CI) for the diagnostic accuracy of CNFD, CNBD, CNFL compared to MTA-right and MTA-left for MCI was 78% (67-90%), 82% (72-92%), 86% (77-95%) versus 53% (36-69%) and 40% (25-55%), respectively, and for dementia it was 85% (76-94%), 84% (75-93%), 85% (76-94%) versus 86% (76-96%) and 82% (72-92%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of CCM, a non-invasive ophthalmic biomarker of neurodegeneration, was high and comparable with MTA rating for dementia but was superior to MTA rating for MCI.
