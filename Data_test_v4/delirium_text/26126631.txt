26126631|t|Oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment: evidence from human data provided by redox proteomics.
26126631|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with many known pathological features, yet there is still much debate into the exact cause and mechanisms for progression of this degenerative disorder. The amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress hypothesis postulates that it is the oligomeric Abeta that inserts into membrane systems to initiate much of the oxidative stress observed in brain during the progression of the disease. In order to study the effects of oxidative stress on tissue from patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we have developed a method called redox proteomics that identifies specific brain proteins found to be selectively oxidized. Here, we discuss experimental findings of oxidatively modified proteins involved in three key cellular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of AD progression: energy metabolism, cell signaling and neurotransmission, as well as the proteasomal degradation pathways and antioxidant response systems. These proteomics studies conducted by our laboratory and others in the field shed light on the molecular changes imposed on the cells of AD and MCI brain, through the deregulated increase in oxidative/nitrosative stress inflicted by Abeta and mitochondrial dysfunction.
