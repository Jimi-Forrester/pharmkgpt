7249928|a|The folic acid (FA) levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 39 chronic alcoholics, 15 methamphetamine addicts and 18 control subjects were determined using the technique of Lactobacillus casei assay. Twelve of the 39 alcoholics developed delirium tremens (DT) after determination of the FA level. The serum FA level of the alcoholics with DT was significantly lower than that of the controls, and showed a tendency to be lower than in the alcoholics without DT. The CSF FA of the DT group was significantly lower than that of the control group and of the alcoholics without DT. In the methamphetamine addicts, although the serum FA was significantly lower than that of the controls, the CSF FA remained unchanged. All the methamphetamine addicts demonstrated psychological dependence and tolerance development as did the alcoholics, but they did not show any physical dependence. From these results, a mechanism underlying the development of symptoms of physical dependence such as DT was discussed in relation to the CSF FA.
