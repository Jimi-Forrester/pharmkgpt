32918513|a|OBJECTIVES: Cultural variations complicate psychiatric care, especially for migrant children. Transcultural psychotherapy (TCP) is an original psychotherapeutic technique developed to address complex situations of resistant mental disorders in the context of migration. This research will aim to assess the efficacy, the acceptability, and describe the therapeutic processes of TCP for the treatment of depression in first or second generation of migration children and adolescents. METHOD: Mixed method study using a multicenter, Bayesian randomized clinical trial with blinded evaluation of the primary outcome. Two parallel groups of 40 children or adolescents from 6 to 20 years old and their family will be included. In the experimental group, patients will attend six sessions of transcultural therapy in addition to usual care. RESULTS: The improved Clinical Global Impression scale scores at 6 months will be compared across groups. Qualitative analysis of families and therapists' interviews will allow to specify the therapeutic processes and acceptability of the therapy. CONCLUSION: The findings will encourage the development and routinization of TCP for second-line use and its adaption as a first-line technique in this population.
