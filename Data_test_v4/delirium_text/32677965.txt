32677965|a|The complexity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neurovascular unit (NVU) was and still is a challenge to bridge. A highly selective, restrictive and dynamic barrier, formed at the interface of blood and brain, the BBB is a "gatekeeper" and guardian of brain homeostasis and it also acts as a "sensor" of pathological events in blood and brain. The majority of brain and cerebrovascular pathologies are associated with BBB dysfunction, where changes at the BBB can lead to or support disease development. Thus, an ultimate goal of BBB research is to develop competent and highly translational models to understand mechanisms of BBB/NVU pathology and enable discovery and development of therapeutic strategies to improve vascular health and for the efficient delivery of drugs. This review article focuses on the progress being made to model BBB injury in cerebrovascular diseases in vitro.
