18569738|a|We describe a 56-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease with left hemispatial neglect and left homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing considered a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease resulting from severe degenerative change in the right primary visual cortex. Hemispatial neglect normally results from brain damage to the right cerebral hemisphere. Homonymous hemianopsia is commonly the result of localized brain disease, especially cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. To our knowledge, a patient with Alzheimer's disease showing hemispatial neglect and homonymous hemianopsia with macular sparing has not previously been reported.
