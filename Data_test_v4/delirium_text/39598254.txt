39598254|a|Neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are difficult to treat. Unfortunately, many therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disease only halt the progression of these diseases and do not reverse neuronal damage. There is a demand for finding solutions to reverse neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with neurodegenerative brain diseases. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the potential for therapeutic agents like specific neurotrophic and growth factors in promoting CNS neuroregeneration in brain diseases. We discuss how BDNF, NGF, IGF-1, and LIF could potentially be used for the treatment of brain diseases. The molecule's different mechanisms of action in stimulating neuroregeneration and methods to analyze their efficacy are described. Methods that can be utilized to deliver these proteins to the brain are also discussed.
