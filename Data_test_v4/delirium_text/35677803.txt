35677803|t|Putative Involvement of Cytokine Modulation in the Development of Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
35677803|a|Following surgery, local cytokine-driven inflammation occurs, as part of the normal healing process. Cytokines in the central nervous system such as IL-6 and IL-8 may also be elevated. These cytokine changes likely contribute to neuroinflammation, but the complex mechanisms through which this occurs are incompletely understood. It may be that perioperative changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines have a role in the development of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), such as post-operative delirium (POD). This review considers the current evidence regarding perioperative cytokine changes in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as considering the potential for cytokine-altering therapies to prevent and treat PND.
