36062003|a|Background: Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) is a protein that is upregulated by interferon-beta. Homeostatic MxA mRNA levels are potentially correlated with inflammatory disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) and could have an important role in MS pathology. Aim: To investigate the association between myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) mRNA levels in blood and disease activity and progression in MS over a long-term follow-up period. Methods: Baseline blood MxA mRNA levels were determined in a prospective cohort of 116 untreated patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or early relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), and related to long-term relapses, radiological disease activity, clinical scores [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), timed-25-foot walk (T25FW), 9-hole-peg test (9HPT)], MS type, and disease modifying therapy (DMT) use. Results: Low MxA mRNA levels were associated with the occurrence of >=9 T2-lesions on MRI imaging and the occurrence of relapses during long-term follow-up (median 11 years, IQR 5.91-13.69 years). MxA mRNA levels were not associated with EDSS, T25FW, 9HPT, and MS subtype. Conclusion: Baseline MxA mRNA levels are associated with long-term development of T2-lesions on MRI-scans in our cohort. This confirms the relevance of the endogenous interferon-beta system in the occurrence of MS disease activity.
