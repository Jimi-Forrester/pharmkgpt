12737525|a|Over the past several years researchers have engineered many transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. Since loss of memory is one of the major hallmarks of the disorder, the phenotypic characterization of these animals has included both behavioral tests which aim to evaluate learning abilities, and electrophysiological studies to analyze synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, a widely studied cellular model of learning and memory. These studies are fundamental for the design of novel therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
