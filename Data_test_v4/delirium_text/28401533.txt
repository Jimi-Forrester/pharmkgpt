28401533|t|Long-term follow-up of fenestrated endovascular repair for juxtarenal aortic aneurysm.
28401533|a|BACKGROUND: Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is increasingly being used for juxtarenal aortic aneurysms. The aim of this study was to review long-term results and assess the importance of changing stent-graft design on outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all patients who underwent FEVAR within a single unit over 12 years (February 2003 to December 2015). Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival, and freedom from target vessel loss, aneurysm expansion, graft-related endoleak and secondary intervention was performed. Comparison between outcomes of less complex grafts (fewer than 3 fenestrations) and more complex grafts (3 or 4 fenestrations) was undertaken. RESULTS: Some 173 patients underwent FEVAR; median age was 76 (i.q.r. 70-79) years and 90 2 per cent were men. Median aneurysm diameter was 63 (59-71) mm and median follow-up was 34 (16-50) months. The adjusted primary technical operative success rate was 95 4 per cent. The in-hospital mortality rate was 5 2 per cent; there was no known aneurysm-related death during follow-up. Median survival was 7 1 (95 per cent c.i. 5 2 to 8 1) years and overall survival was 60 1 per cent (104 of 173). There was a trend towards an increasing number of fenestrations in the graft design over time. In-hospital mortality appeared higher when more complex stent-grafts were used (8 versus 2 per cent for stent-grafts with 3-4 versus fewer than 3 fenestrations; P = 0 059). Graft-related endoleaks were more common following deployment of stent-grafts with three or four fenestrations (12 of 90 versus 6 of 83; P < 0 001). CONCLUSION: Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair for juxtarenal aneurysm is associated with few aneurysm-related deaths in the long term. Significant numbers of secondary interventions are required, but the majority of these can be performed using an endovascular approach.
