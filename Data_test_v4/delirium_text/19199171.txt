19199171|a|BACKGROUND: Although Delirium is the most common psychiatric disease in ICU settings, it is recognized late or not at all in up to 84 % of all cases. METHODS: Translation of the ICDSC, in accordance with ISPOR guidelines and validation by conducting a screening of 68 ICU patients. RESULTS: The translation process was authorized by the original author. The final German translation of the ICDSC showed a sensitivity and specificity of 89 % and 57 % respectively. CONCLUSION: The ICDSC is suitable for delirium screening by nurses even on ventilated patients. Besides a high sensitivity another advantage is the possibility to screen for a subsyndromal delirium.
