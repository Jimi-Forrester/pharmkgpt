36071315|t|Computerized tool and interdisciplinary care for older patients with delirium in the emergency department: a novel model in Taiwan.
36071315|a|AIMS: A computerized tool and interdisciplinary care were implemented to develop a novel model for older patients with delirium in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: We developed a computerized tool using a delirium triage screen and brief confusion assessment in the hospital information system, performed education for the healthcare providers, and developed a continuous care protocol. Comparisons for outcomes between pre- and post-intervention periods were performed. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-intervention period, patients in the post-intervention period had shorter hospitalization stay, lower expenditure of hospitalization, more likely to return home, lower ED revisits of <= 3 days, re-hospitalization of <= 14 days, and mortality of <= 1 month. All mentioned differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A novel model was successfully developed for delirium management in older patients in the ED. Outcome differences were not significant; however, the result is promising, which gives us an important reference in the future.
