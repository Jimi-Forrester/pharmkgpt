32782444|a|BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are critical life-threatening syndromes characterized by the infiltration of a large number of granulocytes (mainly neutrophils) that lead to an excessive inflammatory response. Emodin (Emo) is a naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative and an active ingredient of Chinese medicine. It is believed to have anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the impact of Emo on the pulmonary inflammatory response and the granulocytes function in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. RESULTS: Treatment with Emo protected rat against LPS-induced ALI. Compared to untreated rat, Emo-treated rat exhibited significantly ameliorated lung pathological changes and decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). However, Emo has no protective effect on the rat model of acute lung injury with granulocyte deficiency. In addition, treatment with Emo enhanced the bactericidal capacity of LPS-induced granulocytes via the up-regulation of the ability of granulocytes to phagocytize bacteria and generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Emo also downregulated the respiratory burst and the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LPS-stimulated granulocytes, alleviating the damage of granulocytes to surrounding tissues. Finally, Emo can accelerate the resolution of inflammation by promoting apoptosis of granulocytes. CONCLUSION: Our results provide the evidence that Emo could ameliorates LPS-induced ALI via its anti-inflammatory action by modulating the function of granulocytes. Emo may be a promising preventive and therapeutic agent in the treatment of ALI.
