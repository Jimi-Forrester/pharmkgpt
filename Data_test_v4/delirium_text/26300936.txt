26300936|a|BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis has a significant impact on patient's quality of life and socioeconomic status and is associated with increased susceptibility to vehicle accidents and falls. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate cognitive function in patients with cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All subjects, who underwent transient elastography (TE) between March 2014 and August 2014 in Shariati outpatient clinic, Tehran, Iran, were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was made based on clinical and laboratory findings and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values > 14. Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) and simple visual reaction time (RT) were the neuropsychiatric tests used to assess cognitive function, in all subjects. RESULTS: A total of 37 cirrhotic patients and 37 matched controls were included. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly lower mean quotient (MQ) score, compared with controls (91 +- 18.2 vs. 114.6 +- 17.5, P <0.001). All of WMS subscales, except associate learning, showed statistically significant differences between the two groups. Reaction time was more prolonged in patients with cirrhosis, compared with controls. Cognitive function of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients was significantly impaired, with respect to logical memory, visual reproduction and MQ score, compared to other underlying causes of cirrhosis (P = 0.01, P = 0.04, and P = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that neuropsychiatric and cognitive problems must be considered in the management of covert hepatic encephalopathy (HE) patients, especially in patients with HCV infection. The WMS and simple visual RT tests are useful methods for the early diagnosis of covert HE.
