1281980|t|A 109-amino-acid C-terminal fragment of Alzheimer's-disease amyloid precursor protein contains a sequence, -RHDS-, that promotes cell adhesion.
1281980|a|Amyloid beta (A beta), the major constituent of the fibrils composing senile plaques and vascular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, is a 39-42-residue self-aggregating degradation peptide of a larger multidomain membrane glycoprotein designated amyloid precursor protein (APP). An array of biological functions has been assigned to different APP domains, including growth regulation, neurotoxicity, inhibitory activity of serine proteinases and promotion of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. A beta is generated through an as-yet-unknown catabolic pathway that by-passes or inhibits the cleavage of APP within the A beta sequence. We have identified a 16 kDa intermediate APP C-terminal fragment containing A beta in leptomeningeal vessels of aged normal individuals and AD patients by means of its immunoreactivity with a panel of four different anti-(APP C-terminal) antibodies, indicating a different pathway of APP processing. Previous studies have indicated that the APP C-terminal domain is the most likely to be involved in cell-matrix interactions. A 109-amino-acid construct C109 with a sequence analogous to the C-terminal of APP (positions 587-695 of APP695), similar in length and immunoreactivity to the 16 kDa fragment, was found to promote cell adhesion. By use of synthetic peptides, this activity was initially located to the extracellular 28 residues of A beta. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the sequence RHDS (amino acids 5-8 of A beta, corresponding to residues 601-604 of APP695 was responsible for the adhesion-promoting activity. The interaction is dependent on bivalent cations and can be blocked either by the tetrapeptides RHDS and RGDS or by an anti-(beta 1 integrin) antibody. Thus, through integrin-like surface receptors, APP or its derivative proteolytic fragments containing the sequence RHDS may modulate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions.
