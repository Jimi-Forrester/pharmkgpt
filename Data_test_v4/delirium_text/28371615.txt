28371615|t|Mechanisms that synergistically regulate eta-secretase processing of APP and Aeta-alpha protein levels: relevance to pathogenesis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
28371615|a|The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of cerebral beta-amyloid plaque from a small peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta). Abeta is generated from the canonical amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) proteolysis pathway through beta- and gamma-secretases. Decreasing Abeta levels through targeting APP processing is a very promising direction in clinical trials for AD. A novel APP processing pathway was recently identified, in which eta-secretase processing of APP occurs and results in the generation of the carboxy-terminal fragment-eta (CTF-eta or eta-CTF) (Wang et al., 2015) and Aeta-alpha peptide (Willem et al., 2015). eta-Secretase processing of APP may be up-regulated by at least two mechanisms: either through inhibition of lysosomal-cathepsin degradation pathway (Wang et al., 2015) or through inhibition of BACE1 that competes with eta-secretase cleavage of APP (Willem et al., 2015). A thorough characterization of eta-processing of APP is critical for a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and insights into results of clinical trials of AD. Here we further investigated eta-secretase processing of APP using well-characterized cell models of AD. We found that these two mechanisms act synergistically toward increasing eta-secretase processing of APP and Aeta-alpha levels. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of several other known secretase modulators on eta-processing of APP. The results of our study should advance the understanding of pathophysiology of AD, as well as enhance the knowledge in developing effective AD treatments or interventions related to eta-secretase processing of APP.
