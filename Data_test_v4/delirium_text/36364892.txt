36364892|a|This study aims to explore the effects of Garcinia mangostana (mangosteen) and Curcuma longa independently and synergistically in modulating induced inflammation and impaired brain neurotransmitters commonly observed in high-fat diet-induced obesity in rodent models. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups. Group I, control, obese, fed on a high-fat diet (HFD), and Group II-IV, fed on HFD then given mangosteen extract (400 mg/kg/day) and/or Curcuma (80 mg/kg/day), or a mixture of both for 6 weeks. Plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, leptin, and brain serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate were measured in the five studied groups. G. mangostana and Curcuma longa extracts demonstrate antioxidant and DPPH radical scavenging activities. Both induced a significant reduction in the weight gained, concomitant with a non-significant decrease in the BMI (from 0.86 to 0.81 g/cm2). Curcuma either alone or in combination with MPE was more effective. Both extracts demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects and induced a significant reduction in levels of both IL-6 and IL-12. The lowest leptin level was achieved in the synergistically treated group, compared to independent treatments. Brain dopamine was the most affected variable, with significantly lower levels recorded in the Curcuma and synergistically treated groups than in the control group. Glutamate and serotonin levels were not affected significantly. The present study demonstrated that mangosteen pericarp extract (MPE) and Curcuma were independently and in combination effective in treating obesity-induced inflammation and demonstrating neuroprotective properties.
