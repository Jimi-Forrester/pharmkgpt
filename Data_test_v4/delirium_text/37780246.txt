37780246|a|Non-dairy creamers have been widely used for coffee whitening and texture improvement. To avoid the intake of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oil, coconut oil-based diacylglycerol (CO-DAG) was applied in non-dairy creamer as core material. In this study, effects of DAG content (30, 50, 70, 90%) on the characteristics of CO-DAG were evaluated, including rheological and thermodynamic properties. The CO-DAG with a content of 50% exhibited a wide plastic range and contained mixture of beta and beta' polymorphic forms. Using CO-DAG (50%) as core material, the physicochemical properties of non-dairy creamer were characterized and compared with commercial products. The results indicated that CO-DAG-based non-dairy creamers showed similar encapsulation efficiency (92.74%) and thermal stability to commercial products. Furthermore, CO-DAG-based non-dairy creamer showed higher whiteness index (54.20) than commercial non-dairy creamers (50.22) when applied to black coffee. Overall, it is anticipated that CO-DAG-based non-dairy creamers have great potentials in coffee whitening.
