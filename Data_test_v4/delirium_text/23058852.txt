23058852|a|Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with changes in gamma-secretase activity in the brain, producing an amyloid beta-protein-42-lowering gamma-modulator-like effect. We show here that this modulation occurs at the stage of amyloid deposition, presumably decades earlier than the onset of AD. In addition, gamma-secretase modulator-1, a gamma-modulator, altered gamma-secretase activity in the AD brain but to a lesser extent than in the normal brain. These findings suggest that gamma-modulators have limited efficacy against amyloid deposition and AD.
