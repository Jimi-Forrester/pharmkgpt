33420706|a|Young-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease has different clinical presentations with late-onset presenting most often with memory deficits while young-onset often presents with a non-amnestic syndrome. However, it is unknown whether there are differences in presentation and progression of neuropsychiatric symptoms in young- versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate differences in the prevalence and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with young- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease longitudinally with and without accounting for the effect of medication usage. Sex differences were also considered in these patient groups. We included 126 young-onset and 505 late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center-Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We investigated the prevalence and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire over 4 visits with 1-year intervals, using a linear mixed-effects model. The prevalence of depression was significantly higher in young-onset than late-onset Alzheimer's disease over a 4-year interval when antidepressant usage was included in our analyses. Our findings suggest that neuropsychiatric symptom profiles of young- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease differ cross-sectionally but also display significant differences in progression.
