34995752|t|Ketamine Mitigates Neurobehavioral Deficits in a Canine Model of Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest.
34995752|a|Hypothermic circulatory arrest is a protective technique used when complete cessation of circulation is required during cardiac surgery. Prior efforts to decrease neurologic injury with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 were limited by unacceptable side effects. We hypothesized that ketamine would provide neuroprotection without dose-limiting side effects. Canines were peripherally cannulated for cardiopulmonary bypass, cooled to 18 C, and underwent 90 minutes of circulatory arrest. Ketamine-treated canines (n = 5; total dose 2.85 mg/kg) were compared to untreated controls (n = 10). A validated neurobehavioral deficit score was obtained at 24, 48, and 72 hours (0 = no deficits/normal exam; higher score represents increasing deficits). Biomarkers of neuronal injury in the cerebrospinal fluid were examined at baseline and at 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Brain histopathologic injury was scored at 72 hours (higher score indicates more necrosis and apoptosis). Ketamine-treated canines had significantly improved, lower neurobehavioral deficit scores compared to controls (overall P = 0.003; 24 hours: median 72 vs 112, P = 0.030; 48 hours: 47 vs 90, P = 0.021; 72 hours: 30 vs 89, P = 0.069). Although the histopathologic injury scores of ketamine-treated canines (median 12) were lower than controls (16), there was no statistical difference (P = 0.10). Levels of phosphorylated neurofilament-H and neuron specific enolase, markers of neuronal injury, were significantly lower in ketamine-treated animals (P = 0.010 and = 0.039, respectively). Ketamine significantly reduced neurologic deficits and biomarkers of injury in canines after hypothermic circulatory arrest. Ketamine represents a safe and approved medication that may be useful as a pharmacologic neuroprotectant during cardiac surgery with circulatory arrest.
