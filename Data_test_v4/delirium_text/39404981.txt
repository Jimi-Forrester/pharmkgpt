39404981|a|The inhibition of amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation and degradation of Abeta aggregates are promising approaches for treating and preventing Alzheimer's disease. In our search for Abeta42 aggregation inhibitors, we isolated seven undescribed meroterpenoids, sargasilides A (1)-G (7), from brown alga (Sargassum siliquastrum) collected at Noto Peninsula in Japan. We structurally elucidated the isolated meroterpenoids using spectroscopic data and evaluated their activities using Thioflavin T assay and transmission electron microscopy. Among the seven compounds isolated, sargasilide B had the strongest inhibitory activity. From the comparison of structure and activity, the geometric isomerism of olefins and length of isoprene side chains are important for the activity of meroterpenoids isolated from brown alga.
