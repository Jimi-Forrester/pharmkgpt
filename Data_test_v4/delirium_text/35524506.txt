35524506|t|Concordance of cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion across the European Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Network.
35524506|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and this has led to its being included in revised European CJD Surveillance Network diagnostic criteria for sCJD. As CSF RT-QuIC becomes more widely established, it is crucial that the analytical performance of individual laboratories is consistent. The aim of this ring-trial was to ascertain the degree of concordance between European countries undertaking CSF RT-QuIC. METHODS: Ten identical CSF samples, seven from probable or neuropathologically confirmed sCJD and three from non-CJD cases, were sent to 13 laboratories from 11 countries for RT-QuIC analysis. A range of instrumentation and different recombinant prion protein substrates were used. Each laboratory analysed the CSF samples blinded to the diagnosis and reported the results as positive or negative. RESULTS: All 13 laboratories correctly identified five of the seven sCJD cases and the remaining two sCJD cases were identified by 92% of laboratories. Of the two sCJD cases that were not identified by all laboratories, one had a disease duration >26 months with a negative 14-3-3, whilst the remaining case had a 4-month disease duration and a positive 14-3-3. A single false positive CSF RT-QuIC result was observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that CSF RT-QuIC demonstrates an excellent concordance between centres, even when using a variety of instrumentation, recombinant prion protein substrates and CSF volumes. The adoption of CSF RT-QuIC by all CJD surveillance centres is recommended.
