37489069|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the most frequent cause of lobar hemorrhages in the brains of elderly individuals. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloidogenic proteins in the vessel wall of leptomeningeal and/or intracerebral blood vessels. Different proteins can cause CAA. Most frequently, the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is found to be deposited in CAA and indicates a link to Alzheimer's disease, because Abeta is known to be deposited in amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Among other proteins that can also cause CAA, transthyretin (TTR) is the most important one because TTR amyloidosis can be successfully treated. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose TTR-related CAA even in biopsies taken in the context of cerebral hematoma evacuations if possible. The current "Boston criteria version 2.0" for the diagnosis of CAA highlight the importance of autopsy for the definite diagnosis of CAA and biopsies for the diagnosis of probable CAA. Here, we discuss the implications of Abeta-related and non-Abeta-related forms of CAA for their current diagnostic relevance also in the context of neurodegenerative diseases as well as the implications of the Boston criteria version 2.0 for neuropathological diagnosis.
