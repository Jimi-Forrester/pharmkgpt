34200832|a|One of the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in which there are small variants of brain changes among the intermediate stages. Although there has been an increase in research into the diagnosis of AD in its early levels of developments lately, brain changes, and their complexity for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), makes early detection of AD difficult. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method that can predict MCI, early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), and AD. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fMRI dataset consisting of 138 subjects was used for evaluation. The finetuned ResNet18 network achieved a classification accuracy of 99.99%, 99.95%, and 99.95% on EMCI vs. AD, LMCI vs. AD, and MCI vs. EMCI classification scenarios, respectively. The proposed model performed better than other known models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
