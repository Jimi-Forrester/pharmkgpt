34576024|t|Molecular Proteomics and Signalling of Human Platelets in Health and Disease.
34576024|a|Platelets are small anucleate blood cells that play vital roles in haemostasis and thrombosis, besides other physiological and pathophysiological processes. These roles are tightly regulated by a complex network of signalling pathways. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques are contributing not only to the identification and quantification of new platelet proteins, but also reveal post-translational modifications of these molecules, such as acetylation, glycosylation and phosphorylation. Moreover, target proteomic analysis of platelets can provide molecular biomarkers for genetic aberrations with established or non-established links to platelet dysfunctions. In this report, we review 67 reports regarding platelet proteomic analysis and signalling on a molecular base. Collectively, these provide detailed insight into the: (i) technical developments and limitations of the assessment of platelet (sub)proteomes; (ii) molecular protein changes upon ageing of platelets; (iii) complexity of platelet signalling pathways and functions in response to collagen, rhodocytin, thrombin, thromboxane A2 and ADP; (iv) proteomic effects of endothelial-derived mediators such as prostacyclin and the anti-platelet drug aspirin; and (v) molecular protein changes in platelets from patients with congenital disorders or cardiovascular disease. However, sample sizes are still low and the roles of differentially expressed proteins are often unknown. Based on the practical and technical possibilities and limitations, we provide a perspective for further improvements of the platelet proteomic field.
