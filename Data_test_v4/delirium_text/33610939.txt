33610939|t|Understanding and controlling amyloid aggregation with chirality.
33610939|a|Amyloid aggregation and human disease are inextricably linked. Examples include Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and type II diabetes. While seminal advances on the mechanistic understanding of these diseases have been made over the last decades, controlling amyloid fibril formation still represents a challenge, and it is a subject of active research. In this regard, chiral modifications have increasingly been proved to offer a particularly well-suited approach toward accessing to previously unknown aggregation pathways and to provide with novel insights on the biological mechanisms of action of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins. Here, we summarize recent advances on how the use of mirror-image peptides/proteins and d-amino acid incorporations have helped modulate amyloid aggregation, offered new mechanistic tools to study cellular interactions, and allowed us to identify key positions within the peptide/protein sequence that influence amyloid fibril growth and toxicity.
