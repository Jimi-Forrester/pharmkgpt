30629520|t|A Smartphone Application for Automated Decision Support in Cognitive Task Based Evaluation of Central Nervous System Motor Disorders.
30629520|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: New technology enables constant boost to the powers of mobile devices, which in the previous years have transformed from simple mobile phones to smart phones. Computational powers of these electronics enable actions that previously were possible only for computers. By the use of special applications, we may benefit from sensors and multimedia capabilities of operating systems. Therefore, a new era for devoted implementations opens, in which a smart application can take a role of computing system to estimate the symptoms of diseases by evaluating signals coming from a human body. METHODS: We propose a model of an application implemented for mobile android systems, which can be used for examination of central nervous system motor disorders occurring in patients suffering from Huntington (HD), Alzheimer, or Parkinson diseases. In particular, the model tracks tremors (involuntary movements), and cognitive (memory loss or dementia) impairments using touch and visual stimulus modalities. The proposed model interprets the symptoms from human bodies that indicate one of the diseases of the nervous system. Pre-processing of collected data for feature extraction is executed on a mobile device by using core functionality and methods provided in android's application programming interface. The information is evaluated by a back-propagation neural network classifier and the result is presented to the end user. The system is able to contact medical supervision and provide an assistance from the clinic. RESULTS: The system uses a collected dataset of 1928 records, taken from 11 HD patients and 11 healthy persons in Lithuania, to gather statistics about examinations and presents the results as medical evaluation with prediction on the state of health. The accuracy of recognition of early, prodromal symptoms for central nervous system motor disorders is 86.4% (F-measure 0.859). The app (available on Google Play) is easy to use and is efficient tool for decision support in medical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: The use of intelligent apps which can help to evaluate neurodegenerative disorders is an important enhancement to medical diagnosis. The developed smartphone app supports the doctor with additional results that are easy to compare with other examinations. This kind of examination is a nice change from classic stereotypes, especially for younger age patients, who are used to various aspects of information technology.
