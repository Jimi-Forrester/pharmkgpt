37576589|a|Purpose of review: To summarizes the literature on cellular senescence and frailty in solid-organ transplantation and highlight the emerging role of senotherapeutics as a treatment for cellular senescence. Recent findings: Solid-organ transplant patients are aging. Many factors contribute to aging acceleration in this population, including cellular senescence. Senescent cells accumulate in tissues and secrete proinflammatory and profibrotic proteins which result in tissue damage. Cellular senescence contributes to age-related diseases and frailty. Our understanding of the role cellular senescence plays in transplant-specific complications such as allograft immunogenicity and infections is expanding. Promising treatments, including senolytics, senomorphics, cell-based regenerative therapies, and behavioral interventions, may reduce cellular senescence abundance and frailty in patients with solid-organ transplants. Summary: Cellular senescence and frailty contribute to adverse outcomes in solid-organ transplantation. Continued pursuit of understanding the role cellular senescence plays in transplantation may lead to improved senotherapeutic approaches and better graft and patient outcomes.
