32155681|a|OBJECTIVE: To characterise the occurrence of fever (>=38.0 C) after treatment for post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) with sublingual misoprostol 800 mcg in Latin America, where elevated rates of misoprostol's thermoregulatory effects and recipients' increased susceptibility to high fever have been documented. METHODS: A prospective observational study in hospitals in Argentina enrolled consenting women with atonic PPH after vaginal delivery, eligible to receive misoprostol. Corporal temperature was assessed at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post-treatment; other effects were recorded. The incidence of high fever >= 40.0 C (primary outcome) was compared to the rate observed previously in Ecuador. Logistic regressions were performed to identify clinical and population-based predictors of misoprostol-induced fever. RESULTS: Transient shivering and fever were experienced by 75.5% (37/49) of treated participants and described as acceptable by three-quarters of women interviewed (35/47). The high fever rate was 12.2% (6/49), [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 4.6, 24.8], compared to Ecuador's rate following misoprostol treatment (35.6% (58/163) [95% CI 28.3, 43.5], P = 0.002). Significant predictors of misoprostol-induced fever (model dependent) were as follows: pre-delivery haemoglobin < 11.0g/dl, rapid placental expulsion, and higher age of the woman. No serious outcomes were reported prior to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Misoprostol to treat PPH in Argentina resulted in a significantly lower rate of high fever than in Ecuador, although both are notably higher than rates seen elsewhere. A greater understanding of misoprostol's side effects and factors involved in their occurrence, including genetics, will help alleviate concerns. The onset of shivering may be the simplest way to know if fever can also be expected.
