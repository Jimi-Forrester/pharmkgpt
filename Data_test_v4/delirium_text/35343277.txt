35343277|t|Changes in Electrical Activities of the Brain Associated with Cognitive Functions in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.
35343277|a|Introduction: Electroencephalogram (EEG) has the potentials to decipher the neural underpinnings of cognitive processes in clinical and healthy populations. Objective: The current systematic review is intended to examine the functional brain changes underlying cognitive dysfunctions in T2DM patients. Methods: The review was conducted on studies published in the PubMed, WebofScience, Cochrane, PsycInfo database till June 2021. The keywords used were electroencephalogram, T2DM, cognitive impairment/dysfunction. We considered studies using resting-state EEG and ERP. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to compile the studies. Results: The search yielded a total of 2384 studies. Finally, 16 independent studies were included. There was a pattern of a shift in EEG power observed from higher to lower frequencies in T2DM patients, though to a lesser degree than Alzheimer's disease patients. P300 latency was increased in T2DM patients mainly over frontal, parietal, and posterior regions. P300 and N100 amplitudes were decreased in T2DM patients than in healthy controls. Conclusion: The results indicate that T2DM has consequences for cognitive functions, and it finds a place in the continuum of healthy cognition to dementia.
