33070520|a|The relationship between chronic bacterial colonization in the brain and Alzheimer's disease is attracting extensive attention. Recent studies indicated that the components of bacterial biofilm drive the amyloid-beta production. Muramyl dipeptide, the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria, contributes to the development of many central inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the involvement of Muramyl dipeptide in amyloid-beta production is not completely defined. In our present study, wild type mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of normal saline or Muramyl dipeptide. Data showed that the production of Abeta1-42 oligomers was significantly increased after Muramyl dipeptide injection in the wild type mice or incubation of the SH-SY5Y cells with Muramyl dipeptide. Moreover, the action of Muramyl dipeptide was dose- and time-dependent. The above results suggested a possibility that the Muramyl dipeptide-induced Abeta1-42 oligomer production might be related to the NOD2/p-p38 MAPK/BACE1 pathway. To confirm this, the SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNA NOD2. Data showed that the transfected SH-SY5Y cells exhibited decreased expression of Abeta1-42 oligomer, NOD2, p-p38 MAPK, and BACE1 after treatment with Muramyl dipeptide. Finally, SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with SB203580, an inhibitor of the p-38-MAPK pathway. The results indicated that these pretreated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited decreased expression of Abeta1-42 oligomer, p-p38 MAPK, and BACE1 after treatment with Muramyl dipeptide. In conclusion, these results suggested that Muramyl dipeptide was the trigger factor for Abeta1-42 oligomer production, which probably acts via the NOD2/p-p38 MAPK/BACE1 signaling pathway.
