3412205|a|The possible involvement of environmental aluminum in the etiology of Alzheimer disease and of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type is supported by both direct and indirect relationships between some encephalopathies and the abnormal presence of aluminum(III) in human and animal brain tissues. Proposals for further biochemical, toxicological and analytical work are illustrated.
