38196805|a|Objective: This study aimed to clarify the factors influencing the discharge destination of stroke patients in a super-aged rural community in Japan, focusing on functional independence and sociodemographic factors. Patients and Methods: We enrolled patients recovering from stroke with supratentorial lesions who were admitted to our convalescent rehabilitation hospital. The motor components of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM-motor) were assessed for each patient at admission and discharge as explanatory variables. An increase in the FIM-motor scores during hospitalization was also recorded. Additionally, sociodemographic data such as sex, age, and clinical characteristics, such as type of stroke, history of stroke, days from stroke onset to transfer to our convalescent rehabilitation hospital, total duration of hospital stay including acute care, number of co-resident household members, living with a spouse, and number of children were collected. As target values, discharge outcomes were categorized into two groups: returning home and going to a nursing home. Logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The study sample comprised 160 patients (mean age +- standard deviation, 74.80 +- 12.19 years). Of these, 114 were discharged to their homes, and 46 were transferred to nursing homes. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that higher FIM-motor scores at discharge, greater number of co-resident household members, and living with one's spouse were the most powerful predictors of a higher probability of returning home. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that functional independence levels and the number of co-resident household members were crucial factors in predicting the discharge destination of patients after stroke in a super-aged rural community in Japan. These findings imply that for older patients with lower functional independence, supportive social networks are essential for home discharge, offering clues for providing long-term healthcare in super-aged rural communities worldwide.
