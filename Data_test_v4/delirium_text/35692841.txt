35692841|t|Identification of Immune Infiltration-Related ceRNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Prognosis of Patients With Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
35692841|a|Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally; hence, relevant clinical biomarkers are necessary to enable diagnosis, early detection, and development of novel therapies. The differentially expressed genes were annotated and visualized using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia. In addition, a competitive endogenous ribonucleic acids network was constructed using Cytoscape, which explained the regulation of gene expression in glaucoma. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to analyze the immune microenvironment. We validated that the core genes could predict glaucoma occurrence and development and identified potential molecular mechanism pathways, which were associated with immune infiltration and participated in endogenous regulation networks. Our data may partially explain the pathogenesis of glaucoma and they provide potential theoretical support for targeted therapy.
