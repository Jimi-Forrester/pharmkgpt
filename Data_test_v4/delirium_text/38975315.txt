38975315|a|Objectives: We hope to offer a comprehensive understanding of the advancements and patterns in research on PND. Methods: We performed a thorough search on the Web of Science Core Collection to locate relevant studies published from 1969 to 2022 and utilized four distinct tools, namely VOSviewer (J Data Inf Sci, 2017, 2, 1; J Am Soc Inf Sci, 1973, 24, 265; Amer Doc, 1963, 14, 10 and Scientometrics, 2010, 82, 581), CiteSpace (Scientometrics, 2010, 84, 523), Scimago Graphica, and R-bibliometrix which allowed us to examine various aspects. Results: We included a total of 6787 articles and reviews for analysis which described PND research, the sources, and the subfields; highlighted the significant developments in this field; identified three main directions in PND.Conclusion: This study highlights the rapid growth of research on PND in recent years and provided an overview of previous studies in the field of PND, thereby establishing the overall landscape of PND research and identifying potential avenues for future investigations. Methods: We performed a thorough search on the Web of Science Core Collection to locate relevant studies published from 1969 to 2022. To perform bibliometric analysis and network visualization, we utilized four distinct tools, namely VOSviewer (J Data Inf Sci, 2017, 2, 1; J Am Soc Inf Sci, 1973, 24, 265; Amer Doc, 1963, 14, 10 and Scientometrics, 2010, 82, 581), CiteSpace (Scientometrics, 2010, 84, 523), Scimago Graphica, and R-bibliometrix. These tools allowed us to examine various aspects, including the yearly publication output, the contribution of different countries or regions, the involvement of active journals, co-citation analysis, publication status, keywords, and terms, as well as scientific categories. We hope to offer a comprehensive understanding of the advancements and patterns in research on PND. The insights gained from this study can assist researchers and clinicians in enhancing the management and implementation of their work in this field. Results: In this study, we included a total of 6787 articles and reviews for analysis. First, publication trends and contribution by country analysis described PND research. Second, a historical analysis described PND research, the sources, and the subfields. Third, an analysis of keywords highlighted the significant developments in this field. Fourth, an analysis of research themes identified three main directions in PND. Conclusion: In summary, the research volume exhibits exponential growth over time. Furthermore, the majority of contributions originate from Western countries and China. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is evident, with its roots in biology and medicine and further branching into psychology and social sciences. POCD, delirium-predominant associated clinical management were major research themes about PND.
