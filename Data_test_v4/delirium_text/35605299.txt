35605299|t|Zinc carnosine: Frontiers advances of supplement for cancer therapy.
35605299|a|Zinc (Zn) has an existence within large quantities in the human brain, while accumulating within synaptic vesicle. There is growing evidence that Zn metabolic equilibrium breaking participates into different diseases (e.g., vascular dementia, carcinoma, Alzheimer's disease). Carnosine refers to an endogenic dipeptide abundant in skeletal muscle and brains and exerts a variety of positive influences (e.g., carcinoma resistance, crosslinking resistance, metal chelation and oxidation limitation). A complex of Zn and carnosine, called Zinc-L-carnosine (ZnC), has been extensively employed within Zn supplement therapeutic method and the treating approach for ulcers. ZnC has been shown to play a variety of roles in the body, including inhibiting intracellular reactive oxygen species(ROS) and free radical levels, inhibiting inflammation, supplementing zinc enzymes and promoting wound healing and mucosal cell repair. The present study conducting a reviewing process for the advances of ZnC in tumor adjuvant therapy.
