32146060|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of phthalide alkyl tertiary amine derivatives as promising acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with high potency and selectivity against Alzheimer's disease.
32146060|a|A series of phthalide alkyl tertiary amine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as potential multi-target agents against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results indicated that almost all the compounds displayed significant AChE inhibitory and selective activities. Besides, most of the derivatives exhibited increased self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation inhibitory activity compared to the lead compound dl-NBP, and some compounds also exerted good antioxidant activity. Specifically, compound I-8 showed the highest inhibitory potency toward AChE (IC50 = 2.66 nM), which was significantly better than Donepezil (IC50 = 26.4 nM). Moreover, molecular docking studies revealed that compound I-8 could bind to both the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. Furthermore, compound I-8 displayed excellent BBB permeability in vitro. Importantly, the step-down passive avoidance test indicated that I-8 significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. Collectively, these results suggested that I-8 might be a potent and selective AChE inhibitor for further anti-AD drug development.
