11804704|t|Association of CSF apolipoprotein E, Abeta42 and cognition in Alzheimer's disease.
11804704|a|A significant association between CSF Abeta42 and cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) homozygous for the epsilon3 allele of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) has been described. In this study we extended our observations on apoE, as another plaque component, and investigated the association between CSF apoE concentrations and cognitive performance after stratification for the apoE genotype in 62 patients with AD, 19 other forms of dementia and 18 controls. CSF Abeta42 and apoE concentrations were significantly and positively associated with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in AD (Abeta42: r = 0.332; P = 0.026; apoE: r = 0.386; P = 0.006). For Abeta42 this association was exclusively present in epsilon3 homozygotes (r = 0.44; P = 0.014), whereas apoE was correlated with MMSE in epsilon4 hetero- or homozygotes subjects (epsilon4/epsilonX: r = 0.638; P = 0.004: epsilon4/epsilon4; r = 0.812; P = 0.05). No association was observed between CSF concentrations of Abeta42 and apoE. The significant relationship between MMSE and CSF Abeta42 in epsilon3 homozygotes and apoE in epsilon4 hetero- and homozygotes respectively may suggest that both proteins may be associated independently from each other with cognitive decline.
