36644525|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the general populations, and in particular of health professionals. Primary care personnel are at greater risk due to being highly exposed to the disease and working regularly in direct contact with patients suffering COVID-19. However, there is not sufficient evidence on the long-term psychological impact these professionals may suffer. We aimed to explore the long-term psychological impact of COVID-19 on primary care professionals. METHODS: We applied a two-phase design; a self-reported psychopathology screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and IES-R) in phase-1, and a specialized psychiatric evaluation (MINI, HDRS and STAI) in phase-2 to confirm phase-1 results. Evaluations were carried at the beginning of the pandemic (May-June 2020) (n=410) and one year later (n=339). Chi-square, ANOVA and logistic regression tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Primary care professionals presented high rates of depression, anxiety and psychological distress, measured by PHQ-9, GAD-7 and IES-R respectively during the pandemic. Depressive symptoms  severity (PHQ-9: 7.5 vs 8.4, p=0.013) increased after one year of COVID-19 pandemic. After one year nearly 40% of subjects presented depression. Being women, having suffered COVID-19 or a relative with COVID-19, and being a front-line professional were risk factors for presenting depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: Primary Care professionals in Cantabria present a poor mental health during COVID-19 pandemic, which has even worsened at long-term, presenting a greater psychopathology severity one year after. Thus, it is critical implementing prevention and early-treatment programs to help these essential professionals to cope with the pandemic.
