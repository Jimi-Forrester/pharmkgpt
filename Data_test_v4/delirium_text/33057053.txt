33057053|a|Stress can predispose to depressive episodes, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating the transition from the initial stress response to a persistent pathological depressive state remain poorly understood. We profiled the development of an enduring depressive-like state by assessing affective behavior and hippocampal function during the 2 months following social-defeat stress. We measured remodeling of hippocampal extracellular matrix (ECM) during this period, as we recently identified ECM changes to mediate cognitive impairment during the sustained depressive-like state. Affective disturbance and cognitive impairments develop disparately after social stress, with gradual appearance of affective deficits. In contrast, spatial memory was impaired both early after stress and during the late-emerging chronic depressive-like state, while intact in-between. Similarly, we observed a biphasic regulation of the hippocampal ECM coinciding with hippocampus-dependent memory deficits. Together our data (1) reveal a dichotomy between affective and cognitive impairments similar to that observed in patients, (2) indicate different molecular processes taking place during early stress and the chronic depressive-like state, and (3) support a role of the ECM in mediating long-lasting effects on memory. From a translational point of view, it is important to prioritize on temporal phenotypic aspects in animal models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of depression.
