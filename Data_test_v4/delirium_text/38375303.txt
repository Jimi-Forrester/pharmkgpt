38375303|a|Traditional medicines are becoming more popular as people become more aware of the dangers of synthetic pharmaceuticals. Tribulus terrestris L., (Gokharu) an annual herbaceous plant, has been extensively utilized by herbalists for numerous medicinal purposes. T. terrestris has been studied for its multiple therapeutic effects, including immunomodulatory, aphrodisiac, anti-urolithic, absorption enhancer, cardioprotective, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, neuro-protective, anticancer, and analgesic properties. Saponins and flavonoids are two examples of beneficial substances that have recently been found in T. terrestris. These chemicals are very important for a variety of therapeutic effects. Numerous studies have shown that T. terrestris products and various parts may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, testosterone-boosting, and liver protective effects. According to the published evidence, T. terrestris boosts testosterone secretion, regulates blood pressure, and protects the human body against injuries. The cardiovascular, reproductive, and urinary systems are all severely impacted. Due to its potent bioactive compounds, the literature evaluated from a wide range of sources including books, reports, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Springer, and other databases demonstrated the extraordinary potential to treat numerous human and animal ailments. Our review is different from other published articles because we explored its importance for humans and especially in veterinary like poultry health. It could also be used as an aphrodisiac to treat different fertility-related disorders in human and animal science. More research into the pharmacodynamics of herbs like T. terrestris is needed so that it can be used in a wider variety of nutraceutical products for humans and poultry.
