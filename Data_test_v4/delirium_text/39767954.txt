39767954|t|Long-Term Results After Salter Innominate Osteotomy for the Treatment of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip-Only 8% Rate of Total Hip Arthroplasty at a Median Follow-Up of 22 Years.
39767954|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The redirection or reshaping of the acetabulum might be warranted to attain a concentric and stable hip in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The aim of this study is to assess the late clinical and radiological results, and to determine the number of patients requiring secondary surgery or a total hip arthroplasty at a long-term follow-up. METHODS: Our institution performed 99 Salter osteotomies on 76 patients without underlying neuromuscular conditions over a 21-year period, from 1981 to 2002. These procedures were carried out by three different surgeons. Patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation at the review visit, including a physical examination, clinical assessments using the Harris hip score (HHS), Oxford score (OHS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score, as well as pelvic radiographs. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 22 years, total hip arthroplasty was performed in 6 out of 77 hips (8%). Patients who underwent a Salter osteotomy with an open reduction had a higher rate of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head compared to those who only underwent a Salter pelvic osteotomy (p < 0.001). There were statistically significant differences in the group with and without AVN in terms of HHS (p = 0.006, 95%CI 0.003 to 0.006), OHS (p = 0.016, 95%CI 0.012 to 0.017), a modified OHS (p = 0.018, 95% CI 0.012 to 0.016), a VAS score in activity (p = 0.046, 95%CI 0.042 to 0.050) and VAS score satisfaction (p = 0.005, 95%CI 0.003 to 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of THA was 8% at a mean of follow-up of 22 years. Secondary results suggest that AVN occurs more frequently when a Salter osteotomy is combined with an open reduction. The occurrence of AVN is associated with significantly lower clinical outcome scores and patient satisfaction, as well as significantly higher pain scores. In the absence of AVN, good clinical results can be expected at long-term follow-up.
