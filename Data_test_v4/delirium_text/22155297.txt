22155297|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and most common cause of dementia. However, there is no known way to halt or cure the neurodegenerative disease. Oxidative stress is a cardinal hallmark of the disease and has been considered as therapeutic target for AD treatment. Several factors may contribute to oxidative stress in AD brains. First, mitochondrion is a key player that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial dysfunction found in AD patients may exaggerate generation of ROS and oxidative stress. Second, amyloid-beta peptide generates ROS in the presence of metal ions such as Fe(2+) and Cu(2+). Third, activated glial cells in AD brains may produce excessive amount of superoxide and nitric oxide through NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, respectively. Increased ROS can cause damage to protein, lipid and nucleic acids. Numerous studies demonstrated that natural polyphenolic compounds protect against various neurotoxic insults in vitro and in vivo AD models. In these studies, dietary polyphenolic compounds exhibit neuroprotective effects through scavenging free radicals and increasing antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, they could facilitate the endogenous antioxidant system by stimulating transcription. Some epidemiological and clinical studies highlighted their therapeutic potential for AD treatment. In this review, we will briefly discuss causes of oxidative stress in AD brains, and describe antioxidant neuroprotective effects and therapeutic potential for AD of selected natural polyphenolic compounds.
