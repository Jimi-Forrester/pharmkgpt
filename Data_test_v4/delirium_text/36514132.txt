However, how microglia respond and regulate demyelination is not fully understood. METHODS: To understand how microglia respond during demyelination, we fed mice cuprizone-a potent demyelinating agent-and assessed the dynamics of genetically fate-mapped microglia. We then used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify and track the microglial subpopulations that arise during demyelination. To understand how microglia contribute to the clearance of dead oligodendrocytes, we ablated microglia starting at the peak of cuprizone-induced cell death and used the viability dye acridine orange to monitor apoptotic and lytic cell morphologies after microglial ablation. Lastly, we treated serum-free primary microglial cultures to model distinct aspects of cuprizone-induced demyelination and assessed the response. RESULTS: The cuprizone diet generated a robust microglial response by week 4 of the diet. Single-cell RNA sequencing at this time point revealed the presence of several cuprizone-associated microglia (CAM) clusters. These clusters expressed a transcriptomic signature indicative of cytokine regulation and reactive oxygen species production with altered lysosomal and metabolic changes consistent with ongoing phagocytosis. Using acridine orange to monitor apoptotic and lytic cell death after microglial ablation, we found that microglia preferentially phagocytose lytic carcasses. In culture, microglia exposed to lytic carcasses partially recapitulated the CAM state, suggesting that phagocytosis contributes to this distinct microglial state during cuprizone demyelination. CONCLUSIONS: Microglia serve multiple roles during demyelination, yet their transcriptomic state resembles other neurodegenerative conditions. The phagocytosis of cellular debris is likely a universal cause for a common neurodegenerative microglial state.
