26138001|a|BACKGROUND: Latency of P300 subcomponent of event-related potentials (ERPs) increases in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, which correlate well with cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) reduce P300 latency in AD patients with parallel improvement in cognition. It is not known whether N200 response to ChEIs is similar to that of P300. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare characteristics of P300 and N200 in AD patients, treatment-naive and on stable donepezil treatment, matched by age, education, sex, and cognitive function. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We recruited 22 consecutive treatment-naive AD patients (AD-N group), 22 AD patients treated with a stable donepezil dose of 10 mg/day for at least 3 months (AD-T group), and 50 healthy controls were recruited. Neuropsychological testing (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, and additional tests) and ERP recording was performed and analyzed. RESULTS: All groups did not differ according to age, duration of education, or sex (p>0.05). AD-N and AD-T groups did not differ according to cognitive function. The AD-T group had longer duration of disease than the AD-N group (p<0.001). The AD-T and AD-N groups did not differ in P300 latencies (p=0.49). N200 latency was longer in the AD-T group (p<0.001). The general linear model showed that significant predictors of P300 latency were age (p=0.019) and AD treatment status (p<0.001). Duration of AD was a significant predictor of N200 latency (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The response of N200 latency to donepezil treatment differs from the response of P300. P300 is a better marker of ChEI treatment-dependent cognitive functions. N200 is more dependent on the duration of AD.
