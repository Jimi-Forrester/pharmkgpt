38930118|t|Diagnostic Utility of Specific Frailty Questionnaire: The Kihon Checklist for Hippocampal Atrophy in COPD.
38930118|a|Background/Objectives: COPD patients who are frail have been reported to develop brain atrophy, but no non-invasive diagnostic tool has been developed to detect this condition. Our study aimed to explore the diagnostic utility of the Kihon Checklist (KCL), a frailty questionnaire, in assessing hippocampal volume loss in patients with COPD. Methods: We recruited 40 COPD patients and 20 healthy individuals using the KCL to assess frailty across seven structural domains. Hippocampal volumes were obtained from T1-weighted MRI images, and ROC analysis was performed to detect hippocampal atrophy. Results: Our results showed that patients with COPD had significantly greater atrophic left hippocampal volumes than healthy subjects (p < 0.05). The univariate correlation coefficient between the left hippocampal volume and KCL (1-20), which pertains to instrumental and social activities of daily living, was the largest (rho = -0.54, p < 0.0005) among the KCL subdomains. Additionally, both KCL (1-25) and KCL (1-20) demonstrated useful diagnostic potential (93% specificity and 90% sensitivity, respectively) for identifying individuals in the lowest 25% of the left hippocampal volume (AUC = 0.82). Conclusions: Our study suggests that frailty questionnaires focusing on daily vulnerability, such as the KCL, can effectively detect hippocampal atrophy in COPD patients.
