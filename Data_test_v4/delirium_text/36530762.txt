36530762|a|Even in the early stages of cognitive impairment, older people can present important motor alterations. However, there are no studies that have investigated Timed Up and Go (TUG) and its subtasks in predicting impairment of functional capacity over time in this population. Objectives: The aim of this study was to verify if the TUG test and its subtasks can predict functional decline over 32 months in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: This is a prospective 32-month follow-up study, including at baseline 78 older adults (MCI: n=40; AD: n=38). The TUG and its subtasks (e.g., sit-to-stand, walking forward, turn, walking back, and turn-to-sit) were performed at baseline using the Qualisys Motion system. Functional capacity was assessed at baseline and after 32 months. Results: After follow-up, the sample had 45 older adults (MCI: n=25; AD: n=20). Of these, 28 declined functional capacity (MCI: n=13; AD: n=15). No TUG variable significantly predicted (p>0.05) functional decline in both groups, by univariate logistic regression analysis with the covariate gender. Conclusions: Although older adults with MCI and mild AD declined functional capacity, the TUG test and its subtasks could not predict this decline over 32 months.
