38139097|a|Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects older premutation carriers (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X gene. Despite the high prevalence of the FXTAS disorder, neuropathology studies of individuals affected by FXTAS are limited. We performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in the hippocampus of 26 FXTAS cases and analyzed the tissue microscopically. The major neuropathological characteristics were white matter disease, intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes, and neuron loss. Astrocytes contained more and larger inclusions than neurons. There was a negative correlation between age of death and CGG repeat length in cases over the age of 60. The number of astroglial inclusions (CA3 and dentate gyrus) and the number of CA3 neuronal inclusions increased with elevated CGG repeat length. In the two cases with a CGG repeat size less than 65, FXTAS intranuclear inclusions were not present in the hippocampus, while in the two cases with less than 70 (65-70) CGG repeat expansion, neurons and astrocytes with inclusions were occasionally identified in the CA1 sub-region. These findings add hippocampus neuropathology to the previously reported changes in other areas of the brain in FXTAS patients, with implications for understanding FXTAS pathogenesis.
