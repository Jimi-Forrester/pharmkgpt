35138147|t|Axillary Microbiota Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease Patients.
35138147|a|Cognitive impairment (CI) is among the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), with a substantially negative impact on patient management and outcome. The development and progression of CI exhibits high interindividual variability, which requires better diagnostic and monitoring strategies. PD patients often display sweating disorders resulting from autonomic dysfunction, which has been associated with CI. Because the axillary microbiota is known to change with humidity level and sweat composition, we hypothesized that the axillary microbiota of PD patients shifts in association with CI progression, and thus can be used as a proxy for classification of CI stages in PD. We compared the axillary microbiota compositions of 103 PD patients (55 PD patients with dementia [PDD] and 48 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment [PD-MCI]) and 26 cognitively normal healthy controls (HC). We found that axillary microbiota profiles differentiate HC, PD-MCI, and PDD groups based on differential ranking analysis, and detected an increasing trend in the log ratio of Corynebacterium to Anaerococcus in progression from HC to PDD. In addition, phylogenetic factorization revealed that the depletion of the Anaerococcus, Peptoniphilus, and W5053 genera is associated with PD-MCI and PDD. Moreover, functional predictions suggested significant increases in myo-inositol degradation, ergothioneine biosynthesis, propionate biosynthesis, menaquinone biosynthesis, and the proportion of aerobic bacteria and biofilm formation capacity, in parallel to increasing CI. Our results suggest that alterations in axillary microbiota are associated with CI in PD. Thus, axillary microbiota has the potential to be exploited as a noninvasive tool in the development of novel strategies. IMPORTANCE Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Cognitive impairment (CI) in PD has significant negative impacts on life quality of patients. The emergence and progression of cognitive impairment shows high variability among PD patients, and thus requires better diagnostic and monitoring strategies. Recent findings indicate a close link between autonomic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Since thermoregulatory dysfunction and skin changes are among the main manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in PD, we hypothesized that alterations in the axillary microbiota may be useful for tracking cognitive impairment stages in PD. To our knowledge, this the first study characterizing the axillary microbiota of PD patients and exploring its association with cognitive impairment stages in PD. Future studies should include larger cohorts and multicenter studies to validate our results and investigate potential biological mechanisms.
