34178339|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 is a devastating illness that has infected millions of people since the beginning of year 2020, through its multi-systemic manifestations that range widely in severity. Because current knowledge on the types and severities of medical illnesses encountered by patients who recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 is limited, it remains unknown whether these illnesses are direct sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 infection or unrelated coincidences. In this article, we summarize the evidence currently available on post-coronavirus disease 2019 medical complications and propose directions for studying the long-term complications of coronavirus disease 2019 in the future.
