39723433|a|Background: The factors influencing nurses' knowledge of delirium in acute care settings have not been fully investigated in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate these factors among nurses in acute care settings in the northern region of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenience sample of 234 acute care nurses at the main public hospitals in the Hail region of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a structured, self-administered questionnaire, from November 2023 to February 2024. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors of knowledge about delirium. Results: Of the acute care nurses, 7.3% had a good level of overall knowledge about delirium, while 66.1% and 26.6% showed poor and moderate levels, respectively. Most nurses (78.2%) had poor knowledge of delirium assessment. Significantly higher scores on delirium assessment were observed for nurses who reported receiving in-service training on delirium (P = 0.006) and when a clear job description was applied (P = 0.031), whereas significantly higher scores on knowledge about risk factors were observed for those who had previous experience in caring for delirious patients (P <0.001), received educational sessions on delirium (P = 0.001), and participated in training on delirium care (P <0.001). Lack of previous experience in caring for delirious patients and participation in delirium care training were significant factors for lower knowledge about delirium scores (CI=-5.750 --1.200, P <0.001). Conclusion: In-service training, daily clinical discussion, availability of instructional materials, and specific training on delirium significantly influence nurses' knowledge about delirium, particularly regarding delirium assessment and early recognition. Enhancing these factors could improve nurses' knowledge and the care and management of patients complaining of delirium in acute care settings.
