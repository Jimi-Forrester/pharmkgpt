35978521|a|The T7 phage is a virulent phage hosted by Escherichia coli, which poses no threat to animals and plants. Due to the advantages of small genome, well elucidated functional genomics, fast life cycle, and high stability, T7 phage has been widely used in many fields, including biology and medicine. In this review, we focus on the research of T7 phages in biological sciences and medicine, including the application of T7 phages and T7 phage products, T7 phage display systems, and recombinant T7 phages in the treatment and diagnosis of infectious diseases (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and tumor diseases. In addition, we also introduce the therapeutic application of T7 phage in various diseases such as allergic reaction, Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory reaction, and other diseases, and finally discuss the future direction of T7 phage application in the biomedical field.
