26874041|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress may be involved in occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD). 8-iso-Prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), an isoprostane derived from arachidonic acid via lipid peroxidation, is considered a gold standard for measuring oxidative stress. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of postoperative plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels to predict POD and POCD in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. METHODS: Postoperative plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels of 182 patients were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We assessed the relationships between plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels and the risk of POD and POCD using a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels and age were identified as the independent predictors for POD and POCD. Based on areas under receiver operating characteristic curve, the predictive values of 8-iso-PGF2alpha were obviously higher than those of age for POD and POCD. In a combined logistic-regression model, 8-iso-PGF2alpha significantly enhanced the areas under curve of age for prediction of POD and POCD. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative plasma 8-iso-PGF2alpha levels may have the potential to predict POD and POCD in elder patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
