38284555|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the precision of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration biomarker measurements from venous dried plasma spots (DPSv enous ) for the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases in remote settings. METHODS: In a discovery (n = 154) and a validation cohort (n = 115), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); neurofilament light (NfL); amyloid beta (Abeta) 40, Abeta42; and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181 and p-tau217) were measured in paired DPSvenous and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma samples with single-molecule array. In the validation cohort, a subset of participants (n = 99) had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. RESULTS: All DPSvenous and plasma analytes correlated significantly, except for Abeta42. In the validation cohort, DPSvenous GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, and p-tau217 differed between CSF Abeta-positive and -negative individuals and were associated with worsening cognition. DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that measuring blood biomarkers related to AD pathology and neurodegeneration from DPSvenous extends the utility of blood-based biomarkers to remote settings with simplified sampling conditions, storage, and logistics. HIGHLIGHTS: A wide array of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration were detectable in dried plasma spots (DPSvenous ). DPSvenous biomarkers correlated with standard procedures and cognitive status. DPSvenous biomarkers had a good diagnostic accuracy discriminating amyloid status. Our findings show the potential interchangeability of DPSvenous and plasma sampling. DPSvenous may facilitate remote and temperature-independent sampling for AD biomarker measurement. Innovative tools for blood biomarker sampling may help recognizing the earliest changes of AD.
