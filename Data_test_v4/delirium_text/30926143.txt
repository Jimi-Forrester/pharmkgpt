30926143|a|The dynamics of CNS function rely upon omnidirectional communication among CNS cell types. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of this communication and are actively involved in response to CNS injury, mediating inflammatory response and inflammation-related neuroprotection as they display dual beneficial and detrimental roles. Neuroimmune interactions include communication between neurons and microglia, the resident macrophages within the CNS, and these interactions are a critical mediator of healthy brain functions, mounting an inflammatory response, and disease pathogenesis. This review aims to organize recent research highlighting the role of EVs in health and neurodegenerative disorders, with a specific focus on neuroimmune interactions between neurons and glia in Alzheimer's disease.
