21688526|t|[Charles Bonnet syndrome: case reports and short review].
21688526|a|Charles Bonnet first described visual hallucinations in a ground of visual deprivation in the 18th century. In this paper, two case reports with the syndrome are presented (female 83 years old, male 68 years old) along with a short literature review. The distinction of the syndrome from other psychiatric disorders (delirium, dementia), where visual hallucinations are also present, demands the presence of the diagnostical triad: visual hallucinations, visual impairment, intact cognitive status. The hallucinations are rich in colors and tension, people usually have the "leading roles" and patients mostly are curious, enjoy the hallucinations and are not afraid of them. More often hallucinations appear after acute visual impairment and in older patients. There are several theories concerning the mechanisms that lead to the syndrome. The Charles Bonnet syndrome appears to be self-restricted and there are no clear guidelines regarding its treatment.
