38335640|a|OBJECTIVES: To identify different mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phenotypes based on substantial relative impairment in specific cognitive domains and then characterize the complex process of general cognitive and daily functions over time in older adults with these MCI subtypes. METHODS: A total of 1020 participants with MCI at baseline from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were recruited. MCI subtypes were obtained based on neuropsychological tests in five cognitive domains: memory (M), visuospatial function (V), language (L), processing speed (P), and executive function (E). General cognitive function and daily function were measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), respectively. Linear mixed models were fitted to curve their trajectories across different MCI subtypes. RESULTS: Considering visuospatial function, subtypes were MO (memory impaired only), M&V (memory and visuospatial function impaired) and M&nV (memory impaired and visuospatial function non-impaired). Similar subtypes and naming rules were obtained based on language, executive function, and processing speed. Further, depending on the number of relative impaired cognitive domains M&S and M&M were obtained. Participants with MO had the highest prevalence in the sample (53.4 %), followed by M&nV (31.1 %). Participants with M&V had the highest mean age (74.69 years) at baseline and the greatest dementia conversion rate (53.2 %). The MMSE and FAQ score trajectories changed most slowly in participants with MO while fastest in those with M&V. Obvious different trajectories of both MMSE and FAQ scores were observed across different subtypes based on visuospatial function and executive function. CONCLUSION: Compared to MO, individuals with multi-dimensional cognitive impairment have worse general cognitive and daily functions, especially for those with M&V.
