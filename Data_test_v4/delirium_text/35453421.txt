35453421|t|Oriented Deep Eutectic Solvents as Efficient Approach for Selective Extraction of Bioactive Saponins from Husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge.
35453421|a|The husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge (X. sorbifolia), as by-products of industrial production, have brought a severe burden to the environment and caused an enormous waste of resources. Bioactive triterpenoid saponins are rich in the husks. To reuse the husks and gain high-quality saponin products, saponin-oriented deep eutectic solvents (DESs), as an efficient and selective extraction strategy from X. sorbifolia husks, were designed for the first time. The enhancement of the extraction rate was investigated by screening solvents from acidic DESs and response surface methodology (RSM) optimization. As a result, the tetrapropylammonium bromide-lactic acid (TPMBr-La) was the most efficient DESs, with an extraction efficiency of up to 135% higher than 70% ethanol. A maximum extraction rate of 72.11 +- 0.61 mg Re/g dw was obtained under the optimized parameters. Scanning electron microscope graphs revealed that damage to the microstructure caused by DESs enhanced the extraction efficiency. Moreover, the recovery of total saponins with D101 macroporous resin was consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Seven saponins were also identified by HPLC-MS analysis. Finally, TPMBr-La extracts exhibited 92.30 +- 1.10% DPPH radical scavenging rate at 100 mug/mL, and 92.20 +- 0.30% ABTS radical scavenging rate at 1200 mug/mL. Our current research proposes a selective and high-efficiency substitute for the extraction of saponins and might contribute to further DESs application in the recycling of by-products.
