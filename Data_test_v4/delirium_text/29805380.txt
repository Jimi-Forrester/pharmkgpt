29805380|t|Frontal White Matter Hyperintensity Is Associated with Verbal Aggressiveness in Elderly Women with Alzheimer Disease and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.
29805380|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are exhibited in most patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Although white matter hyperintensity (WMH) is often observed with AD, the precise role of WMH in BPSD remains unclear. The current study aimed to identify the impact of regional WMH on specific features of BPSD in persons with mild to moderate AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: A sample of 256 female outpatients with AD (n = 217) and aMCI (n = 39) were recruited. We assessed BPSD using the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale. WMH and brain atrophy were evaluated using an automatic segmentation program. Regional WMH was evaluated as periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep WMH in frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes. RESULTS: Whole-brain WMH was associated with verbal aggressiveness. In multivariate analysis, PVH in the frontal lobe was independently associated with verbal aggressiveness after adjustment for brain atrophy and clinical confounders. CONCLUSION: The current results indicated that PVH in the frontal lobe was independently associated with verbal aggressiveness.
