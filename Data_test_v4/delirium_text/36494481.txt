36494481|t|MKL-1-induced PINK1-AS overexpression contributes to the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via ALDOA-mediated glycolysis.
36494481|a|Aldolase A (ALDOA), an important metabolic enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, plays an important role in regulating tumour metabolism. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of ALDOA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its biological role in tumour progression. Bioinformatics analysis, western blot (WB) and RT-qPCR were performed to detect the relative expression of ALDOA in HCC tissues and cell lines. A loss-of-function approach was used to investigate the biological function of ALDOA. The role of ALDOA on glycolysis was assessed by WB, glucose and lactate assay kits and a nude mouse xenograft model. Luciferase reporter experiment, chromatin immunoprecipitation and WB were performed to elucidate the underlying molecular. The expression level of ALODA was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. High ALDOA levels were associated with poorer patient overall survival. Mechanistic studies suggest that ALDOA is a direct target of miR-34a-5p, which can inhibit glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting the 3'UTR of ALDOA. PINK1 antisense RNA (PINK1-AS) competitively sponged miR-34a-5p to increase ALDOA expression by antagonizing miR-34a-5p-mediated ALDOA inhibition. MKL-1 acted as a transcription factor to promote the expression of PINK1-AS and ALDOA, thus promoting the deterioration of HCC cells. This study shows that high expression of ALDOA contributes to the development and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and will be a target and potential prognostic biomarker for the treatment of HCC.
