37357520|t|Naturally Occurring Cholinesterase Inhibitors from Plants, Fungi, Algae, and Animals: A Review of the Most Effective Inhibitors Reported in 2012-2022.
37357520|a|Since the development of the "cholinergic hypothesis" as an important therapeutic approach in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the scientific community has made a remarkable effort to discover new and effective molecules with the ability to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The natural function of this enzyme is to catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain. Thus, its inhibition increases the levels of this neurochemical and improves the cholinergic functions in patients with AD alleviating the symptoms of this neurological disorder. In recent years, attention has also been focused on the role of another enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), mainly in the advanced stages of AD, transforming this enzyme into another target of interest in the search for new anticholinesterase agents. Over the past decades, Nature has proven to be a rich source of bioactive compounds relevant to the discovery of new molecules with potential applications in AD therapy. Bioprospecting of new cholinesterase inhibitors among natural products has led to the discovery of an important number of new AChE and BChE inhibitors that became potential lead compounds for the development of anti-AD drugs. This review summarizes a total of 260 active compounds from 142 studies which correspond to the most relevant (IC 50 <= 15 microM) research work published during 2012-2022 on plant-derived anticholinesterase compounds, as well as several potent inhibitors obtained from other sources like fungi, algae, and animals.
