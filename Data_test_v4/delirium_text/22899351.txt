22899351|t|The equilibria of sphingolipid-cholesterol and sphingolipid-sphingolipid in monolayers at the air-water interface.
22899351|a|Monolayers of sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide (Cer) and cholesterol (Ch) and binary mixtures SM-Ch, SM-Cer and Cer-Ch were investigated at the air-water interface. SM, Cer and Ch were used in the experiment. The surface tension values of pure and mixed monolayers were used to calculate pi-A isotherms. Surface tension measurements were carried out at 22  C using a Teflon trough and a Nima 9000 tensiometer. Interactions between sphingolipid and Ch as well as sphingolipid and another sphingolipid result in significant deviations from the additivity rule. An equilibrium theory to describe the behavior of monolayer components at the air-water interface was developed in order to obtain the stability constants and Gibbs free energy values of SM-Ch, SM-Cer and Cer-Ch complexes. We considered the equilibrium between the individual components and the complex and established that sphingolipid and Ch as well as sphingolipid and another sphingolipid formed highly stable 1:1 complexes.
