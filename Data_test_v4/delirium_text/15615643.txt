15615643|t|Transgenic animal models of tauopathies.
15615643|a|Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and other related diseases with prominent tau pathology. Research advances in the last several decades have characterized and defined tau neuropathologies of both neuron and glia in these diverse disorders and this has stimulated development of animal models of tauopathies. Indeed, animal models ranging from invertebrate species such as C. elegan to Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian transgenic mouse models of tauopathies have been generated and reported. This review summarizes the salient features of many of the known models of tauopathies.
