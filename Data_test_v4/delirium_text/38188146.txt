38188146|a|Excessive induction of inflammatory and immune responses is widely considered as one of vital factors contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Neutrophils are well-studied members of inflammatory and immune cell family, contributing to the innate and adaptive immunity. Neutrophil-released neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play an important role in the regulation of various kinds of diseases, including CNS diseases. In this review, current knowledge on the biological features of NETs will be introduced. In addition, the role of NETs in several popular and well-studied CNS diseases including cerebral stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and neurological cancers will be described and discussed through the reviewing of previous related studies.
