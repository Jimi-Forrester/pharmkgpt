26837944|a|OBJECTIVE: It is generally acknowledged that drug dependence is connected with abnormal functional organization in the individual's brain. The present study aimed to identify the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) abnormality with the cerebral networks involved in betel quid dependence (BQD) by resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: With fMRI data measured from 33 resting-state BQD individuals and 32 non-addicted and age-, sex-, education-matched healthy controls, we inquired into the BQD-related changes in FC between the regions of ACC with the whole brain involved in BQD individuals using a region of interest vised method, and to identify the relation of the alteration with the severity of BQD and duration. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the BQD group showed increased connectivity from ACC to the regions of the reward network (brainstem including midbrain regions such as the ventral tegmental area and pons, caudate, thalamus) and cerebellum. Decreased connectivity was observed in the BQD group in regions from ACC to the default mode network (medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus) and para Hippocampal/hypothalamus. Specifically, the BQD scale was positively correlated with increased FC of right ACC to left thalamus and left ACC to pons; the durations were negatively correlated with FC of right ACC to left precuneus. CONCLUSION: These disturbances in rsFC from ACC to the reward network and DMN revealed by fMRI may have a key function in providing insights into the neurological pathophysiology underlying BQD-associated executive dysfunction and disinhibition. These findings may contribute to our better understanding of the mechanisms underlying BQD.
