38238547|t|Risk for diagnosis or treatment of mood or anxiety disorders in adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2020-2022.
38238547|a|COVID-19 is associated with increased risks for mood or anxiety disorders, but it remains uncertain how the association evolves over time or which patient groups are most affected. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide database of electronic health records to determine the risk of depressive or anxiety disorder diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection by 3-month blocks from January 2020 to April 2022. The study population comprised 822,756 patients (51.8% female; mean age 42.8 years) with COVID-19 and 2,034,353 patients with other respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (53.5% female, mean age 30.6 years). First time diagnoses of depressive or anxiety disorders 14 days to 3 months after infection, as well as new or new plus recurrent prescriptions of antidepressants or anxiolytics, were compared between propensity score matched cohorts using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, including hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of a new diagnosis or prescription was also stratified by age, sex, and race to better characterize which groups were most affected. In the first three months of the pandemic, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly increased risk of depression or anxiety disorder diagnosis (HR 1.65 [95% CI, 1.30-2.08]). October 2021 to January 2022 (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06-1.18]) and January to April 2022 (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.14]). Similar temporal patterns were observed for antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions, when the control group was patients with bone fracture, when anxiety and depressive disorders were considered separately, when recurrent depressive disorder was tested, and when the test period was extended to 6 months. COVID-19 patients >=65 years old demonstrated greatest absolute risk at the start of the pandemic (6.8%), which remained consistently higher throughout the study period (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.13-1.27]), and overall, women with COVID-19 had greater risk than men (HR 1.35 [95% CI 1.30-1.40]).
