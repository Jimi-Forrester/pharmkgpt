37493827|a|BACKGROUND: Behavioural symptoms and frontotemporal hypometabolism overlap between behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and primary psychiatric disorders (PPD), hampering diagnostic distinction. Voxel-wise comparisons of brain metabolism might identify specific frontotemporal-(hypo)metabolic regions between bvFTD and PPD. We investigated brain metabolism in bvFTD and PPD and its relationship with behavioural symptoms, social cognition, severity of depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Compared to controls, bvFTD showed decreased metabolism in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (p < 0.001), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), temporal pole, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and caudate, whereas PPD showed no hypometabolism. Compared to PPD, bvFTD showed decreased metabolism in the dACC (p < 0.001, p < 0.05FWE), insula, Broca's area, caudate, thalamus, OFC and temporal cortex (p < 0.001), whereas PPD showed decreased metabolism in the motor cortex (p < 0.001). Across bvFTD and PPD, decreased metabolism in the temporal cortex (p < 0.001, p < 0.05FWE), dACC and frontal cortex was associated with worse social cognition. Decreased metabolism in the dlPFC was associated with compulsiveness (p < 0.001). Across bvFTD, PPD and controls, decreased metabolism in the PFC and motor cortex was associated with executive dysfunctioning (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate subtle but distinct metabolic patterns in bvFTD and PPD, most strongly in the dACC. The degree of frontotemporal and cingulate hypometabolism was related to impaired social cognition, compulsiveness and executive dysfunctioning. Our findings suggest that the dACC might be an important region to differentiate between bvFTD and PPD but needs further validation.
