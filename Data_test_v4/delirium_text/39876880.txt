39876880|t|Pancreatic beta cell-secreted factor FGF23 attenuates Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid beta-induced neuronal death.
39876880|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment. The pathophysiology of AD may involve aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, which may underlie the disease mechanism. Patients with diabetes exhibit an elevated risk of developing AD, indicating potential therapeutic implications upon elucidating the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that pancreatic beta cell-secreted factors could protect neurons from Abeta-induced toxicity. Therefore, we established an experimental model to elucidate the communication between pancreatic beta cells and neuronal cells. Notably, our findings demonstrate that pancreatic beta cell culture supernatant effectively inhibits Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. Transcriptomic analysis showed significant up-regulation of multiple ribosomal protein genes in neuronal cells treated with pancreatic beta cell culture supernatant. Fibroblast growth factor 23, a secreted factor from pancreatic beta cells, significantly suppressed Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. Our findings suggest that pancreatic beta cells may secrete previously unrecognized neuroprotective factors, thereby attenuating neuronal cell death in AD.
