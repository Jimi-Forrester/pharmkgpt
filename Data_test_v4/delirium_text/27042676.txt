27042676|t|CSF Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios: better diagnostic markers of Alzheimer disease.
27042676|a|OBJECTIVE: The diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) must be improved before widespread clinical use. This study aimed to determine whether CSF Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios are better diagnostic biomarkers of AD during both predementia and dementia stages in comparison to CSF Abeta42 alone. METHODS: The study comprised three different cohorts (n = 1182) in whom CSF levels of Abeta42, Abeta40, and Abeta38 were assessed. CSF Abetas were quantified using three different immunoassays (Euroimmun, Meso Scale Discovery, Quanterix). As reference standard, we used either amyloid ((18)F-flutemetamol) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (n = 215) or clinical diagnosis (n = 967) of well-characterized patients. RESULTS: When using three different immunoassays in cases with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment, the CSF Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios were significantly better predictors of abnormal amyloid PET than CSF Abeta42. Lower Abeta42, Abeta42/Abeta40, and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios, but not Abeta40 and Abeta38, correlated with smaller hippocampal volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging. However, lower Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42, but not the ratios, correlated with non-AD-specific subcortical changes, that is, larger lateral ventricles and white matter lesions. Further, the Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios showed increased accuracy compared to Abeta42 when distinguishing AD from dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson's disease dementia and subcortical vascular dementia, where all Abetas (including Abeta42) were decreased. INTERPRETATION: The CSF Abeta42/Abeta40 and Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios are significantly better than CSF Abeta42 to detect brain amyloid deposition in prodromal AD and to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD dementias. The ratios reflect AD-type pathology better, whereas decline in CSF Abeta42 is also associated with non-AD subcortical pathologies. These findings strongly suggest that the ratios rather than CSF Abeta42 should be used in the clinical work-up of AD.
