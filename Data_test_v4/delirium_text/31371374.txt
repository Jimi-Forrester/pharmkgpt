31371374|t|Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit: Is Dexmedetomidine Effective?
31371374|a|Delirium in the intensive care unit affects approximately 30% of patients despite vigorous efforts to encourage the use of effective screening tools and preventive strategies. The success of pharmacological treatment of delirium remains equivocal; moreover, a paucity of research supports the use of atypical antipsychotic medications. However, dexmedetomidine appears to have a promising role in delirium management. This review includes an overview of the pathophysiology and types of delirium and describes 2 established tools used to screen for delirium. Published research related to the use of dexmedetomidine in the management of delirium is also discussed. The authors make recommendations for critical care nurses on dexmedetomidine use in the context of providing evidence-based nursing care to intensive care unit patients with delirium.
