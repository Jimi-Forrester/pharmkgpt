39417289|a|This study investigated the association between cognitive function and facial emotion recognition (FER) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). We enrolled 126 participants from Taiwan, including 63 patients with idiopathic PD and 63 matched healthy controls. The PD group was divided into two groups: those with normal cognitive function (PD-NC) and those with MCI (PD-MCI). Participants underwent a modality emotion recognition test and comprehensive cognitive assessment. Our findings reveal that patients with PD-MCI exhibit significantly impaired FER, especially in recognizing "disgust," compared with patients with PD-NC and healthy adults (p = .001). This deficit correlates with executive function, attention, memory, and visuospatial abilities. Attention mediates the relationship between executive function and "disgust" FER. The findings highlight how patients with PD-MCI are specifically challenged when recognizing "disgust" and suggest that cognitive training focusing on cognitive flexibility and attention may improve their FER abilities. This study contributes to our understanding of the nuanced relationship between cognitive dysfunction and FER in patients with PD-MCI, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.
