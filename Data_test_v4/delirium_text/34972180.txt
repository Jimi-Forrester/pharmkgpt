34972180|t|Mild anemia and 11- to 15-year mortality risk in young-old and old-old: Results from two population-based cohort studies.
34972180|a|BACKGROUND: Mild anemia is a frequent although often overlooked finding in old age. Nevertheless, in recent years anemia has been linked to several adverse outcomes in the elderly population. Objective of the study was to investigate the association of mild anemia (hemoglobin concentrations: 10.0-11.9/12.9 g/dL in women/men) with all-cause mortality over 11-15 years and the effect of change in anemia status on mortality in young-old (65-84 years) and old-old (80+ years). METHODS: The Health and Anemia and Monzino 80-plus are two door-to-door, prospective population-based studies that included residents aged 65-plus years in Biella municipality and 80-plus years in Varese province, Italy. No exclusion criteria were used. RESULTS: Among 4,494 young-old and 1,842 old-old, mortality risk over 15/11 years was significantly higher in individuals with mild anemia compared with those without (young-old: fully-adjusted HR: 1.35, 95%CI, 1.15-1.58; old-old: fully-adjusted HR: 1.28, 95%CI, 1.14-1.44). Results were similar in the disease-free subpopulation (age, sex, education, smoking history, and alcohol consumption adjusted HR: 1.54, 95%CI, 1.02-2.34). Both age groups showed a dose-response relationship between anemia severity and mortality (P for trend <0.0001). Mortality risk was significantly associated with chronic disease and chronic kidney disease mild anemia in both age groups, and with vitamin B12/folate deficiency and unexplained mild anemia in young-old. In participants with two hemoglobin determinations, seven-year mortality risk was significantly higher in incident and persistent anemic cases compared to constant non-anemic individuals in both age groups. In participants without anemia at baseline also hemoglobin decline was significantly associated with an increased mortality risk over seven years in both young-old and old-old. Limited to the Monzino 80-plus study, the association remained significant also when the risk was further adjusted also for time-varying covariates and time-varying anemia status over time. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from these two large prospective population-based studies consistently suggest an independent, long-term impact of mild anemia on survival at older ages.
