37902143|t|Sleep Deficiency by Caregiving Status: Findings From Nationally Representative Data.
37902143|a|OBJECTIVE: Caregiving demands may influence caregivers' sleep duration and quality, which are essential for optimal health. We aimed to examine the association between caregiving status and sleep deficiency (i.e., short sleep duration and/or poor quality) and identify factors associated with sleep deficiency among caregivers. METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from 3870 adults living in the United States, obtained from the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey. Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between caregiving status (i.e., caregivers vs. non-caregivers) and sleep status (i.e., normal duration-good quality [optimal sleep, reference], short duration-good quality, normal duration-poor quality, and short duration-poor quality), and to identify caregiving-related factors associated with sleep deficiency in the caregiver group. RESULTS: Compared to non-caregivers, caregivers were more likely to report short sleep duration (<7 hours) with good quality sleep (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.566, 95% CI [1.238, 1.980]) or poor quality sleep (RRR = 1.376, 95% CI [1.034, 1.832]) than the optimal sleep status. Caregivers providing care for >=20 hours per week (vs. <20 hours) and providing care to individuals with dementia (vs. no dementia caregiving) were 2.8 times more likely to report normal sleep duration with poor sleep quality than optimal sleep (RRR = 2.796, 95% CI [1.125, 6.950]; RRR = 2.776, 95% CI [1.154, 6.675], respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of a higher risk of sleep deficiency among caregivers suggest that health care providers need to assess both caregivers' sleep duration and quality status. Interventions tailored to the caregiving context are also warranted.
