38175857|t|Role of Artificial Intelligence in Multinomial Decisions and Preventative Nutrition in Alzheimer's Disease.
38175857|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 50 million people worldwide, an increase of 35 million since 2015, and it is known for memory loss and cognitive decline. Considering the morbidity associated with AD, it is important to explore lifestyle elements influencing the chances of developing AD, with special emphasis on nutritional aspects. This review will first discuss how dietary factors have an impact in AD development and the possible role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in preventative care of AD patients through nutrition. The Mediterranean-DASH diets provide individuals with many nutrient benefits which assists the prevention of neurodegeneration by having neuroprotective roles. Lack of micronutrients, protein-energy, and polyunsaturated fatty acids increase the chance of cognitive decline, loss of memory, and synaptic dysfunction among others. ML software has the ability to design models of algorithms from data introduced to present practical solutions that are accessible and easy to use. It can give predictions for a precise medicine approach to evaluate individuals as a whole. There is no doubt the future of nutritional science lies on customizing diets for individuals to reduce dementia risk factors, maintain overall health and brain function.
