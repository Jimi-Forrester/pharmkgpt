2932761|t|Beta-endorphin, cortisol and postoperative delirium: a preliminary report.
2932761|a|A transient delirium, including hallucinations and disorientation, occurred at some time during a 48 to 72 hr postoperative period in patients recovering from elective surgery in an intensive care unit. The occurrence of delirium in these patients was associated with a significant and unusually prolonged postoperative increase in circulating levels of beta-endorphin (B-endorphin) and cortisol, and a total disruption of normal plasma circadian rhythms of B-endorphin and cortisol. Postoperative mean 24-hr plasma levels of B-endorphin and cortisol were not significantly different from preoperative baseline levels in those patients who did not exhibit post-surgical delirium. Circadian rhythms of B-endorphin and cortisol in the non-delirious patients also remained normal following surgery, although peak plasma concentrations were significantly phase-shifted to later in the day. A disruption in circadian rhythms of the endogenous opiate/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may represent an important component of post-operative psychological changes that are frequently observed in the intensive care unit setting.
