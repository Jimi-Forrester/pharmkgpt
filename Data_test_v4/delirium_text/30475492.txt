30475492|t|THE BURDEN ON DEMENTIA CAREGIVERS: How Can Communities and Health Care Organizations Help?
30475492|a|Family members are integral to the care, safety and overall well-being of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Being a caregiver is often associated with significant isolation as well as emotional, psychosocial and financial burden. In recognition of the toughness of this job and the increasing prevalence of dementia, there has been growing momentum among public policy makers and within communities and the health care system to address the challenges caregivers face. This article describes efforts in Minnesota communities to do so. The authors make recommendations for communities and health care systems.
