8165467|t|Psychosocial aspects of surgical care in the elderly patient.
8165467|a|Delirium, dementia, and depression often complicate the care of elderly surgical patients. Simple screening procedures performed preoperatively and postoperatively facilitate the early detection of these conditions and enable the physician to promptly institute appropriate treatment. Although the evaluation and management of these disorders are often within the range of the surgical treatment team, psychiatric consultation should be obtained when uncertainty exists about diagnosis or therapy.
