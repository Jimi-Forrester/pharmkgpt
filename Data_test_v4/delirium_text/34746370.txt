34746370|a|Abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to the worldwide pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has caused a significant increase in the number of cases and mortalities since its first diagnosis in December 2019. Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, neurological involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system has been also reported. Herein, the higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases in COVID-19 patients in future is also imaginable. Neurological complications of COVID-19 infection are more commonly seen in severely ill individuals; but, earlier diagnosis and treatment can lead to better long-lasting results. In this respect, stem cell biotechnologies with considerable self-renewal and differentiation capacities have experienced great progress in the field of neurological disorders whether in finding out their underlying processes or proving them promising therapeutic approaches. Herein, many neurological disorders have been found to benefit from stem cell medicine strategies. Accordingly, in the present review, the authors are trying to discuss stem cell-based biotechnologies as promising therapeutic options for neurological disorders secondary to COVID-19 infection through reviewing neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and current stem cell-based biotechnologies for neurological disorders. Lay Summary: Due to the substantial burden of neurological disorders in the health, economic, and social system of society, the emergence of neurological manifestations following COVID-19 (as a life-threatening pandemic) creates the need to use efficient and modern methods of treatment. Since stem cell-based methods have been efficient for a large number of neurological diseases, it seems that the use of mentioned methods is also effective in the process of improving neurological disorders caused by COVID-19. Hereupon, the current review aims to address stem cell-based approaches as treatments showing promise to neurological disorders related to COVID-19.
