16883555|a|Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial alterations contribute to the neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2) mutations have been shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis by mechanisms suggested to involve impaired mitochondrial function. We have previously detected active gamma-secretase complexes in mitochondria. We investigated the impact of PS/gamma-secretase on mitochondrial function using mouse embryonal fibroblasts derived from wild-type, PS1-/-, PS2-/- and PS double knock-out (PSKO) embryos. Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) showed a higher percentage of fully functional mitochondria in PS1-/- and PSwt as compared to PS2-/- and PSKO cells. This result was evident both in whole cell preparations and in isolated mitochondria. Interestingly, pre-treatment of isolated mitochondria with the gamma-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 resulted in a decreased population of mitochondria with high DeltaPsim in PSwt and PS1-/- cells, indicating that PS2/gamma-secretase activity can modify DeltaPsim. PS2-/- cells showed a significantly lower basal respiratory rate as compared to other cell lines. However, all cell lines demonstrated competent bioenergetic function. These data point toward a specific role of PS2/gamma-secretase activity for proper mitochondrial function and indicate interplay between PS1 and PS2 in mitochondrial functionality.
