10402486|a|The blood redox status of probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and control subjects with distinct Apo E genotypes was investigated. It was assessed by measuring the levels of hydroperoxides (MDA) in plasma and erythrocytes, the levels of the antioxidant defense system (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) in plasma, erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes, the activities of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in erythrocytes and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) in platelets and also the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in leukocytes. No significant differences were found between the Apo E genotype and MDA, uric acid, vitamin E and reduced-glutathione (GSH) levels in plasma; MDA, vitamin E, GSH, superoxide-dismutase (SOD), glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px) and COMT levels in erythrocytes; vitamin E levels in the platelets of AD patients and control subjects. However, the uric acid levels in plasma and the COMT levels in erythrocytes of AD patients and control subjects with the epsilon4 allele were significantly lower than those observed in control subjects without the epsilon4 allele. Moreover, the duraquinol oxidation level in leukocytes of AD patients with the epsilon4 allele was significantly higher than that in AD patients without the epsilon4 allele and control subjects with and without the epsilon4 allele. The meaning of these results is discussed in terms of involvement of oxidative stress in the etiopathogenesis of AD.
