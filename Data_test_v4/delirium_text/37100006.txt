37100006|t|Your suffering is my stressor: Proinflammatory gene expression rises with spousal distress in middle-aged and older couples.
37100006|a|Marital quality shares ties to inflammation-related conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Lab-based studies implicate hostility during marital conflict as a mechanism via inflammatory reactivity, but little attention has been paid to the inflammatory aftermath of other marital exchanges. A spouse's emotional distress is an important but overlooked context for middle-aged and older couples, as conflict declines and networks shrink. To examine the links of spousal distress to changes in proinflammatory gene expression, 38 adults ages 40-81 witnessed their spouse relive an upsetting personal memory aloud, rated their mood before and after, and provided blood samples at baseline and twice post-task; they also shared their own upsetting memory and discussed a marital problem in the interim. Those whose spouse disclosed their upsetting memory with greater emotional intensity showed larger elevations in proinflammatory gene expression 30-40 min and 80-90 min after the task. The association replicated for listeners whose negative mood increased more in response to spousal disclosure. Findings were robust to behavior in the other emotional tasks, race, gender, age, alcohol, smoking, comorbidities, and sagittal abdominal diameter. These novel results identify spousal distress as a key marital context that may escalate inflammation-related health risks.
