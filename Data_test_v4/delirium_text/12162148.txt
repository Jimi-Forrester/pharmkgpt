12162148|a|OBJECTIVES: Significant changes in mortality patterns are part of the changing population demographics. This paper explores their implications for health evaluation and screening programs. METHODS: A review of selected age-adjusted mortality rates from the National Vital Statistics Reports of the USA was undertaken and their change over the last five decades analyzed. RESULTS: The review shows a continued decline in mortality rates from leading causes of death, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, pneumonia and influenza, and a sharp rise in the death rates from Alzheimer's disease. Available means for detection of Alzeimer's disease are summarized. CONCLUSION: Given the emerging possibilities for the treatment and prevention of the progression of Alzheimer's disease, tests for early detection of Alzheimer's should be included in health screening examinations.
