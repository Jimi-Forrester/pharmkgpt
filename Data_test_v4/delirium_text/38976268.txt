38976268|a|Importance: Understanding the heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) and associated brain abnormalities is essential for effective management and treatment of dementia. Objective: To identify dementia subtypes with distinct functional connectivity associated with neuropsychiatric subsyndromes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies-3 (OASIS-3; recruitment began in 2005) and Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; recruitment began in 2004) databases, this cross-sectional study analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, clinical assessments, and neuropsychological measures of participants aged 42 to 95 years. The fMRI data were processed from July 2022 to February 2024, with secondary analysis conducted from August 2022 to March 2024. Participants without medical conditions or medical contraindications for MRI were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures: A multivariate sparse canonical correlation analysis was conducted to identify functional connectivity-informed NPS subsyndromes, including behavioral and anxiety subsyndromes. Subsequently, a clustering analysis was performed on obtained latent connectivity profiles to reveal neurophysiological subtypes, and differences in abnormal connectivity and phenotypic profiles between subtypes were examined. Results: Among 1098 participants in OASIS-3, 177 individuals who had fMRI and at least 1 NPS at baseline were included (78 female [44.1%]; median [IQR] age, 72 [67-78] years) as a discovery dataset. There were 2 neuropsychiatric subsyndromes identified: behavioral (r = 0.22; P = .002; P for permutation = .007) and anxiety (r = 0.19; P = .01; P for permutation = .006) subsyndromes from connectivity NPS-associated latent features. The behavioral subsyndrome was characterized by connections predominantly involving the default mode (within-network contribution by summed correlation coefficients = 54) and somatomotor (within-network contribution = 58) networks and NPSs involving nighttime behavior disturbance (R = -0.29; P < .001), agitation (R = -0.28; P = .001), and apathy (R = -0.23; P = .007). The anxiety subsyndrome mainly consisted of connections involving the visual network (within-network contribution = 53) and anxiety-related NPSs (R = 0.36; P < .001). By clustering individuals along these 2 subsyndrome-associated connectivity latent features, 3 subtypes were found (subtype 1: 45 participants; subtype 2: 43 participants; subtype 3: 66 participants). Patients with dementia of subtype 3 exhibited similar brain connectivity and cognitive behavior patterns to those of healthy individuals. However, patients with dementia of subtypes 1 and 2 had different dysfunctional connectivity profiles involving the frontoparietal control network (FPC) and somatomotor network (the difference by summed z values was 230 within the SMN and 173 between the SMN and FPC for subtype 1 and 473 between the SMN and visual network for subtype 2) compared with those of healthy individuals. These dysfunctional connectivity patterns were associated with differences in baseline dementia severity (eg, the median [IQR] of the total score of NPSs was 2 [2-7] for subtype 3 vs 6 [3-8] for subtype 1; P = .04 and 5.5 [3-11] for subtype 2; P = .03) and longitudinal progression of cognitive impairment and behavioral dysfunction (eg, the overall interaction association between time and subtypes to orientation was F = 4.88; P = .008; using the time x subtype 3 interaction item as the reference level: beta = 0.05; t = 2.6 for time x subtype 2; P = .01). These findings were further validated using a replication dataset of 193 participants (127 female [65.8%]; median [IQR] age, 74 [69-77] years) consisting of 154 newly released participants from OASIS-3 and 39 participants from ADNI. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings may provide a novel framework to disentangle the neuropsychiatric and brain functional heterogeneity of dementia, offering a promising avenue to improve clinical management and facilitate the timely development of targeted interventions for patients with dementia.
