37629211|a|Over 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, and more than half of them are affected by HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Such disorders are characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and central nervous system deterioration, which lead to short- or long-term memory loss, cognitive impairment, and motor skill deficits that may show gender disparities. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous study suggested that HIV-1 infection and viral protein R (Vpr) upregulate the SUR1-TRPM4 channel associated with neuroinflammation, which may contribute to HAND. The present study aimed to explore this relationship in a mouse model of HAND. This study employed the HIV transgenic Tg26 mouse model, comparing Tg26 mice with wildtype mice in various cognitive behavioral and memory tests, including locomotor activity tests, recognition memory tests, and spatial learning and memory tests. The study found that Tg26 mice exhibited impaired cognitive skills and reduced learning abilities compared to wildtype mice, particularly in spatial memory. Interestingly, male Tg26 mice displayed significant differences in spatial memory losses (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were identified in female mice. Consistent with our early results, SUR1-TRPM4 channels were upregulated in Tg26 mice along with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4), consistent with reactive astrocytosis and neuroinflammation. Corresponding reductions in neurosynaptic responses, as indicated by downregulation of Synapsin-1 (SYN1) and Synaptophysin (SYP), suggested synaptopathy as a possible mechanism underlying cognitive and motor skill deficits. In conclusion, our study suggests a possible relationship between SUR1-TRPM4-mediated neuroinflammation and synaptopathy with impairments of learning and memory in mice with HAND. These findings could help to develop new therapeutic strategies for individuals living with HAND.
