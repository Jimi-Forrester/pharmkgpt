36901999|t|Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Contributes to Cell Senescence and ER Stress in Aging Mice Colon.
36901999|a|Aging, which is characterized by enhanced cell senescence and functional decline of tissues, is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases. Accumulating evidence shows that age-related dysfunction in the colon leads to disorders in multiple organs and systemic inflammation. However, the detailed pathological mechanisms and endogenous regulators underlying colon aging are still largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression and activity of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme are increased in the colon of aged mice. Importantly, genetic knockout of sEH attenuated the age-related upregulation of senescent markers p21, p16, Tp53, and beta-galactosidase in the colon. Moreover, sEH deficiency alleviated aging-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the colon by reducing both the upstream regulators Perk and Ire1 as well as the downstream pro-apoptotic effectors Chop and Gadd34. Furthermore, treatment with sEH-derived linoleic acid metabolites, dihydroxy-octadecenoic acids (DiHOMEs), decreased cell viability and increased ER stress in human colon CCD-18Co cells in vitro. Together, these results support that the sEH is a key regulator of the aging colon, which highlights its potential application as a therapeutic target for reducing or treating age-related diseases in the colon.
