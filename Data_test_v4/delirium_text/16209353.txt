16209353|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE - EC. 3.1.1.7) plays an essential role in acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission. Unfortunately, an AChE-peptide exhibits pathophysiological activity via an apoptotic pathway that could play an important role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. It was found that a peptide derived from AChE may induce neuronal death and acetylcholinesterase may induce neurological changes in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It was also stated that complex of AChE with beta-amyloid is much more toxic than amyloid and causes stronger neurological changes. AChE promotes the generation of amyloid by accelerating the expression of peptide precursor (beta-APP) in glial cells. The essential role is also played by AChE in induction of hematological disease. It is well known that phospho-organic compounds cause inhibition of AChE precursors what is related to decrease of hemoglobin concentration, number of erythrocytes and hematocrit level. The article is an attempt to explain the role of acetylcholinesterase in neuronal apoptosis, Alzheimer's disease and Myasthenia gravis as well as in leukemia.
