21683258|t|Using Caenorhabditis elegans to study serpinopathies.
21683258|a|Protein misfolding, polymerization, and/or aggregation are hallmarks of serpinopathies and many other human genetic disorders including Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease. While higher organism models have helped shape our understanding of these diseases, simpler model systems, like Caenorhabditis elegans, offer great versatility for elucidating complex genetic mechanisms underlying these diseases. Moreover, recent advances in automated high-throughput methodologies have promoted C. elegans as a useful tool for drug discovery. In this chapter, we describe how one could model serpinopathies in C. elegans and how one could exploit this model to identify small molecule compounds that can be developed into effective therapeutic drugs.
