38947067|a|Background: Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most prevalent muscle disease in adults for which no current treatment exists. The pathogenesis of IBM remains poorly defined. Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are the most common histopathological findings. In this study, we aimed to explore the interplay between inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in IBM patients, highlighting sex differences. Methods: We included 38 IBM patients and 22 age- and sex-matched controls without myopathy. Bulk RNA sequencing, Meso Scale Discovery ELISA, western blotting, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were performed on frozen muscle samples from the study participants. Results: We demonstrated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in IBM muscle samples, with the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway being the most upregulated. On muscle histopathology, there is increased NRLP3 immunoreactivity in both inflammatory cells and muscle fibers. Mitophagy is critical for removing damaged mitochondria and preventing the formation of a vicious cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction-NLRP3 activation. In the IBM muscle samples, we showed altered mitophagy, most significantly in males, with elevated levels of p-S65-Ubiquitin, a mitophagy marker. Furthermore, p-S65-Ubiquitin aggregates accumulated in muscle fibers that were mostly type 2 and devoid of cytochrome-c-oxidase reactivity. Type 2 muscle fibers are known to be more prone to mitochondrial dysfunction. NLRP3 RNA levels correlated with p-S65-Ubiquitin levels in both sexes but with loss of in muscle strength only in males. Finally, we identified sex-specific molecular pathways in IBM, with females having activation of pathways that could offset some of the pathomechanisms of IBM. Conclusions: NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in IBM, along with altered mitophagy particularly in males, which is of potential therapeutic significance. These findings suggest sex-specific mechanisms in IBM that warrant further investigation.
