39230866|t|Curculigoside Regulates Apoptosis and Oxidative Stress Against Spinal Cord Injury by Modulating the Nrf-2/NQO-1 Signaling Pathway In Vitro and In Vivo.
39230866|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe neurological disorder that can lead to paralysis or death. Oxidative stress during SCI is a critical phase causing extensive nerve cell damage and apoptosis, thereby impairing spinal cord healing. Thus, a primary goal of SCI drug therapy is to mitigate oxidative stress. Curculigoside (CUR), a phenolic glucoside extracted from the dried root and rhizome of Curculigo orchioides Gaertn, possesses neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate whether CUR effectively promotes the recovery of spinal cord tissue following SCI and elucidate its mechanism. We employed a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced PC12 cell model and an SCI rat model to observe the effects of CUR on oxidation and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that CUR significantly reduced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax and Caspase-3), Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), while increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Moreover, CUR effectively enhanced levels of antioxidants (glutathione [GSH)] and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. Furthermore, CUR facilitated functional recovery through its anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative stress effects on spinal cord tissues in SCI rats. These effects were mediated via the Nrf2/NQO1 signaling pathway. Therefore, our study showed that CUR acted as an anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative stress agent, inhibiting astrocyte activation and promoting neuronal reconstruction and functional recovery. These findings may contribute significantly to the development of SCI treatments and advance the field of SCI drug therapy.
