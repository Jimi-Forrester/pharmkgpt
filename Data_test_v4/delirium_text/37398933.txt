37398933|t|Cold-Induced Reprogramming of Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue Assessed by Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing.
37398933|a|Adipose browning has demonstrated therapeutic potentials in several diseases. Here, by conducting transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell and single-nucleus resolution, we reconstituted the cellular atlas in mouse inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT) at thermoneutrality or chronic cold condition. All major nonimmune cells within the iWAT, including adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs), mature adipocytes, endothelial cells, Schwann cells, and smooth muscle cells, were recovered, allowing us to uncover an overall and detailed blueprint for transcriptomes and intercellular cross-talks and the dynamics during white adipose tissue brown remodeling. Our findings also unravel the existence of subpopulations in mature adipocytes, ASPCs, and endothelial cells, as well as new insights on their interconversion and reprogramming in response to cold. The adipocyte subpopulation competent of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) antigen presentation is potentiated. Furthermore, a subcluster of ASPC with CD74 expression was identified as the precursor of this MHCII+ adipocyte. Beige adipocytes are transdifferented from preexisting lipid generating adipocytes, which exhibit developmental trajectory from de novo differentiation of amphiregulin cells (Aregs). Two distinct immune-like endothelial subpopulations are present in iWAT and are responsive to cold. Our data reveal fundamental changes during cold-evoked adipose browning.
