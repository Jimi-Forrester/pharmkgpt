30924524|a|With an increasingly aging global population, the incidence of neurological diseases such as dementia is set to increase to unmanageable levels, yet there are currently only symptomatic therapies available for treatment. The mechanisms underlying the development of some forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not yet completely elucidated with several competing hypotheses existing. During the closure of the critical period in the brain, significant compositional changes occur to the neural extracellular matrix (ECM). Specifically, condensed mesh-like structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs) form around subsets of neurons and have a profound effect on axonal growth and limit neuronal plasticity. These PNNs act as a morphological checkpoint and can influence memory and cognition. Manipulating these important ECM structures may provide the key to reactivating plasticity and restoring memory, both of which are severely impaired in AD and other associated neurological diseases. This review explores the current understanding of how PNNs are manipulated and examines potential new methods for PNN modulation.
