32000045|a|This study aims to investigate whether magnolol (MG), a natural neolignane compound, can prevent AD induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) and the possible mechanisms involved. MG dose-dependently reduces Abeta deposition, toxicity and memory impairment caused by Abeta in transgenic C. elegans. More importantly, these effects are reversed by GW9662, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) antagonist. MG is more effective in enhancing PPAR-gamma luciferase levels than honokiol (HK). Meanwhile, MG has the potential to bind with the ligand binding domain of PPAR-gamma (PPAR-gamma-LBD). As expected, MG inhibited the luciferase activity of NF-kappaB and its target genes of inflammatory cytokines, and this effect was blocked by GW9662. The luciferase activity of Nrf2-ARE expression can be activated by MG and decreased Abeta-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). The target gene LXR of PPAR-gamma is activated by MG, which upregulates ApoE and promotes microglia phagocytosis and the degradation of Abeta, and these effects were also reversed by GW9662. In summary, MG can attenuate Abeta-induced AD and the underlying mechanism is the reduction of inflammation and promotion of phagocytosis and degradation of Abeta, which is dependent on PPAR-gamma.
