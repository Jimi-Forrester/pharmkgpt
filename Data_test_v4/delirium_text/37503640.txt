37503640|t|Clinical and Laboratory Predictors of Mortality in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study from India.
37503640|a|OBJECTIVE: Wide arrays of laboratory parameters have been proposed by many studies for prognosis in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we wanted to determine if the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium score in addition to certain clinical and laboratory parameters would help in predicting mortality. We wanted to determine if a greater severity score on chest x-ray at presentation translated to poor patient outcomes using the COVID-19 chest radiography score. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at SDS TRC and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of chest diseases, Bangalore from March 2021 to June 2021. This study included 202 real-time-polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 patients aged above 18 years admitted to the intensive care unit of our hospital. Demographic characteristics and baseline hematological and inflammatory markers (serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin-I, ferritin, and d-dimer) were collected. Radiological severity on a chest x-ray was assessed using the validated COVID-19 chest radiography score. The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium score was assigned to each patient within 24 hours of intensive care unit admission. Outcome studied was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The overall mortality was 54.9% (111 cases). Age more than 50 years, >4 days of symptoms, peripheral oxygen saturation/ fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 200, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase >398.5 IU/L, and hypoalbuminemia (<2.95 g/dL) were detected as independent predictors of mortality. A significant correlation of risk stratification with mortality (P = .057) was seen with International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium score. There was no significant correlation between the COVID-19 chest radiography score and mortality. CONCLUSION: Age >50 years, peripheral oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <200, mean symptom duration of >4 days, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and hypoalbuminemia are independent predictors of mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium score was different in the survivors and deceased.
