37627844|t|The Impact of Rocuronium and Sugammadex on Length of Stay in Patients Undergoing Open Spine Surgery: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.
37627844|a|Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), an all-encompassing perioperative care approach, has been demonstrated to enhance surgical results, mitigate postoperative issues, and decrease the length of hospital stay (LOS) in diverse surgical specialties. In this retrospective study, our objective was to examine the influence of muscle relaxant selection on LOS and perioperative results in adult patients undergoing open spine surgery. Specifically, we compared 201 patients who received cisatracurium and neostigmine with 201 patients who received rocuronium and sugammadex, after 1:1 propensity score matching. The utilization of the rocuronium and sugammadex combination in anesthesia for open spinal surgery did not lead to a reduction in the LOS but was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative chest radiographic abnormalities, including infiltration, consolidation, atelectasis, or pneumonia (p = 0.027). In our secondary analysis, multivariate analysis revealed multiple determinants influencing the prolonged LOS (>7 days) during open spine surgery. Bispectral index-guided anesthesia emerged as a protective factor, while variables such as excessive intraoperative blood loss and fluid administration as well as postoperative chest radiographic abnormalities independently contributed to prolonged LOS.
