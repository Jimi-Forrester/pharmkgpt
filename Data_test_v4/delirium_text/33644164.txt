33644164|t|Metabolic syndrome, ApoE genotype, and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly population: A single-center, case-control study.
33644164|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is related to poor cognitive function. However, the results of previous studies were inconsistent, and whether the ApoEepsilon4 allele modifies the association remains unclear. AIM: To elucidate the relationships among MetS, ApoEepsilon4, and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly population in China. METHODS: One hundred elderly patients with MetS and 102 age- and gender-matched controls were included in the study. Baseline clinical characteristics and biochemical index for glucose and lipid metabolism were obtained. The distribution of ApoEepsilon4 was assessed with PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Cognitive function was evaluated by mini-mental status examination at the 1-year follow-up examination. RESULTS: Compared with controls, MetS patients had worse cognitive function and decreased ability to participate in activities of daily life (P = 0.001 and 0.046, respectively). Patients with cognitive dysfunction had higher prevalence of MetS (62.1% vs 36.4%, P < 0.001) and were more likely to carry the ApoEepsilon4 allele (22.3% vs 10.1%, P = 0.019). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that diagnosis with MetS, severe insulin resistance, status as an ApoEepsilon4 carrier, higher systolic blood pressure, and larger waist circumference were risk factors for cognitive dysfunction (P < 0.05). Repeated-measures analysis of variance, performed with data collected at the 1-year follow-up, revealed continuous influences of MetS and ApoEepsilon4 on the deterioration of cognitive function (time x team, P < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of MetS and ApoEepsilon4 carrier status were persistently associated with cognitive dysfunction among an elderly population in China.
