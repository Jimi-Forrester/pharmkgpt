7315481|a|During the 12-month period, 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1978, 690 people received 4,194 electroconvulsive treatments at the Psychiatric Hospital, Enugu. The diagnostic classifications of patients receiving this form of treatment included severe psychotic depression (and masked depression), catatonic schizophrenia (with marked withdrawal, mutism, or excitement); mania which has become unresponsive to major tranquilizers, some selected cases of acute delirium and the collective group "puerperal psychosis". Bilateral ECT was generally used and the frequency of treatment was two ECT's per week. The method of anaesthesia used is described and mention is made of the few and mild complications which were encountered. ECT was found to have reduced the total duration of stay in hospital (for in-patients). Considering the acute shortage of specialized manpower in the field of psychiatry in Nigeria, a suggestion is made for the establishment of community based psychiatric centres where, among other forms of therapy, ECT could be given in appropriate cases, on out-patient basis. The wider use of this form of treatment in deserving cases in psychiatric hospitals is also recommended.
