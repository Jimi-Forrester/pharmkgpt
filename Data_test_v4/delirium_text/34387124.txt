34387124|t|Postnatal Right Ventricular Developmental Track Changed by Volume Overload.
34387124|a|Background Current right ventricular (RV) volume overload (VO) is established in adult mice. There are no neonatal mouse VO models and how VO affects postnatal RV development is largely unknown. Methods and Results Neonatal VO was induced by the fistula between abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava on postnatal day 7 and confirmed by abdominal ultrasound, echocardiography, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The RNA-sequencing results showed that the top 5 most enriched gene ontology terms in normal RV development were energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cellular respiration, striated muscle tissue development, and muscle organ development. Under the influence of VO, the top 5 most enriched gene ontology terms were angiogenesis, regulation of cytoskeleton organization, regulation of vasculature development, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, and regulation of the actin filament-based process. The top 3 enriched signaling pathways for the normal RV development were PPAR signaling pathway, citrate cycle (Tricarboxylic acid cycle), and fatty acid degradation. VO changed the signaling pathways to focal adhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and pathways in cancer. The RNA sequencing results were confirmed by the examination of the markers of metabolic and cardiac muscle maturation and the markers of cell cycle and angiogenesis. Conclusions A neonatal mouse VO model was successfully established, and the main processes of postnatal RV development were metabolic and cardiac muscle maturation, and VO changed that to angiogenesis and cell cycle regulation.
