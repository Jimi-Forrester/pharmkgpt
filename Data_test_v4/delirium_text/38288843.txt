38288843|a|Neurodegenerative diseases represent a formidable global health challenge, affecting millions and imposing substantial burdens on healthcare systems worldwide. Conditions, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, among others, share common characteristics, such as neuronal loss, misfolded protein aggregation, and nervous system dysfunction. One of the major obstacles in treating these diseases is the presence of the blood-brain barrier, limiting the delivery of therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Nanotechnology offers promising solutions to overcome these challenges. In Alzheimer's disease, NPs loaded with various compounds have shown remarkable promise in preventing amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and reducing neurotoxicity. Parkinson's disease benefits from improved dopamine delivery and neuroprotection. Huntington's disease poses its own set of challenges, but nanotechnology continues to offer innovative solutions. The promising developments in nanoparticle-based interventions for neurodegenerative diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS), have offered new avenues for effective treatment. Nanotechnology represents a promising frontier in biomedical research, offering tailored solutions to the complex challenges posed by neurodegenerative diseases. While much progress has been made, ongoing research is essential to optimize nanomaterial designs, improve targeting, and ensure biocompatibility and safety. Nanomaterials possess unique properties that make them excellent candidates for targeted drug delivery and neuroprotection. They can effectively bypass the blood-brain barrier, opening doors to precise drug delivery strategies. This review explores the extensive research on nanoparticles (NPs) and nanocomposites in diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative disorders. These nanomaterials exhibit exceptional abilities to target neurodegenerative processes and halt disease progression.
