21623645|a|Biomarker research is a rapidly advancing field in medicine. Recent advances in genomic, genetic, epigenetic, neuroscientific, proteomic, and metabolomic knowledge and technologies have opened the way to thriving research. In the most general sense, a biomarker refers to any useful characteristic that can be measured and used as an indicator of a normal biologic process, a pathogenic process, or a pharmacologic response to a therapeutic agent. Despite the extensive resources concentrated on this area, there are very few biomarkers currently available that qualify and are satisfactorily validated for mental disorders, and there is still a major lack of biomarkers for typifying neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This article provides an overview of this field of research and focuses on recent advances in biomarker research in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
