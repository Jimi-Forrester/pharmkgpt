34983027|t|Staged Hybrid Treatment with Branched Endovascular Aneurysm Repair of a Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm in the Presence of a Total Infrarenal Aortoiliac Occlusion.
34983027|a|Aortoiliac occlusive disease may limit the use of branched endovascular aneurysm repair (BEVAR) of thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAAs). Thus, infrarenal aortoiliac occlusion may preclude the use of BEVAR. We present a case involving a 67-year-old patient with a fast-progressing TAAA (diameter: 70 mm) and a concomitant total aortoiliac occlusion. A multi-staged treatment concept included the creation of the access and the distal landing zone for the consecutive endovascular procedures through an aorto-right femoral-left popliteal bypass. At six-week intervals, thoracic endovascular aortic repair for the creation of the proximal landing zone and a 4-vessel BEVAR were accomplished. At 36 months, a type III endoleak occurred due to the fracture of the bridging stent-graft to the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery. It was successfully treated with VBX stent-grafts. This case illustrates the importance of a staged hybrid approach in the management of complex aortic pathologies with poor access and insufficient distal landing zone.
