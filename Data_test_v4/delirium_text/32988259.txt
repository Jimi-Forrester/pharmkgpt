32988259|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported a significant increase in age-related magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in relatively younger people living with HIV (PLWH). However, there is little data available for brain changes in Asian PLWH. The data to differentiate HIV specific brain change from usual aging change was also sparse. To clarify them, we assessed the presence of leukoaraiosis and brain atrophic changes on MRI in young and middle-aged Japanese PLWH. METHODS: We reviewed data from well-controlled PLWH (age: 20-64 years) and coeval controls. We evaluated the presence of leukoaraiosis, as well as the extent of whole-brain grey matter (GM) atrophy and parahippocampal atrophy on brain MRI and determined between-group differences. Moreover, we evaluated the severity of parahippocampal atrophy based on the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: We enrolled 40 PLWH and 33 controls (median age: 40.15 and 48.00 years, respectively, [p = .3585]). Leukoaraiosis was significantly more prevalent among the PLWH (20 cases [50%]) than in the controls (9 cases [27.3%]) (univariate: p = .0483, multivariate: p = .0206). The extent of whole-brain GM atrophy was significantly greater in the PLWH than in the controls (univariate: p < .001, multivariate: p = .0012). Contrastingly, there was no significant between-group difference in the extent and severity of parahippocampal atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Aging changes in the brain were significantly more prevalent in well-controlled Japanese PLWH. However, the process of atrophic brain changes might differ between HIV and one of age-related diseases, Alzheimer's disease.
