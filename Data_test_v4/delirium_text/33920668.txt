33920668|a|The current study aims to investigate the influence of socio-demographic factors on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test results in a Greek-speaking population consisting of a sample of healthy older adults, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia patients in rural areas. In addition, the current research focuses on determining optimal cut-off scores for the clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia. The data originated from 283 participants in an ongoing registry of the Neurology Department of Alexandroupolis University Hospital, recruited in different rural districts of north-eastern Greece, across a broad range of educational and occupational categories. Total and sub-domain scores for the MoCA varied significantly, according to sex, age, and education, among the three study groups. The optimal cut-off points of 25/26 for the MoCA total score was determined to classify healthy subjects from individuals with MCI, 24 to discriminate healthy participants from demented, and 21/22 to discriminate subjects with MCI from dementia. Overall, the clinical use of the MoCA test can be supported by demographically adjusted standard scores in a Greek-speaking rural population. These findings serve to improve the diagnostic accuracy and utility of the MoCA test.
