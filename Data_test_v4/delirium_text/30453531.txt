30453531|a|The Hippo pathway restricts organ size during development and its inactivation plays a crucial role in cancer. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog transcriptional coactivator with PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (TAZ) are transcription co-activators and effectors of the Hippo pathway mediating aberrant enlargement of organs and tumor growth upon Hippo pathway inactivation. It has been demonstrated that genetic inactivation of YAP could be an effective approach to inhibit tumorigenesis. In order to identify pharmacological inhibitors of YAP, we screened a library of 52,683 compounds using a YAP-specific reporter assay. In this screen we identified cyclopeptide RA-V (deoxybouvardin) as a specific inhibitor of YAP and TAZ but not other reporters. Unexpectedly, later experiments demonstrated that RA-V represses the protein but not mRNA levels of YAP target genes. Nevertheless, RA-V strongly blocks liver enlargement induced by Mst1/2 knockout. Furthermore, RA-V not only inhibits liver tumorigenesis induced by YAP activation, but also induces regression of established tumors. We found that RA-V inhibits dedifferentiation and proliferation, while inducing apoptosis of hepatocytes. Furthermore, RA-V also induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of macrophages in the microenvironment, which are essential for YAP-induced tumorigenesis. RA-V is thus a drug candidate for cancers involving YAP/TAZ activation.
