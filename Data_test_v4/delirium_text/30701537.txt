30701537|t|Dexmedetomidine for the management of delirium in critically ill patients-A protocol for a systematic review.
30701537|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients and carries an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Dexmedetomidine can potentially treat delirium by diminishing predisposing factors. The evidence regarding the use of dexmedetomidine in the management of delirium is conflicting. This protocol aims to identify the beneficial and harmful effects of dexmedetomidine in the management of delirium. METHODS: This protocol uses the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration, the Preferred Report Items of Systematic reviews with Meta-Analysis Protocols, and the eight-step assessment procedure suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues. We wish to assess in critically ill patients with delirium, if dexmedetomidine vs placebo is effective in managing delirium and improving clinical outcomes. We will include all relevant randomised clinical trials assessing the use of dexmedetomidine in treating delirium. To identify trials, we will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Science Citation Index Expanded on Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science Journal Database, and BIOSIS. Two authors will screen the literature and extract data. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to evaluate included trials. Extracted data will be analysed using Review Manager 5 and Trial Sequential Analysis. We will create a 'Summary of Findings'-table in which we will present our primary and secondary outcomes. We will assess the quality of evidence using GRADE assessment. DISCUSSION: This systematic review can potentially aid clinicians in decision making and benefit the many critically ill patients developing delirium.
