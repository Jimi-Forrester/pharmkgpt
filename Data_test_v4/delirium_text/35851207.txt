35851207|a|INTRODUCTION: The gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major causative agent of periodontitis in adults. It is also associated with disorders of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems, rheumatoid arthritis, pancreatic cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in the oral cavity or introduced as probiotic preparations can support successful treatment of periodontitis due to their antagonism with the pathogen. AIM: The aim of this study was in vitro assessment of the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus thermophilus against P. gingivalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial effect of lactobacilli or S. thermophilus from the LBB Culture collection against P. gingivalis DSM 20709 was evaluated with the well diffusion assay on Wilkins Chalgren blood agar. Inhibition of the pathogen was evaluated by measuring the diameter of clear zones around the wells. RESULTS: Application of milk fermented with selected LAB resulted in a bacteriostatic effect. The most active culture was S. thermophilus 187/4, followed by L. delbr. ssp. bulgaricus (LBB.B1054, C3/2 and LBB.B120), L. helveticus LBB.H48/1 and L. rhamnosus I-1/13. The respective reconstituted freeze-dried preparations had a stronger inhibitory effect on the pathogen with the formation of clear bactericidal zones. The effect of milk acidified with lactic acid was apparent with minimal bactericidal zone observed at concentration of 0.1%. The effectiveness of the assay was confirmed with Elgydium and Eludril. CONCLUSIONS: P. gingivalis DSM 20709 was sensitive to the metabolites produced in fermented milk by selected strains of L. delbr. ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, and S. thermophilus. Reconstituted freeze dried fermented milk had a stronger inhibitory effect compared to fresh samples. Lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria was the key component for inhibition of the pathogen.
