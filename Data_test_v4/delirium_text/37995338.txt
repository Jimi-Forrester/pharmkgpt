37995338|a|Background: COVID-19 is associated with multiple complications, in addition to those produced at the pulmonary level. Post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits have been detected in the cognitive domain of attention and executive functions, even 4 months after COVID-19. Objective: to determine the frequency of cognitive alterations in patients recovered from COVID-19. Material and methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study was carried out. Records of patients in care after infection by SARS-CoV-2 were integrated, the Neuropsi test was applied. Descriptive statistics and association tests were used through the Chi square test, taking p < 0.05 as significant. Results: Data from 44 files were integrated. The median age, I place them in the sixth decade of life. There was a predominance of men (63.6%). The most frequent comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension (50%) and diabetes mellitus (40.9%). Most of the patients were managed only at home (61.4%) with a moderate-severe COVID-19 picture (68.2%). The most affected dimensions of the Neuropsi test were attention and concentration (47.7%, mild alteration) and short-term memory (77.3%, mild alteration). Conclusions: Cognitive impairment in patients recovered from COVID-19 assessed through the Neuropsi test presented mild alterations in attention and concentration, as well as in short-term memory. These could affect functionality, quality of life and ability to perform work.
