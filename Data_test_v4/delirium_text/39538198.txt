Generalized slowing in the electroencephalogram (EEG) supports the diagnosis of delirium. We examined the potential of single-channel EEG (DeltaScan ) as an easy-to-use device on intensive care units for detecting delirium. Our aim was to investigate characteristics of bihemispheric EEG recordings and single-channel EEG in patients suffering from strokes with and without delirium and to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of EEG-based diagnoses. METHODS: Within the first five days after stroke onset, patients received single-channel EEG DeltaScan  and a routine 21-channel EEG. The DeltaScan  analyzes right sided fronto-parietal EEG using a proprietary algorithm focusing on polymorphic delta activity (PDA). In routine EEG the power spectral density (PSD) in predefined frequency bands was analyzed based on 2-minute eyes-closed resting state segments. EEG-analyses were conducted in MNE (v1.3.1) in Python (3.10) and RStudio (v4.2.1). RESULTS: In 9 of 53 patients (52-90 years) delirium was diagnosed according to DSM-V criteria. Sensitivity of DeltaScan  was 44% (95% CI = 15.3-77.3%), while specificity was 71% (95% CI = 57-83%). We found patients with right hemispheric stroke having a higher probability to be false positive in DeltaScan  (p = 0.01). The 21-channel EEG based power analysis revealed significant differences in frontal delta and theta power between patients with and without delirium (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: When EEG is used in clinical practice to support a delirium diagnosis in stroke patients, bihemispheric recordings are likely preferable over unilateral recordings. Slowing in the delta- or theta-frequency spectrum over the site of stroke may lead to false-positive results in single channel EEG based delirium scoring.
