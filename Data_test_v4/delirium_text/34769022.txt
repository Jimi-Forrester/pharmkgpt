34769022|a|Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins as the 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). There are 25 selenoproteins encoded in the human genome, and their synthesis requires a dedicated machinery. Most selenoproteins are oxidoreductases with important functions in human health. A number of disorders have been associated with deficiency of selenoproteins, caused by mutations in selenoprotein genes or Sec machinery genes. We discuss mutations that are known to cause disease in humans and report their allele frequencies in the general population. The occurrence of protein-truncating variants in the same genes is also presented. We provide an overview of pathogenic variants in selenoproteins genes from a population genomics perspective.
