34231709|a|Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) usually starts with pulmonary signs and symptoms. However, in some cases, the initial clinical presentations are extrapulmonary. This literature review aimed at summarizing and discussing the extrapulmonary onset manifestations of COVID-19. The most frequent initial extrapulmonary manifestations include hypogeusia, hyposmia, non-specific abdominal symptoms, corneal congestion, and deep venous thrombosis. Several rarer extrapulmonary manifestations in locations such as the brain, peripheral nerves, muscles, eyes, ears, myocardium, intestines, skin, or vessels have been additionally reported as onset presentations of COVID-19. In conclusion, it is crucial for clinicians and health care providers to consider extrapulmonary presentations at the onset of COVID-19 to avoid overlooking the infection and contributing to the spread of the disease.
