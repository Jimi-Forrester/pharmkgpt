38776886|t|Dementia among Minority Populations: A Scoping Review of Meaning, Language, and Translation.
38776886|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia as a neurocognitive disorder is becoming increasingly common worldwide, and minority groups are more vulnerable than the general population. Many factors may contribute to their vulnerability such as misconceptions, language barriers, cultural factors, invalid assessment tools, lack of knowledge, or assigning spiritual beliefs to dementia symptoms. Therefore, this scoping literature review aimed to clarify how empirical studies reflect the meaning of dementia, language, and translation among minority ethnic groups. SUMMARY: The PRISMA extension for the scoping review protocol was used. Thirty-eight studies published in English were reviewed and analysed. The findings revealed that lack of knowledge about dementia and attributing the disease to the normal ageing process were frequent among minority groups. Furthermore, their cultural-specific perspectives and worldviews of wellness and well-being can impact the way dementia is perceived, consequent help-seeking behaviours, or caregiving. Facilitating educational programs to enhance the knowledge and experiences of ethnic communities might be beneficial. Moreover, language is shown to be an important aspect in dementia assessment and participants' educational level could significantly impact their functional capacity when responding to cognitive measures. Even though there are some useful screening tests, diagnosis barriers might be eased by assessment tool development, modifications, and accurate translations for ethnic communities. KEY MESSAGES: A promising pathway to support ethnically diverse communities regarding dementia can be raising awareness, providing ethnic-specific services, developing cultural-specific tools to assess dementia or any cognitive impairment by considering perceptions, language, and culture among ethnic groups. Cultural and spiritual considerations could also encourage engagement during assessment.
