35408965|t|Mechanistic Insights into Selective Autophagy Subtypes in Alzheimer's Disease.
35408965|a|Eukaryotic cells possess a plethora of regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis and ensure proper biochemical functionality. Autophagy, a central, conserved self-consuming process of the cell, ensures the timely degradation of damaged cellular components. Several studies have demonstrated the important roles of autophagy activation in mitigating neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, surprisingly, activation of macroautophagy has not shown clinical efficacy. Hence, alternative strategies are urgently needed for AD therapy. In recent years, selective autophagy has been reported to be involved in AD pathology, and different subtypes have been identified, such as aggrephagy, mitophagy, reticulophagy, lipophagy, pexophagy, nucleophagy, lysophagy and ribophagy. By clarifying the underlying mechanisms governing these various subtypes, we may come to understand how to control autophagy to treat AD. In this review, we summarize the latest findings concerning the role of selective autophagy in the pathogenesis of AD. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that selective autophagy is an active mechanism in AD pathology, and that regulating selective autophagy would be an effective strategy for controlling this pathogenesis.
