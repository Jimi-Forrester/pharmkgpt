28550254|a|BACKGROUND: Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) mutations are the most common cause of familial early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The PSEN1 E280A (E280A) mutation has an autosomal dominant inheritance and is involved in the production of amyloid-beta. The largest family group of carriers with E280A mutation is found in Antioquia, Colombia. The study of mutation carriers provides a unique opportunity to identify brain changes in stages previous to AD. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a low cost and minimally invasiveness technique that enables the following of brain changes in AD. OBJECTIVE: To examine how previous reported differences in EEG for Theta and Alpha-2 rhythms in E280A subjects are related to specific regions in cortex and could be tracked across different ages. METHODS: EEG signals were acquired during resting state from non-carriers and carriers, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects from E280A kindred from Antioquia, Colombia. Independent component analysis (ICA) and inverse solution methods were used to locate brain regions related to differences in Theta and Alpha-2 bands. RESULTS: ICA identified two components, mainly related to the Precuneus, where the differences in Theta and Alpha-2 exist simultaneously at asymptomatic and symptomatic stages. When the ratio between Theta and Alpha-2 is used, significant correlations exist with age and a composite cognitive scale. CONCLUSION: Theta and Alpha-2 rhythms are altered in E280A subjects. The alterations are possible to track at Precuneus regions using EEG, ICA, and inverse solution methods.
