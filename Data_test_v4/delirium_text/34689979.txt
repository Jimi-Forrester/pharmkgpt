34689979|a|INTRODUCTION: Among the themes to be addressed by a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on geriatric oncology, one of the priorities was delirium, due to its frequency, complications and difficulties encountered by healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing delirium. Our study aims to evaluate professional practices in the area of education, regarding the evaluation of the content of a MOOC module about delirium syndrome in geriatric oncology. METHODS: We created a multidisciplinary group to define the scientific content, the pedagogical objectives, the scriptwriting and the development of a training module. The quality of instructional design was then evaluated according to eleven MOOC design principles to promote learning. Participants were studied. RESULTS: Seven of the eleven criteria for evaluating pedagogical quality were documented. Among the 1020 participants, 455 (44.6%) completed the final test concerning delirium: 417 (40.8%) passed the final test; 406 documented their profession and the region of France where they worked: 146 (32%) nurses (confirming the participation of the targeted audience), 103 (22.6%) doctors/pharmacists (illustrating the multi-professional interest of the thematic), with a wide distribution of the participants over the national territory. DISCUSSION: The multidisciplinary team's investment in developing these teaching materials strengthened the group's cohesion and valuated its professional skills. All teaching resources developed for access via the internet must be accompanied by an evaluation of the quality of the scientific content, objectives and teaching methods, before being able to appreciate its use in the field and assess its real impact on the participants' learning and practice.
