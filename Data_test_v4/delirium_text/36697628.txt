36697628|t|Chemoenzymatic synthesis of 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine by L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase/L-threonine aldolase.
36697628|a|Pyrazines are typically formed from amino acids and sugars in chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction. In this study, we demonstrate that 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine can be produced from L-Thr by a simple bacterial operon. We conclude that EDMP is synthesized chemoenzymatically from L-Thr via the condensation reaction of two molecules of aminoacetone and one molecule of acetaldehyde. Aminoacetone is supplied by L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase using L-Thr as a substrate via 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate. Acetaldehyde is supplied by 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase bearing threonine aldolase activity from L-Thr when CoA was at low concentrations. Considering the rate of EDMP production, the reaction intermediate is stable for a certain time, and moderate reaction temperature is important for the synthesis of EDMP. When the precursor was supplied from L-Thr by these enzymes, the yield of EDMP was increased up to 20.2%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this reaction is useful for synthesizing various alkylpyrazines.
