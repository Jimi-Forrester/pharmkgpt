35207214|a|People living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRDs) are at a higher risk of suicidal behaviors given intersecting risk factors. Previous studies generally only focused on AD, small clinical samples, or grouped all dementia subtypes together, limiting insights for other ADRD subtypes. The objective of this study was to generate evidence related to the relative burden of suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) among people with AD and ADRDs. This retrospective cross-sectional study identified hospitalizations related to suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias using ICD-10-CM codes from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). A logistic regression model was estimated to assess associations between AD/ADRD subtype and patient characteristics, and the risk for a suicidal-behavior-related hospitalization and modes of harm were reported. During 2016-2018, there were 12,538 hospitalizations related to suicidal behaviors for people with AD/ADRDs. The overall prevalence of suicidal-behavior-related hospitalizations was lowest for AD (0.8%) and highest for frontotemporal dementia (2.6%). Among hospitalizations for suicide attempts, the most common mode of harm was medications or drugs (89.2% of all attempts), followed by weapons (17.7%). We found that there was a difference in the frequency of suicidal-behavior-related hospitalizations among AD/ADRD hospitalized patients across dementia subtypes.
