32358751|a|Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are widely used for controlling pests worldwide. The inhibitory effects of these pesticides on acetylcholinesterase lead to neurotoxic damages. The oxidative stress is responsible for several neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, seizure, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. Strong evidence suggests that dysfunction of mitochondria and oxidative stress are involved in neurological diseases. OPs can disturb the function of mitochondria by inducing oxidative stress. In the present study, we tried to highlight the role of dysfunction of mitochondria and the induction of oxidative stress in the neurotoxicity induced by OPs. Additionally, the amelioration of OP-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunctional through the chemical and natural antioxidants have been discussed.
