29980748|a|Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are being trialled for cell transplantation therapies for neural repair as they have unique properties which can enhance neuron regeneration. However, improvements in cell viability, proliferation and migration are needed to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Growth factors can enhance cell activity, but they can also induce side effects as they can act on numerous cell types. An alternative approach is to identify natural products (NPs) that more selectively activate specific cell functions. We have examined two pure NPs, 3-acetoxy-7,8-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (RAD288) and 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (RAD289) isolated from the Australian plant Eremophila microtheca. We determined that RAD288 and RAD289 stimulated the viability and proliferation of OECs in two-dimensional cultures and increased cell viability in three-dimensional spheroids. Both compounds also enhanced OEC-mediated phagocytosis of neural debris. However, only RAD288 stimulated migration of OECs, demonstrating that key structural changes to the compound can dramatically affect the resultant cellular action. In addition, cell-type specific action is highlighted by the result that neither compound stimulated the viability of Schwann cells which are a closely-related glial cell type. Therefore, these small molecules may have high potential for selective activation of specific therapeutically-useful activities of OECs for transplantation therapies to repair the nervous system.
