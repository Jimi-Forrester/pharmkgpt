36514585|t|Rare Double Aneuploidy (Down-Klinefelter Syndrome): A Case Report.
36514585|a|Double aneuploidies, such as Down syndrome and sex chromosome aneuploidies, are relatively rare. One rare form of double aneuploidy, Down-Klinefelter syndrome, is described here. The phenotypic characteristics of a three-year-old child showed the presence of features typical of Down syndrome. He had a global developmental delay, small testes, and diabetes mellitus by 18 months of age. Regardless of the presenting clinical features, karyotyping should be performed in all patients with suspected Down syndrome. In Down-Klinefelter syndrome, anticipatory phenotype goes beyond the sum of individual syndromic characteristics.
