35538665|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are small peptides, classified as amyloids, that have the potential to self-assemble and form cytotoxic species, such as small soluble oligomers and large insoluble fibrils. The formation of Abeta aggregates facilitates the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while IAPP aggregates induce pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis, leading to exacerbation of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cross-amyloid interactions between Abeta and IAPP have been described both in vivo and in vitro, implying the role of Abeta or IAPP as modulators of cytotoxic self-aggregation of each species, and suggesting that Abeta-IAPP interactions are a potential molecular link between AD and T2D. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, "hotspot" regions of the two peptides were studied to understand the formation of hexamers in a heterogeneous and homogeneous peptide-containing environment. Systems of only Abeta(16-22) peptides formed antiparallel, beta-barrel-like structures, while systems of only IAPP(20-29) peptides formed stacked, parallel beta-sheets and had relatively unstable aggregation structures after 2 mus of simulation time. Systems containing both Abeta and IAPP (1:1 ratio) hexamers showed antiparallel, beta-barrel-like structures, with an interdigitated arrangement of Abeta(16-22) and IAPP(20-29). These beta-barrel structures have features of cytotoxic amyloid species identified in previous literature. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide atomistic insight into both the mechanism behind cross-amyloid interactions and structural morphologies of these toxic amyloid species.
