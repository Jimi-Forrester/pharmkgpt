34356186|t|Ageing and Olfactory Dysfunction in Trisomy 21: A Systematic Review.
34356186|a|PURPOSE: The olfactory system is particularly vulnerable in an ageing brain, both anatomically and functionally, and these brain changes are more pronounced among individuals with trisomy 21. Furthermore, the age of the system starts to deteriorate, and the mechanism involved is unclear in an individual with trisomy 21. Therefore, the present review aims to summarise the available information related to this topic and to suggest questions still unanswered which can be a subject of further research. METHODS: A systematic literature search of trisomy 21 and olfactory dysfunction was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus electronic database following PRISMA guidelines. References and citations were checked in the Google Scholar database. Reports were extracted for information on demographics and psychophysical evaluation. Then, the reports were systematically reviewed based on the effects of ageing on the three olfactory domains: threshold, discrimination, and identification. RESULTS: Participants with trisomy 21 show an early onset of olfactory impairment, and the age effect of the olfactory deficit is fully expressed at age > 30 years old. The three olfactory domains, threshold, discrimination, and identification, are suggested to be impaired in trisomy 21 participants with age > 30 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction in an individual with trisomy 21 commences at a relatively young age and affects the three olfactory domains. A challenge for the future is to quantitatively establish the olfactory function of an individual with trisomy 21 at all ages with more detailed measurements to further understand the pathophysiology of this brain deterioration.
