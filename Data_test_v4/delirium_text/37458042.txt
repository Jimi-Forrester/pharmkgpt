37458042|t|Understanding the Association Between Sensory Impairment and Dementia: Toward Informing Future Research and Health Policy.
37458042|a|Recent epidemiological research has linked decline in multiple sensory functions with an increased risk of dementia. However, the pathways linking such factors with neurodegenerative disorders remain unclear. Studies that assess this are crucial for guiding the distribution of public health resources and the development of clinical trials aiming to delay or prevent dementia. This commentary examines the contribution of a study by Dintica and colleagues to the field of sensory-cognitive research.
