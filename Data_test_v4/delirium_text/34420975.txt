34420975|t|Heterogeneity and Factorial Structure in Alzheimer's Disease: A Cognitive Perspective.
34420975|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show heterogeneous cognitive profiles which suggest the existence of cognitive subgroups. A deeper comprehension of this heterogeneity could contribute to move toward a precision medicine perspective. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed 1) to investigate AD cognitive heterogeneity as a product of the combination of within- (factors) and between-patients (sub-phenotypes) components, and 2) to promote its assessment in clinical practice by defining a small set of critical tests for this purpose. METHODS: We performed factor mixture analysis (FMA) on neurocognitive assessment results of N = 230 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD. This technique allowed to investigate the structure of cognitive heterogeneity in this sample and to characterize the core features of cognitive sub-phenotypes. Subsequently, we performed a tests selection based on logistic regression to highlight the best tests to detect AD patients in our sample. Finally, the accuracy of the same tests in the discrimination of sub-phenotypes was evaluated. RESULTS: FMA revealed a structure characterized by five latent factors and four groups, which were identifiable by means of a few cognitive tests and were mainly characterized by memory deficits with visuospatial difficulties ("Visuospatial AD"), typical AD cognitive pattern ("Typical AD"), less impaired memory ("Mild AD"), and language/praxis deficits with relatively spared memory ("Nonamnestic AD"). CONCLUSION: The structure of cognitive heterogeneity in our sample of AD patients, as studied by FMA, could be summarized by four sub-phenotypes with distinct cognitive characteristics easily identifiable in clinical practice. Clinical implications under the precision medicine framework are discussed.
