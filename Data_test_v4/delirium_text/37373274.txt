37373274|a|In recent years, three emerging cell deaths, ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, have gradually attracted everyone's attention, and they also play an important role in the occurrence and development of various diseases. Ferroptosis is an idiographic iron-dependent form regulated cell death with the hallmark of accumulation of the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Necroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death mediated by the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1(RIPK1) and receptor-interacting protein kinase 3RIPK3. Pyroptosis, also known as cell inflammatory necrosis, is a programmed cell necrosis mediated by Gasdermin D (GSDMD). It is manifested by the continuous swelling of the cells until the cell membrane ruptures, resulting in the release of the cell contents and the activation of a strong inflammatory response. Neurological disorders remain a clinical challenge and patients do not respond well to conventional treatments. Nerve cell death can aggravate the occurrence and development of neurological diseases. This article reviews the specific mechanisms of these three types of cell death and their relationship with neurological diseases and the evidence for the role of the three types of cell death in neurological diseases; understanding these pathways and their mechanisms is helpful for the treatment of neurological diseases.
