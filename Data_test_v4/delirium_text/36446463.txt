36446463|t|Thirst in adult patients in the intensive care unit: protocol for a scoping review.
36446463|a|INTRODUCTION: Thirst is one of the most bothersome symptoms experienced by intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Effective diagnosis and management of thirst in the ICU is essential, particularly as patients are less sedated than previously and more aware of this problem. Currently, no overview of publications on thirst identification and management in ICU patients exists. The scoping review will address the broad question 'What is known about thirst as a symptom in adult critically ill patients?' It aims to provide an overview of the causes and risk factors, diagnosis and measurement, the symptom dimensions and its interaction with other symptoms, and thirst management. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology framework to guide the process and will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Methods include: defining the review questions, eligibility criteria, concepts of interest and context; and outlining the search strategy, study selection process, data extraction and analysis. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL will be searched from inception to April 2022. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required, as the scoping review will synthesise information from available publications. The scoping review will be submitted for publication to a scientific journal, presented at relevant conferences and disseminated as part of future workshops with ICU support groups and the critical care professional community.
