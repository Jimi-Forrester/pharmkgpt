27227450|t|Alzheimer's Amyloid-beta Sequesters Caspase-3 in Vitro via Its C-Terminal Tail.
27227450|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta), the main constituent in senile plaques found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), is considered as a causative factor in AD pathogenesis. The clinical examination of the brains of patients with AD has demonstrated that caspase-3 colocalizes with senile plaques. Cellular studies have shown that Abeta can induce neuronal apoptosis via caspase-3 activation. Here, we performed biochemical and in silico studies to investigate possible direct effect of Abeta on caspase-3 to understand the molecular mechanism of the interaction between Abeta and caspase-3. We found that Abeta conformers can specifically and directly sequester caspase-3 activity in which freshly prepared Abeta42 is the most potent. The inhibition is noncompetitive, and the C-terminal region of Abeta plays an important role in sequestration. The binding of Abeta to caspase-3 was examined by cross-linking and proteolysis and by docking and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations. Experimental and in silico results revealed that Abeta42 exhibits a higher binding affinity than Abeta40 and the hydrophobic C-terminal region plays a key role in the caspase-Abeta interaction. Overall, our study describes a novel mechanism demonstrating that Abeta sequesters caspase-3 activity via direct interaction and facilitates future therapeutic development in AD.
