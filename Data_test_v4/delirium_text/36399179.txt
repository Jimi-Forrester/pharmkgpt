36399179|a|Some patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) would develop delirium, which is associated with poor prognosis. The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify factors associated with ICU delirium in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We included 753 AMI and divided those into the ICU-delirium group (n = 110) and the non-ICU-delirium group (n = 643) according to the presence of ICU delirium. The ICU delirium was evaluated by confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups, and factors associated with ICU delirium were sought by multivariate analysis. The prevalence of female sex was significantly higher in the ICU-delirium group (43.6%) than in the non-ICU-delirium group (20.2%) (p < 0.001). The incidence of in-hospital death was significantly higher in the ICU-delirium group (17.3%) than in the non-ICU-delirium group (0.5%) (p < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age [every 10 years increase: odds ratio (OR) 1.439, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.127-1.837, p = 0.004], female sex (OR 2.237, 95%CI 1.300-3.849, p = 0.004), triple vessel disease (OR 2.317, 95%CI 1.365-3.932, p = 0.002), body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR 2.910, 95%CI 1.410-6.008, p = 0.004), use of mechanical support (OR 2.812, 95%CI 1.500-5.270, p = 0.001), respiratory failure (OR 5.342, 95%CI 3.080-9.265, p < 0.001), and use of continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 5.901, 95%CI 2.520-13.819, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with ICU delirium. In conclusion, ICU delirium was associated with in-hospital death. Older age, female sex, triple vessel disease, leanness, use of mechanical support, respiratory failure, and continuous renal replacement therapy were significantly associated with the occurrence of ICU delirium.
