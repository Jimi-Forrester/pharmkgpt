33126360|t|Medical management of septic arthritis of sternoclavicular joint: A case report.
33126360|a|RATIONALE: Sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis is an unusual disease in healthy adults, and Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative pathogen. The current treatment of choice is surgery with sternoclavicular joint resection and pectoralis flap closure, especially when the disease is complicated by osteomyelitis and abscess. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report a 76-year-old woman without risk factors who visited our hospital for pain and redness, swelling on the left anterior chest wall. DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging showed infectious arthritis in the left SCJ, with multiple abscess pockets at the subcutaneous layer of anterior chest wall communicating with the joint cavity. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from blood culture. INTERVENTION: She was treated with 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. OUTCOMES: After antibiotic treatment, she was successfully treated without recurrence. LESSONS: Besides surgery, medical treatment should also be considered for sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis, depending on patient status and the causative pathogen. Physicians should be aware of this rare disease to facilitate its prompt diagnosis and management.
