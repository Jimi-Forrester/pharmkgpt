39078159|t|Associations Between Glucose Metabolism Measures and Amyloid-beta and Tau Load on PET 14 Years Later: Findings From the Framingham Heart Study.
39078159|a|OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes and glucose metabolism have previously been linked to Alzheimer disease (AD). Yet, findings on the relation of glucose metabolism with amyloid-beta and tau pathology later in life remain unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 288 participants (mean age = 43.1 years, SD = 10.7, range 20-70 years) without dementia, from the Framingham Heart Study, who had available measures of glucose metabolism (i.e., one-time fasting plasma glucose and insulin) and positron emission tomography (PET) measures of amyloid-beta and/or tau 14 years later. We performed linear regression analyses to test associations of plasma glucose (continuously and categorically; elevated defined as >100 mg/dL), plasma insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with amyloid-beta or tau load on PET. When significant, we explored whether age, sex, and APOE epsilon4 allele carriership (AD genetic risk) modified these associations. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that elevated plasma glucose was associated with greater tau load 14 years later (B [95% CI] = 0.03 [0.01-0.05], P = 0.024 after false discovery rate [FDR] correction) but not amyloid-beta. APOE epsilon4 carriership modified this association (B [95% CI] = -0.08 [-0.12 to -0.03], P = 0.001), indicating that the association was only present in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers (n = 225). Plasma insulin and HOMA-IR were not associated with amyloid-beta or tau load 14 years later after FDR correction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that glucose metabolism is associated with increased future tau but not amyloid-beta load. This provides relevant knowledge for prevention strategies and prognostics to improve health care.
