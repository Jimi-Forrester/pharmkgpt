32173426|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis (OP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common geriatric concurrent diseases, and many studies indicate the connection of their pathogenesis. Cistanche tubulosa (Schenk) Wight (CT) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine and has been extensively applied to treat OP and AD, respectively. However, the active ingredients for both concurrent diseases simultaneously and underlying mechanisms are limited. AIM OF STUDY: This work aimed at establishing an effective and reliable network screening method to find dual-effects compounds in CT that can protect AD and OP concurrently. And it will provide new perspectives of the link between OP and AD on molecular mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The dual-effects of CT were systematically analyzed with integrating multiple databases and extensive analysis at a network pharmacology level. Classified drug-target interaction network was constructed to reveal differences in effects between different types of compounds. To prove the effectiveness of this network, some compounds were selected to verify in Pre-induced OP model and AlCl3-induced AD model of zebrafish according to the topological parameters. RESULTS: 22 dual-effects active ingredients in CT were initially screened out via network pharmacology with a closely connection with 81 OP and AD-related targets. Classified network analysis found the better bioactivities of phenylethanoid glycosides and flavonoids. The dual-effects of four selected compounds demonstrated that the network is reasonable and effective, suggesting the dual-effects of the remaining 18 compounds. Moreover, we identified 9 putative targets and two pathways that were significantly related to OP and AD. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified 22 dual-effects active components in CT. This systematic screening strategy provided a new protocol to objectively discover multi-effects compounds of traditional Chinese medicine, and even a macroscopic perspective that will improve our understanding of the link between OP and AD on molecular mechanisms.
