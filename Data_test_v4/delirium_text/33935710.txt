33935710|a|Disturbance of the gut microbiota plays an essential role in mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Xiaoyaosan, a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has a wide therapeutic spectrum and is used especially in the management of depression and anxiety. In this study, we used an antibiotic-induced microbiome-depleted (AIMD) mouse model to determine the possible relationship between imbalance of the intestinal flora and behavioral abnormalities in rodents. We explored the regulatory effect of Xiaoyaosan on the intestinal flora and attempted to elucidate the potential mechanism of behavioral improvement. We screened NLRP3, ASC, and CASPASE-1 as target genes based on the changes in gut microbiota and explored the effect of Xiaoyaosan on the colonic NLRP3 pathway. After Xiaoyaosan intervention, AIMD mice showed a change in body weight and an improvement in depressive and anxious behaviors. Moreover, the gut flora diversity was significantly improved. Xiaoyaosan increased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae in AIMD mice and decreased that of Bacteroidaceae, the main lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria, resulting in decreased levels of LPS in feces, blood, and colon tissue. Moreover, serum levels of the inflammatory factor, IL-1beta, and the levels of NLRP3, ASC, and CASPASE-1 mRNA and DNA in the colon were significantly reduced. Therefore, Xiaoyaosan may alleviate anxiety and depression by modulating the gut microbiota, correcting excessive LPS release, and inhibiting the immoderate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the colon.
