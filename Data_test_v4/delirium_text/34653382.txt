34653382|a|OBJECTIVES: Units for perioperative geriatric care are playing a growing role in the care of older patients after hip fracture surgery. Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications after hip fracture, but no study has assessed the impact of therapeutics received during a dedicated orthogeriatric care pathway on its incidence. Our main objective was to assess the association between drugs used in emergency, operating, and recovery departments and postoperative delirium during the acute stay. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All patients >=70 years old admitted for hip fracture to the emergency department and hospitalized in our unit for perioperative geriatric care after hip fracture surgery under general anesthesia between July 2009 and December 2019 in an academic hospital in Paris. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biological data and all medications administered pre-, peri-, and postoperatively were prospectively collected by 3 geriatricians. Postoperative delirium in the unit for perioperative geriatric care was assessed by using the confusion assessment method scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess variables independently associated with postoperative delirium. RESULTS: A total of 490 patients were included [mean (SD) age 87 (6) years]; 215 (44%) had postoperative delirium. The occurrence was not associated with therapeutics administered during the dedicated orthogeriatric care pathway. Probability of postoperative delirium was associated with advanced age [>90 years, odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-3.89], dementia (OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.14--5.82), depression (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14-3.01), and preoperative use of beta-blockers (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.79). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: No emergency or anesthetic drugs were significantly associated with postoperative delirium. Further studies are needed to demonstrate a possible causal link between preoperative use of beta-blockers and postoperative delirium.
