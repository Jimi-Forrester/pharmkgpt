28261626|t|Influence of heparin molecular size on the induction of C- terminal unfolding in beta2-microglobulin.
28261626|a|Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta2- microglobulin (beta2m) in the interstitial matrix. Matrix substances such as heparin have reportedly been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of dialysis-related amyloidosis. In clinical setting of hemodialysis, two types of heparin, i.e., high and low molecular heparin (H.M.H. and L.M.H.) have been routinely used. Still commonly used is H.M.H., followed by L.M.H. preparations with distinct advantages. Here, we studied that the interaction of native and two amyloidogenic beta2m variants: DeltaN6beta2m and D76N beta2m with H.M.H. and L.M.H. We also investigated whether heparin could induce beta2m to have an amyloidogenic conformation. Biolayer interferometry revealed that DeltaN6beta2m had a strong reaction and D76N beta2m had a moderate reaction with H.M.H.. Furthermore,H.M.H. induced the C-terminal unfolding in a native beta2m. By contrast, L.M.H. showed no reaction even with DeltaN6beta2m. This study showed firstly a direct binding of beta2m with H.M.H.. H.M.H. would provoked a C-terminal unfolding of beta2m, which indicated production of an amyloidogenic intermediate, i.e., beta2m92-99. In addition, our findings also suggest that L.M.H. may provide beneficial effects against the development of the DRA.
