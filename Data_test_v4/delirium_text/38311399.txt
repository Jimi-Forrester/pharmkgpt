38311399|t|No-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) clothianidin, a neonicotinoid pesticide, impairs hippocampal memory and motor learning associated with alteration of gene expression in cerebellum.
38311399|a|Neonicotinoid pesticides (NNs) have been associated with numerous neurobehavioral effects in rodents, raising concerns about their impact on cognitive function. Clothianidin (CLO), a type of NN, was orally administered to male mice (10 weeks old, C57BL/6N) at the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 50 mg/kg/day as indicated in the pesticide risk assessment report. Behavioral tests (novel location recognition and rotarod tests) evaluated hippocampal memory and cerebellar motor learning. After each test, plasma monoamines (3-methoxytyramine, histamine, serotonin, tryptamine) were measured by LC-ESI/MS/MS (Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry), and cerebellar mRNA expression was quantified by microarray and qRT-PCR analyses. The NOAEL of CLO was found to impair hippocampal memory, leading to decreased spontaneous locomotor activity and motor function. We reported, for the first time, multiple alterations of gene expression in the cerebellum associated with motor dysfunction.
