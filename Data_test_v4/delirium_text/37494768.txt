37494768|t|Glucocorticoid enhances presenilin1-dependent Abeta production at ER's mitochondrial-associated membrane by downregulating Rer1 in neuronal cells.
37494768|a|Stress-induced release of glucocorticoid is an important amyloidogenic factor that upregulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta secretase 1 (BACE1) levels. Glucocorticoid also contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by increasing ER-mitochondria connectivity, in which amyloid beta (Abeta) processing occurs rigorously because of its lipid raft-rich characteristics. However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoid enhances gamma-secretase activity in the mitochondrial-associated membrane of ER (MAM) and subsequent accumulation of mitochondrial Abeta is unclear. In this study, we determined how glucocorticoid enhances Abeta production in MAM using SH-SY5Y cells and ICR mice. First, we observed that cortisol-induced Abeta accumulation in mitochondria preceded its extracellular apposition by enhancing gamma-secretase activity, which was the result of increased presenilin 1 (PSEN1) localization in MAM. Screening data revealed that cortisol selectively downregulated the ER retrieval protein Rer1, which triggered its maturation and subsequent entry into the endocytic secretory pathway of PSEN1. Accordingly, overexpression of RER1 reversed the deleterious effects of mitochondrial Abeta on mitochondrial respiratory function and neuronal cell viability. Notably, we found that cortisol guided the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to bind directly to the RER1 promoter, thus trans-repressing its expression. Inhibiting GR function reduced Abeta accumulation at mitochondria and improved the outcome of a spatial memory task in mice exposed to corticosterone. Taken together, glucocorticoid enhances PSEN1-mediated Abeta generation at MAM by downregulating Rer1, which is a potential target at early stages of AD pathogenesis.
