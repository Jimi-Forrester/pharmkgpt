33189299|a|BACKGROUND: A novel concept for an organ-preserving treatment of pediatric urogenital and perianal rhabdomyosarcoma includes high dose rate brachytherapy following surgical tumor resection. For the duration of the brachytherapy of 6 days plus 2-day recovery break the patients are not allowed to move and are kept under deep sedation, which can lead to difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation, withdrawal, delirium, and prolonged hospital stay. The aim of this study was to evaluate a protocol which includes a switch from fentanyl to ketamine 3 days prior to extubation to help ensure a rapid extubation and transfer from PICU. METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical tumor resection of rhabdomyosarcoma and subsequent brachytherapy were treated according to a standardized protocol. We evaluated doses of fentanyl, midazolam and clonidine, time of extubation, length of PICU stay and occurrence of withdrawal symptoms and delirium. We compared fentanyl dose at time of extubation, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation and time to discharge from PICU with patients after isolated severe traumatic brain injury. RESULTS: Twentytwo patients (age 39.9 +- 29.8 months) were treated in our PICU to undergo brachytherapy. Extubation was performed 21.6 +- 13.5 h after the last brachytherapy session with an average fentanyl dose of 1.5 +- 0.5 microg/kg/h and patients were discharged from PICU 58.4 +- 30.3 h after extubation, which all is significantly lower compared to the control group (extubation after 88.0 +- 42.2 h, p < 0.001; fentanyl dose at the time of extubation 2.5 +- 0.6 microg/kg/h, p < 0.001; PICU discharge after 130.1 +- 148.4 h, p < 0.009). Withdrawal symptoms were observed in 9 patients and delirium in 13 patients. CONCLUSION: A standardized analgesia and sedation protocol including an opioid break, scoring systems to detect withdrawal symptoms and delirium, and tapering plans contributes to successful early extubation and discharge from PICU after long-term deep sedation.
