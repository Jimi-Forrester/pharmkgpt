33693143|t|Prevalence, Clinical Profile, and In-Hospital Outcomes of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Japan.
33693143|a|Background: The prevalence, patient profile, and outcomes of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in aortic stenosis (AS) remain unknown, especially in East Asia. Methods and Results: One hundred and eighty-one AS patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) were enrolled. Sixty-one patients (33.7%) had SDB, and lower stroke volume index was an independent determinant of SDB. Incidence of in-hospital stroke after TAVI was higher in the SDB group. Conclusions: SDB is associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in Japanese AS patients referred for TAVI. SDB was highly associated with the incidence of stroke as a procedural complication.
