22813998|a|This study aimed to better characterize the sensorimotor mechanisms underlying motor resonance, namely the relationship between motion perception and movement production in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work first gives a kinematic description of AD patients' upper limb movements, then it presents a simple paradigm in which a dot with different velocities is moved in front of the participant who is instructed to point to its final position when it stopped. AD patients' actions, as well as healthy elderly participants, were similarly influenced by the dot velocity, suggesting that motor resonance mechanisms are not prevented by pathology. In contrast, only patients had anticipatory motor response: i.e. they started moving before the end of the stimulus motion, unlike what was requested by the experimenter. While the automatic imitation of the stimulus suggests an intact ability to match the internal motor representations with that of the visual model, the uncontrolled motion initiation would indicate AD patients' deficiency to voluntarily inhibit response production. These findings might open new clinical perspectives suggesting innovative techniques in training programs for people with dementia. In particular, the preservation of the motor resonance mechanisms, not dependent on conscious awareness, constitutes an intact basis upon which clinicians could model both physical and cognitive interventions for healthy elderly and AD patients. Furthermore, the evaluation of the inhibitory functions, less sensitive to the level of education than other methods, might be useful for screening test combined with the traditional AD techniques. However, further investigations to understand if this feature is specific to AD or is present also in other neurodegenerative diseases are needed.
