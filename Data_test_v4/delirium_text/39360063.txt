39360063|a|The human gut is the abode of several complex and diverse microbes. It is a fact that the human brain is interconnected with the spinal cord and sense organs; however, there is also a possibility of a connection between the brain and the gut microbiome. The human gut can be altered in various ways, the principal method being the intake of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics. Can this alteration in the gut microbiome be clinically utilised in the perioperative period? We conducted a literature search related to this topic using databases and search engines (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online {MEDLINE}, Embase, Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar). The search revealed some preclinical and clinical studies in animals and humans that demonstrate the alteration of the gut microbiome with the use of anxiolysis, probiotics/prebiotics and other perioperative factors including opioids, anaesthetics and perioperative stress. The significant effects of this alteration have been seen on preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium/cognitive dysfunction/pain. These effects are described in this narrative review, which opens up newer vistas for high-quality research related to the gut microbiome, gut-brain axis, the related signaling pathways and their clinical application in the perioperative period.
