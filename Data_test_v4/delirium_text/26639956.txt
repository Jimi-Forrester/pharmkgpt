26639956|a|BACKGROUND: APOEe4 genotype and aging have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, subjective memory complaints (SMC) might be a first clinical expression of the effect of AD pathology on cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether APOEe4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory are risk factors for high amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden in cognitively normal elderly. METHODS: 307 cognitively normal participants (72.7 +- 6.8 years, 53% female, 55% SMC) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent amyloid PET and APOE genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of APOEe4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory with Abeta pathology. RESULTS: Odds of high Abeta burden were greater at an older age (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.68-6.14), when SMC were present (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.03-3.48), and for APOEe4 carriers (OR = 7.49; 95% CI = 3.96-14.15), while episodic memory was not associated with odds of high Abeta burden. Stratified analyses showed that odds of SMC for high Abeta burden were increased in specifically APOEe4 carriers (OR = 4.58, 95% CI = 1.83-11.49) and younger participants (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.39-10.01). CONCLUSION: Aging, APOEe4 genotype, and SMC were associated with high Abeta burden. SMC were especially indicative of high Abeta burden in younger participants and in APOEe4 carriers. These findings suggest that selection based on the presence of SMC, APOEe4 genotype and age may help identify healthy elderly participants with high Abeta burden eligible for secondary prevention trials.
