37258171|t|Left Main Bronchus Obstruction in a Patient with Small-cell Lung Cancer Successfully Treated with Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Case Report.
37258171|a|Lung cancer can cause fatal central airway obstruction. Rapid airway clearance is necessary in some cases, but ventilator management may be insufficient to maintain oxygenation levels. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) may be an effective rescue therapy for respiratory failure, but its efficacy in treating tumor-related airway obstruction is unknown. We herein report a case of central airway obstruction and severe acute respiratory failure due to small-cell lung cancer successfully treated with VV-ECMO, bronchoscopic airway intervention, and chemotherapy. VV-ECMO can be an effective option for the treatment of central airway obstruction with acute respiratory failure due to lung cancer.
