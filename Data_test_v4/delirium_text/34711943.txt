34711943|a|Aging is associated with chronic systemic inflammation, which contributes to the development of many age-related diseases, including vascular disease. The world's population is aging, leading to an increasing prevalence of both stroke and vascular dementia. The inflammatory response to ischemic stroke is critical to both stroke pathophysiology and recovery. Age is a predictor of poor outcomes after stroke. The immune response to stroke is altered in aged individuals, which contributes to the disparate outcomes between young and aged patients. In this review, we describe the current knowledge of the effects of aging on the immune system and the cerebral vasculature and how these changes alter the immune response to stroke and vascular dementia in animal and human studies. Potential implications of these age-related immune alterations on chronic inflammation in vascular disease outcome are highlighted.
