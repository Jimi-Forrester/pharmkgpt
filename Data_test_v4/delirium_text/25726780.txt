25726780|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the possibility of using MMSE and CGIS as well as the Clock drawing test for the objectification of treatment efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Authors examined 765 patients with mild and moderate dementia treated with donepezil during 3 months. The efficacy was assessed using the MMSE and CGIS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The methods demonstrated the reproducibility compared to those used in earlier clinical trials and efficacy of donepezile in the treatment of mild and moderate AD, the Clock drawing test can be recommended as an additional technique for assessment of treatment efficacy in relation to opticospatial function.
