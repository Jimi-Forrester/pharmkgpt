29960604|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels are increasingly studied as a potential accessible marker of cognitive impairment and dementia. However, it remains underexplored whether plasma Abeta levels including the novel Abeta peptide 1-38 (Abeta1-38) relate to preclinical markers of neurodegeneration and risk of dementia. We investigated the association of plasma Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 levels with imaging markers of neurodegeneration and risk of dementia in a prospective population-based study. METHODS: We analyzed plasma Abeta levels in 458 individuals from the Rotterdam Study. Brain volumes, including gray matter, white matter, and hippocampus, were computed on the basis of 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia and its subtypes were defined on the basis of internationally accepted criteria. RESULTS: A total of 458 individuals (mean age, 67.8 +- 7.7 yr; 232 [50.7%] women) with baseline MRI scans and incident dementia were included. The mean +- SD values of Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 (in pg/ml) were 19.4 +- 4.3, 186.1 +- 35.9, and 56.3 +- 6.2, respectively, at baseline. Lower plasma Abeta1-42 levels were associated with smaller hippocampal volume (mean difference in hippocampal volume per SD decrease in Abeta1-42 levels, - 0.13; 95% CI, - 0.23 to - 0.04; p = 0.007). After a mean follow-up of 14.8 years (SD, 4.9; range, 4.1-23.5 yr), 79 persons developed dementia, 64 of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower levels of Abeta1-38 and Abeta1-42 were associated with increased risk of dementia, specifically AD (HR for AD per SD decrease in Abeta1-38 levels, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00-2.16; HR for AD per SD decrease in Abeta1-42 levels, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.75) after adjustment for age, sex, education, cardiovascular risk factors, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele carrier status, and other Abeta isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that lower plasma Abeta levels were associated with risk of dementia and incident AD. Moreover, lower plasma Abeta1-42 levels were related to smaller hippocampal volume. These results suggest that plasma Abeta1-38 and Abeta1-42 maybe useful biomarkers for identification of individuals at risk of dementia.
