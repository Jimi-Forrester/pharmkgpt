38329281|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to investigate the incremental value of amyloid positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET) in a tertiary memory clinic setting in China. METHODS: A total of 1073 patients were offered Abeta-PET using 18 F-florbetapir. The neurologists determined a suspected etiology (Alzheimer's disease [AD] or non-AD) with a percentage estimate of their confidence and medication prescription both before and after receiving the Abeta-PET results. RESULTS: After disclosure of the Abeta-PET results, etiological diagnoses changed in 19.3% of patients, and diagnostic confidence increased from 69.3% to 85.6%. Amyloid PET results led to a change of treatment plan in 36.5% of patients. Compared to the late-onset group, the early-onset group had a more frequent change in diagnoses and a higher increase in diagnostic confidence. DISCUSSION: Abeta-PET has significant impacts on the changes of diagnoses and management in Chinese population. Early-onset cases are more likely to benefit from Abeta-PET than late-onset cases. HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid PET contributes to diagnostic changes and its confidence in Chinese patients. Amyloid PET leads to a change of treatment plans in Chinese patients. Early-onset cases are more likely to benefit from amyloid PET than late-onset cases.
