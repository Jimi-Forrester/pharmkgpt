30213101|a|In sterile liver inflammation, danger signals are released in response to tissue injury to alert the immune system; e.g., by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Recently, IL-33 has been identified as a novel type of danger signal or "alarmin", which is released from damaged and necrotic cells. IL-33 is a pleiotropic cytokine that targets a broad range of immune cells and exhibits pro- and anti-inflammatory properties dependent on the disease. This review summarizes the immunomodulatory roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-33 in sterile liver inflammation and highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways in liver disease.
