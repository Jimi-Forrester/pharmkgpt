36769380|t|Serum Neurofilament Light Chain and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein as Potential Diagnostic Biomarkers in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Preliminary Study.
36769380|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopment disorders, characterized by a multifactorial etiology based on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Recent evidence supports the neurobiological hypothesis based on neuroinflammation theory. To date, there are no sufficiently validated diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ASD. Therefore, we decided to investigate the potential diagnostic role for ASD of two biomarkers well known for other neurological inflammatory conditions: the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the neurofilament (Nfl). Nfl and GFAP serum levels were analyzed using SiMoA technology in a group of ASD patients and in a healthy control group (CTRS), age- and gender-matched. Then we investigated the distribution, frequency, and correlation between serum Nfl and GFAP levels and clinical data among the ASD group. The comparison of Nfl and GFAP serum levels between ASD children and the control group showed a mean value of these two markers significantly higher in the ASD group (sNfL mean value ASD pt 6.86 pg/mL median value ASD pt 5.7 pg/mL; mean value CTRS 3.55 pg/mL; median value CTRS 3.1 pg; GFAP mean value ASD pt 205.7 pg/mL median value ASD pt 155.4 pg/mL; mean value CTRS 77.12 pg/mL; median value CTRS 63.94 pg/mL). Interestingly, we also found a statistically significant positive correlation between GFAP levels and hyperactivity symptoms (p-value <0.001). Further investigations using larger groups are necessary to confirm our data and to verify in more depth the potential correlation between these biomarkers and ASD clinical features, such as the severity of the core symptoms, the presence of associated symptoms, and/or the evaluation of a therapeutic intervention. However, these data not only might shed a light on the neurobiology of ASD, supporting the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration hypothesis, but they also might support the use of these biomarkers in the early diagnosis of ASD, to longitudinally monitor the disease activity, and even more as future prognostic biomarkers.
