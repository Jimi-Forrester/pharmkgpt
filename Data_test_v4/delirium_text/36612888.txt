36612888|t|Integrated Dynamic Autonomic and Cardiovascular Regulation during Postural Transitions in Older Adults Living with Frailty: A Systematic Review Protocol.
36612888|a|Older adults often experience episodes of a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing, known as orthostatic hypotension (OH). OH is associated with an increased risk of life-threatening health problems, falls, and death. Although OH has been studied in older adults, the integrated dynamic autonomic and cardiovascular regulation during postural transitions in older adults with frailty remains scarce and poorly understood. The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine the association between how active (e.g., lie-to-stand) and passive (head-up tilt) postural transitions affect the dynamic integrated autonomic and cardiovascular regulatory responses, comparing older adults with different levels of frailty (non-frail, pre-frail, or frail). A second aim is to perform a meta-analysis to compare autonomic and cardiovascular responses during active postural transitions in non-frail, pre-frail, and frail older adults. The systematic review will be outlined according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. The meta-analysis will generate estimates of the comparative autonomic and cardiovascular responses after active postural transitions in adults who are non-frail, pre-frail, and frail. This systematic review will provide critical information on how integrated dynamic autonomic and cardiovascular regulation occurs during postural transitions in older adults with different frailty statuses.
