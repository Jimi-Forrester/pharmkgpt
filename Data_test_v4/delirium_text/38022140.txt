38022140|t|Comprehensive Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric and Mucocutaneous Manifestations in the Diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Complete Clinical Approach to a Case.
38022140|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystemic, potentially fatal disease that commonly affects young women between puberty and menopause. It is a multifactorial disease associated with an elevated risk of premature death. The diagnosis is complex due to the broad clinical spectrum as well as the severity at the time of presentation. It is based on clinical manifestations and complementary studies of antibodies. Diagnostic criteria are not available, and classification criteria, such as the ACR/EULAR (American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism) of 2019 are often used for diagnosis. Despite its clinical heterogeneity, SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple systems, and its early diagnosis is essential to avoid damage to vital organs and improve clinical outcomes. This case report shows atypical manifestations of a patient with neuropsychiatric and dermatological symptoms that were essential within the clinical picture to make the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.
