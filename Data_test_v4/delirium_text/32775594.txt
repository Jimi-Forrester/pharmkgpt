32775594|a|INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence linking periodontal infections to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Saliva sampling can reveal information about the host and pathogen interactions that can inform about physiological and pathological brain states. METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort of age-matched participants (78) was segmented according to their chemosensory (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test; UPSIT) and cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Exam; MMSE and clinical dementia rating; CDR). Mid-morning saliva was sampled from each participant and processed for microbiome composition and cytokine analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to unravel specific changes in microbial and immunological signatures and logistic regression analysis (LRA) was employed to identify taxa that varied in abundance among patient groups. RESULTS: Using olfaction we distinguish in the cognitively normal population a segment with high chemosensory scores (CNh, 27) and another segment with chemosensory scores (CNr, 16) as low as mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 21) but higher than the AD group (17). We could identify stage-specific microbial signatures changes but no clearly distinct cytokine profiles. Periodontal pathogen species as Filifactor villosus decline with the increasing severity of AD, whereas opportunistic oral bacteria such as Leptotrichia wadei show a significant enrichment in MCI. CONCLUSIONS: The salivary microbiome indicates stage-dependent changes in oral bacteria favoring opportunistic species at the expense of periodontal bacteria, whereas the inflammatory profiles remain mainly unchanged in the sampled population.
