21861060|a|Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, is involved in the regulation of gene transcription, energy metabolism and cell aging. Recent studies have showed that SIRT1 possesses neuroprotective effects, however, it is not very clear how SIRT1 exerts the neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this review, we summarized the neuroprotective role of SIRT1 in AD and its possible molecular mechanisms, proposing a novel strategy for preventing and treating neurodegeneration.
