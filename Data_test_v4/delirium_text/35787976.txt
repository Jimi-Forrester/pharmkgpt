35787976|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The lipid oxidation is a key factor for damaging hepatocytes and causing cell death. However, the mechanisms underlying hepatocyte death and the role of the most popular lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear. METHODS: We demonstrated using hepatoma cell lines, a NASH mouse model, HNE-treated monkeys, and biopsy specimens from patients with NASH that HNE induced hepatocyte death by disintegrating the lysosomal limiting membrane. RESULTS: The degree of HNE deposition in human NASH hepatocytes was more severe in cases with high lobular inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis scores, and was associated with enlargement of the staining of lysosomes in hepatocytes. In in vitro experiments, HNE activated mu-calpain via G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 120. The resultant rupture/permeabilization of the lysosomal limiting membrane induced the leakage of cathepsins from lysosomes and hepatocyte death. The blockade of G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) or mu-calpain expression suppressed lysosomal membrane damage and hepatocyte death by HNE. Alda-1, which activates aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 to degrade HNE, prevented HNE-induced hepatocyte death. Intravenous administration of HNE to monkeys for 6 months resulted in hepatocyte death by a mechanism similar to that of cultured cells. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of Alda-1 to choline-deficient, amino-acid defined treated mice for 8 weeks inhibited HNE deposition, decreased liver inflammation, and disrupted lysosomal membranes in hepatocytes, resulting in improvement of liver fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide novel insights into the mechanism of hepatocyte death in NASH and will contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for NASH.
