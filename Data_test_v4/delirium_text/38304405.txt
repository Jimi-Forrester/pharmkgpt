38304405|t|Challenges for setting up psychiatric services in a trauma centre in India.
38304405|a|Psychiatric sequelae may occur following traumatic injury irrespective of whether an insult has been caused to the brain. A range of psychiatric illnesses have been either causative of or associated with road traffic accidents and traumatic injuries, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Despite literature on such associations, psychiatric intervention in the treatment of patients following traumatic injury is limited. The authors share their experience of challenges in addressing mental health problems in a tertiary care trauma centre located in North India. Steps in overcoming those challenges included: developing a semi-structured form to be completed for referrals and consultations, a psychiatrist attending weekly rounds with the surgeons, and initiating a psychiatry out-patient clinic for patients discharged from the trauma centre. It may be worthwhile in the future to set up a trauma psychiatry unit at the centre, involving a clinical psychologist, a psychiatric social worker and an occupational therapist for the comprehensive care of patients.
