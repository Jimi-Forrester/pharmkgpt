31884567|a|The progression of cancers and neurodegenerative disorders is largely defined by a set of molecular determinants that are either complementarily deregulated, or share remarkably overlapping functional pathways. A large number of such molecules have been demonstrated to be involved in the progression of both diseases. In this review, we particularly discuss our current knowledge on p53, cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin F, Pin1 and protein phosphatase 2A, and their implications in the shared or distinct pathways that lead to cancers or neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we focus on the inter-dependent regulation of brain cancers and neurodegeneration, mediated by intercellular communication between tumor and neuronal cells in the brain through the extracellular microenvironment. Finally, we shed light on the therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
