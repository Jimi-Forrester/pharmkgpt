32468464|t|Nutritional Lipidomics in Alzheimer's Disease.
32468464|a|Lipids constitute almost 60% of the brain's dry weight, and they are thought to be involved in inflammation, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. The brain mostly contains sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids and cholesterol which are abundant in myelin and neuronal membranes. The recent rise of the promising area of lipidomic data can be used as a diagnosing tool at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease allowing novel therapeutic targets. In this review, altered lipid metabolites as well as the impact of diet in the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are analyzed.
