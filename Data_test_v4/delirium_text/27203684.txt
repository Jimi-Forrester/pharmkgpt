27203684|a|Mitochondria are physically and biochemically in contact with other organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Such contacts are formed between mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM), specialized subregions of ER, and the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). We have previously shown increased expression of MAM-associated proteins and enhanced ER to mitochondria Ca(2+) transfer from ER to mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)-related neuronal models. Here, we report that siRNA knockdown of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a protein that is involved in the tethering of ER and mitochondria, leads to increased contact between the two organelles. Cells depleted in Mfn2 showed increased Ca(2+) transfer from ER to mitchondria and longer stretches of ER forming contacts with OMM. Interestingly, increased contact resulted in decreased concentrations of intra- and extracellular Abeta40 and Abeta42 . Analysis of gamma-secretase protein expression, maturation and activity revealed that the low Abeta concentrations were a result of impaired gamma-secretase complex function. Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 and neprilysin expression as well as neprilysin activity were not affected by Mfn2 siRNA treatment. In summary, our data shows that modulation of ER-mitochondria contact affects gamma-secretase activity and Abeta generation. Increased ER-mitochondria contact results in lower gamma-secretase activity suggesting a new mechanism by which Abeta generation can be controlled.
