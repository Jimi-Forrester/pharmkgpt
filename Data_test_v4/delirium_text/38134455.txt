38134455|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of oral pregabalin versus gabapentin on sedation quality and anesthesia recovery times in cats in a typical perioperative setting. ANIMALS: 50 healthy cats with > 1 kg body weight presenting for elective surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, prospective clinical trial, cats presenting to the University of California-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital were assigned to receive buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg IM followed by 1 of 2 oral sedation treatments: pregabalin 4 mg/kg or gabapentin 10 mg/kg. Cats were then anesthetized using a standardized protocol. Physical examination parameters and behavioral scores were measured by 2 treatment-blinded veterinarians to compare sedation levels before and after drug administration. Inadequate sedation for handling or IV catheter placement was addressed by dexmedetomidine administration. After surgery was completed, anesthesia recovery times and quality were assessed by the same veterinarians. The effects of pregabalin versus gabapentin on body temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were analyzed using Student t tests; behavioral assessments were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; and drug treatment effects on dexmedetomidine sedation rescue and frequency of delirium during anesthetic recovery were analyzed using Fisher exact tests. A P < .05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in change of physiologic parameters or sedation scores before and after sedation between groups. The need for rescue sedation for IV catheter placement and the incidence of emergence delirium were infrequent and similar for both treatments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: At the doses studied, oral pregabalin and gabapentin produced indistinguishable effects as adjunctive perioperative sedation agents in cats.
