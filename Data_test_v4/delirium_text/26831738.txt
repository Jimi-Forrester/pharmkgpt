26831738|t|Coagulansin-A has beneficial effects on the development of bovine embryos in vitro via HSP70 induction.
26831738|a|Coagulansin-A (withanolide) is the steroidal lactone obtained from Withania coagulans which belong to Solanaceae family. The present study investigated the effects of coagulansin-A on bovine oocyte maturation and embryo development in vitro. All these oocytes were aspirated from the ovaries obtained from Korean Hanwoo cows at a local abattoir. To determine whether coagulansin-A has beneficial effects on bovine oocyte maturation in vitro, 355 oocytes per group (control and treated) in seven replicates were subjected with different concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 muM) of coagulansin-A. The coagulansin-A was added in the in vitro maturation (IVM) media followed by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and then in vitro culture (IVC). Only treatment with 5 muM coagulansin-A remarkably (P<0.05) improved embryos development (Day 8 blastocyst) having 27.30 and 40.01% for control and coagulansin-A treated groups respectively. Treatment with 5 muM coagulansin-A significantly induced activation of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) (P<0.05). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that 5 muM coagulansin-A treatment also significantly inhibited oxidative stress and inflammation during bovine embryo development in vitro by decreasing 8-oxoguanosine (8-OxoG) (P<0.05) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (P<0.05). The expressions of HSP70 and NF-kappaB were also conformed through real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay confirmed that coagulansin-A treatment significantly improved the embryo quality and reduced bovine embryo DNA damage (P<0.05). The present study provides new information regarding the mechanisms by which coagulansin-A promotes bovine embryo development in vitro.
