34608617|a|PURPOSE: To assess feasibility of conducting acute sarcopenia research in complex populations of hospitalised older adults. METHODS: Patients >= 70 years old were recruited to three cohorts: elective colorectal surgery, emergency (abdominal) surgery, medical patients with infections. Participants were recruited to the elective cohort in preoperative assessment clinic, and acutely admitted participants from surgical and medical wards at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. Serial measures of muscle quantity (ultrasound quadriceps, bioelectrical impedance analysis), muscle function (hand grip strength, physical performance), and questionnaires (mini-nutritional assessment, physical function) were performed at baseline, within 7 (+- 2) days of admission/surgery, and 13 (+- 1) weeks post-admission/surgery. Feasibility outcomes were assessed across timepoints including recruitment and drop-out rates, and procedure completion rates. RESULTS: Eighty-one participants were recruited (mean age 79, 38.3% females). Recruitment rates were higher in elective (75%, 24/32) compared to emergency surgery (37.2%, 16/43), and medical participants (45.1%, 41/91; p = 0.003). Drop-out rates varied from 8.3 to 19.5% at 7 days, and 12.5-43.9% at 13 weeks. Age and gender did not differ between patients assessed for eligibility, approached, or recruited. Completion rates were highest for ultrasound quadriceps (98.8%, 80/81 across all groups at baseline). Gait speed completion rates were lower in medical (70.7%, 29/41) compared to elective participants (100%, 24/24) at baseline. CONCLUSION: Higher participation refusal and drop-out rates should be expected for research involving recruitment of participants from the acute setting. Assessment of muscle quantity/quality through ultrasound is recommended in early-stage trials in the acute setting, where completion rates of physical performance testing are expected to be lower.
