38509745|a|The optimal analgesia regimen after open cardiac surgery is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of continuous transversus thoracis muscle plane (TTMP) blocks initiated before surgery on open cardiac surgery outcomes. A group of 110 patients were randomly allocated to either receive bilateral continuous TTMP blocks (TTP group) or no nerve block (SAL group). The primary endpoint was post-operative pain at 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h after extubation at rest and exercise. The secondary outcome measures included analgesia requirements (sufentanil and flurbiprofen axetil administration), time to extubation, incidence of reintubation, length of stay in the ICU, incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), time until return of bowel function, time to mobilization, urinary catheter removal and length of hospital stay. The length of stay in the ICU and length of hospital stay were significantly longer in the SAL group than in the TTP group. NRS scores at rest and exercise were significantly lower in the TTP group than in the SAL group at all time points. The TTP group required significantly less intraoperative and post-operative sufentanil and post-operative dynastat consumption than the SAL group. Time to extubation, time to first flatus, time until mobilization and time until urinary catheter removal were significantly earlier in the TTP group than in the SAL group. The incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the TTP group. Bilateral continuous TTMP blocks provide effective analgesia and accelerate recovery in patients undergoing open heart valve replacement surgery.
