35631262|t|Anticholinergic Load Is Associated with Swallowing Dysfunction in Convalescent Older Patients after a Stroke.
35631262|a|This study aimed to establish whether anticholinergic load affects the swallowing function of geriatric stroke patients in convalescent stages, as no proven association between the anticholinergic load-based Anticholinergic Risk Scale and the swallowing dysfunction in Japanese patients was known. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on hospitalized older patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke. The study outcomes included evaluating the patients at hospital discharge using the Functional Oral Intake Scale. To evaluate the effects of an increased anticholinergic load, we used a multivariate analysis to examine whether the change in the Anticholinergic Risk Scale during hospitalization was associated with the outcome. Of 542 enrolled patients, 345 (63.7%) presented with cerebral infarction, 148 (27.3%) with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 49 (9%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The change in the Anticholinergic Risk Scale was independently associated with the Functional Oral Intake Scale (beta = -0.118, p = 0.0164) at discharge. Among anticholinergics, the use of chlorpromazine, hydroxyzine, haloperidol, metoclopramide, risperidone, etc., increased significantly from admission to discharge. An increased anticholinergic load was associated with swallowing dysfunction in older patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation.
