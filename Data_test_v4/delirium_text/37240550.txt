37240550|t|Radiologically Defined Sarcopenia as a Biomarker for Frailty and Malnutrition in Head and Neck Skin Cancer Patients.
37240550|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate whether radiologically defined sarcopenia, or a low skeletal muscle index (SMI), could be used as a practical biomarker for frailty and postoperative complications (POC) in patients with head and neck skin cancer (HNSC). This was a retrospective study on prospectively collected data. The L3 SMI (cm2/m2) was calculated with use of baseline CT or MRI neck scans and low SMIs were defined using sex-specific cut-off values. A geriatric assessment with a broad range of validated tools was performed at baseline. POC was graded with the Clavien-Dindo Classification (with a grade of > II as the cut-off). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed with low SMIs and POC as the endpoints. The patients' (n = 57) mean age was 77.0 +- 9 years, 68.4% were male, and 50.9% had stage III-IV cancer. Frailty was determined according to Geriatric 8 (G8) score (OR 7.68, 95% CI 1.19-49.66, p = 0.032) and the risk of malnutrition was determined according to the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (OR 9.55, 95% CI 1.19-76.94, p = 0.034), and these were independently related to low SMIs. Frailty based on G8 score (OR 5.42, 95% CI 1.25-23.49, p = 0.024) was the only variable related to POC. However, POC was more prevalent in patients with low SMIs (  19%, OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.5-6.0, p = 0.356).To conclude, a low SMI is a practical biomarker for frailty and malnutrition in HNSC. Future research should be focused on interventions based on low SMI scores and assess the effect of the intervention on SMI, frailty, malnutrition, and POC.
