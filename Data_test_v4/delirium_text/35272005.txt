35272005|t|Tauopathies: The Role of Tau in Cellular Crosstalk and Synaptic Dysfunctions.
35272005|a|Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases among which are many of the most prevalent and with higher incidence worldwide, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to the World Health Organization, this set of diseases will continue to increase their incidence, affecting millions of people by 2050. All of them are characterized by aberrant aggregation of tau protein in neurons and glia that are distributed in different brain regions according to their susceptibility. Numerous studies reveal that synaptic regulation not only has a neuronal component, but glia plays a fundamental role in it beyond its neuroinflammatory role. Despite this, it has not been emphasized how the glial inclusions of tau in this cell type directly affect this and many other essential functions, whose alterations have been related to the development of tauopathies. In this way, this review shows how tau inclusions in glia influence the synaptic dysfunctions that result in the cognitive symptoms characteristic of tauopathies. Thus, the mechanisms affected by inclusions in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes are unraveled.
