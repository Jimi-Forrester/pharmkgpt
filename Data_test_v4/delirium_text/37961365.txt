37961365|t|Senescent and disease-associated microglia are modifiable features of aged brain white matter.
37961365|a|Brain white matter tracts undergo structural and functional changes linked to late-life cognitive decline, but the cellular and molecular contributions to their selective vulnerability are not well defined. In naturally aged mice, we demonstrate that senescent and disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotypes converge in hippocampus-adjacent white matter. Through gold-standard gene expression and immunolabeling combined with high-dimensional spatial mapping, we identified microglial cell fates in aged white matter characterized by aberrant morphology, microenvironment reorganization, and expression of senescence and DAM markers, including galectin 3 (GAL3/Lgals3), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, including Cdkn2a/p16 ink4a . Pharmacogenetic or pharmacological targeting of p16 ink4a or BCL2 reduced white matter GAL3+ DAM abundance and rejuvenated microglial fimbria organization. Our results demonstrate dynamic changes in microglial identity in aged white matter that can be reverted by senotherapeutic intervention to promote homeostatic maintenance in the aged brain.
