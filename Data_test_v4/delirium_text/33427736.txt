33427736|t|Cerebrovascular and Neurodegenerative Pathologies in Long-Term Stable Mild Cognitive Impairment.
33427736|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered by some to be a prodromal phase of a progressive disease (i.e., neurodegeneration) resulting in dementia; however, a substantial portion of individuals (ranging from 5-30%) remain cognitively stable over the long term (sMCI). The etiology of sMCI is unclear but may be linked to cerebrovascular disease (CVD), as evidence from longitudinal studies suggest a significant proportion of individuals with vasculopathy remain stable over time. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the presence of neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies in individuals with long-term (>5-year) sMCI, in a preliminary test of the hypothesis that CVD may be a contributor to non-degenerative cognitive impairment. We expect frequent vasculopathy at autopsy in sMCI relative to neurodegenerative disease, and relative to individuals who convert to dementia. METHODS: In this retrospective study, using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, individuals with sMCI (n = 28) were compared to those with MCI who declined over a 5 to 9-year period (dMCI; n = 139) on measures of neurodegenerative pathology (i.e., Abeta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, TDP-43, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and CVD (infarcts, lacunes, microinfarcts, hemorrhages, and microbleeds). RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease pathology (Abeta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) was significantly higher in the dMCI group than the sMCI group. Microinfarcts were the only vasculopathy associated with group membership; these were more frequent in sMCI. CONCLUSION: The most frequent neuropathology in this sample of long-term sMCI was microinfarcts, tentatively suggesting that silent small vessel disease may characterize non-worsening cognitive impairment.
