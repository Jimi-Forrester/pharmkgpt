37355079|t|Tenuigenin activates the IRS1/Akt/mTOR signaling by blocking PTPN1 to inhibit autophagy and improve locomotor recovery in spinal cord injury.
37355079|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tenuigenin (TEN) is a main pharmacologically active component of Polygala tenuifolia Willd. (Polygalaceae), which has shown neuroprotective functions in Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, TEN also demonstrated an anti-oxidative impact in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease, reducing damage and loss of dopaminergic neurons. AIM: This work focuses on the impact of TEN on locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI) and underpinning molecules involved. METHODS: A rat model of SCI was generated, and the rats were treated with TEN, oe-PTPN1 (PTP non-receptor type 1), a protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) antagonist LY294002, or an autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Subsequently, locomotor function was detected. Pathological changes and neuronal activity in the spinal cord tissues were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TUNEL assays. Protein expression of Beclin-1 and microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)-II/LC3B-I, PTPN1, IRS1, mTOR, and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) was analyzed by western blot assays. The LC3B expression was further examined by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Treatment with TEN restored the locomotor function of SCI rats, reduced the cavity area and cell apoptosis, upregulated growth-associated protein 43 and neurofilament 200, and decreased the Beclin-1 and LC3B-II/LC3B-I levels in the spinal cord. TEN suppressed PTPN1 protein level, while PTPN1 suppressed IRS1 protein to reduce the p-Akt and mTOR levels. Either PTPN1 overexpression or LY294002 treatment blocked the promoting effect of TEN on SCI recovery. However, treatment with 3-MA suppressed autophagy, which consequently rescued the locomotor function and reduced neuron loss induced by PTPN1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that TEN suppresses autophagy to promote function recovery in SCI rats by blocking PTPN1 and rescuing the IRS1/Akt/mTOR signaling.
