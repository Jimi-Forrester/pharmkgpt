35634543|a|Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a massive threat to public health worldwide. Siddha system of medicine is one of the traditional medicines of South India. The recommended formulations in Siddha Sasthric Medicines- Fixed Regimen (SSM-FiRe) are Amukkura tablets, Kaba Sura Kudineer (KSK) for asymptomatic COVID-19 positive (RT-PCR) patients, and Athimathuram tablets, Adathodai Manappagu syrup, Thippili Rasayanam, Brahmananda Bairavam tablet, and Notchi Kudineer for mild symptomatic patients. The core objective of the trial was to document the efficacy of SSM-FiRe in the prevention of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 disease progression to the next level of severity, reduce the severity of symptoms and revert to RT-PCR Negative. Methods: An exploratory, prospective, open-labeled, single-arm, non-randomized trial was designed as per GCP guidelines to assess the efficacy of SSM-FiRe. Sixty RT-PCR positive participants who were asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms were recruited for the study at the Siddha COVID Care Centre, Vyasarpadi, Chennai from June to August 2020. Nasal and oropharyngeal swab tests were performed on the 0, 7th, and 14th days. All participants were treated with SSM - FiRe regimen. All the participants were also assessed based on Siddha Yakkkaiyin Ilakkanam, which included Clinical symptoms and vitals. Laboratory investigations such as Haemogram, Liver Function Test, Renal Function Test, HbA1C, Electrolytes, Inflammatory markers, Cardiac profile, Immunoglobulins, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests were performed. Results: 83% of COVID-19 patients turned RT-PCR negative on the 7th day and in most of the cases, symptoms were reduced within the first 5 days of admission. The RT-PCR cycle threshold (ct) value increased significantly (<0.001) after treatment and all the participants were RT-PCR negative, except one, who was positive even after 14 days. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developed significantly (p-value - 0.006). LFT, RFT, CBC, Total proteins, and electrolytes continued to be in the normal range after treatment, indicating the safety of the intervention. Conclusion: Asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 disease can be well managed by SSM - FiRe treatment, Further studies could be taken up to strengthen the findings.
