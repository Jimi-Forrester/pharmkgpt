36505526|t|A review of perioperative anemia: A modifiable and not so benign risk factor.
36505526|a|Anemia is a commonly encountered finding either during the preoperative assessment or during the postoperative management of the patient. Anemia often gets overlooked while more emphasis is paid to cardiovascular and pulmonary evaluation. Evidence, however, suggests that the presence of anemia in the perioperative period can predispose patients to other complications. Awareness of the consequences of anemia in the perioperative period can lead to better recognition and early management of this potentially modifiable risk factor. In this review, we focus on the effects of anemia on the cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, cognitive, and functional status outcomes of patients. We also review management strategies that could be employed, depending on the available time and resources.
