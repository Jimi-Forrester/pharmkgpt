15161596|a|Acute confusional syndrome, or delirium, is a transitory mental state characterized by the fluctuating alteration of awareness and attention levels. We present the case of a patient with acute confusional syndrome associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) aggravated by metabolic acidosis induced by oral acetazolamide treatment.A 70-year-old man with no history of neurological disease was referred with a clinical picture consistent with acute confusional syndrome presenting between midnight and dawn. During the admission examination infectious, toxic, and neurologic causes, or those related to metabolic or heart disease were ruled out. Arterial blood gases measured during one of the nighttime episodes of acute confusional syndrome showed mild hypoxia and hypercapnia with mixed acidosis. Signs and symptoms suggestive of OSAS had been developing over the months prior to admission, with snoring, sleep apnea, and moderate daytime drowsiness. Polysomnography demonstrated severe OSAS with an apnea-hypopnea index of 38. Mean arterial oxygen saturation was 83%; time oxygen saturation remained below 90% was 44%. The attending physician ordered the withdrawal of oral acetazolamide, which was considered the cause of the metabolic component of acidosis. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure was initiated at 9 cm H2O, after a titration polysomnographic study. The patient continued to improve.OSAS, for which very effective treatment is available, should be included among diseases that may trigger acute confusional syndrome.
