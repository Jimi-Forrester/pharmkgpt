36986277|t|Rosmarinus officinalis and Mentha piperita Oils Supplementation Enhances Memory in a Rat Model of Scopolamine-Induced Alzheimer's Disease-like Condition.
36986277|a|Alzheimer's disease is regarded as a common neurodegenerative disease that may lead to dementia and the loss of memory. We report here the nootropic and anti-amnesic effects of both peppermint and rosemary oils using a rat model of scopolamine-induced amnesia-like AD. Rats were administered orally with two doses (50 and 100 mg/kg) of each single oil and combined oils. The positive group used donepezil (1 mg/kg). In the therapeutic phase, rats were administered scopolamine (1 mg/kg) through the oral administration of oils. During the nootropic phase, both oils showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in radial arm maze latency times, working memory, and reference memory errors compared with the normal group, along with significant (p < 0.05) enhancements of long-term memory during the passive avoidance test. Therapeutic phase results revealed significant enhancements of memory processing compared with the positive groups. In the hippocampus, oils exhibited an elevation of BDNF levels in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemistry findings showed increased hippocampal neurogenesis suppressed by scopolamine in the sub-granular zone, and the anti-amnesic activity of single oil was enhanced when the two oils combined. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) of the two oils revealed sufficient compounds (1,8-Cineole, alpha-Pinene, menthol and menthone) with potential efficacy in the memory process and cognitive defects. Our work suggests that both oils could enhance the performance of working and spatial memory, and when combined, more anti-amnesic activity was produced. A potential enhancement of hippocampal growth and neural plasticity was apparent with possible therapeutic activity to boost memory in AD patients.
