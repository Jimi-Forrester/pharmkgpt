35280457|a|Tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) are molecules with a pyramidal structure formed by folding four single strands of DNA based on the principle of base pairing. Although DNA has polyanionic properties, the special spatial structure of TDNs allows them to penetrate the cell membrane without the aid of transfection agents in a caveolin-dependent manner and enables them to participate in the regulation of cellular processes without obvious toxic side effects. Because of their stable spatial structure, TDNs resist the limitations imposed by nuclease activity and innate immune responses to DNA. In addition, TDNs have good editability and biocompatibility, giving them great advantages for biomedical applications. Previous studies have found that TDNs have a variety of biological properties, including promoting cell migration, proliferation and differentiation, as well as having anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-infective and immune regulation capabilities. Moreover, we confirmed that TDNs can promote the regeneration and repair of skin, blood vessels, muscles and bone tissues. Based on these findings, we believe that TDNs have broad prospects for application in wound repair and regeneration. This article reviews recent progress in TDN research and its applications.
