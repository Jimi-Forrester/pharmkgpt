35702288|a|The edible oil needs of African countries are met by imported or locally produced ones. Therefore, consumers are generally confronted with a choice of edible oils of poorly controlled quality. However, quality control of edible oils for local consumption is of high necessity. This study aimed to assess the quality of edible oils sold and consumed in some cities in Burkina Faso. Oil samples collected in the cities of Dedougou, Koudougou, and Nouna were used for several analyses. Oil samples from palm, refined and unrefined cottonseed, and groundnut were collected. Standard methods were used to assess the physicochemical quality parameters of the oils, including the peroxide value, water and volatile matter content, acid value, traces of soap, and mineral oil contents. The parameters varied significantly depending on the oil type, but not by the locality of origin. The peroxide indices had varied from 3.24 to 39.99 mEq O2/kg oil. The acid indices varied from 0.22 mg KOH/g to 1.24 mg KOH/g. The water and volatile matter contents ranged from 0.04% to 0.88%. The test for traces of soap gave values ranging from 0 to 76 ppm. For the mineral oil test, four samples of cottonseed oil collected in Dedougou gave positive results. Compared to international reference standards, in particular the Codex Alimentarius standard, it may constitute a health risk for consumers. The poor storage, distribution, and marketing conditions of the oils could explain their poor quality. In order to provide consumers with quality oils, regular controls must be undertaken in the places where the oils are stored and/or marketed.
