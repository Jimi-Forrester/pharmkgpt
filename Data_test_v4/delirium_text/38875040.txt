38875040|t|Cognitive Speed in Neurodegenerative Disease: Comparing Mean Rate and Inconsistency Within and Across the Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Spectra in the COMPASS-ND Study.
38875040|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) are characterized by early and gradual worsening perturbations in speeded cognitive responses. Objective: Using simple and choice reaction time tasks, we compared two indicators of cognitive speed within and across the AD and LBD spectra: mean rate (average reaction time across trials) and inconsistency (within person variability). Methods: The AD spectrum cohorts included subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, n = 28), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 121), and AD (n = 45) participants. The LBD spectrum included Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 32), mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI, n = 21), and LBD (n = 18) participants. A cognitively unimpaired (CU, n = 39) cohort served as common benchmark. We conducted multivariate analyses of variance and discrimination analyses. Results: Within the AD spectrum, the AD cohort was slower and more inconsistent than the CU, SCI, and MCI cohorts. The MCI cohort was slower than the CU cohort. Within the LBD spectrum, the LBD cohort was slower and more inconsistent than the CU, PD, and PD-MCI cohorts. The PD-MCI cohort was slower than the CU and PD cohorts. In cross-spectra (corresponding cohort) comparisons, the LBD cohort was slower and more inconsistent than the AD cohort. The PD-MCI cohort was slower than the MCI cohort. Discrimination analyses clarified the group difference patterns. Conclusions: For both speed tasks, mean rate and inconsistency demonstrated similar sensitivity to spectra-related comparisons. Both dementia cohorts were slower and more inconsistent than each of their respective non-dementia cohorts.
