36500503|t|On the Question of the Formation of Nitro-Functionalized 2,4-Pyrazole Analogs on the Basis of Nitrylimine Molecular Systems and 3,3,3-Trichloro-1-Nitroprop-1-Ene.
36500503|a|Experimental and theoretical studies on the reaction between (E)-3,3,3-trichloro-1-nitroprop-1-ene and N-(4-bromophenyl)-C-arylnitrylimine were performed. It was found that the title process unexpectedly led to 1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-phenyl-5-nitropyrazole instead of the expected Delta2-pyrazoline molecular system. This was the result of a unique CHCl3 elimination process. The observed mechanism of transformation was explained in the framework of the molecular electron density theory (MEDT). The theoretical results showed that both of the possible channels of [3 + 2] cycloaddition were favorable from a kinetic point of view, due to which the creation of 1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-aryl-4-tricholomethyl-5-nitro-Delta2-pyrazoline was more probable. On the other hand, according to the experimental data, the presented reactions occurred with full regioselectivity.
