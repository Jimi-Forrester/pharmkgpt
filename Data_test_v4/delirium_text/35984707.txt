35984707|t|Discovery of (R)-N-Benzyl-2-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)propanamide [(R)-AS-1], a Novel Orally Bioavailable EAAT2 Modulator with Drug-like Properties and Potent Antiseizure Activity In Vivo.
35984707|a|(R)-7 [(R)-AS-1] showed broad-spectrum antiseizure activity across in vivo mouse seizure models: maximal electroshock (MES), 6 Hz (32/44 mA), acute pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), and PTZ-kindling. A remarkable separation between antiseizure activity and CNS-related adverse effects was also observed. In vitro studies with primary glia cultures and COS-7 cells expressing the glutamate transporter EAAT2 showed enhancement of glutamate uptake, revealing a stereoselective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) effect, further supported by molecular docking simulations. (R)-7 [(R)-AS-1] was not active in EAAT1 and EAAT3 assays and did not show significant off-target activity, including interactions with targets reported for marketed antiseizure drugs, indicative of a novel and unprecedented mechanism of action. Both in vivo pharmacokinetic and in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADME-Tox) profiles confirmed the favorable drug-like potential of the compound. Thus, (R)-7 [(R)-AS-1] may be considered as the first-in-class small-molecule PAM of EAAT2 with potential for further preclinical and clinical development in epilepsy and possibly other CNS disorders.
