27863851|a|AIMS: The sporadic and late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes the most common form of dementia. This non-familiar form could be a consequence of metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity and the development of a brain-specific insulin resistance known as type III diabetes. This work demonstrates the development of a significant AD-like neuropathology due to these metabolic alterations. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice strain were divided into two groups, one fed with a diet rich in palmitic acid (high-fat diet, HFD) since their weaning until 16 months of age, and another group used as a control with a regular diet. The analyses were carried out in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus using a Thioflavin-S stain and immunofluorescence assays. RESULTS: The most significant finding of the present research was that HFD induced the deposition of the betaA peptide. Moreover, the diet also caused alterations in different cell processes, such as increased inflammatory reactions that lead to a decrease in the neuronal precursor cells. In addition, the results show that there were also dysregulations in normal autophagy and apoptosis, mechanisms related to betaA formation. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings confirm that HFD favors the formation of betaA depositions in the brain, a key feature of AD, supporting the metabolic hypothesis of sporadic AD.
