39589665|a|BACKGROUND: Critical illness survivors frequently suffer from long-term impairments, often described as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). PICS encompasses physical, cognitive, and mental impairments. Additionally, the term intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness (ICUAW) was coined for muscle weakness after critical illness. Research on the progression and outcome of individuals affected by PICS and ICUAW is scant. Thus we aimed to assess the health status and its progression during neurorehabilitation in critically ill patients using comprehensive outcome measures, describe the prevalence of PICS, and evaluate factors associated with rehabilitation outcomes. METHODS: Patients with mixed reasons for critical illness who received >= 5 days of mechanical ventilation on the ICU and who were admitted to neurorehabilitation, were eligible to be included in this prospective cohort study. A number of outcomes (patient-reported, clinician-reported, and performance) were assessed after discharge from the ICU (V1) and shortly before discharge from inpatient neurorehabilitation (V2). The prevalence of PICS, defined as having at least one impairment in any PICS dimension), was calculated at V1 and V2. Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with rehabilitation outcome (poor outcome = modified Rankin Scale > 2) and ICUAW at V2 (MRC sum score < 48). RESULTS: In total, 250 critical illness survivors (62 +- 14 years, 34% female, median stay on ICU 55 days, median inpatient rehabilitation 65 days) were included. 11 participants (4.4%) died before V2. All outcomes improved significantly during rehabilitation except sensory impairment and pain. PICS was present in 96% at V1 and in 85% at V2, whereby mainly the physical domain (V1: 87%, V2: 66%; ICUAW with MRC sum score < 48) and the cognitive domain (V1:65%, V2:55%; Montreal Cognitive Assessment < 26) were affected. Mental impairment was lower (V1:48%, V2:29%; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale > 7), but still affected a considerable number of participants. Accordingly, health-related quality of life was rather low at discharge (0.64 +- 0.28, index value of EQ-5D-5L). MRC sum score at V1, duration of mechanical ventilation, and female gender were significantly associated with a poor rehabilitation outcome. Grip strength in % of reference at V1, age, female gender, and comorbidities were significantly associated with persistent ICUAW at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant improvements during rehabilitation, survivors after critical illness experience a substantial burden of PICS and ICUAW at discharge from rehabilitation care. Survivors of critical illness require long-term follow-up, supportive structures, and tailored long-term multi-disciplinary therapies even after intensive rehabilitation.
