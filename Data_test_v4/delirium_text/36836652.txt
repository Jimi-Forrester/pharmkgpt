36836652|a|(1) Background: To systematically review evidence on the safety and efficacy of psychopharmacological treatments available for psychomotor agitation (PA) in children and adolescents. (2) Methods: Studies assessing the safety and efficacy of psychopharmacological treatments for acute PA in children and adolescents that were published between January 1984 and June 2022 on PubMed were systematically reviewed. We included: (i) papers that presented a combination of the search terms specified in the "Search strategy" sub-paragraph; (ii) manuscripts in English; (iii) original papers; (iv) prospective or retrospective/observational studies and experimental or quasi-experimental reports. The exclusion criteria were: (i) review papers; (ii) non-original studies including editorials and book reviews; (iii) studies not specifically designed and focused on the selected topic. (3) Results: We selected 42 papers: 11 case series (11/42, 26.19%), 8 chart reviews (8/42, 19.05%), 8 case reports (8/42, 19.05%), 6 double-blind placebo-controlled randomized studies (6/42, 14.29%), 4 double-blind controlled randomized studies (4/42, 9.52%), 4 open-label trials (4/42, 9.52%) and 1 case control (1/42, 2.38%). (4) Conclusions: The drugs most frequently used to treat agitation in children and adolescents were ziprasidone, risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine and valproic acid. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy/safety ratio, considering the limited number of observations in this field.
