33235680|t|Frontotemporal dementia as underlying cause of newly altered mental status in a 59-year-old female: a case presentation and literature review.
33235680|a|59 y.o. female is evaluated for chronic behavioral abnormalities. We describe the diagnostic approach to cases of altered mental status. Before considering the different possible etiologies including, for example, metabolic, infectious, toxic, hypoxemic, endocrine, or iatrogenic ones, we underline the importance of assessing patient's baseline functional status. Often, in particular in older patients' population, dementia is the underlying culprit of mentation abnormalities. Through extensive history and with the help of neuroimaging studies, our patient was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.
