21160565|t|Achiral bis-imine in combination with CoCl2: A remarkable effect on enantioselectivity of lipase-mediated acetylation of racemic secondary alcohol.
21160565|a|A bis-imine (prepared via a new FeCl3-based method) in combination with CoCl2 facilitated lipase-mediated acetylation of the (R)-isomer of a racemic benzylic secondary alcohol with 91% ee(s). The methodology was used for the preparation of the known drug rivastigmine.
