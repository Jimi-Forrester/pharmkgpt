33250056|a|In humans, iatrogenic transmission of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta)-amyloidosis is suspected following inoculation of pituitary-derived hormones or dural grafts presumably contaminated with Abeta proteins as well as after cerebral surgeries. Experimentally, intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenate extracts containing misfolded Abeta can seed Abeta deposition in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis or in non-human primates. The transmission of cerebral Abeta is governed by the host and by the inoculated samples. It is critical to better characterize the propensities of different hosts to develop Abeta deposition after contamination by an Abeta-positive sample as well as to better assess which biological samples can transmit this lesion. Abeta precursor protein (huAPPwt) mice express humanized non-mutated forms of Abeta precursor protein and do not spontaneously develop Abeta or amyloid deposits. We found that inoculation of Abeta-positive brain extracts from Alzheimer patients in these mice leads to a sparse Abeta deposition close to the alveus 18 months post-inoculation. However, it does not induce cortical or hippocampal Abeta deposition. Secondary inoculation of apparently amyloid deposit-free hippocampal extracts from these huAPPwt mice to APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse models of amyloidosis enhanced Abeta deposition in the alveus 9 months post-inoculation. This suggests that Abeta seeds issued from human brain samples can persist in furtive forms in brain tissues while maintaining their ability to foster Abeta deposition in receptive hosts that overexpress endogenous Abeta. This work emphasizes the need for high-level preventive measures, especially in the context of neurosurgery, to prevent the risk of iatrogenic transmission of Abeta lesions from samples with sparse amyloid markers.
