25584188|t|The contribution of comprehensive geriatric assessment to primary care physicians.
25584188|a|BACKGROUND: To provide quality care to the growing number of older patients, primary care physicians (PCPs) will require support from geriatric specialists. Multidisciplinary comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has been found to improve outcomes in older people. This study explored the contribution of CGA to the management of older patients by their PCPs; PCP attitudes to CGA; and PCP satisfaction with CGA. METHODS: Two hundred PCPs in an Israeli Preferred Provider Organization were interviewed as part of an evaluative study of the contribution of a national outpatient CGA program to older patients, their families and physicians. RESULTS: The main reasons for referral to CGA were cognitive impairment and rapid functional decline. Three domains described the contribution of CGA to PCPs: medical treatment, support in counseling patients, and treatment of cognitive impairment. About 69% of PCPs definitely agreed that CGA more fully addressed the physical, mental and social needs of patients than other consultative clinics. About half were very satisfied with the CGA staff's attitudes to patients, their families and to the PCP. CONCLUSIONS: CGA contributed significantly to the care provided to older patients by PCPs. The expansion of CGA services deserves consideration.
