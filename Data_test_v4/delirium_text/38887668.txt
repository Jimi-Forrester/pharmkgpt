38887668|a|Background: Extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a signaling molecule in the peripheral nerves, regulating myelination after nerve injury. The present study examined whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ATP levels in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are related to disease severity. Methods: CSF ATP levels in 13 patients with GBS and 18 patients with CIDP were compared with those in a control group of 16 patients with other neurological diseases (ONDs). In patients with CIDP, CSF ATP levels were compared before and after treatment. The correlations between CSF ATP levels and other factors, including clinical data and CSF protein levels, were also evaluated. Results: Median CSF ATP levels were significantly higher in patients with GBS and CIDP than in those with ONDs. When patients with CIDP were classified into two groups depending on their responsiveness to immunotherapy, median CSF ATP levels were significantly higher in good responders than in ONDs. CSF ATP levels tended to decrease after treatment in patients with CIDP. In patients with CIDP, there is a negative correlation between CSF ATP and CSF protein levels. Conclusions: CSF ATP levels were increased in patients with GBS and CIDP. In particular, CSF ATP levels tended to decrease following treatment in patients with CIDP. CSF ATP levels may be useful biomarkers for the diagnosis or monitoring of therapeutic effects in patients with GBS and CIDP.
