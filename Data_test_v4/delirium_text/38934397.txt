38934397|a|Spinal cord injury is an intractable traumatic injury. The most common hurdles faced during spinal cord injury are failure of axonal regrowth and reconnection to target sites. These also tend to be the most challenging issues in spinal cord injury. As spinal cord injury progresses to the chronic phase, lost motor and sensory functions are not recovered. Several reasons may be attributed to the failure of recovery from chronic spinal cord injury. These include factors that inhibit axonal growth such as activated astrocytes, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, myelin-associated proteins, inflammatory microglia, and fibroblasts that accumulate at lesion sites. Skeletal muscle atrophy due to denervation is another chronic and detrimental spinal cord injury-specific condition. Although several intervention strategies based on multiple outlooks have been attempted for treating spinal cord injury, few approaches have been successful. To treat chronic spinal cord injury, neural cells or tissue substitutes may need to be supplied in the cavity area to enable possible axonal growth. Additionally, stimulating axonal growth activity by extrinsic factors is extremely important and essential for maintaining the remaining host neurons and transplanted neurons. This review focuses on pharmacotherapeutic approaches using small compounds and proteins to enable axonal growth in chronic spinal cord injury. This review presents some of these candidates that have shown promising outcomes in basic research ( in vivo animal studies) and clinical trials: AA-NgR(310)ecto-Fc (AXER-204), fasudil, phosphatase and tensin homolog protein antagonist peptide 4, chondroitinase ABC, intracellular sigma peptide, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, matrine, acteoside, pyrvate kinase M2, diosgenin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and fampridine-sustained release. Although the current situation suggests that drug-based therapies to recover function in chronic spinal cord injury are limited, potential candidates have been identified through basic research, and these candidates may be subjects of clinical studies in the future. Moreover, cocktail therapy comprising drugs with varied underlying mechanisms may be effective in treating the refractory status of chronic spinal cord injury.
