36849565|a|OBJECTIVE: Hepatobiliary surgery bares obstacles to informed consent for the patients due to its complexity and related risk of postoperative complications. 3D visualization of the liver has been proven to facilitate comprehension of the spatial relationship between anatomical structures and to assist in clinical decision-making. Our objective is to utilize individual 3D-printed liver models to enhance patient satisfaction with surgical education in hepatobiliary surgery. DESIGN, SETTING: We conducted a prospective, randomized pilot study comparing 3D liver model-enhanced (3D-LiMo) surgical education against regular patient education during preoperative consultation at the department of Visceral, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Of 97 screened patients, undergoing hepatobiliary surgery, 40 patients were enrolled from July 2020 to January 2022. RESULTS: The study population (n = 40) was predominantly of male gender (62.5%) with a median age of 65.2 years and a high prevalence of preexisting diseases. Underlying disease, warranting hepatobiliary surgery, was malignancy in the majority of cases (97.5%). Patients in the 3D-LiMo group were more likely to feel very thoroughly educated and exhibited a higher level of satisfaction following surgical education than the control group (80 vs. 55%, n.s.; 90 vs. 65%, n.s.; respectively). Applying 3D models was also associated with enhanced understanding of the underlying disease with regard to amount (100% vs. 70%, p = 0.020) and location of liver masses (95 vs. 65%, p = 0.044). 3D-LiMo patients also demonstrated enhanced understanding of the surgical procedure (80 vs. 55%, n.s.), leading to better awareness for the occurrence of postoperative complications (88.9, vs. 68.4%, p = 0.052). Adverse event profiles were similar. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, individual 3D-printed liver models increase patient satisfaction with surgical education and facilitate patients' understanding of the surgical procedure as well as awareness of postoperative complications. Therefore, the study protocol is feasible to apply to an adequately powered, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with minor modifications.
