35229837|t|A tri-modal paper device based on flower-like CuSe for the detection of an Alzheimer's disease-associated microRNA marker.
35229837|a|A tri-modal paper device based on flower-like CuSe was developed for monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related miRNA by integrating colorimetric, photothermal and surface-enhanced Raman scattering approaches. Significantly, false-negative signals at the early stage of AD were completely eliminated by using our presented tri-modal strategy.
