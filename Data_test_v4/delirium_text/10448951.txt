10448951|a|An analytical assay is presented for the determination of the enantiomeric composition of galanthamine and related synthetic and natural compounds. (-)-Galanthamine is isolated from Galanthus nivalis and is used in this optical pure form in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Recent efforts for a total synthesis of unichiral (-)-galanthamine is connected with the need for a fast and reliable assay for the determination of the optical purity of the end product, as well as for optimizing and controlling the final steps in total synthesis particularly the asymmetric transformation of narwedine. In this paper the enantiomeric resolution of these compounds is reported employing a capillary electrophoretic system with beta-cyclodextrin derived chiral selectors. With the proposed system a number of galanthamine and narwedine derived analogous compounds could be separated, including 1-bromo- and N-alkyl-substituted compounds.
