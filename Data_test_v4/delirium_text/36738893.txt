36738893|t|lncRNA NEAT1: Key player in neurodegenerative diseases.
36738893|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are the most common causes of disability worldwide. Given their high prevalence, devastating symptoms, and lack of definitive diagnostic tests, there is an urgent need to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as powerful regulatory molecules in neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been reported to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether this is part of a protective or harmful mechanism is still unclear. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of NEAT1 in neurodegenerative diseases and its association with the characteristic aggregation of misfolded proteins: amyloid-beta and tau in AD, alpha-synuclein in PD, mutant huntingtin in HD, and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma in ALS. The aim of this review is to stimulate further research on more precise and effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.
