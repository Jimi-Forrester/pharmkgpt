31277540|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of delirium after spinal surgery in elderly patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 436 patients with spinal surgery from January 2016 to November 2018. According to delirium occurrancy after the operation, 436 cases were divided into two groups:delirium group and non-delirium group. Body mass index(BMI), history of diabetes, history of coronary heart disease, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), preoperative white blood cell count, preoperative erythrocyte volume, preoperative hemoglobin level, operation mode, operation time, anesthesia time, American Association of Anesthesiologists(ANA)(ASA) score, cardiac function grading(NYHA), intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion, intraoperative fentanyl, propofol and Dizocine dosage, postoperative white blood cell count, postoperative erythrocyte volume, postoperative hemoglobin level, postoperative electrolytes (sodium, potassium) and univariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors. The independent risk factors were further investigated by multivariate Logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 cases, 112 elderly patients had postoperative delirium, the incidence of delirium was about 25.68%. The age, preoperative leukocyte count, erythrocyte specific volume, postoperative hemoglobin level in delirium group and non-delirium group were measured. There were significant differences in the postoperative sodium concentration, anesthesia time, ASA score, cardiac function grading, blood loss during operation, postoperative use of Dizocine, history of diabetes, history of coronary heart disease and history of COPD (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the age, ASA score, postoperative Dizocine volume, and COPD history were independent risk factors for the occurrence of delirium after spinal surgery in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: The elderly patients over 72 years old, the ASA score>2, the use of Dizocine analgesic and the patients with COPD are the independent risk factors of postoperative delirium.
