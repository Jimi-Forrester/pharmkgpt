34202490|t|Age-Dependent Hippocampal Proteomics in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer Mouse Model: A Comparative Analysis with Classical SWATH/DIA and directDIA Approaches.
34202490|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the human population, for which there is currently no cure. The cause of AD is unknown; however, the toxic effects of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are believed to play a role in its onset. To investigate this, we examined changes in global protein levels in a hippocampal synaptosome fraction of the Amyloid Precursor Protein swe/Presenelin 1 dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD at 6 and 12 months of age (moa). Data independent acquisition (DIA), or Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragment-ion (SWATH), was used for a quantitative label-free proteomics analysis. We first assessed the usefulness of a recently improved directDIA workflow as an alternative to conventional DIA data analysis using a project-specific spectral library. Subsequently, we applied directDIA to the 6- and 12-moa APP/PS1 datasets and applied the Mass Spectrometry Downstream Analysis Pipeline (MS-DAP) for differential expression analysis and candidate discovery. We observed most regulation at 12-moa, in particular of proteins involved in Abeta homeostasis and microglial-dependent processes, like synaptic pruning and the immune response, such as APOE, CLU and C1QA-C. All proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025777.
