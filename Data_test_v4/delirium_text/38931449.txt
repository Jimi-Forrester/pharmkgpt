38931449|t|Exploring the Role of Ubiquitin-Proteasome System in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.
38931449|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly population. The pathogenesis of PD encompasses genetic alterations, environmental factors, and age-related neurodegenerative processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated that aberrant functioning of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of PD. Notably, E3 ubiquitin ligases serve as pivotal components determining substrate specificity within UPS and are intimately associated with the regulation of various proteins implicated in PD pathology. This review comprehensively summarizes the mechanisms by which E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes modulate PD-associated proteins and signaling pathways, while exploring the intricate relationship between UPS dysfunctions and PD etiology. Furthermore, this article discusses recent research advancements regarding inhibitors targeting PD-related E3 ubiquitin ligases.
