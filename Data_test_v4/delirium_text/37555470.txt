37555470|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are neurological disorders that become more prevalent with age, usually caused by damage or loss of neurons or their myelin sheaths, such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important triggers for neurodegenerative disease development, and mitigation of oxidative stress caused by ROS imbalance in the human body is important for the treatment of these diseases. As a widespread delicious fruit, the raspberry is widely used in the field of food and medicine because of its abundant polyphenols and other bioactive substances. Polyphenols from a wide variety of raspberry sources could alleviate neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to summarize the current roles of these polyphenols in maintaining neurological stability by regulating the composition and metabolism of the intestinal flora and the gut-brain axis signal transmission. Especially, we discuss the therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases of raspberry polyphenols through intestinal microorganisms and ROS signals, by means of summary and analysis. Finally, methods of improving the digestibility and utilization of raspberry polyphenols are proposed, which will provide a potential way for raspberry polyphenols to guarantee the health of the human nervous system.
