32291812|t|Validation of the Brief Assessment of Impaired Cognition and the Brief Assessment of Impaired Cognition Questionnaire for identification of mild cognitive impairment in a memory clinic setting.
32291812|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to validate the Brief Assessment of Impaired Cognition (BASIC) and the Brief Assessment of Impaired Cognition Questionnaire (BASIC-Q) for identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a memory clinic setting. METHODS: A total of 163 sociodemographically matched patients (MCI, n = 42, and dementia, n = 121) and 83 control participants were included in the study. Two instruments were validated: (a) BASIC, including the components self-report, informant report, and two brief cognitive tests, and (b) BASIC-Q, including the components self-report, informant report, and orientation. BASIC can be administered in 5 minutes and BASIC-Q in less than 5 minutes. RESULTS: A high discriminative validity for MCI vs control participants was found for both BASIC (sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.89) and BASIC-Q (sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.88). In comparison, the MMSE had low sensitivity (0.61) and moderate specificity (0.72). All components of BASIC and BASIC-Q contributed significantly to differentiate MCI from control participants. The components of BASIC and BASIC-Q also contributed significantly to differentiate MCI from dementia, except for self-report, which was identical in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both BASIC and BASIC-Q are brief, valid, and effective instruments for identification of patients with possible MCI in a memory clinic setting. Further cross-validation of the instruments in a general practice or primary care setting is needed.
