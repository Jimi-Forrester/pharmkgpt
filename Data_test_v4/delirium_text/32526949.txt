32526949|t|Engineered Extracellular Vesicles/Exosomes as a New Tool against Neurodegenerative Diseases.
32526949|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are commonly generated by intracellular accumulation of misfolded/aggregated mutated proteins. These abnormal protein aggregates impair the functions of mitochondria and induce oxidative stress, thereby resulting in neuronal cell death. In turn, neuronal damage induces chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Thus, reducing/eliminating these abnormal protein aggregates is a priority for any anti-neurodegenerative therapeutic approach. Although several antibodies against mutated neuronal proteins have been already developed, how to efficiently deliver them inside the target cells remains an unmet issue. Extracellular vesicles/exosomes incorporating intrabodies against the pathogenic products would be a tool for innovative therapeutic approaches. In this review/perspective article, we identify and describe the major molecular targets associated with neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the antibodies already developed against them. Finally, we propose a novel targeting strategy based on the endogenous engineering of extracellular vesicles/exosomes constitutively released by cells of the central nervous system.
