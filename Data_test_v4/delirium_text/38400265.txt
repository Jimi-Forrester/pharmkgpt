38400265|t|A Semantic Framework to Detect Problems in Activities of Daily Living Monitored through Smart Home Sensors.
38400265|a|Activities of daily living (ADLs) are fundamental routine tasks that the majority of physically and mentally healthy people can independently execute. In this paper, we present a semantic framework for detecting problems in ADLs execution, monitored through smart home sensors. In the context of this work, we conducted a pilot study, gathering raw data from various sensors and devices installed in a smart home environment. The proposed framework combines multiple Semantic Web technologies (i.e., ontology, RDF, triplestore) to handle and transform these raw data into meaningful representations, forming a knowledge graph. Subsequently, SPARQL queries are used to define and construct explicit rules to detect problematic behaviors in ADL execution, a procedure that leads to generating new implicit knowledge. Finally, all available results are visualized in a clinician dashboard. The proposed framework can monitor the deterioration of ADLs performance for people across the dementia spectrum by offering a comprehensive way for clinicians to describe problematic behaviors in the everyday life of an individual.
