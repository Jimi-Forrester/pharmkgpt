32185450|a|BACKGROUND: Dementias are among the most feared diseases and pose a threat to social and healthcare systems in aging societies. A cure for Alzheimer's or other dementias will not be achieved in the coming years, which makes prevention of cognitive decline and dementia a priority for research and patient-related services. AIM: Summary of evidence for drug and other compound-related prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature review of epidemiological evidence and clinical trials of antidementia drugs, anti-amyloid drugs under development, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, hormone replacement therapy, lithium, ginkgo biloba, and Fortasyn Connect. RESULTS: There is evidence for effects on single endpoints and subgroups for some of the reviewed compounds, but there is no consistent evidence for efficacy. DISCUSSION: There is no sufficient evidence to provide any specific or general recommendation for drug- or compound-related prevention of cognitive decline or dementia. It needs to be recognized that prevention trials on cognitive decline in aging and dementia require large numbers of participants and long follow-up times, which create major challenges with regard to conducting and financing such trials. The current state of evidence also supports the potential role of nonpharmacological approaches in dementia prevention.
