38074065|t|Gallbladder Volvulus Masquerading as Acute Cholecystitis: A Case Report.
38074065|a|Gallbladder volvulus is a rare condition that disproportionately affects elderly women. It occurs in patients with aberrant anatomy that results in a hypermobile gallbladder free to twist on the mesentery, leading to ischemia and necrosis. Due to its close resemblance to cholecystitis, it is difficult to diagnose preoperatively, thus most cases are diagnosed intraoperatively. In our case, a 90-year-old female was transferred to the hospital from an outside facility after being diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. A robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach was used to gain entry into the abdomen. Upon entry, the gallbladder was gangrenous, detached from the liver bed, and twisted on the cystic duct. Despite the presence of severe inflammatory changes and adhesions, the gallbladder was resected without complications, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day five.
