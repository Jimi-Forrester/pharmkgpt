37730895|a|Pathophysiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) and familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) remains poorly known, including the exact role of neuroglia and specifically astroglia, in part because studies of astrocytes in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain samples are scarce. As far as we know, this is the first study of a 3-D immunohistochemical and microstructural analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)- and glutamine synthetase (GS)-positive astrocytes performed in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of human SAD and FAD samples. In this study, we report prominent atrophic changes in GFAP and GS astrocytes in the EC of both SAD and FAD characterised by a decrease in area and volume when compared with non-demented control samples (ND). Furthermore, we did not find neither astrocytic loss nor astrocyte proliferation or hypertrophy (gliosis). In contrast with the astrogliosis classically accepted hypothesis, our results show a highly marked astrocyte atrophy that could have a major relevance in AD pathological processes being fundamental and key for AD mnesic and cognitive alterations equivalent in both SAD and FAD.
