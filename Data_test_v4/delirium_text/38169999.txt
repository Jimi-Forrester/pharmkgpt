38169999|t|Hemothorax After Retroclavicular Approach to the Infraclavicular Region in a Critically Ill Patient: A Case Report.
38169999|a|The retroclavicular approach to the infraclavicular region (RAPTIR) is a recently described locoregional technique for upper limb analgesia that offers advantages over the classic infraclavicular block. RAPTIR is considered an effective and easy-to-perform block associated with few complications and better patient comfort. We present a case of a critically ill patient with thoracic and upper limb trauma. Despite multimodal analgesia, the patient developed delirium and experienced suboptimal pain control. An ultrasound-guided continuous RAPTIR block was performed, resulting in improved pain scores and delirium control. Twenty-four hours post block, the patient presented with dyspnea and chest pain, leading to the diagnosis of hemothorax. Chest computed tomography angiography revealed no vascular damage. The perineural catheter was removed 48 hours after its placement and the patient had a satisfactory recovery without long-term complications. The RAPTIR requires the needle to pass underneath the clavicle's acoustic shadow, putting the structures beneath the clavicle at risk of injury. Cadaver studies have raised concerns about potential vascular complications of the RAPTIR in a noncompressible location. This case highlights, for the first time, a rare but serious complication of the RAPTIR, demonstrating the potential risks of passing the needle through a blind spot.
