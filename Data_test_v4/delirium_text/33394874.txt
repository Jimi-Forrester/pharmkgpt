33394874|t|Effect on Quality of Care of a Delirium Prevention Campaign for Surgical Intensive Care Nurses.
33394874|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an important issue related to mortality in patients treated in intensive care units. LOCAL PROBLEM: Although there are guidelines for preventing delirium, its importance may be overlooked compared with the treatment of physical illness. METHODS: A 2-step delirium prevention campaign (DPC) was implemented and its effects compared (before and after the DPC). INTERVENTIONS: The DPC comprised the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and a checklist for delirium prevention. RESULTS: Hospital mortality declined after the DPC, but there were no significant changes in the incidence and duration of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses led the delirium preventive care intervention. Delirium prevention care may be more effective with policy approaches to progress the DPC.
