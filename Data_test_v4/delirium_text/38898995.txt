38898995|t|The multifaceted functions of DNA-PKcs: implications for the therapy of human diseases.
38898995|a|The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), catalytic subunit, also known as DNA-PKcs, is complexed with the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 to form DNA-PK holoenzyme, which is well recognized as initiator in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair after double strand break (DSB). During NHEJ, DNA-PKcs is essential for both DNA end processing and end joining. Besides its classical function in DSB repair, DNA-PKcs also shows multifaceted functions in various biological activities such as class switch recombination (CSR) and variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) recombination in B/T lymphocytes development, innate immunity through cGAS-STING pathway, transcription, alternative splicing, and so on, which are dependent on its function in NHEJ or not. Moreover, DNA-PKcs deficiency has been proven to be related with human diseases such as neurological pathogenesis, cancer, immunological disorder, and so on through different mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to summarize the latest findings about DNA-PKcs and diseases for better targeting DNA-PKcs, which have shown efficacy in cancer treatment in preclinical models. Here, we discuss the multifaceted roles of DNA-PKcs in human diseases, meanwhile, we discuss the progresses of DNA-PKcs inhibitors and their potential in clinical trials. The most updated review about DNA-PKcs will hopefully provide insights and ideas to understand DNA-PKcs associated diseases.
