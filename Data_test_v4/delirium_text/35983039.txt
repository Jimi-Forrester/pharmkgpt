35983039|a|Immune dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SZ). Despite previous studies showing a broad link between immune dysregulation and the central nervous system of SZ, the exact relationship has not been completely elucidated. With immune infiltration analysis as an entry point, this study aimed to explore the relationship between schizophrenia and the immune system in more detail from brain regions, immune cells, genes, and pathways. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the hippocampus (HPC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and striatum (STR) between SZ and control groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional enrichment analysis showed that three brain regions were closely related to the immune system. Compared with PFC and STR, there were 20 immune-related genes (IRGs) and 42 immune pathways in HPC. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed that the differential immune cells in HPC were effector memory T (Tem) cells. The correlation of immune-related DEGs (IDEGs) and immune cells further analysis showed that NPY, BLNK, OXTR, and FGF12, were moderately correlated with Tem cells. Functional pathway analysis indicated that these four genes might affect Tem by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway and the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis results indicated that these four genes had a high diagnostic ability (AUC=95.19%). Finally, the disease animal model was successfully replicated, and further validation was conducted using the real-time PCR and the western blot. These results showed that these gene expression changes were consistent with our previous expression profiling. In conclusion, our findings suggested that HPC in SZ may be more closely related to immune disorders and modulate immune function through Tem, PI3K-Akt pathway, and neuroactive ligand-binding receptor interactions. To the best of our knowledge, the Immucell AI tool has been applied for the first time to analyze immune infiltration in SZ, contributing to a better understanding of the role of immune dysfunction in SZ from a new perspective.
