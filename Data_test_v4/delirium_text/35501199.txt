35501199|a|INTRODUCTION: In 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, visitor access to acute hospitals including intensive care units (ICUs) was initially barred, followed by a limit of one person per patient for one hour per day. This study explores the care and communication experienced by family members of ICU patients during this time. METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study was conducted at an Australian quaternary hospital. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted using an aide-memoire designed to understand participants' experiences as family of a patient during this time. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed. FINDINGS: Twenty family members of patients in the ICU participated. Three major themes were identified: 'impact of restricting visiting procedures', 'family experiences of communication', and 'care and support'. Inflexible visiting restrictions had a momentous impact on families. Participants objected to having to nominate only two people to visit during the admission and the short visiting time limit. Some family members suffered extreme stress and anxiety during their absence from the bedside. Additional challenges were experienced by rural families, visitors with disabilities, and the young children of patients who were excluded. Communication with clinicians varied. Telehealth was valued by some but not universally embraced. The relationship between staff members and families and involvement in decision-making were unaffected. CONCLUSION: Families experienced significant psychological distress from being separated from their critically ill relatives. Patient care and involvement in decision-making appeared to be unchanged, but communication with staff felt to be lacking. Better alternatives to face-to-face communication must be sought to limit the impact of family separation on mental health. Families are a key link between the patient and clinicians and often play a major role in patient support and recovery after discharge. There is an urgent need to support them and facilitate meaningful engagement despite the obstacles.
