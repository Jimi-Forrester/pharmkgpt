38016800|t|Tomato and Lemon Extracts Synergistically Improve Cognitive Function by Increasing Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels in Aged Mice.
38016800|a|Brain aging, the primary risk factor for cognitive impairment, occurs because of the accumulation of age-related neuropathologies. Identifying effective nutrients that increase cognitive function may help maintain brain health. Tomatoes and lemons have various bioactive functions and exert protective effects against oxidative stress, aging, and cancer. Moreover, they have been shown to enhance cognitive function. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of tomato and lemon ethanolic extracts (TEE and LEE, respectively) and their possible synergistic effects on the enhancement of cognitive function and neurogenesis in aged mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect of TEE and LEE were investigated. For the in vivo experiment, TEE, LEE, or their mixture was orally administered to 12-month-old mice for 9 weeks. A single administration of either TEE or LEE improved cognitive function and neurogenesis in aged mice to some extent, as determined using the novel object recognition test and doublecortin immunohistochemical staining, respectively. However, a significant enhancement of cognitive function and neurogenesis in aged mice was observed after the administration of the TEE+LEE mixture, which had a synergistic effect. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B postsynaptic density protein 95, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and TrkB/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation also synergistically increased after the administration of the mixture compared with those in the individual treatments. In conclusion, compared to their separate treatments, treatment with the TEE+LEE mixture synergistically improved the cognitive function, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity in aged mice via the BDNF/TrkB/ERK signaling pathway.
