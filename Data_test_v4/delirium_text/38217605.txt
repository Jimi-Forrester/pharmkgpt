38217605|t|In Silico Insights into Micro-Mechanism Understanding of Extracts of Taxus Chinensis Fruits Against Alzheimer's Disease.
38217605|a|BACKGROUND: The taxus chinensis fruit (TCF) shows promises in treatment of aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its related constituents and targets against AD have not been deciphered. OBJECTIVE: This study was to uncover constituents and targets of TCF extracts against AD. METHODS: An integrated approach including ultrasound extractions and constituent identification of TCF by UPLC-QE-MS/MS, target identification of constituents and AD by R data-mining from Pubchem, Drugbank and GEO databases, network construction, molecular docking and the ROC curve analysis was carried out. RESULTS: We identified 250 compounds in TCF extracts, and obtained 3,231 known constituent targets and 5,326 differential expression genes of AD, and 988 intersection genes. Through the network construction and KEGG pathway analysis, 19 chemicals, 31 targets, and 11 biological pathways were obtained as core compounds, targets and pathways of TCF extracts against AD. Among these constituents, luteolin, oleic acid, gallic acid, baicalein, naringenin, lovastatin and rutin had obvious anti-AD effect. Molecular docking results further confirmed above results. The ROC AUC values of about 87% of these core targets of TCF extracts was greater than 0.5 in the two GEO chips of AD, especially 10 targets with ROC AUC values greater than 0.7, such as BCL2, CASP7, NFKBIA, HMOX1, CDK2, LDLR, RELA, and CCL2, which mainly referred to neuron apoptosis, response to oxidative stress and inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, etc.Conclusions:The TCF extracts have diverse active compounds that can act on the diagnostic genes of AD, which deserve further in-depth study.
