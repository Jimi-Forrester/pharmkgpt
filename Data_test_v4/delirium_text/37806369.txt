37806369|t|The Importance of Social Behavior in Nonhuman Primate Studies of Aging: A mini-review.
37806369|a|Social behavior plays an important role in supporting both psychological and physical health across the lifespan. People's social lives change as they age, and the nature of these changes differ based on whether people are on healthy aging trajectories or are experiencing neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Nonhuman primate models of aging have provided a base of knowledge comparing aging trajectories in health and disease, but these studies rarely emphasize social behavior changes as a consequence of the aging process. What data exist hold particular value, as negative effects of disease and aging on social behavior are likely to have disproportionate impacts on quality of life. In this mini review, we examine the literature on nonhuman primate models of aging with a focus on social behavior, in the context of both health and disease. We propose that adopting a greater focus on social behavior outcomes in nonhuman primates will improve our understanding of the intersection of health, aging and sociality in humans.
