27763482|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, in which an accumulation of toxic amyloid beta in the brain precedes the emergence of clinical symptoms. AD spectrum consists of presymptomatic, early symptomatic, and symptomatic phase of dementia. At present, no pharmacotherapy exists to modify or reverse a course of AD, and only symptomatic treatments are available. Many elderly patients, diagnosed with multiple medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases) are at increased risk of the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and vascular dementia. Studies have revealed reduced rates of cognitive decline, in elderly patients, who were treated with centrally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) (that have an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier). This article reviews recently published literature, focused on possible protective influence of the centrally active ACE-Is, in the elderly population, at risk for cognitive decline.
