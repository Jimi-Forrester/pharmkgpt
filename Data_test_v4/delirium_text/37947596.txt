37947596|t|Exhaled Nitric Oxide as Biomarker of Type 2 Diseases.
37947596|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived gas molecule which has been studied for its role as a signaling molecule in the vasculature and later, in a broader view, as a cellular messenger in many other biological processes such as immunity and inflammation, cell survival, apoptosis, and aging. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a convenient, easy-to-obtain, and non-invasive method for assessing active, mainly Th2-driven, airway inflammation, which is sensitive to treatment with standard anti-inflammatory therapy. Consequently, FeNO serves as a valued tool to aid the diagnosis and monitoring of several asthma phenotypes. More recently, FeNO has been evaluated in several other respiratory and/or immunological conditions, including allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with/without nasal polyps, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergy. In this review, we aim to provide an extensive overview of the current state of knowledge about FeNO as a biomarker in type 2 inflammation, outlining past and recent data on the application of its measurement in patients affected by a broad variety of atopic/allergic disorders.
