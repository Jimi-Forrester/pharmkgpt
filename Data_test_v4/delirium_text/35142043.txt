35142043|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of hypotensive anesthesia (HA) combined with tranexamic acid (TXA) for reducing perioperative blood loss in simultaneous bilateral total hip arthroplasty (SBTHA). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 183 eligible patients (15 females and 168 males, 44.01 +- 9.29 years old) who underwent SBTHA from January 2015 to September 2020 at our medical center were enrolled for analysis. Fifty-nine patients received standard general anesthesia (Std-GA group), the other 85 and 39 patients received HA with an intraoperative mean arterial pressure between 70 and 80 mmHg (70-80 HA group) and below 70 mmHg (<70 HA group), respectively. TXA was administrated to all patients. Perioperative blood loss (total, dominant, and hidden), transfusion rate and volume, hemoglobin and hematocrit reduction, duration of operation and anesthesia, length of hospitalization, range of hip motion as well as postoperative complications were collected from hospital's electronic records and compared between groups. RESULTS: All patients were followed for more than 3 months. Total blood loss in the two HA groups (1390.25 +- 595.67 ml and 1377.74 +- 423.46 ml, respectively) was significantly reduced compared with that in Std-GA group (1850.83 +- 800.73 ml, P < 0.001). Both dominant and hidden blood loss were dramatically decreased when HA was applied (both P < 0.001). Accordingly, the transfusion rate along with volume in 70-80 HA group (14.1%, 425.00 +- 128.81 ml) and <70 HA group (12.8%, 340.00 +- 134.16 ml) were reduced in comparison with those in Std-GA group (37.3%, 690.91 +- 370.21ml; P = 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively). The maximal hemoglobin and hematocrit reduction in both HA groups were significantly less than those in Std-GA group (both P < 0.001). Of note, 70-80 and <70 HA groups exhibited comparable efficacy with no significant differences between them. Besides, significant difference in duration of surgery was found among groups (P = 0.044 and P < 0.001), while no differences in anesthesia time and postoperative range of hip motion were observed. Regarding complications, the incidence of both acute kidney injury and postoperative hypotension in <70 HA group was significantly higher than that in 70-80 HA and Std-GA groups (P = 0.014 and P < 0.001). Incidence of acute myocardial injury was similar among groups (P = 0.099) and no other severe complications or mortality were recorded. CONCLUSION: The combination of HA with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70-80 mmHg and TXA could significantly reduce blood loss and transfusion during SBTHA, in addition to shortening operation time and length of hospitalization, and with no increase in complications.
