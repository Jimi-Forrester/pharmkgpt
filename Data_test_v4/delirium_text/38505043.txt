38505043|t|Perioperative morbidity and 3-year survival in non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery: a propensity matched analysis.
38505043|a|Background: Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery with spontaneous breathing is rarely utilized, but may have several advantages over standard intubation, especially in those with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities. In this study we evaluate the safety, feasibility, and 3-year survival of thoracoscopic surgery without endotracheal intubation for oncologic and non-oncologic indications. Methods: All consecutive patients [2018-2022] selected for lung resection or other pleural space intervention under local anesthesia and sedation were compared to a cohort undergoing elective thoracoscopic procedures with endotracheal intubation. A propensity-score matched cohort was used to compare perioperative outcomes and 3-year overall survival. Results: A total of 72 patients underwent thoracoscopic surgery without intubation compared to 1,741 who were intubated. Non-intubated procedures included 19 lobectomies (26.4%), 9 segmentectomies (12.5%), 25 wedge resections (34.7%), and 19 pleural or mediastinal resections (26.4%). Non-intubated patients had a lower average body mass index (BMI; 24.6 vs. 27.1 kg/m2, P<0.001) and a higher comorbidity burden. Primary lung cancer was the indication in 30 (41.7%) non-intubated patients. The non-intubated cohort had no operative or 30-day mortality. After propensity-score matching, there was no significant difference in pre-operative factors. In propensity-score matched analysis, non-intubated patients had shorter median total operating room time (109 vs. 159 min, P<0.001) and procedure time (69 vs. 119 min, P<0.001). Peri-operative morbidity was rare and did not differ between intubated and non-intubated patients. There was no significant difference in 3-year survival associated with non-intubation in the propensity-score matched cohorts (95% vs. 89%, P=0.10) or in a Cox proportional hazard model [hazard ratio (HR), 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36-3.67; P=0.81]. Conclusions: Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery is safe and feasible in carefully selected patients for both benign and oncologic indications.
