21155154|t|Electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of delirious mania: a report of 2 patients.
21155154|a|Delirious mania also known as Bell mania is a syndrome of excitement, delirium, and psychosis, of acute onset. We report 2 patients who presented with acute onset of disorientation, aggressive behavior, double incontinence, grandiose ideas, and auditory hallucinations. Results of investigations to rule out organic etiology such as computed tomographic scan of brain, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and biochemical parameters were normal. Creatine kinase levels were only moderately elevated. A provisional diagnosis of delirious mania was made, and patients were empirically started on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) session. Delirium resolved by the second ECT session, unmasking manic symptoms, and recovered completely at the end of sixth ECT session. Prophylactic lithium was started, and both patients continue to be in remission after 1 year. Differential diagnosis of the above clinical presentation includes neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant catatonia. Delirious mania is clinically important owing to the potential for diagnostic confusion and good response to ECTs.
