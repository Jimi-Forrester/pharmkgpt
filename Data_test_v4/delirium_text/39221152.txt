39221152|a|Background and aim: Pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) begin before the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) manifest, with the hippocampus being one of the first affected structures. Current treatments fail to alter AD progression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown potential in improving AD pathology through multi-target mechanisms. This study investigates pathological changes in AD hippocampal tissue and explores TCM active components that may alleviate these changes. Methods: GSE5281 and GSE173955 datasets were downloaded from GEO and normalized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Key functional modules and hub genes were analyzed using Cytoscape and R. Active TCM components were identified from literature and the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. Enrichment analyses were performed on target genes overlapping with DEGs. Result: From the datasets, 76 upregulated and 363 downregulated genes were identified. Hub genes included SLAMF, CD34, ELN (upregulated) and ATP5F1B, VDAC1, VDAC2, HSPA8, ATP5F1C, PDHA1, UBB, SNCA, YWHAZ, PGK1 (downregulated). Literature review identified 33 active components from 23 herbal medicines. Target gene enrichment and analysis were performed for six components: dihydroartemisinin, berberine, naringenin, calycosin, echinacoside, and icariside II. Conclusion: Mitochondrial to synaptic vesicle dysfunction pathways were enriched in downregulated genes. Despite downregulation, UBB and SNCA proteins accumulate in AD brains. TCM studies suggest curcumin and echinacoside may improve hippocampal pathology and cognitive impairment in AD. Further investigation into their mechanisms is needed.
