39092369|t|Effectiveness of Earplugs and Eye Masks on Sleep Quality and Fatigue Among Nonventilated Patients in an Intensive Care Unit.
39092369|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep is a basic physiological need and is imperative for healing and rejuvenation. However, the environment of the intensive care unit (ICU), including loud sounds and bright lights, can undermine patients' sleep quality. AIM: This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of overnight use of earplugs and eye masks to improve sleep quality and potentially influence hemodynamic parameters and mitigate fatigue among nonventilated patients in an ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This experimental study was conducted among 84 nonventilated patients in an ICU. The patients were evenly divided between an intervention group (n=42) and a control group (n=42). The intervention group patients received earplugs and eye masks for three consecutive nights from 10:30 pm to 6:30 am, while the control group patients received routine care. Clinical data, responses to the Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire, and rankings on a numerical fatigue scale were collected before (pretest) and after the intervention each night and the next morning (posttests 1, 2, and 3). RESULTS: The results revealed a significant reduction in fatigue. At pretest, fatigue scores in the study group were 4.19+-1.64. The score was significantly reduced to 3.40+-1.39 at posttest 1 and then to 2.21+-1.00 at posttest 3 (p<0.0001). The sleep quality for the study group showed a significant improvement from the pretest score of 43.73+-8.27 to 60.35+-6.85 at posttest 3 (p<0.001), whereas the control group had slightly worse sleep quality, with 40.64+-8.67 at pretest and 45.63+-6.95 at posttest 3. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous patient monitoring is an essential nursing care activity in ICUs while ensuring good-quality sleep promotes healing and reduces fatigue. Sleep quality can be supported by devices such as earplugs and eye masks to limit undue disturbances in the ICU settings.
