36142879|t|Genetics, Functions, and Clinical Impact of Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) Gene.
36142879|a|Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) has been verified as an important causative factor for early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). PSEN1 is a part of gamma-secretase, and in addition to amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, it can also affect other processes, such as Notch signaling, beta-cadherin processing, and calcium metabolism. Several motifs and residues have been identified in PSEN1, which may play a significant role in gamma-secretase mechanisms, such as the WNF, GxGD, and PALP motifs. More than 300 mutations have been described in PSEN1; however, the clinical phenotypes related to these mutations may be diverse. In addition to classical EOAD, patients with PSEN1 mutations regularly present with atypical phenotypic symptoms, such as spasticity, seizures, and visual impairment. In vivo and in vitro studies were performed to verify the effect of PSEN1 mutations on EOAD. The pathogenic nature of PSEN1 mutations can be categorized according to the ACMG-AMP guidelines; however, some mutations could not be categorized because they were detected only in a single case, and their presence could not be confirmed in family members. Genetic modifiers, therefore, may play a critical role in the age of disease onset and clinical phenotypes of PSEN1 mutations. This review introduces the role of PSEN1 in gamma-secretase, the clinical phenotypes related to its mutations, and possible significant residues of the protein.
