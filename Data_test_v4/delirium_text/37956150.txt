37956150|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to acute organ dysfunction, and delirium is associated with long-term cognitive impairment and a prolonged hospital stay. This retrospective single-center study aimed to investigate the risk factors for delirium in patients with COVID-19 infection receiving treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 111 patients aged >18 years with COVID-19 pneumonia who required oxygen therapy from February 2021 to April 2022 were included. Data on patient demographics, past medical history, disease severity, delirium, and treatment strategies during hospitalization were obtained from electronic health records. Patient characteristics and risk factors for delirium were analyzed. Old age (P < 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), disease severity (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) (P < 0.001), mechanical ventilator support (P < 0.001), neuromuscular blocker use (P < 0.001), and length of stay in the ICU (P < 0.001) showed statistically significant differences on the univariable analysis. Multivariable analysis with backward selection revealed that old age (odds ratio, 1.149; 95% confidence interval, 1.037-1.273; P = 0.008), hypertension (odds ratio, 8.651; 95% confidence interval, 1.322-56.163; P = 0.024), mechanical ventilator support (odds ratio, 226.215; 95% confidence interval, 15.780-3243.330; P < 0.001), and length of stay in the ICU (odds ratio, 30.295; 95% confidence interval, 2.539-361.406; P = 0.007) were significant risk factors for delirium. In conclusion, old age, ICU stay, hypertension, mechanical ventilator support, and neuromuscular blocker use were predictive factors for delirium in COVID-19 patients in the ICU. The study findings suggest the need for predicting the occurrence of delirium in advance and preventing and treating delirium.
