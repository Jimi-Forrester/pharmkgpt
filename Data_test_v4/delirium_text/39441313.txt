39441313|t|The Impact of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia on Individual's Autonomy: a Scoping Review.
39441313|a|The purpose of this study was to identify, map, summarize, and clarify the existing literature on the effects of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) an individual's autonomy across all types of dementia diagnoses. The study aimed to determine whether there is a correlation between BPSD and a decrease in a person's autonomy, as this relationship is important for improving dementia care through effective interventions. To achieve this goal, a scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for scoping reviews and the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews checklist. The inclusion criteria were: (i) population: participants with a clinical diagnosis of any type of dementia; (ii) concept: examining the relationship between one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms or BPSD and the individual's autonomy; (iii) context: the progress of any type and any stage of dementia. The database search yielded 74 records, of which 41 fully met the pre-established eligibility criteria. Most studies in this review focused on participants with Alzheimer's disease and analysed their functional abilities. Most studies in this review showed significant outcomes regarding the impact of BPSD on a person's autonomy. The main BPSD investigated in the studies were depression, apathy, irritability, agitation, aggression, disinhibition, and lability. Apathy had a recurrent association with reduced autonomy in persons with dementia, while depression and psychosis were also found to have an impact on individuals' autonomy.
