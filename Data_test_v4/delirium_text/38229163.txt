38229163|t|Thyroid storm in pregnancy: a review.
38229163|a|BACKGROUND: Thyroid storm is a state of circulating thyroid hormone excess leading to multiorgan dysfunction and systemic decompensation. It typically occurs in the setting of poorly controlled hyperthyroidism and a precipitating illness or event. Management of thyroid storm in pregnancy poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. MAIN BODY: Thyroid storm is a clinical diagnosis characterized by hyperpyrexia, tachyarrhythmias, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric disturbances. However, diagnostic scoring systems have not been validated in pregnancy. Treatment involves specialist consultation, supportive care, and pharmacological options such as anti-thyroid medications, beta blockers, iodine solutions, glucocorticoids, and cholestyramine. These must be adapted and modified in pregnancy to prevent fetal and maternal complications. CONCLUSION: There is a critical need to recognize thyroid storm during pregnancy and initiate proper medical interventions promptly.
