39921532|a|BACKGROUND: The growing demand for surgical resection in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma highlights the need to understand the impact of preoperative frailty on surgical outcomes. The aim of this multicentre cohort study was to investigate the association between frailty and short- and long-term outcomes after hepatic resection among elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: A multicentre analysis was conducted on elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (aged greater than or equal to 70 years) who underwent curative-intent resection at ten Chinese hospitals from 2012 to 2021. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (with frailty defined as a Clinical Frailty Scale score greater than or equal to 5). The primary outcomes were overall survival and recurrence-free survival; secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative 30-day morbidity and mortality, and 90-day mortality. The outcomes between patients with and without preoperative frailty were compared. RESULTS: Of the 488 elderly patients, 148 (30.3%) were considered frail. Frail patients experienced significantly higher 30-day morbidity (68.9% (102 of 148) versus 43.2% (147 of 340)), 30-day mortality (4.1% (6 of 148) versus 0.6% (2 of 340)), and 90-day mortality (6.1% (9 of 148) versus 0.9% (3 of 340)) compared with non-frail patients (all P < 0.010). During a median follow-up of 37.7 (interquartile range 20.4-57.8) months, frail patients demonstrated significantly worse median overall survival (41.6 (95% c.i. 32.0 to 51.2) versus 69.7 (95% c.i. 55.6 to 83.8) months) and recurrence-free survival (27.6 (95% c.i. 23.1 to 32.1) versus 42.7 (95% c.i. 34.6 to 50.8) months) compared with non-frail patients (both P < 0.010). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed frailty as an independent risk factor for decreased overall survival (HR 1.61; P = 0.001) and decreased recurrence-free survival (HR 1.32; P = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes after resection in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings suggest that frailty assessment should be incorporated into perioperative and postoperative evaluation for elderly patients undergoing hepatocellular carcinoma resection.
