23884226|a|Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a cumbersome diagnosis to make in vivo, particularly because of its elusive nature and ability to be a relatively nonspecific 'great mimicker'. Although it frequently has skin manifestations, it often escapes diagnosis due to its angiotrophism and predilection for vessels that are difficult to biopsy (e.g., cerebral vasculature). IVLBCL can involve the vasculature of virtually any organ but typically spares the lymph nodes themselves, and likely due to defects in adhesion molecules, remains stationary in the vessels. Histologically, the malignant lymphocytes are large and mitotically active with prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the cells stain as B-cells. The disease has an overall poor prognosis. Here we present a case of IVLBCL diagnosed at autopsy that presented as a hemorrhagic frontal lobe infarct, which progressed to delirium.
