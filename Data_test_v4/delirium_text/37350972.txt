37350972|a|Background: Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy (GFAP-A) is a recently discovered inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disease, whose clinical characteristics and prognostic factors for short-term outcomes have not been defined yet. We aimed to assess the symptoms, laboratory tests, imaging findings, treatment, and short-term prognosis of GFAP-A. Methods: A double-center retrospective cohort study was performed between May 2018 and July 2022. The clinical characteristics and prognostic factors for short-term outcomes were determined. Results: We enrolled 33 patients with a median age of 28 years (range: 2-68 years), 15 of whom were children (<18 years). The clinical spectrum is dominated by meningoencephalomyelitis. Besides, we also found nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and neuropathic pain in some GFAP-A patients, which were not mentioned in previous reports. And adults were more prone to limb numbness than children. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions involving the brain parenchyma, meninges, and spinal cord, exhibiting patchy, linear, punctate, and strip T2 hyperintensities. First-line immunotherapy, including corticosteroid and gamma globulin, was effective in most patients in the acute phase (P = 0.02). However, patients with overlapping AQP4 antibodies did not respond well to first-line immunotherapy and coexisting neural autoantibodies were more common in women. Additionally, the short-term prognosis was significantly better in children than in adults (P = 0.04). Positive non-neural autoantibodies and proven viral infection were independent factors associated with poor outcomes (P = 0.03, 0.02, respectively). Conclusion: We expanded the spectrum of clinical symptoms of autoimmune GFAP-A. The clinical symptoms and short-term prognosis differed between children and adults. Positive non-neural autoantibodies and proven viral infection at admission suggest a poor short-term prognosis.
