30055132|a|INTRODUCTION: Several neurodegenerative brain proteinopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are associated with cerebral deposition of insoluble aggregates of alpha-synuclein. Previous studies reported a trend toward increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) concentrations in AD compared with other neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls. METHODS: The pathophysiological role of CSF alpha-syn in asymptomatic subjects at risk of AD has not been explored. We performed a large-scale cross-sectional observational monocentric study of preclinical individuals at risk for AD (INSIGHT-preAD). RESULTS: We found a positive association between CSF alpha-syn concentrations and brain beta-amyloid deposition measures as mean cortical standard uptake value ratios. We demonstrate positive correlations between CSF alpha-syn and both CSF t-tau and p-tau181 concentrations. DISCUSSION: Animal models presented evidence, indicating that alpha-syn may synergistically and directly induce fibrillization of both tau and beta-amyloid. Our data indicate an association of CSF alpha-syn with AD-related pathophysiological mechanisms, during the preclinical phase of the disease.
