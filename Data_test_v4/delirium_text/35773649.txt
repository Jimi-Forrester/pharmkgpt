35773649|t|Association between gait features assessed by artificial intelligent system and cognitive function decline in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: study protocol of a multicenter prospective cohort study (ACCURATE-2).
35773649|a|BACKGROUND: Gait disturbances may appear prior to cognitive dysfunction in the early stage of silent cerebrovascular disease (SCD). Subtle changes in gait characteristics may provide an early warning of later cognitive decline. Our team has proposed a vision-based artificial intelligent gait analyzer for the rapid detection of spatiotemporal parameters and walking pattern based on videos of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between gait features assessed by our artificial intelligent gait analyzer and cognitive function changes in patients with SCD. METHODS: This will be a multicenter prospective cohort study involving a total of 14 hospitals from Shanghai and Guizhou. One thousand and six hundred patients with SCD aged 60-85 years will be consecutively recruited. Eligible patients will undergo the intelligent gait assessment and neuropsychological evaluation at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. The intelligent gait analyzer will divide participant into normal gait group and abnormal gait group according to their walking performance in the TUG videos at baseline. All participants will be naturally observed during 1-year follow-up period. Primary outcome are the changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Secondary outcomes include the changes in intelligent gait spatiotemporal parameters (step length, gait speed, step frequency, step width, standing up time, and turning back time), the changes in scores on other neuropsychological tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Stroop Color Word Test, and Digit Span Test), falls events, and cerebrovascular events. We hypothesize that both groups will show a decline in MMSE score, but the decrease of MMSE score in the abnormal gait group will be more significant. CONCLUSION: This study will be the first to explore the relationship between gait features assessed by an artificial intelligent gait analyzer and cognitive decline in patients with SCD. It will demonstrate whether subtle gait abnormalities detected by the artificial intelligent gait analyzer can act as a cognitive-related marker for patients with SCD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04456348 ; 2 July 2020).
