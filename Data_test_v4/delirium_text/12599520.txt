12599520|a|A 76-year-old man with supranuclear palsy, developed consciousness disturbance followed by the treatment of decubitus ulcer in the sacral region using iodoform-gauze. He was semicoma and tachycardia. His pupils were miotic and light reflexes were absent. EEG demonstrated diffuse and random slow activities. Plasma concentration of free iodine was high (151 micrograms/dl), but the other laboratory findings including thyroid functions were normal. He was diagnosed as suffering from iodoform poisoning. The symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of the patient recovered soon after the removal of iodoform-gauze. Although iodoform has been widely used for the treatment of wounds, there are few case reports of its side effects, such as consciousness disturbance, delirium, headache and tachycardia.
