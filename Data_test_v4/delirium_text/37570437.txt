37570437|t|Analysis of Reports Sent to the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System and Published Literature Regarding the Safety of Metformin in the Elderly.
37570437|a|The first line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is metformin. This study aims to investigate the safety profile of metformin and metformin combination medications in older adults using pharmacovigilance data. A literature search was used to identify published clinical studies reporting safety of metformin in older patients (age >= 65 years old), which were then thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, a deep analysis was performed, taking into account suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports submitted to the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System involving patients with 65 years old or older, with metformin or metformin combination as the suspected drug. The results suggest that metformin is safer when used in combination with other antidiabetics than when used in monotherapy. Metformin prolonged-release tablets have a lower incidence of adverse effects compared to treatment with immediate-release metformin tablets. The analysis of the reports showed that "gastrointestinal disorders" was one of the most common classes reported, and metformin alone was the drug most commonly associated with serious gastrointestinal reactions that resulted in hospitalization. In addition, it was the drug most commonly associated with the lactic acidosis ADR. Even though most ADRs in the reports were serious, the majority progressed to cure. According to the analysis performed, the results suggest that the patient's renal function should be considered in order to prevent ADRs associated with metformin, such as lactic acidosis. Therefore, monitoring the safety profile of metformin remains essential to prevent serious ADRs.
