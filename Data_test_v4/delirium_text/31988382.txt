31988382|t|FERARI is required for Rab11-dependent endocytic recycling.
31988382|a|Endosomal transport is essential for cellular organization and compartmentalization and cell-cell communication. Sorting endosomes provide a crossroads for various trafficking pathways and determine recycling, secretion or degradation of proteins. The organization of these processes requires membrane-tethering factors to coordinate Rab GTPase function with membrane fusion. Here, we report a conserved tethering platform that acts in the Rab11 recycling pathways at sorting endosomes, which we name factors for endosome recycling and Rab interactions (FERARI). The Rab-binding module of FERARI consists of Rab11FIP5 and rabenosyn-5/RABS-5, while the SNARE-interacting module comprises VPS45 and VIPAS39. Unexpectedly, the membrane fission protein EHD1 is also a FERARI component. Thus, FERARI appears to combine fusion activity through the SM protein VPS45 with pinching activity through EHD1 on SNX-1-positive endosomal membranes. We propose that coordination of fusion and pinching through a kiss-and-run mechanism drives cargo at endosomes into recycling pathways.
