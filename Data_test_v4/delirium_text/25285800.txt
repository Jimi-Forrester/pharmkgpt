25285800|a|Numerous studies have reported the feasibility and safety of autologous SCT (ASCT) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and mild to moderate renal impairment, but there are limited data in dialysis-dependent patients. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the toxicities and efficacy outcomes of 33  MM patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure who underwent ASCT at our institution from 1998 to 2012. The most common grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities were mucositis (49%), infection (15%) and bleeding (6%). Atrial dysrhythmias (24%) and delirium (30%) of all grades were also common. Hematologic toxicities included febrile neutropenia (88%); and RBC and platelet transfusions were required by 71 and 100% of patients, respectively. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was high at 15%, predominantly caused by septic shock. Response to ASCT was at least VGPR (very good PR) in 50%, PR in 46.2% and stable disease (SD) in 3.8%. Median OS was 5.6 years, comparable to our overall institutional data. Overall, seven patients became dialysis independent. We conclude that ASCT can be an effective treatment for dialysis-dependent MM patients, with high response rates and survival. However, toxicities and a high TRM are observed indicating that further studies are needed to enhance the safety of this approach.
