31422072|a|T2 relaxation time (T2) alterations may serve as markers for early detection and disease progression monitoring by reflecting brain microstructural integrity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the characteristics of T2 alterations during the early stage of AD remain elusive. We explored T2 alterations and their possible correlations with cognitive function in 5XFAD mice at early ages (1, 2, 3, and 5 months of age). Voxel-based analysis (VBA) and region of interest (ROI) analysis showed a decreased T2 in the hippocampus of 2-, 3-, and 5-month-old 5XFAD mice compared to those of controls. The dorsal hippocampal T2 decreased earlier than the ventral hippocampus T2. A significant correlation was observed between Morris water maze (MWM) test cognitive behavior and the dorsal hippocampus T2 in 5XFAD mice. These results indicated that the microstructural integrity of brain tissues, particularly the hippocampus, was impaired early and the impairment became more extensive and severe during disease progression. Furthermore, the dorsal hippocampus is a crucial component involved in spatial cognition impairment in young 5XFAD mice.
