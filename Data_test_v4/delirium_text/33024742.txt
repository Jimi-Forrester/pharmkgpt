33024742|t|A Highly Selective Perylenediimide-Based Chemosensor: "Naked-Eye" Colorimetric and Fluorescent Turn-On Recognition for Al3.
33024742|a|A novel "turn-on" fluorescent probe (PCN) was designed, synthesized, and characterized with perylene tetracarboxylic disimide as the fluorophore and Schiff base subunit as the metal ion receptor. The probe demonstrated a considerable fluorescence enhancement in the presence of Al3+ in DMF with high selectivity and sensitivity. Furthermore, the considerably "off-on" fluorescence response simultaneously led to the apparent color change from colorless to brilliant yellow, which could also be identified by naked eye easily. The sensing capability of PCN to Al3+ was evaluated by the changes in ultraviolet-visible, fluorescence, Fourier transform-infrared, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-resolution mass spectrometry spectroscopies. The linear concentration range for Al3+ was 0-63 muM with a detection limit of 0.16 muM, which allowed for the quantitative determination of Al3+.
