19903021|a|Retinoic acid, an essential factor derived from vitamin A, has been shown to have a variety of functions including roles as an antioxidant and in cellular differentiation. Since oxidative stress and dedifferentiation of neurons appear to be common pathological elements of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, we speculated that retinoic acid may offer therapeutic promise. In this vein, recent compelling evidence indicates a role of retinoic acid in cognitive activities and anti-amyloidogenic properties. Here, we review the actions of retinoic acid that indicate that it may have therapeutic properties ideally served for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
