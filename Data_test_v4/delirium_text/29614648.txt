29614648|a|Amyloid deposits originating from the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and aggregates of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal studies have demonstrated a link between early life exposure to lead (Pb) and latent overexpression of the AbetaPP and MAPT genes and their products via epigenetic reprogramming. The present study monitored APP gene and epigenetic mediators and transcription factors known to regulate it. Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to study the mRNA, miRNA, and proteins levels of AbetaPP, specificity protein 1 (SP1; a transcriptional regulator of amyloid and tau pathway), and epigenetic intermediates namely: DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1, DNMT3a and Methyl- CpG protein binding 2 (MeCP2) in the cerebral cortex of transgenic mice (Knock-in for human MAPT). These transgenic mice were developmentally exposed to Pb and the impact on mRNA, miRNA, and protein levels was scrutinized on postnatal days (PND) 20 and 50. The data revealed a consistent inverse relationship between miRNA and protein levels for SP1 and AbetaPP both in the basal and exposed conditions, which may influence the levels of their corresponding proteins. On the other hand, the relationship between miRNA and protein levels was not correlative for DNMT1 and DNMT3a. MeCP2 miRNA protein levels corresponded only following environmental exposure. These results suggest that developmental exposure to Pb and subsequent AbetaPP protein levels may be controlled through transcriptional regulators and epigenetic mechanisms that mainly involve miRNA regulation.
