38549537|t|A Novel Perspective on PCSK9 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Focus on Amyloid Beta.
38549537|a|The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) belongs to a member of the proprotein convertase (PC) family, which is mainly secreted by the liver and plays a central role in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, PCSK9 plays a multifunctional role in promoting the inflammatory response, inducing cell apoptosis and pyroptosis and affecting tumor homeostasis. The brain is the organ with the richest lipid content. Incidentally, PCSK9 increased in many brain diseases, including brain injury and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, the relationship between PCSK9 and brain diseases has attracted increasing research interest. Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is the central and initial event in the pathogenesis of AD. This study focuses on the effects of PCSK9 on Abeta accumulation in the brain via multiple modalities to explore the potential role of PCSK9 in AD, which is characterized by progressive loss of brain cells by increasing Abeta accumulation. The study also explores the new mechanism by which PCSK9 is involved in the pathogenesis of AD, providing interesting and innovative guidance for the future of PCSK9-targeted therapy for AD.
