30249201|t|Association among handgrip strength, body mass index and decline in cognitive function among the elderly women.
30249201|a|BACKGROUND: The association between handgrip strength combined with body mass index (BMI) and cognitive impairment has not been thoroughly examined. We aimed to investigate whether the relationship between handgrip strength and risk of cognitive impairment is altered by the presence of obesity in older women. METHODS: A total of 544 older women aged over 65 years without cognitive impairment from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) were included in the study. Handgrip strength was classified in a binary manner (weak or strong) or in tertiles and obesity was defined as a BMI >= 25 kg/m2, in accordance with the Asia-Pacific World Health Organization criteria. Incident cognitive impairment was defined as a Korean Mini-mental State Examination (K-MMSE) score of less than 24 after eight years of follow-up. RESULTS: Strong handgrip strength was associated with reduced likelihood of developing cognitive impairment compared to weak handgrip strength in obese women (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 0.23, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.08-0.66). The highest tertile of handgrip strength was associated with reduced risk of incident cognitive impairment (aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.70), compared to the lowest tertile of handgrip strength in obese women, with a significant linear trend (p for trend = 0.016). Furthermore, the highest tertile of handgrip strength was significantly associated with smaller decline in K-MMSE scores compared to the lowest tertile of handgrip strength in obese women (p value = 0.009). There was no association between handgrip strength and incident cognitive impairment in non-obese women. CONCLUSIONS: Strong handgrip strength was associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment among obese women, but not in non-obese women. Handgrip strength may be a simple and useful marker for predicting future cognitive impairment among obese women.
