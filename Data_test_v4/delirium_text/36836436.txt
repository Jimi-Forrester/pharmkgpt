36836436|t|Nontrombotic Pulmonary Embolism: Different Etiology, Same Significant Consequences.
36836436|a|Nontrombotic pulmonary embolism represents the embolization of different types of materials (cells, organisms, gas, foreign material) into pulmonary circulation. The disease is uncommon, and clinical presentation together with laboratory findings are nonspecific. Its pathology is usually misdiagnosed based on imaging findings as pulmonary thromboembolism, but the correct diagnosis is essential because different therapeutic approaches are required. In this context, knowledge of the risk factors associated with nontrombotic pulmonary embolism and specific clinical symptoms is fundamental. Our objective was to discuss the specific features of the most common etiologies of nontrombotic pulmonary embolism, gas, fat, amniotic fluid, sepsis and tumors, to provide assistance for a rapid and correct diagnosis. Because the most common etiologies are iatrogenic, knowledge of the risk factors could be an important tool for prevention or rapid treatment if the disease develops during different procedures. The diagnosis of nontrombotic pulmonary embolisms represent a laborious challenge, and endeavors should be made to prevent development and increase awareness of this disease.
