38451044|a|The study aimed to identify the biomarkers for predicting coronary atherosclerotic lesions progression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Related transcriptome datasets were seized from Gene Expression Omnibus database. IBD-related modules were identified via Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. The 'Limma' was applied to screen differentially expressed genes between stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Subsequently, we employed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and three machine-learning strategies to further screen for candidate hub genes. Application of the receiver operating characteristics curve to quantitatively evaluate candidates to determine key diagnostic biomarkers, followed by a nomogram construction. Ultimately, we performed immune landscape analysis, single-gene GSEA and prediction of target-drugs. 3227 IBD-related module genes and 570 DEGs accounting for AMI were recognized. Intersection yielded 85 shared genes and mostly enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. After filtering through PPI network and multi-machine learning algorithms, five candidate genes generated. Upon validation, CTSD, CEBPD, CYP27A1 were identified as key diagnostic biomarkers with a superior sensitivity and specificity (AUC > 0.8). Furthermore, all three genes were negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells and positively correlated with neutrophils. Single-gene GSEA highlighted the importance of pathogen invasion, metabolism, immune and inflammation responses during the pathogenesis of AMI. Ten target-drugs were predicted. The discovery of three peripheral blood biomarkers capable of predicting the risk of CAD proceeding into AMI in IBD patients. These identified biomarkers were negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells and positively correlated with neutrophils, indicating a latent therapeutic target.
