33118739|t|Analysis of Readmissions to The Intensive Care Unit After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery: Ten Years' Experience.
33118739|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency, causes, and related predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) readmissions after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. METHODS: A total of 4112 consecutive patients who underwent on-pump CABG between January 2007 and January 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as patients with and without ICU readmission. Demographic and perioperative characteristics were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The ICU readmission rate was 3.5%. The most common reasons for ICU readmissions were respiratory (29%) and cardiac (23.4%) complications. The 90-day mortality risk was significantly higher in the readmitted patients than the non-readmitted patients (22.1% and 1.6%, respectively; P<0.001; OR=17.6; 95% CI=11.19-28.41). Severe left ventricular dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, emergency CABG, EuroSCORE II > 5%, cross-clamp time > 35 minutes, postoperative respiratory complications, neurological complications, and cardiac complications showed a strong association with ICU readmissions. CONCLUSION: ICU readmission after CABG is associated with an increased mortality rate. Evaluation, not only of patients' comorbidities, but also of intraoperative conditions and postoperative complications, is important to identify patients at risk for ICU readmission.
