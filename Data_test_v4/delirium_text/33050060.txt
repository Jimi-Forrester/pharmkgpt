33050060|a|(1) Background: Internal medicine (IM) resident physicians need to be trained to care for older adults and transition them safely across care settings. Objective: The study purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of a curriculum in geriatrics assessment and communication skills for transitions of care (TOCs) to IM resident physicians. (2) Methods: IM residents rotated for 4 weeks on the geriatrics consult service at a large public teaching hospital, where they received didactic lectures and clinical experience in consultation and transitional care. The curriculum was designed to meet consensus guidelines for minimum geriatrics competencies expected of IM residents. Previously validated and published assessment tools were used for geriatrics knowledge and attitudes. Locally developed tools were used to directly observe and rate communication skills, and self-assess geriatrics assessment and health literacy skills. The curriculum was evaluated using a quasi-experimental, nonrandomized, single-group pre- and post-test observational design. Data on 31 subjects were collected over 18 months and analyzed using mixed-effects models. (3) Results: Average knowledge scores improved from 65% to 74% (Delta9%, 95% CI 4-13%, p < 0.001). Communication skills improved by an average of 1.15 points (95% CI 0.66-1.64, p < 0.001) on a 9-point scale. Attitudes did not change significantly. Self-rated confidence in geriatrics assessment and health literacy skills improved modestly. (4) Conclusions: The curriculum is effective in teaching basic geriatrics knowledge and communication skills, and increasing self-confidence in geriatrics assessment skills. In settings where an inpatient geriatrics consult service is feasible, the curriculum may be a model for combining geriatrics and TOC training.
