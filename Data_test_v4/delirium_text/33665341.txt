33665341|a|Disclosure of personal disease-related information to asymptomatic adults has been debated over the last century in medicine and research. Recently, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been conceptualized as a continuum that begins with a "preclinical" stage in which biomarkers are present in the absence of cognitive impairment. Studies have begun assessing the safety, psychological, and behavioral effects of disclosing both AD-related genetic and biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired older adults. Yet, debate continues over the appropriate circumstances and methods for returning such information. This article outlines concerns with and rationale for AD biomarker disclosure and summarizes findings from prior studies. Overall, this article aims to describe and respond to key questions concerning disclosure of amyloid positron emission tomography scan results to asymptomatic adults in a research setting. Moving forward, such conditions are important to consider as interventions target the preclinical phase of AD and normalize disclosing biomarker information to cognitively unimpaired persons.
