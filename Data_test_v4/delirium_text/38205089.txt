38205089|t|Acute Viral Encephalitis Mimicking Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in an Immunocompetent Obese Adolescent Girl.
38205089|a|Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is common worldwide and one of the main causes of infectious encephalitis. We report the case of a 13-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department with complaints of recurrent episodes of vague headaches associated with photophobia multiple times within three days before hospitalization. The patient had a history of morbid obesity without other metabolic complications as well as a history of chicken pox in childhood. Doctors subsequently diagnosed her with increased intracranial pressure owing to suspected VZV encephalitis. A lumbar puncture confirmed the presence of VZV in the cerebrospinal fluid. After admitting the diagnosis of VZV encephalitis, doctors treated the patient with intravenous acyclovir and discharged her with oral acyclovir. This case highlights the importance of considering VZV encephalitis in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with headaches, especially in the presence of typical vesicular skin rashes. The case has an unusual complication associated with shingles, which doctors diagnosed early and treated appropriately.
