33002972|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increased focus on patient-centered outcomes, mental health, and delirium prevention makes this review timely and relevant for critical care. RECENT FINDINGS: This review focuses on patient-centered outcomes in the ICU, highlighting the latest research to promote brain health and psychological recovery during and after perioperative critical illness. Topics include sedation in the obese patient, delirium severity assessments, the role of the Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison in the ICU, Post-intensive care syndrome, and the importance of family engagement in the COVID era. SUMMARY: Highlighting new research, such as novel implementation strategies in addition to a lack of research in certain areas like sleep in the ICU may lead to innovation and establishment of evidence-based practices in critical care. Perioperative brain health is multifaceted, and an increase in multidisciplinary interventions may help improve outcomes and decrease morbidity in ICU survivors.
