19638749|a|Prolonged immobilization plays a significant role in neuromuscular abnormalities and complicates the clinical course of a majority of critically ill patients. Immobilization in critically ill patients is associated with significant morbidity and impaired physical function. Overuse of sedation, sleep deprivation, immobility, and the development of delirium are all intensive care unit (ICU) factors that may negatively impact patient outcomes. Ambulation of critically ill patients is difficult with risk for adverse events. However, with a dedicated and trained team and culture change, early ICU mobility can be a feasible and safe process. Early mobility has potential as a therapy to prevent or treat the neuromuscular complications of critical illness. ICU culture can be transformed in a way that leads to improved and more reliable treatments and care, including early activity and mobility.
