37629233|t|Diaphragm Dysfunction and ICU-Acquired Weakness in Septic Shock Patients with or without Mechanical Ventilation: A Pilot Prospective Observational Study.
37629233|a|Sepsis is a risk factor for diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW); however, the impact of mechanical ventilation (MV) on these relationships has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to compare the incidence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-AW in patients with septic shock, with and without MV. We conducted a single-center prospective observational study that included consecutive patients diagnosed with septic shock admitted to the ICU between March 2021 and February 2022. Ultrasound measurements of diaphragm thickness and manual measurements of limb muscle strength were repeated after ICU admission. The incidences of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-AW, as well as their associations with clinical outcomes, were compared between patients with MV and without MV (non-MV). Twenty-four patients (11 in the MV group and 13 in the non-MV group) were analyzed. At the final measurements in the MV group, eight patients (72.7%) had diaphragm dysfunction, and six patients (54.5%) had ICU-AW. In the non-MV group, 10 patients (76.9%) had diaphragm dysfunction, and three (23.1%) had ICU-AW. No association was found between diaphragm dysfunction and clinical outcomes. Patients with ICU-AW in the MV group had longer ICU and hospital stays. Among patients with septic shock, the incidence of diaphragm dysfunction was higher than that of ICU-AW, irrespective of the use of MV. Further studies are warranted to examine the association between diaphragm dysfunction and clinical outcomes.
