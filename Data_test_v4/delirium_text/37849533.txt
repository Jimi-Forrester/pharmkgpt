37849533|t|The Potential of NOD-like Receptor Protein 3 Inflammasome Inhibitors in the Treatments of Diseases.
37849533|a|The invention in this patent application relates to 4-aminopyridazin-6-one derivatives represented generally by formula 1. These compounds are inhibitors of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway and may potentially provide a useful treatment for one or more of the diseases and disorders mediated by NLRP3, including but not limited to immune diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory fever syndromes, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, chronic liver disease, kidney-related disease, hyperoxaluria, lupus nephritis, Type I and Type II diabetes, nephropathy, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and many more.
