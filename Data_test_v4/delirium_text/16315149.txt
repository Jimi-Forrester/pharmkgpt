16315149|t|The TE4D-Cog: a new test for detecting early dementia in English-speaking populations.
16315149|a|BACKGROUND: The screening test usually used to detect dementia (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) is limited by a ceiling effect and high false positive rates, as are other similar instruments. There is therefore a need for a more sensitive and specific screening tool to aid early detection and diagnosis of dementia. OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis of the study was that the TE4D-Cog would be more sensitive and specific than the MMSE in detecting mild cognitive impairment in patients with AD. METHOD: The TE4D (Test for the Early Detection of Dementia from Depression) was adapted from its original German version for English-speaking populations. This new scale (the TE4D-Cog) was then administered together with the MMSE and the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) to 178 people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and 25 cognitively intact comparators. The sensitivity and specificity in detecting dementia of the TE4D-Cog and the MMSE were compared in those with mild dementia and those without dementia. RESULTS: The TE4D-cog had high sensitivity with an acceptable specificity and low false positive rate. It also had good concurrent validity, high inter-rater reliability, good internal consistency and strong predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The TE4D-Cog is easy to administer, short and acceptable. Results are independent of age, gender and level of education. The TE4D-Cog may therefore be a useful alternative to the MMSE as a dementia screening instrument.
