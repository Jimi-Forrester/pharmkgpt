28099462|t|Acute and Chronic Sustained Hypoxia Do Not Substantially Regulate Amyloid-beta Peptide Generation In Vivo.
28099462|a|BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological evidence has linked hypoxia with the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that hypoxia can induce amyloid-beta peptide accumulation through various molecular mechanisms including the up-regulation of the amyloid-beta precursor protein, the beta-secretase Bace1, or the gammagamma-secretase complex components, as well as the down-regulation of Abeta-degrading enzymes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of acute and chronic sustained hypoxia in Abeta generation in vivo. METHODS: 2-3 month-old C57/Bl6J wild-type mice were exposed to either normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (9% O2) for either 4 to 72 h (acute) or 21-30 days (chronic sustained) in a hermetic chamber. Brain mRNA levels of Abeta-related genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR, whereas levels of Bace1 protein, full length AbetaPP, and its C-terminal fragments (C99/C88 ratio) were measured by Western blot. In addition, 8 and 14-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were subjected to 9% O2 for 21 days and levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, full length AbetaPP, and soluble AbetaPPalpha (sAbetaPPalpha) were measured by ELISA or WB. RESULTS: Hypoxia (either acute or chronic sustained) did not impact the transcription of any of the Abeta-related genes in young wild-type mice. A significant reduction of Bace1 protein level was noted with acute hypoxia for 16 h but did not correlate with an increased level of full length AbetaPP or a decreased C99/C83 ratio. Chronic sustained hypoxia did not significantly alter the levels of Bace1, full length AbetaPP or the C99/C83 ratio. Last, chronic sustained hypoxia did not significantly change the levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, full length AbetaPP, or sAbetaPPalpha in either young or aged APP/PS1 mice. DISCUSSION: Our results argue against a hypoxia-induced shift of AbetaPP proteolysis from the non-amyloidogenic to the amyloidogenic pathways. We discuss the possible methodological caveats of previous in vivo studies.
