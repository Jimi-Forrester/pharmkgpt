36364296|t|Advances in Research on Bioactivity, Toxicity, Metabolism, and Pharmacokinetics of Usnic Acid In Vitro and In Vivo.
36364296|a|Lichens are among the most widely distributed plants on earth and have the longest growth cycle. Usnic acid is an abundant characteristic secondary metabolite of lichens and the earliest lichen compound used commercially. It has diverse pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, antioxidant, and photoprotective effects, and promotes wound healing. It is widely used in dietary supplements, daily chemical products (fodder, dyes, food, perfumery, and cosmetics), and medicine. However, some studies have found that usnic acid can cause allergic dermatitis and drug-induced liver injury. In this paper, the bioactivity, toxicity, in vivo and in vitro metabolism, and pharmacokinetics of usnic acid were summarized. The aims were to develop and utilize usnic acid and provide reference for its future research.
