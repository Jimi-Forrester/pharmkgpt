29764286|a|In this paper the environmental evaluation of the separation process of the microalgal biomass Scenedesmus sp. from full-scale photobioreactors was carried out at the Research and Development Nucleus for Sustainable Energy (NPDEAS), with different flocculants (iron sulfate - FeCl3, sodium hydroxide - NaOH, calcium hydroxide - Ca(OH)2 and aluminum sulphate Al2(SO4)3, by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, using the SimaPro 7.3 software. Furthermore, the flocculation efficiency by means of optical density (OD) was also evaluated. The results indicated that FeCl3 and Al2(SO4)3 were highly effective for the recovery of microalgal biomass, greater than 95%. Though, when FeCl3 was used, there was an immediate change in color to the biomass after the orange colored salt was added, typical with the presence of iron, which may compromise the biomass use according to its purpose and Al2(SO4)3 is associated with the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, restricting the application of biomass recovered through this process for nutritional purposes, for example. Therefore, it was observed that sodium hydroxide is an efficient flocculant, promoting recovery around 93.5% for the ideal concentration of 144 mg per liter. It had the best environmental profile among the compared flocculant agents, since it did not cause visible changes in the biomass or compromise its use and had less impact in relation to acidification, eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity, among others. Thus, the results indicate that it is important to consider both flocculation efficiency aspects and environmental impacts to identify the best flocculants on an industrial scale, to optimize the process, with lower amount of flocculant and obtain the maximum biomass recovery and decrease the impact on the extraction, production, treatment and reuse of these chemical compounds to the environment. However, more studies are needed in order to evaluate energy efficiency of the process coupled with other microalgal biomass recovery technologies. In addition, studies with natural flocculants, other polymers and changes in pH are also needed, as these are produced in a more sustainable way than synthetic organic polymers and have the potential to generate a biomass free of undesirable contaminants.
