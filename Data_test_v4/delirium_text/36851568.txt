36851568|t|Mitochondria Dysfunction at the Heart of Viral Myocarditis: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Implications.
36851568|a|The myocardium/heart is the most mitochondria-rich tissue in the human body with mitochondria comprising approximately 30% of total cardiomyocyte volume. As the resident "powerhouse" of cells, mitochondria help to fuel the high energy demands of a continuously beating myocardium. It is no surprise that mitochondrial dysfunction underscores the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular ailments, including those of viral origin such as virus-induced myocarditis. Enteroviruses have been especially linked to injuries of the myocardium and its sequelae dilated cardiomyopathy for which no effective therapies currently exist. Intriguingly, recent mechanistic insights have demonstrated viral infections to directly damage mitochondria, impair the mitochondrial quality control processes of the cell, such as disrupting mitochondrial antiviral innate immune signaling, and promoting mitochondrial-dependent pathological inflammation of the infected myocardium. In this review, we briefly highlight recent insights on the virus-mitochondria crosstalk and discuss the therapeutic implications of targeting mitochondria to preserve heart function and ultimately combat viral myocarditis.
