18433936|t|Association study of the CFH Y402H polymorphism with Alzheimer's disease.
18433936|a|Several reports indicated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) may share similar genetic and pathological features. We postulated that the functional Y402H polymorphism within the CFH gene and unambiguously recognised as a major genetic determinant of AMD, may also be a risk factor of AD. We analysed the association of this polymorphism with the AD risk in both prospective and cross-sectional studies. We were not able to detect such an association whatever the studied population, suggesting that the CFH gene is not a genetic determinant of AD.
