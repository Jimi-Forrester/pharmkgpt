1939490|t|Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid proteins by electrophoresis.
1939490|a|The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a specific ultrafiltrate of plasma, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The study of its proteins and their alteration may yield useful information on several neurological diseases. By using various electrophoretic separation techniques, several CSF proteins have been identified derived from plasma or from brain. Different one-dimensional methods, such as agarose gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, are of similar value in identifying the non-specific oligoclonal bands, which are mainly helpful in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. Isoelectric focusing has a greater resolution than other one-dimensional methods, and it yields additional data about disease-associated proteins occurring in Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Silver-stained two-dimensional gels provide more information about the complex protein composition of CSF, particularly about proteins produced in the brain, such as apolipoprotein E and neuron-specific enolase. For the detection of oligoclonal antibodies, the investigation of protein changes revealed by Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the analysis of CSF immune complexes, two-dimensional electrophoresis has a greater sensitivity.
