33566063|t|Regulation of Reelin functions by specific proteolytic processing in the brain.
33566063|a|The secreted glycoprotein Reelin plays important roles in both brain development and function. During development, Reelin regulates neuronal migration and dendrite development. In the mature brain, the glycoprotein is involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. It has been suggested that Reelin loss or decreased function contributes to the onset and/or deterioration of neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. While the molecular mechanisms underpinning Reelin function remain unclear, recent studies have suggested that the specific proteolytic cleavage of Reelin may play central roles in the embryonic and postnatal brain. In this review, we focus on Reelin proteolytic processing and review its potential physiological roles.
