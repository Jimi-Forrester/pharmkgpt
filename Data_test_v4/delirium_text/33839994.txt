33839994|t|Overview of the Neuroprotective Effects of the MAO-Inhibiting Antidepressant Phenelzine.
33839994|a|Phenelzine (PLZ) is a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting antidepressant with anxiolytic properties. This multifaceted drug has a number of pharmacological and neurochemical effects in addition to inhibition of MAO, and findings on these effects have contributed to a body of evidence indicating that PLZ also has neuroprotective/neurorescue properties. These attributes are reviewed in this paper and include catabolism to the active metabolite beta-phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) and effects of PLZ and PEH on the GABA-glutamate balance in brain, sequestration of reactive aldehydes, and inhibition of primary amine oxidase. Also discussed are the encouraging findings of the effects of PLZ in animal models of stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis, as well other actions such as reduction of nitrative stress, reduction of the effects of a toxin on dopaminergic neurons, potential anticonvulsant actions, and effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neural cell adhesion molecules, an anti-apoptotic factor, and brain levels of ornithine and N-acetylamino acids.
