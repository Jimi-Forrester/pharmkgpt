34193050|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a universal heterogeneous disease that is characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and cancer vaccines are substitute strategies for CRC treatment. When cancer immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy, the CRC treatment would become excessively efficient. One of the compelling immunotherapy approaches to increase the efficiency of CRC therapy is the deployment of therapeutic mAbs, nanobodies, bi-specific antibodies and cancer vaccines, which improve clinical outcomes in patients. Also, among the possible therapeutic approaches for CRC patients, gene vaccines in combination with antibodies are recently introduced as a new perspective. Here, we aimed to present the current progress in CRC immunotherapy, especially using Bi-specific antibodies and dendritic cells mRNA vaccines. For this aim, all data were extracted from Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Elsevier, using keywords cancer vaccines; CRC immunotherapy and CRC mRNA vaccines. About 97 articles were selected and investigated completely based on the latest developments and novelties on bi-specific antibodies, mRNA vaccines, nanobodies, and MGD007.
