38895446|a|The amino acid composition of the diet has recently emerged as a critical regulator of metabolic health. Consumption of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine is positively correlated with body mass index in humans, and reducing dietary levels of isoleucine rapidly improves the metabolic health of diet-induced obese male C57BL/6J mice. However, it is unknown how sex, strain, and dietary isoleucine intake may interact to impact the response to a Western Diet (WD). Here, we find that although the magnitude of the effect varies by sex and strain, reducing dietary levels of isoleucine protects C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice of both sexes from the deleterious metabolic effects of a WD, while increasing dietary levels of isoleucine impairs aspects of metabolic health. Despite broadly positive responses across all sexes and strains to reduced isoleucine, the molecular response of each sex and strain is highly distinctive. Using a multi-omics approach, we identify a core sex- and strain- independent molecular response to dietary isoleucine, and identify mega-clusters of differentially expressed hepatic genes, metabolites, and lipids associated with each phenotype. Intriguingly, the metabolic effects of reduced isoleucine in mice are not associated with FGF21 - and we find that in humans plasma FGF21 levels are likewise not associated with dietary levels of isoleucine. Finally, we find that foods contain a range of isoleucine levels, and that consumption of dietary isoleucine is lower in humans with healthy eating habits. Our results demonstrate that the dietary level of isoleucine is critical in the metabolic and molecular response to a WD, and suggest that lowering dietary levels of isoleucine may be an innovative and translatable strategy to protect from the negative metabolic consequences of a WD.
