37568287|t|Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Guided, Individualized Arterial Blood Pressure Management for Carotid Endarterectomy under General Anesthesia: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.
37568287|a|Background: Differences in blood pressure can influence the risk of brain ischemia, perioperative complications, and postoperative neurocognitive function in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: In this single-center trial, patients scheduled for CEA under general anesthesia were randomized into an intervention group receiving near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-guided blood pressure management during carotid cross-clamping and a control group receiving standard care. The primary endpoint was postoperative neurocognitive function assessed before surgery, on postoperative days 1 and 7, and eight weeks after surgery. Perioperative complications and cerebral autoregulatory capacity were secondary endpoints. Results: Systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) and norepinephrine doses (89 (54-122) vs. 147 (116-242) microg; p < 0.001) during carotid cross-clamping were lower in the intervention group. No group differences in postoperative neurocognitive function were observed. The rate of perioperative complications was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (3.3 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.03). The breath-holding index did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Postoperative neurocognitive function was comparable between CEA patients undergoing general anesthesia in whom arterial blood pressure during carotid cross-clamping was guided using NIRS and subjects receiving standard care. NIRS-guided, individualized arterial blood pressure management resulted in less vasopressor exposition and a lower rate of perioperative complications.
