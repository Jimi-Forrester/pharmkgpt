36861182|t|Mobile emergency department care to nursing home residents: a novel outreach service.
36861182|a|BACKGROUND: Every month, 6% of Danish nursing home residents are admitted to hospital. However, these admissions might have limited benefits and are associated with an increased risk of complications. We initiated a new mobile service comprising consultants performing emergency care in nursing homes. OBJECTIVE: Describe the new service, the recipients of this service, hospital admission patterns and 90-day mortality. DESIGN: A descriptive observational study. MODEL: When an ambulance is requested to a nursing home, the emergency medical dispatch centre simultaneously dispatches a consultant from the emergency department who will provide an emergency evaluation and decisions regarding treatment at the scene in collaboration with municipal acute care nurses. METHOD: We describe the characteristics of all nursing home contacts from 1st November 2020 to 31st December 2021. The outcome measures were hospital admissions and 90-day mortality. Data were extracted from the patients' electronic hospital records and prospectively registered data. RESULTS: We identified 638 contacts (495 individuals). The new service had a median of two (interquartile range: 2-3) new contacts per day. The most frequent diagnoses were related to infections, unspecific symptoms, falls, trauma and neurologic disease. Seven out of eight residents remained at home following treatment, 20% had an unplanned hospital admission within 30 days and 90-day mortality was 36.4%. CONCLUSION: Transitioning emergency care from hospitals to nursing homes could present an opportunity for providing optimised care to a vulnerable population and limiting unnecessary transfers and admissions to hospitals.
