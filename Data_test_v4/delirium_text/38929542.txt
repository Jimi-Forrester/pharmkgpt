38929542|t|Effect of Treatment of the Cholinergic Precursor Choline Alphoscerate in Mild Cognitive Dysfunction: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38929542|a|Background and Objectives: The focus on mild cognitive dysfunction in adults is of great interest, given the risk of worsening and conversion to dementia. Cognitive dysfunctions are characterized by a decrease in the weight and volume of the brain, due to cortical atrophy, with a widening of the grooves and flattening of the convolutions. Brain atrophy that mainly involves the hippocampus is related to the progression of cognitive impairment and the conversion from mild cognitive dysfunction to dementia. Currently, there is no treatment for MCI. Results from a trial on Alzheimer's disease (ASCOMALVA trial) suggest that a sustained cholinergic challenge can slow the progression of brain atrophy typical of Alzheimer's disease associated with vascular damage. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy of choline alphoscerate in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and associated vascular damage, in stabilizing and/or slowing brain atrophy typical of adult-onset cognitive dysfunction, and in improving and/or slowing the progression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with MCI. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial will recruit 60 patients that will be evaluated and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive choline alphoscerate (1200 mg/day) or placebo, for 12 months. Analyses will be carried out using SPSS vesion No 26 the Statistician in charge of this study, with the statistical significance level chosen as 0.05. Discussion: This trial may provide evidence about the efficacy of treatment with the cholinergic precursor choline alphoscerate in patients with mild cognitive dysfunction. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals. Registration: EudraCT number: 2020-000576-38.
