38909512|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease with cognitive impairment occurring in the older people, in which extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid and intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau are regarded as the prevailing theories. However, the exact AD mechanism has not been determined. Moreover, there is no effective treatment available in phase III trials to eradicate AD, which is imperative to explore novel treatments. PURPOSE: A number of up-to-date pre-clinical studies on cognitive impairment is beneficial to clarify the pathology of AD. This review recapitulates several advances in AD pathobiology and discusses the neuroprotective effects of natural compounds, such as phenolic compounds, natural polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, peptide, and lipids, underscoring the therapeutic potential for AD. METHODS: Electronic databases involving PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched up to October 2023. Articles were conducted using the keywords like Alzheimer's disease, pathogenic mechanisms, natural compounds, and neuroprotection. RESULT: This review summarized several AD pathologies and the neuroprotective effects of natural compounds such as natural polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, peptide, and lipids. CONCLUSION: We have discussed the pathogenic mechanisms of AD and the effect natural products on neurodegenerative diseases particularly in treating AD. Specifically, we investigated the molecular pathways and links between natural compounds and Alzheimer's disease such as through NF-kappaB, Nrf2, and mTOR pathway. Further investigation is necessary in exploring the bioactivity and effectiveness of natural compounds in clinical trials, which may provide a promising treatment for AD patients.
