29850945|a|PURPOSE: Acute palliative care units (APCUs) admit patients with cancer for symptom control, transition to community palliative care units or hospice (CPCU/H), or end-of-life care. Prognostication early in the course of admission is crucial for decision-making. We retrospectively evaluated factors associated with patients' discharge disposition on an APCU in a cancer center. METHODS: We evaluated demographic, administrative, and clinical data for all patients admitted to the APCU in 2015. Clinical data included cancer diagnosis, delirium screening, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) symptoms. An ESAS sub-score composed of fatigue, drowsiness, shortness of breath, and appetite (FDSA) was also investigated. Factors associated with patients' discharge disposition (home, CPCU/H, died on APCU) were identified using three-level multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 280 patients, the median age was 65.5 and median length of stay was 10 days; 155 (55.4%) were admitted for symptom control, 65 (23.2%) for transition to CPCU/H, and 60 (21.4%) for terminal care. Discharge dispositions were as follows: 156 (55.7%) died, 63 (22.5%) returned home, and 61 (21.8%) were transferred to CPCU/H. On multivariable analysis, patients who died were less likely to be older (OR 0.97, p = 0.01), or to be admitted for symptom control (OR 0.06, p < 0.0001), and more likely to have a higher FDSA score 21-40 (OR 3.02, p = 0.004). Patients discharged to CPCU/H were less likely to have been admitted for symptom control (OR 0.06, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Age, reason for admission, and the FDSA symptom cluster on admission are variables that can inform clinicians about probable discharge disposition on an APCU.
