33520530|t|Hulk-Like Urine: A Case of Green Urine Caused by Flupirtine Intoxication.
33520530|a|Acute intoxications are common causes of admission to the Emergency Department (ED). Flupirtine is a non-opioid analgesic, originally used for acute and chronic pain. Because of several reports of severe liver toxicity, its use was limited to acute pain in 2013 by the European Medicines Agency. Although withdrawn from the European market in March 2018, there are still flupirtine tablets in many households, and most people are unaware of the hazards they might be facing. A 58-year-old man was admitted to the ED after a suicide attempt with 1 g of flupirtine. He was lethargic and confused but presented no focal neurological deficits or other symptoms, and the rest of his clinical examination was unremarkable. His cerebral CAT and blood chemistry showed no alterations. The only remarkable feature was that he had green urine. After a careful literature search, a similar case was found caused by flupirtine intoxication. After 24 hours of vigilance in the ED, he improved his neurological status and his urine lost part of its greenish color. He was then transferred to the Psychiatric Department, where he presented a complete remission of the clinical alterations. A follow-up check-up showed no permanent deficits.
