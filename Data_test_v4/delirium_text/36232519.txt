36232519|a|Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), resulting majorly from the rupture of intracranial aneurysms, is a potentially devastating disease with high morbidity and mortality. The bleeding aneurysms can be successfully secured; however, the toxic and mechanical impact of the blood extravasation into the subarachnoid space damages the brain cells leading to the release of different damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). DAMPs upregulate the inflammation after binding their cognate receptors on the immune cells and underlies the early and delayed brain injury after aSAH. Moreover, these molecules are also associated with different post-aSAH complications, which lead to poor clinical outcomes. Among these DAMPs, HMGB1 represents a prototypical protein DAMP that has been well characterized for its proinflammatory role after aSAH and during different post-aSAH complications. However, recent investigations have uncovered yet another face of HMGB1, which is involved in the promotion of brain tissue remodeling, neurovascular repair, and anti-inflammatory effects after SAH. These different faces rely on different redox states of HMGB1 over the course of time after SAH. Elucidation of the dynamics of these redox states of HMGB1 has high biomarker as well as therapeutic potential. This review mainly highlights these recent findings along with the conventionally described normal role of HMGB1 as a nuclear protein and as a proinflammatory molecule during disease (aSAH).
