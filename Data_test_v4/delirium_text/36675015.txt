36675015|t|Apigenin: A Therapeutic Agent for Treatment of Skin Inflammatory Diseases and Cancer.
36675015|a|The skin is the main barrier between the body and the environment, protecting it from external oxidative stress induced by ultraviolet rays. It also prevents the entrance of infectious agents such as viruses, external antigens, allergens, and bacteria into our bodies. An overreaction to these agents causes severe skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis, pruritus, psoriasis, skin cancer, and vitiligo. Members of the flavonoid family include apigenin, quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol. Of these, apigenin has been used as a dietary supplement due to its various biological activities and has been shown to reduce skin inflammation by downregulating various inflammatory markers and molecular targets. In this review, we deal with current knowledge about inflammatory reactions in the skin and the molecular mechanisms by which apigenin reduces skin inflammation.
