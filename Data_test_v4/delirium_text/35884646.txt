35884646|t|Electroencephalography Findings in Older Adults Undergoing Geriatric Treatment: A Surrogate for the Outcome?
35884646|a|Background: Comprehensive geriatric care (CGC) is a multidisciplinary approach developed to meet the needs of older patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable information for monitoring the cerebral function. As a surrogate, EEG findings may help to estimate the course of diseases as well as the treatment outcomes. Objectives: Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate EEG findings in older patients receiving CGC. Methods: Patients with an initial EEG in a geriatric unit between May 2019 and April 2020 and treated using the CGC approach were analyzed. EEG abnormalities were defined as generalized (diffuse) background slowing and/or intermittent/persistent focal slowing and/or epileptiform discharges. Assessment results for the Barthel index (BI), Tinetti Balance and Gait test (TBGT), and Timed Up and Go test (TUG) were analyzed in relation to the presence of EEG abnormalities. Results: The study included 398 patients (mean age: 83.0 +- 6.57 years, 69.3% were female). Abnormal EEG patterns were found in 94 (23.6%) patients. Patients with EEG abnormalities had a mean age of 83.4 years versus a mean of 82.8 years in those without (p = 0.451). Based on all calculated scores, the majority of the patients improved after CGC, with a tendency to higher-grade improvements in those without EEG abnormalities (BI: 86.2% vs. 75.5%, p = 0.024; TUG: 53.3% vs. 31.9%, p < 0.001); for TBGT, only a gradual difference was detected (TBGT: 79.9% vs. 71.3%, p = 0.088). The presence of EEG abnormalities was associated with the parameters dementia (36.2% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.010), known epilepsy/seizure (19.1% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001), structural brain lesion (47.9% vs. 19.7%, p < 0.001), and delirium (9.6% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.030) during hospitalization. Conclusions: We found EEG abnormalities in almost a quarter of the patients treated in the geriatric unit. In older patients, the presence of EEG abnormalities is associated with lower improvements after CGC.
