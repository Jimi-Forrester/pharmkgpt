22104062|a|Numbers of patients with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia (ADD) are necessary for care organisation and indicators development as rates of neuroleptics prescription will have a negative risk-benefit balance. Among people of 60 years old and more covered by the general regime (11 millions, 80% of French people), patients with ADD were identified by at least one of the following criteria: long-term affection status for ADD (67.1% of the identified), refunds for Alzheimer medication (67.5%) or hospitalization for ADD (13.6%). In 2009, 353,482 patients were identified using the presence of one criterion in 2009 and 409,021 were identified the same year when criteria were selected over a period of 3 years (2007 to 2009) (prevalence 3.58%, 2.35 to 5.31% between French regions). By extrapolation, their number for whole France was 551,000. Among patients with ADD, 16% had at least three refunds for neuroleptic in 2009 (9.3 to 22.8% according to regions). Increased use of neuroleptic was associated with hospitalisation in a community hospital, the number of general practitioner consultation and an age between 60 and 75 years. At least one liberal psychiatrist consultation decreased the use. This study gives information among ADD patients management and supports prevention program for neuroleptics use.
