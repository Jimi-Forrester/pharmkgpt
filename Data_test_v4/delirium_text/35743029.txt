35743029|t|Platelets and the Role of P2X Receptors in Nociception, Pain, Neuronal Toxicity and Thromboinflammation.
35743029|a|P2X receptors belong to a family of cation channel proteins, which respond to extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). These receptors have gained increasing attention in basic and translational research, as they are central to a variety of important pathophysiological processes such as the modulation of cardiovascular physiology, mediation of nociception, platelet and macrophage activation, or neuronal-glial integration. While P2X1 receptor activation is long known to drive platelet aggregation, P2X7 receptor antagonists have recently been reported to inhibit platelet activation. Considering the role of both P2X receptors and platelet-mediated inflammation in neuronal diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, targeting purinergic receptors may provide a valuable novel therapeutic approach in these diseases. Therefore, the present review illuminates the role of platelets and purinergic signaling in these neurological conditions to evaluate potential translational implications.
