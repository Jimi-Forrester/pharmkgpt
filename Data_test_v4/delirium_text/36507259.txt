36507259|t|Validation of a cerebral hemodynamic model with personalized calibration in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
36507259|a|This study aims to validate a numerical model developed for assessing personalized circle of Willis (CoW) hemodynamics under pathological conditions. Based on 66 computed tomography angiography images, investigations were obtained from 43 acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients from a local neurovascular center. The mean flow velocity of each artery in the CoW measured using transcranial Doppler (TCD) and simulated by the numerical model was obtained for comparison. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) over all cerebral arteries for TCD and the numerical model was 0.88 (N = 561; 95% CI 0.84-0.90). In a subgroup of patients who had developed delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), the ICC had decreased to 0.72 but remained constant with respect to changes in blood pressure, Fisher grade, and location of ruptured aneurysm. Our numerical model showed good agreement with TCD in assessing the flow velocity in the CoW of patients with aSAH. In conclusion, the proposed model can satisfactorily reproduce the cerebral hemodynamics under aSAH conditions by personalizing the numerical model with TCD measurements.
