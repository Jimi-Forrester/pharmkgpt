30919250|t|Targeting Higher Levels of Tau Protein in Ukrainian Patients with Wilson's Disease.
30919250|a|INTRODUCTION: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism in which impaired copper homeostasis may enhance amyloid aggregation and trigger neurodegeneration. Tau protein is a highly soluble microtubule-associated phosphoprotein that plays a significant role in microtubule stabilization; it is also a critical component of neurotoxic degenerative mechanisms. Tau has been shown to be involved in neuronal degeneration and axonal damage, and impaired copper metabolism has been shown to be involved in copper intoxication and thus associated with the processes of neurodegeneration and cellular damage. We have therefore investigated tau protein as a potential marker of axonal impairment and neurodegeneration. METHODS: Patients with WD (n = 47; mean age +- standard deviation [SD] 30.19 +- 7.87 years; mean disease duration : 10.06 +- 3.9 years) and healthy controls (HC; n = 30; mean age 29.6 +- 4.73 years) were tested for serum tau protein levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. All patients were receiving a stable penicillamine dose as ongoing therapy. RESULTS: Patients with WD had a higher mean tau protein level than did the HC (221.7 +- 135.1 vs. 71.14 +- 20.56 pg/mL, p < 0.0001). Patients with WD also had abnormally high serum tau protein levels (t statistic 6.047, 95% confidence interval - 218.2 to - 95.86) in both the cerebral and hepatocerebral forms of WD, with patients having the cerebral form showing a tendency toward higher tau levels. We found that tau protein did not differ according to gender, disease duration, age at disease onset, ceruloplasmin serum level and copper serum level. CONCLUSION: This study provides novel data revealing that high tau protein levels in WD patients could be a potential biomarker for axonal impairment and possible neuronal damage due to tau protein, leading to neurodegeneration in WD.
