36232390|t|The Role of Extracellular Matrix in Human Neurodegenerative Diseases.
36232390|a|The dense neuropil of the central nervous system leaves only limited space for extracellular substances free. The advent of immunohistochemistry, soon followed by advanced diagnostic tools, enabled us to explore the biochemical heterogeneity and compartmentalization of the brain extracellular matrix in exploratory and clinical research alike. The composition of the extracellular matrix is critical to shape neuronal function; changes in its assembly trigger or reflect brain/spinal cord malfunction. In this study, we focus on extracellular matrix changes in neurodegenerative disorders. We summarize its phenotypic appearance and biochemical characteristics, as well as the major enzymes which regulate and remodel matrix establishment in disease. The specifically built basement membrane of the central nervous system, perineuronal nets and perisynaptic axonal coats can protect neurons from toxic agents, and biochemical analysis revealed how the individual glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan components interact with these molecules. Depending on the site, type and progress of the disease, select matrix components can either proactively trigger the formation of disease-specific harmful products, or reactively accumulate, likely to reduce tissue breakdown and neuronal loss. We review the diagnostic use and the increasing importance of medical screening of extracellular matrix components, especially enzymes, which informs us about disease status and, better yet, allows us to forecast illness.
