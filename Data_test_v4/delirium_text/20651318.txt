20651318|a|PURPOSE: The influence of medications and diagnoses on fall risk in psychiatric inpatients was evaluated. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, psychiatric inpatients age 18 years or older with a documented fall that was reported served as study cases. These patients were matched to control patients from the same hospital (1:1) by admission year, sex, and age. Psychiatric diagnoses evaluated included major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, anxiety or neurosis, delirium, personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Medications assessed as independent variables were conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sleep aids, Alzheimer's disease medications, antihistamines, antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, benign prostatic hyperplasia medications, oral hypoglycemic agents, histamine H(2)-receptor blockers, laxatives and stool softeners, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opioids, Parkinson's disease medications, and overactive bladder medications. Univariate logistic regression models were developed for each risk factor to determine its impact on fall risk. RESULTS: A total of 774 patient cases were matched with controls. Most falls occurred on the second day of hospitalization. Medications associated with a higher risk of falls were alpha-blockers, nonbenzodiazepine sleep aids, benzodiazepines, H(2)-blockers, lithium, antipsychotics, atypical antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and laxatives and stool softeners. Patients with a diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease also had an increased risk of falling. CONCLUSION: Alpha-blockers, nonbenzodiazepine sleep aids, benzodiazepines, H(2)-blockers, lithium, atypical antipsychotics, atypical antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers, conventional anti-psychotics, laxatives and stool softeners, and dementia and Alzheimer's disease were significant predictors of inpatient falls in a psychiatric population.
