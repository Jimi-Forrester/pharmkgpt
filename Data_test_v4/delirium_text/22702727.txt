22702727|t|Characterization of Abeta aggregation mechanism probed by congo red.
22702727|a|beta-Amyloid peptide (1) (Abeta) aggregates are toxic to neuron and the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of congo red (CR) on Abeta aggregation is controversial in aqueous solution. Both prevention and promotion of Abeta aggregation have been proposed, suggesting that CR may interact with Abeta of different structural conformations resulting in different effects on Abeta aggregation behavior. CR with these characteristics can be applied to probe the molecular mechanism of Abeta aggregation. Therefore, in the present study, we used CR as a probe to study the Abeta aggregation behavior in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) condition. Our results show that Abeta(40) adopts two short helices at Q15-S26 and K28-L34 in the SDS environment. CR can interact with the helical form of Abeta(40), and the main interaction site is located at the first helical and hydrophobic core region, residues 17-25, which is assigned as a discordant helix region. Furthermore, CR may prevent Abeta(40) undergoing alpha-helix to beta-strand conversion, and therefore aggregation through stabilizing the helical conformation of discordant helix in SDS environment, suggesting that the discordant helix plays a key role on the conformational stabilization of Abeta. Our present study implies that any factors or molecules that can stabilize the discordant helical conformation may also prevent the Abeta aggregation in membrane associated state. This leads to a new therapeutic strategy for the development of lead compounds to AD.
