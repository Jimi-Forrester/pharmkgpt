36618842|a|Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a rare but well-known life-threatening disease. However, reports on NOMI following trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are limited. This report presents a case of NOMI after trans-apical (TA) TAVI with thyroid storm. A 73-year-old man was admitted for a planned aortic valve surgery. Because he had severe aortic calcification and a right renal tumor that was suspected to be malignant, TA-TAVI was performed. At 61 h after TAVI, the patient complained of abdominal pain, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed ischemic necrosis of the cecum to the ascending colon. An ileocecal resection was performed emergently. He was extubated 61 h postoperatively, but severe delirium, high fever, and atrial fibrillation persisted. Due to a history of Basedow's disease, he was diagnosed with thyroid storm and treated with thiamazole and supportive care. The general status gradually improved, and he was transferred to the rehabilitation unit on the 17th postoperative day. We encountered a case of NOMI following TA-TAVI with a thyroid storm, which made it difficult to understand the patient's medical condition. Learning objective: The occurrence of non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia after trans-catheter aortic valve implantation is rare but possible, and a thyroid storm could occur even after a less invasive surgery. It is important to perform postoperative management while considering the possible occurrence of this condition.
