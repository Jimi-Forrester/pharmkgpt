36561000|t|COVID-19 and Dementia; Hard to Forget Yet Haunting Forgetfulness!
36561000|a|The current pandemic has affected almost everyone worldwide. Although the majority of people survive the illness, bad cognitive repercussions might last a long time, resulting in a lower quality of life and disability, particularly in severe cases. We tried to understand and bring together the various possible mechanisms leading to dementia in COVID-19. The link between COVID-19 and dementia will help public health workers plan and allocate resources to provide better care for a community suffering from sickness and improve quality of life. A conceptual framework for care of infected people in the older age group and care of dementia people is proposed.
