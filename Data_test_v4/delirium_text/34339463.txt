34339463|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) and subsyndromal delirium (SSD) among older patients is a common, serious condition associated with a high incidence of negative outcomes. However, there are few accurate methods for the early detection of POD and SSD in surgical wards. This study aimed to identify risk factors of POD and SSD in older patients who were scheduled for surgery in a surgical ward. This was a prospective observational study. Study participants were older than 65 years, underwent urology surgery, and were hospitalized in the surgical ward between April and September 2019. Delirium symptoms were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) on the preoperative day, the day of surgery, and postoperative days 1-3 by the surgical ward nurses. SSD was defined as the presence of one or more CAM criteria and the absence of a diagnosis of delirium based on the CAM algorithm. Personal characteristics, clinical data, cognitive function, physical functions, laboratory test results, medication use, type of surgery and anesthesia, and use of physical restraint and bed sensor were collected from medical records. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors for both POD and SSD. A total of 101 participants (mean age 74.9 years) were enrolled; 19 (18.8%) developed POD (n = 4) and SSD (n = 15). The use of bed sensors (odds ratio 10.2, p = .001) was identified as a risk factor for both POD and SSD. Our findings suggest that the use of bed sensors might be related to the development of both POD and SSD among older patients in surgical wards.
