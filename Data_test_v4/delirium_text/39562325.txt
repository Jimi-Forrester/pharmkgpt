39562325|t|Setting Standards in Residential Aged Care: Identifying Achievable Benchmarks of Care for Long-term Aged Care Services.
39562325|a|BACKGROUND: Benchmarks are an important aspect of quality measurement and evaluation of long-term care services (LTCS) performance. In this study, we aimed to estimate achievable benchmarks of care (ABC ) for 12 quality indicators used to monitor quality of care in Australian LTCS and to identify LTCS characteristics associated with attaining the estimated ABC. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using integrated population-based datasets from long-term care, health care, and social welfare sectors within the Registry of Senior Australians (ROSA) National Historical Cohort. All LTCS residents in 2019 were included. Twelve risk-adjusted quality indicators were examined. ABC were defined as the performance level of top-ranked LTCS, including those sequentially from rank 1 onward, until the combined number of residents included at least 10% of all residents nationally. Indicator-specific ABC for 2019 were estimated using Bayesian-adjusted performance fraction ranking. Logistic regressions estimated LCTS characteristics associated with ABC attainment. RESULTS: 2746 LTCS and 244,419 residents (>=65 years) between 01/01/2019 and 31/12/2019 were included. The cohort was mostly female (65%), with a median age of 86 years, and 56% had dementia. The ABC provide performance targets based on the observed levels of top-performing LTCS. The ABC for premature mortality (0.007%), weight loss hospitalisations (0.1%), pressure injuries (0.2%), delirium and dementia hospitalisations (0.3%), and medication-related adverse events (0.4%) were lower than 1% and attained by 17-59% of LTCS. The ABC for fractures (1.3%), falls (4.0%), and emergency department presentations (5.1%) were between 1-5% and attained by 7-11% of LTCS. The ABC for antipsychotic use (10.7%), chronic opioid use (23.6%), high sedative load exposure (27.4%), and antibiotic use (47.8%) were between 10-50% and met by 6-7% of LTCS. Smaller LTCS and government-owned LTCS were more likely to achieve the ABC compared to medium, larger, private, and not-for-profit LTCS. CONCLUSION: This is the first national estimation of ABC for Australian LTCS, identifying real-world examples of LTCS with relatively better national performance. The ABC are realistic goals for LTCS improvement efforts. They can be leveraged as national standards in quality monitoring reports and incentive programs. Smaller and government LTCS were generally more likely to attain ABC.
