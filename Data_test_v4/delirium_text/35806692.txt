35806692|t|Evaluating the Effect of Tideglusib-Loaded Bioactive Glass Nanoparticles as a Potential Dentine Regenerative Material.
35806692|a|Dental pulp treatment is the least intrusive procedure currently available for preserving the vitality of the pulp. Several studies are underway to improve the bioactivity of pulp capping materials. Tideglusib isa potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and a regenerative drug developed against Alzheimer's disease and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of dental cavities. However, its bioactive properties encapsulated within the nanoparticles as a component of pulp capping material are largely unknown. In this study, tideglusib-loaded bioactive glass nanoparticles were synthesized (tideglusib-BgNPs) and mixed at various concentrations into the calcium silicate cement to testits physiomechanical and bioactivitiescompared with biodentine (control). The calcium silicate cement with 10wgt% tideglusib-BgNPs showed comparable physiomechanical properties to that of biodentine. Additionally, the assessment of cytotoxicity and bioactivity (cell proliferation, wound healing, and cell migration assays) showed increased bioactivity in terms of better wound healing, increased proliferation, and better migration of human dental pulp stem cells than biodentine. These findings suggest new opportunities to use tideglusib-BgNPs in pulp therapy.
