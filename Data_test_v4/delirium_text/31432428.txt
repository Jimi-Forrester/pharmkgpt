31432428|t|Bioinformatics to Tackle the Biological Meaning of Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome.
31432428|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a source of valuable information concerning brain disorders. The technical advances of high-throughput omics platforms to analyze body fluids can generate a huge amount of data, whose translation to biological meaning is a challenge. Several bioinformatic tools have emerged to help handling this data into systems biology comprehensively. Herein, we describe a step-by-step tutorial for CSF proteome data analysis in the set of neurodegenerative diseases using (1) ClueGO+CluePedia tool to perform cluster-based analysis envisioning the characterization of the biological processes dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases; (2) Cytoscape to map disease-specific proteins; (3) SecretomeP to inquire the secretion pathway of CSF proteins; and (4) STRING to identify biological processes modulated by secreted CSF proteins based on protein-protein interaction analysis. This step-by-step guide might help researchers to better characterize disease pathogenesis and to identify putative disease biomarkers.
