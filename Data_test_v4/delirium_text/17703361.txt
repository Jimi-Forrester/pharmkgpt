17703361|t|PS1 expression is downregulated by gonadal steroids in adult mouse brain.
17703361|a|Mutations in presenilin (PS) 1 and PS2 genes are associated with early onset (< or =65 years) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PS1 is involved in gamma-secretase mediated cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), but its regulation is poorly understood. Sex steroids influence APP cleavage pathways resulting in reduced burden of both intra- and extra-cellular nonamyloidogenic products. As gonadal hormones are implicated in AD and their levels change with age, we have analyzed the effect of 17beta-estradiol and testosterone on PS1 expression in the cerebral cortex of adult and old AKR mice of both sexes. Northern and Western-blot analysis revealed that PS1 mRNA and protein expression followed similar pattern of regulation. PS1 expression was downregulated by 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone in the cerebral cortex of females and adult male, but upregulated in old male mice. Such sex-dependent regulation of PS1 expression during aging by gonadal steroids might account for the PS-related brain functions.
