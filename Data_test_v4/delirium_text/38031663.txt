38031663|t|The effect of structured education and phone follow-up on moderate stage Alzheimer's disease caregiving: Outcomes for patient and caregivers.
38031663|a|AIM: To determine the effectiveness of a caregiver education (needs tailored) and telephone follow-up intervention for caregivers of people with moderate stage Alzheimer's disease on caregiver burden, caregiving impact on life, and patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms, dependence on activities of daily living. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study sampled caregivers of people with moderate stage Alzheimer's. Caregivers in the intervention group received education and telephone follow-up over 12 weeks, while the control group received routine care. Caregivers were assessed for burden, changes in life, and patients for neuropsychiatric symptoms, and dependence on daily living activities. RESULTS: The caregiver burden, life changes, distress, and patients' neuropsychiatric symptom scores showed apparent trend toward betterment, but no statistically significant differences were found in study outcomes between the two groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The caregiver need-based, structured education and telephone follow-up intervention was not empirically effective. With the promising effect from this study, managing behavioral symptoms with need-based, structured, and skill-oriented training has the potential to alleviate the burden on caregivers.
