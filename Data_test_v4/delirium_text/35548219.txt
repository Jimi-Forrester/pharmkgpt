35548219|t|A double fluorescent nanoprobe based on phosphorus/nitrogen co-doped carbon dots for detecting dichromate ions and dopamine.
35548219|a|An "on-off-on" fluorescent phosphorus/nitrogen co-doped carbon dot (PNCD) probe was explored for the determination of Cr(vi) and dopamine resulting from the inner filter effect (IFE). The blue-emitting carbon dots with high quantum yields of 25.47% as well as a narrow size distribution were synthesized by a rapid, convenient route using H3PO4 and ethylenediamine as the precursors without any surface passivation. A wide linear region in the range of 7-70 muM with a detection limit of 0.71 muM was achieved for Cr(vi). Moreover, the proper reductants can weaken the inner filter effect to recover the PNCD fluorescence by converting Cr(vi) into Cr(iii). Therefore, the PNCDs/Cr(vi) hybrid could also be used as an "off-on" fluorescent probe for detecting dopamine (DA) with a detection limit of 0.49 muM. Consequently, the PNCDs could serve as a powerful fluorescent bi-sensor for detection of both Cr(vi) and DA in practical applications.
