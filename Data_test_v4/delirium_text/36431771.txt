36431771|a|Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and astragalin, flavonol glucosides, were isolated from the petals of Paeonia lactiflora as neurite outgrowth-promoting compounds. Isoquercitrin, formed by demethylating the B ring of isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside or by adding a hydroxyl group to the B ring of astragalin, was evaluated for neurite outgrowth-promoting activity and was compared with the activities of isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and astragalin. The activities of isorhamnetin, kaempferol, and quercetin, aglycones corresponding to isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, astragalin, and isoquercitrin, respectively, were also evaluated. Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and astragalin showed much stronger neurite outgrowth-promoting activities than the activities of the other tested flavonoids. They exhibited relatively weak anti-oxidant activities and moderate AChE inhibitory activities compared to the activities of the other tested flavonoids. Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and astragalin promoted morphological neurite outgrowth and the expression of neurofilaments induced by NGF in PC12 cells. Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside and astragalin might be candidate compounds as neural differentiation agents in peripheral nerves and functional food ingredients preventing cognitive decline.
