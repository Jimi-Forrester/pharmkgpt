36380007|t|Presepsin levels and COVID-19 severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
36380007|a|Plasmatic presepsin (PSP) is a novel biomarker reported to be useful for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis. During the pandemic, only few studies highlighted a possible correlation between PSP and COVID-19 severity, but results remain inconsistent. The present study aims to establish the correlation between PSP and COVID-19 severity. English-language papers assessing a correlation between COVID-19 and PSP from MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MeSH, LitCovid NLM, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and the World Health Organization (WHO) website, published from January 2020 were considered with no publication date limitations. Two independent reviewers performed data abstraction and quality assessment, and one reviewer resolved inconsistencies. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022325971).Fifteen articles met our eligibility criteria. The aggregate study population included 1373 COVID-19 patients who had undergone a PSP assessment. The random-effect meta-analysis was performed in 7 out of 15 selected studies, considering only those reporting the mean PSP levels in low- and high-severity cases (n = 707).The results showed that the pooled mean difference of PSP levels between high- and low-severity COVID-19 patients was 441.70 pg/ml (95%CI: 150.40-732.99 pg/ml).Our data show that presepsin is a promising biomarker that can express COVID-19 severity.
