35607548|a|There is a growing body of evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is linked with neuropsychiatric complications such as psychosis and delirium in adults. Much less is known about the neuropsychiatric manifestations of this virus in the child and adolescent population. This case series discusses two unique adolescent patients who presented with new-onset mania and psychosis in the context of an otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, which raises several questions about whether and how the virus precipitates mania and psychosis, whether these symptoms are transient or predisposes patients to a chronic psychiatric disorder, and confounding variables that may have contributed to the symptoms. These questions can then be points for future research and longitudinal follow-up that can better improve our knowledge about the relationship between this complicated virus and how it affects children psychiatrically.
