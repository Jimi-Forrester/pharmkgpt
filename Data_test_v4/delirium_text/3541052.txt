3541052|a|Naltrexone, an oral opiate antagonist, was administered to nine patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's-type dementia (ATD) in a two-phase design: an open dose-ranging phase and a double-blind placebo-controlled trial for patients who showed improvement during the open phase. After a three day placebo (baseline) period, patients received increasing doses of naltrexone over two weeks up to a maximum daily dose of 100 mg. Assessments were made at baseline and at daily dose of 5 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg. Testing was done 2 to 4 hours after medication was administered. Any patient who showed cognitive/behavioral improvement on a given dose of naltrexone was then treated with this dosage in a double-blind crossover comparison to placebo. Criteria for inclusion in the double-blind phase consisted of improvement on three behavioral scales and at least one cognitive test on a given dose of naltrexone. Each double-blind phase followed a one-week washout and was two weeks long. Two of the nine patients demonstrated apparent cognitive enhancement on 100 mg daily of naltrexone and were then tested in the double-blind crossover period. Only one of these patients improved during active naltrexone administration. We conclude that the opiate antagonist naltrexone in a dosage range of 5-100 mg daily is not efficacious in ATD.
