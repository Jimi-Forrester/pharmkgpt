37655363|a|BACKGROUND: To date, studies on positron emission tomography (PET) with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) usually included PSP cohorts overrepresenting patients with Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate FDG-PET in a patient sample representing the broad phenotypic PSP spectrum typically encountered in routine clinical practice. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study included 41 PSP patients, 21 (51%) with RS and 20 (49%) with non-RS variants of PSP (vPSP), and 46 age-matched healthy controls. Two state-of-the art methods for the interpretation of FDG-PET were compared: visual analysis supported by voxel-based statistical testing (five readers) and automatic covariance pattern analysis using a predefined PSP-related pattern. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the majority visual read for the detection of PSP in the whole cohort were 74% and 72%, respectively. The percentage of false-negative cases was 10% in the PSP-RS subsample and 43% in the vPSP subsample. Automatic covariance pattern analysis provided sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 83% in the whole cohort. The percentage of false-negative cases was 0% in the PSP-RS subsample and 15% in the vPSP subsample. CONCLUSIONS: Visual interpretation of FDG-PET supported by voxel-based testing provides good accuracy for the detection of PSP-RS, but only fair sensitivity for vPSP. Automatic covariance pattern analysis outperforms visual interpretation in the detection of PSP-RS, provides clinically useful sensitivity for vPSP, and reduces the rate of false-positive findings. Thus, pattern expression analysis is clinically useful to complement visual reading and voxel-based testing of FDG-PET in suspected PSP.   2023 The Authors.
