28565786|t|Expression of S100beta protein in patients with vascular dementia after basal ganglia hemorrhage and its clinical significance.
28565786|a|We investigated the expression levels and clinical significance of S100beta protein in patients with vascular dementia (VD) after basal ganglia hemorrhage. From June 2014 to December 2015, in 138 patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage, we carried out the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients on the day before the operation, the day after the operation and 9 days after the operation. Thirty-two patients (blood vessel group) had cognitive dysfunction and 106 patients (control group) had VD. One hundred thirty-eight cases of healthy adult volunteers were treated in Henan Provincial People's Hospital and were selected in the same period as healthy controls. The expression levels of serum S100beta in the three groups were tested through the ELISA method and the statistical analysis was carried out. In VD patients, the serum S100beta levels of patients were significantly higher than VD and healthy control groups; differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between those without VD after operation and the healthy control group (P>0.05). The correlation analysis was carried out with serum S100beta as an independent variable and mean arterial pressure, BMI, MMSE and MoCA scores as dependent variables. Our results suggest that S100beta expression levels were negatively correlated to the MMSE score (rs=-4.19) and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The length of hospital stay of patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage associated with VD was significantly extended, with a mean of 23.4+-2.8 days. The expression levels of S100beta protein in the serum of patients with VD after basal ganglia hemorrhage was significantly increased and negatively correlated to the cognitive function of patients. Therefore, it can be used as a differential diagnosis indicator of VD after the basal ganglia hemorrhage and treatment target point of the VD.
