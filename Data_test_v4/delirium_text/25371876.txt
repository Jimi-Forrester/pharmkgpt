MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE ANIMALS WERE DIVIDED INTO: (1) Sham, (2) OVX, (3) Sham-tamoxifen (Sham-TAM) and (4) ovariectomized-tamoxifen (OVX-TAM). The animals of the Sham-TAM and OVX-TAM groups were treated by TAM (1 mg/kg; 4 weeks). RESULTS: In Morris water maze, the escape latency in the OVX group was higher than in the Sham group (P < 0.01). The time latency in the animals of OVX-TAM group was lower than that of OVX group (P < 0.01); however, there were no significant differences between the Sham-TAM and Sham groups. In the probe trial, the time spent in target quadrant (Q1) by the animals of OVX group was lower than that of Sham group (P < 0.01). Interestingly, the animals of OVX-TAM group spent more times in target quadrant (Q1) compared with OVX group (P < 0.01). In passive avoidance test, the animals of OVX group had lower latencies to enter the dark compartment compared with the Sham group (P < 0.05). The time latency to enter the dark compartment by animals of OVX-TAM group was higher than in OVX group (P < 0.01). In OVX-TAM group, the total thiol concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) and malondialdehyde concentration was lower (P < 0.01) than OVX group. CONCLUSIONS: These results allow us to propose that TAM enhances learning and memory of OVX rats. The possible mechanism may be due to the protective effects against brain tissues oxidative damage.
