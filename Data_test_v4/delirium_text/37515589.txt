37515589|a|CONTEXT: Recent studies suggest hypothyroidism to be a risk factor for dementia. Based on existing literature, it is unclear if treatment or compliance to treatment is associated with decreased dementia risk in hypothyroidism patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between thyroid hormone medication adherence and risk of dementia. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study following patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism until incidence of dementia, death, or December 31st, 2020, whichever came earliest. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised of 41,554 older adults age 50 and above with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism between 2004 and 2008 who underwent health screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of dementia was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Among 5,188 men (12.5%) and 36,366 (87.5%) women, 2,120 cases of incident dementia were identified. After stratification of the participants according to the interquartile range of the medication possession ratio (MPR), the 4th quartile (highest adherence) showed a 14% lower risk of overall dementia compared to the 1st quartile (lowest adherence) (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.97). No consistent association was observed between the thyroid hormone medication adherence and vascular dementia. After a dichotomous stratification of the MPR, higher MPR (>=0.8) showed a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.99) compared to lower MPR (<0.8). CONCLUSION: Better adherence to thyroid hormone medication may be beneficial in preventing incident dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease, in older adults with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism. Along with the resolution of hypothyroid symptoms and the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, the reduction of dementia risk may be another potential benefit of thyroid hormone medication.
