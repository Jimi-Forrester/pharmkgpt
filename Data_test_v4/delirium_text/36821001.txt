36821001|a|PURPOSE: Qualitative food avoidance is a significant issue in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and restoring diet diversity is an important part of the treatment process. We aimed to identify clinical factors which drive food avoidance and predict its maintenance in patients with AN. METHODS: In this multicentre longitudinal study, 130 female outpatients with AN were assessed before and after 4 months of care in clinical centres specialized in AN. We assessed levels of avoidance of 16 food items, as well as body mass index (BMI), eating disorder severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, emotional state, daily-life functioning, and body image perception. RESULTS: We found that qualitative food avoidance was associated with the clinical severity of AN, anxiety and mood dimensions, and BMI- and body image-related factors. A younger age at onset predicted the maintenance of food avoidance after 4 months of treatment. Additional exploratory analyses suggested that anxiety and negative affect caused food avoidance more than the opposite. CONCLUSION: Qualitative food avoidance can be an indicator of illness severity. During treatment, focusing on reducing anxiety and negative affect may be a way to indirectly reduce food avoidance and restore diet diversity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III: Evidence obtained from cohort or case-control analytic studies.
