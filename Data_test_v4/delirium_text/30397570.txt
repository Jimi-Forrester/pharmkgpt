30397570|t|Pharmacologic management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of major neurocognitive disorder.
30397570|a|Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) occur in approximately 80% of patients who receive a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder. Nonpharmacologic strategies are the first-line treatment for BPSD. However, psychotropic medications are often necessary when nonpharmacologic methods are not effective in treating symptoms that are distressing or are causing behaviors that are dangerous to the patient or the patient's caregivers. The article provides a review of evidence-based recommendations for the use of antipsychotics, cognitive enhancers, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of BPSD. Different pharmacologic approaches are demonstrated through 2 patient cases in which nonpharmacologic management was not effective. The severity of BPSD must be weighed against the risks and benefits of pharmacologic intervention in order to implement an optimal medication regimen.
