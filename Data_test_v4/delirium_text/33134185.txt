33134185|t|Astrocytes, HIV and the Glymphatic System: A Disease of Disrupted Waste Management?
33134185|a|The discovery of the glial-lymphatic or glymphatic fluid clearance pathway in the rodent brain led researchers to search for a parallel system in humans and to question the implications of this pathway in neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that several features of the glymphatic system may be present in humans. In both rodents and humans, this pathway promotes the exchange of interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the arterial perivascular spaces into the brain parenchyma. This process is facilitated in part by aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels located primarily on astrocytic end feet that abut cerebral endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier. Decreased expression or mislocalization of AQP4 from astrocytic end feet results in decreased interstitial flow, thereby, promoting accumulation of extracellular waste products like hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau). Accumulation of pTau is a neuropathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is accompanied by mislocalization of APQ4 from astrocyte end feet to the cell body. HIV infection shares many neuropathological characteristics with AD. Similar to AD, HIV infection of the CNS contributes to abnormal aging with altered AQP4 localization, accumulation of pTau and chronic neuroinflammation. Up to 30% of people with HIV (PWH) suffer from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and changes in AQP4 may be clinically important as a contributor to cognitive disturbances. In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of the potential contributions of NeuroHIV to glymphatic system functions by focusing on astrocytes and AQP4. Although HAND encompasses a wide range of neurocognitive impairments and levels of neuroinflammation vary among and within PWH, the potential contribution of disruption in AQP4 may be clinically important in some cases. In this review we discuss implications for possible AQP4 disruption on NeuroHIV disease trajectory and how HIV may influence AQP4 function.
