33506431|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the current state of evidence for palliative care (PC) in movement disorders, describes the application of PC to clinical practice, and suggests future research directions. RECENT FINDINGS: PC needs are common in persons living with movement disorders and their families from the time of diagnosis through end-of-life and contribute to quality of life. Early advance care planning is preferred by patients, impacts outcomes and is promoted by PC frameworks. Systematic assessment of non-motor symptoms, psychosocial needs and spiritual/existential distress may address gaps in current models of care. Several complementary and emerging models of PC may be utilized to meet the needs of this population. A PC approach may identify and improve important patient and caregiver-centered outcomes. As a relatively new application of PC, there is a need for research to adapt, develop and implement approaches to meet the unique needs of this population.
