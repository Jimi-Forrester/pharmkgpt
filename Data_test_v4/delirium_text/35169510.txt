35169510|t|Neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient with Cushing's syndrome.
35169510|a|Cushing's syndrome (CS) may present with different neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms including anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Psychosis is a rare clinical manifestation, with literature limited to case reports. We report a case of a 52-year-old woman with psychosis secondary to CS who was mis-diagnosed as schizophrenia-like psychosis. This case highlights the importance of considering CS as a differential when ruling out medical causes in patients with either new or persistent mental health disturbances.
