37449595|t|CDP-choline to promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis: the need for a clinical trial.
37449595|a|Multiple sclerosis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that leads to demyelination and neuronal cell death, resulting in functional disability. Remyelination is the natural repair process of demyelination, but it is often incomplete or fails in multiple sclerosis. Available therapies reduce the inflammatory state and prevent clinical relapses. However, therapeutic approaches to increase myelin repair in humans are not yet available. The substance cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine, CDP-choline, is ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells and plays a crucial role in the synthesis of cellular phospholipids. Regenerative properties have been shown in various animal models of diseases of the central nervous system. We have already shown that the compound CDP-choline improves myelin regeneration in two animal models of multiple sclerosis. However, the results from the animal models have not yet been studied in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this review, we summarise the beneficial effects of CDP-choline on biolipid metabolism and turnover with regard to inflammatory and regenerative processes. We also explain changes in phospholipid and sphingolipid homeostasis in multiple sclerosis and suggest a possible therapeutic link to CDP-choline.
