36219188|t|Delivering the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: bioethical considerations
36219188|a|Delivering the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to the patient can cause situations that do not meet the necessary ethical professional standards. We present two cases in which the rash way such a diagnosis was delivered did not respect the principle of nonmaleficence. In both cases the revelation worsened the situation prior to the consultation, causing unfortunate distress to the patient and family. The blunt use of the term "Alzheimer", together with the insufficient information on the characteristics of the affection, seems to have been the main factor that produced a negative emotional impact, revealing an arrogant professional attitude of 'absolute' and unquestionable knowledge, without the necessary equity. A diagnosis of Alzheimer s should be not only truthful but delivered with caution, above all things avoiding a further damage than that already brought about by the disease.
