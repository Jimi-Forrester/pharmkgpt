35914761|t|The Impact of Masticatory Function on Cognitive Impairment in Older Patients: A Population-Based Matched Case-Control Study.
35914761|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the changes in masticatory function and cognitive impairment by analyzing longitudinal data of older Korean patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged over 60 years with dental records between 2005 to 2010 (baseline; T1) and 2014 to 2020 (follow-up; T2) were selected in a single medical center. Based on the dementia diagnosis after T2, the cohort was classified into two groups, the dementia group (n=122) and the control group (n=366). Changes in masticatory function were calculated using the total functional tooth unit (T-FTU) in both groups. The incidence of tooth extraction (%) and the subsequent rehabilitation during the observation period were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the dementia group, T-FTU significantly decreased from T1 to T2 (9.81+-2.78 to 9.11+-3.16, respectively, p=0.008), while no significant change was observed in the control group. During the mean observation period of 9 years, significantly more teeth were extracted and neglected to be prosthetically restored in the dementia group than in the control group. Regression analysis revealed that the number of missing teeth neglected [odds ratio (OR)=1.195, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.025-1.393, p=0.023] and previous alcohol consumption (OR=4.445, 95% CI=1.831-1.795, p=0.001) were the most significant risk factors of dementia. CONCLUSION: There might be a causative relationship between the neglected missing dentition and the onset of dementia.
