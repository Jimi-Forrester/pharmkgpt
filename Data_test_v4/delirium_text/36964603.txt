36964603|t|Residual unabsorbed midazolam: a case report.
36964603|a|BACKGROUND: Oral midazolam is commonly administered to reduce anxiety in children presenting for medical procedures or surgery. It is unclear what volume of medication remains unabsorbed in the stomach when the child presents for anesthetic induction prior to these procedures. The presence of any significant residual medication in the stomach has significant clinical implications in the postoperative period. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year-old white Caucasian boy presented for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy after receiving oral midazolam liquid. Insertion of the endoscope into the stomach revealed a significant amount of unabsorbed medication remaining within the gastric cavity. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware that the sedative effects of midazolam may be present before the medication is fully absorbed. A significant amount of unabsorbed medication may be present in the stomach during medical procedures/surgery. This may continue to be absorbed in the intraoperative and postoperative period, with unwanted clinical effect.
