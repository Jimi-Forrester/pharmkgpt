38903637|t|Assessing the associations of 1,400 blood metabolites with major depressive disorder: a Mendelian randomization study.
38903637|a|Background and objectives: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating health conditions worldwide. Previous studies have reported a link between metabolic dysregulation and MDD. However, evidence for a causal relationship between blood metabolites and MDD is lacking. Methods: Using a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis (MR), we assessed the causal relationship between 1,400 serum metabolites and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The Inverse Variance Weighted method (IVW) was employed to estimate the causal association between exposures and outcomes. Additionally, MR-Egger regression, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods were used as supplementary approaches for a comprehensive appraisal of the causality between blood metabolites and MDD. Pleiotropy and heterogeneity tests were also conducted. Lastly, the relevant metabolites were subjected to metabolite function analysis, and a reverse MR was implemented to explore the potential influence of MDD on these metabolites. Results: After rigorous screening, we identified 34 known metabolites, 13 unknown metabolites, and 18 metabolite ratios associated with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Among all metabolites, 33 were found to have positive associations, and 32 had negative associations. The top five metabolites that increased the risk of MDD were the Arachidonate (20:4n6) to linoleate (18:2n6) ratio, LysoPE(18:0/0:0), N-acetyl-beta-alanine levels, Arachidonate (20:4n6) to oleate to vaccenate (18:1) ratio, Glutaminylglutamine, and Threonine to pyruvate ratio. Conversely, the top five metabolites that decreased the risk of MDD were N6-Acetyl-L-lysine, Oleoyl-linoleoyl-glycerol (18:1 to 18:2) [2] to linoleoyl-arachidonoyl-glycerol (18:2 to 20:4) [2] ratio, Methionine to phosphate ratio, Pregnanediol 3-O-glucuronide, and 6-Oxopiperidine-2-carboxylic acid. Metabolite function enrichment was primarily concentrated in pathways such as Bile Acid Biosynthesis (FDR=0.177), Glutathione Metabolism (FDR=0.177), Threonine, and 2-Oxobutanoate Degradation (FDR=0.177). In addition, enrichment was noted in pathways like Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine Biosynthesis (p=0.04), as well as Ascorbate and Aldarate Metabolism (p=0.04). Discussion: Within a pool of 1,400 blood metabolites, we identified 34 known metabolites and 13 unknown metabolites, as well as 18 metabolite ratios associated with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Additionally, three functionally enriched groups and two metabolic pathways were selected. The integration of genomics and metabolomics has provided significant insights for the screening and prevention of MDD.
