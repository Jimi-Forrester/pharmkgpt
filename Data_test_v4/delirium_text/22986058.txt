22986058|t|Identification of BACE2 as an avid ss-amyloid-degrading protease.
22986058|a|BACKGROUND: Proteases that degrade the amyloid ss-protein (Ass) have emerged as key players in the etiology and potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unlikely that all such proteases have been identified. To discover new Ass-degrading proteases (AssDPs), we conducted an unbiased, genome-scale, functional cDNA screen designed to identify proteases capable of lowering net Ass levels produced by cells, which were subsequently characterized for Ass-degrading activity using an array of downstream assays. RESULTS: The top hit emerging from the screen was ss-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2), a rather unexpected finding given the well-established role of its close homolog, BACE1, in the production of Ass. BACE2 is known to be capable of lowering Ass levels via non-amyloidogenic processing of APP. However, in vitro, BACE2 was also found to be a particularly avid AssDP, with a catalytic efficiency exceeding all known AssDPs except insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). BACE1 was also found to degrade Ass, albeit ~150-fold less efficiently than BACE2. Ass is cleaved by BACE2 at three peptide bonds-Phe19-Phe20, Phe20-Ala21, and Leu34-Met35--with the latter cleavage site being the initial and principal one. BACE2 overexpression in cultured cells was found to lower net Ass levels to a greater extent than multiple, well-established AssDPs, including neprilysin (NEP) and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE1), while showing comparable effectiveness to IDE. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a new functional role for BACE2 as a potent AssDP. Based on its high catalytic efficiency, its ability to degrade Ass intracellularly, and other characteristics, BACE2 represents a particulary strong therapeutic candidate for the treatment or prevention of AD.
