38401847|a|Emerging evidence suggests that vascular pathological changes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The dysfunction of the cerebral vasculature occurs in the early course of AD, characterized by alterations in vascular morphology, diminished cerebral blood flow (CBF), impairment of the neurovascular unit (NVU), vasculature inflammation, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Vascular dysfunction not only facilitates the influx of neurotoxic substances into the brain, triggering inflammation and immune responses but also hampers the efflux of toxic proteins such as Abeta from the brain, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative changes in AD. Furthermore, these vascular changes significantly impact drug delivery and distribution within the brain. Therefore, developing targeted delivery systems or therapeutic strategies based on vascular alterations may potentially represent a novel breakthrough in AD treatment. This review comprehensively examines various aspects of vascular alterations in AD and outlines the current interactions between nanoparticles and pathological changes of vascular.
