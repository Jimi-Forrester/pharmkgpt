39222668|t|Recent advancement in understanding of Alzheimer's disease: Risk factors, subtypes, and drug targets and potential therapeutics.
39222668|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a significant neocortical degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and secondary alterations in white matter tracts. Understanding the risk factors and mechanisms underlying AD is crucial for developing effective treatments. The risk factors associated with AD encompass a wide range of variables, including gender differences, family history, and genetic predispositions. Additionally, environmental factors such as air pollution and lifestyle-related conditions like cardiovascular disease, gut pathogens, and liver pathology contribute substantially to the development and progression of AD and its subtypes. This review provides current updates and deeper insights into the role of these diverse risk factors, categorizing AD into its distinct subtypes and elucidating their specific pathophysiological mechanisms. Unlike previous studies that often focus on isolated aspects of AD, our review integrates these factors to offer a comprehensive understanding of the disease. Furthermore, the review explores a variety of drug targets linked to the neuropathology of different AD subtypes, highlighting the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions. We have further discussed the novel therapeutic options and categorized them according to their targets. The roles of different drug targets were comprehensively studied, and the mechanism of action of their inhibitors was discussed in detail. By comprehensively covering the interplay of risk factors, subtype differentiation, and drug targets, this review provides a deeper understanding of AD and suggests directions for future research and therapeutic strategies.
