39653372|t|Testing 3 Modalities (Voice Assistant, Chatbot, and Mobile App) to Assist Older African American and Black Adults in Seeking Information on Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias: Wizard of Oz Usability Study.
39653372|a|BACKGROUND: Older African American and Black adults are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) and have the lowest level of ADRD health literacy compared to any other ethnic group in the United States. Low health literacy concerning ADRD negatively impacts African American and Black people in accessing adequate health care. OBJECTIVE: This study explored how 3 technological modalities-voice assistants, chatbots, and mobile apps-can assist older African American and Black adults in accessing ADRD information to improve ADRD health literacy. By testing each modality independently, the focus could be kept on understanding the unique needs and challenges of this population concerning the use of each modality when accessing ADRD-related information. METHODS: Using the Wizard of Oz usability testing method, we assessed the 3 modalities with a sample of 15 older African American and Black adults aged >55 years. The 15 participants were asked to interact with the 3 modalities to search for information on local events happening in their geographical area and search for ADRD-related health information. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that, across the 3 modalities, the content should avoid convoluted and complex language and give the possibility to save, store, and share it to be fully accessible by this population. In addition, content should come from credible sources, including information tailored to the participants' cultural values, as it has to be culturally relevant for African American and Black communities. Finally, the interaction with the tool must be time efficient, and it should be adapted to the user's needs to foster a sense of control and representation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, when designing ADRD-related interventions for African American and Black older adults, it proves to be crucial to tailor the content provided by the technology to the community's values and construct an interaction with the technology that is built on African American and Black communities' needs and demands.
