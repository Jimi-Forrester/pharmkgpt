32998670|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease is known as one of the fastest growing lethal diseases worldwide where we have limited and undesired ways for regulating its pathological progress. Now-a-days, nutritional compounds have been using to treat several brain disorders and one of them; vitamins were strongly reported to combat cognition and memory deterioration in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Objective: Here, the author tried to find the precise physiological roles, status, and worth of vitamins in the brain and how exactly these nutrients modulate progression of Alzheimer's disease. Results & Discussion: After a comprehensive and systematic literature review, the author reports that vitamins have various targets in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by which they act to avert the neuronal dysfunction in the disease. Several Alzheimer's disease-associated neurological deficits have reported regulating by vitamin intake but the beneficial effects identified mostly in combinatorial and long-term studies. Conclusion: In this way, the author suggests that it might be better to test vitamins with other components over single vitamin approach for a compatible and synergistic effect as well as using a combination of vitamin with other compounds can target multiple pathways. This strategy may help in deteriorating memory dysfunction and cognition impairment in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
