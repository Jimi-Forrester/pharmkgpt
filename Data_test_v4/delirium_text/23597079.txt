23597079|a|INTRODUCTION: Modulation of the gamma-secretase enzyme, which reduces the production of the amyloidogenic Abeta42 peptide while sparing the production of other Abeta species, is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Satori has identified a unique class of small molecule gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) capable of decreasing Abeta42 levels in cellular and rodent model systems. The compound class exhibits potency in the nM range in vitro and is selective for lowering Abeta42 and Abeta38 while sparing Abeta40 and total Abeta levels. In vivo, a compound from the series, SPI-1865, demonstrates similar pharmacology in wild-type CD1 mice, Tg2576 mice and Sprague Dawley rats. METHODS: Animals were orally administered either a single dose of SPI-1865 or dosed for multiple days. Abeta levels were measured using a sensitive plate-based ELISA system (MSD) and brain and plasma exposure of drug were assessed by LC/MS/MS. RESULTS: In wild-type mice using either dosing regimen, brain Abeta42 and Abeta38 levels were decreased upon treatment with SPI-1865 and little to no statistically meaningful effect on Abeta40 was observed, reflecting the changes observed in vitro. In rats, brain Abeta levels were examined and similar to the mouse studies, brain Abeta42 and Abeta38 were lowered. Comparable changes were also observed in the Tg2576 mice, where Abeta levels were measured in brain as well as plasma and CSF. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that SPI-1865 is orally bioavailable, brain penetrant, and effective at lowering Abeta42 in a dose responsive manner. With this unique profile, the class of compounds represented by SPI-1865 may be a promising new therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
