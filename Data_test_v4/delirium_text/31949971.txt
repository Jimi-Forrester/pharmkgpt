31949971|t|Emphysematous Pyelonephritis Caused by a Giant Fecaloma.
31949971|a|Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a gas-producing necrotizing bacterial infection that involves the renal parenchyma and perirenal tissue. It is a life-threatening condition that requires a high index of suspicion, an early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment. Rapid progression to septic shock may occur. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of obstructive EPN caused by a giant fecaloma. The patient was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics, in addition to fecaloma evacuation using fleet enemas and oral laxatives. This shows how fecal impaction, a common pathology in routine clinical practice, can cause some serious complications if left untreated, including extrinsic ureteral compression.
