25544955|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effects of different local anesthetic solutions on postoperative pain of anal surgery in adult patients. METHOD: In this randomized double-blind prospective clinical trial, 60 adult patients (18 to 60 years old) with physical status class I and class II that had been brought to a university hospital operating room for fistula anal surgery with spinal anesthesia were selected. Patients were randomly divided into 4 equal groups according to table of random numbers (created by Random Allocation Software 1). Group 1 received 3 mL of normal saline, group 2, 1 mL of normal saline plus 2 mL of bupivacaine 0.5%, group 3, 1 mL of ketamine plus 2 mL of bupivacaine 0.5%, and group 4, no infiltration. Intensity of pain in patients was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS) at 0 (transfer to ward), 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Time interval to administration of drugs and overall dose of drugs were measured in 4 groups. RESULTS: Mean level of pain was the lowest in group 3 at all occasions with a significant difference, followed by groups 2, 4, and lastly 1 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, groups 2 and 3 compared to groups 1 and 4 had the least overall dose of analgesics and requested them the latest, with a significant difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia (1 mL of ketamine plus 2 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% or 1 mL of normal saline plus 2 mL of bupivacaine 0.5%) combined with spinal anesthesia reduces postoperative pain and leads to greater comfort in recovering patients.
