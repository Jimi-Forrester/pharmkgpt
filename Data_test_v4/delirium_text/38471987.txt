38471987|a|Cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation is the physiologic process whereby blood supply to the brain is kept constant over a range of cerebral perfusion pressures ensuring a constant supply of metabolic substrate. Clinical methods for monitoring CBF autoregulation were first developed for neurocritically ill patients and have been extended to surgical patients. These methods are based on measuring the relationship between cerebral perfusion pressure and surrogates of CBF or cerebral blood volume (CBV) at low frequencies (<0.05 Hz) of autoregulation using time or frequency domain analyses. Initially intracranial pressure monitoring or transcranial Doppler assessment of CBF velocity was utilised relative to changes in cerebral perfusion pressure or mean arterial pressure. A more clinically practical approach utilising filtered signals from near infrared spectroscopy monitors as an estimate of CBF has been validated. In contrast to the traditional teaching that 50 mm Hg is the autoregulation threshold, these investigations have found wide interindividual variability of the lower limit of autoregulation ranging from 40 to 90 mm Hg in adults and 20-55 mm Hg in children. Observational data have linked impaired CBF autoregulation metrics to adverse outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, and in surgical patients. CBF autoregulation monitoring has been described in both cardiac and noncardiac surgery. Data from a single-centre randomised study in adults found that targeting arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass to above the lower limit of autoregulation led to a reduction of postoperative delirium and improved memory 1 month after surgery compared with usual care. Together, the growing body of evidence suggests that monitoring CBF autoregulation provides prognostic information on eventual patient outcomes and offers potential for therapeutic intervention. For surgical patients, personalised blood pressure management based on CBF autoregulation data holds promise as a strategy to improve patient neurocognitive outcomes.
