16963588|a|The authors utilized a family-based, case-control study to identify factors predicting subjective memory complaint in relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients. The authors ascertained 1,499 cognitively healthy relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients at 15 centers, who contributed demographic and medical information, including self-assessment of memory. First-degree relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients reported subjective memory complaint more than spouses of Alzheimer's disease patients. Relatives with past depression symptoms endorsed subjective memory complaint more than those without such history. Clinicians counseling family members of Alzheimer's disease patients who express subjective memory complaint should first evaluate cognition. If cognition is intact, depression should be considered.
