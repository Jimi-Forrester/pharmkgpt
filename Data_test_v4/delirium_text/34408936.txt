34408936|t|An Unusual Autopsy Case of Artificial Conservation of a Corpse in a Domestic Setting.
34408936|a|Decomposition, or the process by which a corpse turns into a skeleton due to the destruction of the soft tissue, is very complicated. Humankind has used various methods to inhibit and delay decomposition changes over centuries. It includes mummification, embalming, and preservation of the body under low temperatures. In this report, we present a criminal case involving the conservation of the body using a paste made from clarified butter and turmeric powder, with the body simultaneously kept in an air-conditioned room. The body acquired a stiff, leathery appearance consistent with mummification. The subjacent layers of the muscles had a soft consistency and specified adipocere changes. Adipocere changes were present in most internal organs. This case report involves a certified hospital death with no disagreement over the after-death interval or the cause of death during the postmortem examination. The postmortem changes resulted from a unique method of body preservation: a combination of lower temperature (by air conditioner) and the application of clarified butter mixed with turmeric powder.
