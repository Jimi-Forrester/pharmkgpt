34800383|t|Noninvasive Ventilation and Oxygenation Strategies.
34800383|a|Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) provides respiratory support without the use of invasive ventilation with techniques that do not bypass the upper airway. NIV is particularly attractive given its associated reduced risk of complications associated with intubation. Available NIV modes include nasal cannula, simple mask, nonrebreather, high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure. Acute exacerbation of COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and COVID-19 are conditions for which NIV has shown to be beneficial, whereas there is no consensus among the use of NIV in trauma patients and ARDS.
