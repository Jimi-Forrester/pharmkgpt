23938328|t|Differential characteristics in polypathological inpatients in internal medicine departments and acute geriatric units: the PLUPAR study.
23938328|a|AIM: To determine whether there are any differences between polypathological patients attended in Internal Medicine departments and acute Geriatric units. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicenter study was performed. Polypathological patients admitted to an internal medicine or geriatrics department and attended by investigators consecutively between March 1 and June 30, 2011 were included. Data of age, sex, living in a nursing residence or at home, diagnostic category, use of chronic medication, Charlson, Barthel and Lawton-Brody indexes, Pfeiffer questionnaire, delirium during last admission, need of a caregiver, and having a caregiver were gathered. The need of a caregiver was defined when the Barthel index was<60 or Pfeiffer questionnaire >= 3 errors. RESULTS: 471 polypathological patients, 337 from internal medicine and 144 from geriatrics units were included. Geriatrics inpatients were older and more frequently female. Cardiac (62.1% vs 49.6%; p=.01), digestive (8.3% vs 3.0%; p=.04) and oncohematological diseases (30.2% vs 18.8%; p=.01) were more frequent in patients of internal medicine units and neurological (66.2% vs 40.2%; p<.001) and locomotive ones (39.1% vs 20.4%; p<.001) in geriatrics inpatients. Charlson index was higher for internal medicine inpatients [4.0(2.1) vs 3.5(2.1); p=.04). Patients attended in geriatrics scored higher in Pfeiffer questionnaire [5.5(3.7) vs 3.8(3.3); p<.001], and lower in Barthel [38.8(32.5) vs 61.2(34.3); p=.001] and Lawton-Brody indexes [0.9(1.6) vs 3.0(2.9); p<.001], and more frequently needed a caregiver (87.8% vs 53.6%; p<.001) and had it. CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in disease profile and functional and cognitive situation between polypathological patients of internal medicine and geriatrics departments.
