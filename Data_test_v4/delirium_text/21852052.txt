21852052|t|The in vivo functions of a histidine-rich protein Hpn in Helicobacter pylori: linking gastric and Alzheimer's diseases together?
21852052|a|Helicobacter pylori causes such gastric diseases as gastritis, peptic ulcerations, gastric cancer and MALT lymphoma. Hpn is a histidine-rich protein abundant in this bacterium and forms amyloid-like oligomers in physiologically relevant conditions. Here we proposed the in vivo functions of this protein with relevance to its physical locations. The collective evidence presented here shed some light on the pathologic mechanisms of H. pylori infections, with emphasis on the bacterial colonization in the gastric environment, pathological effects to the gastric epithelial cells and the possible link to Alzheimer's disease.
