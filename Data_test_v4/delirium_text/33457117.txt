33457117|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by several risk factors leading to dementia. It's diagnosis usually depends on clinical presentation and certain biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The brain has a high content of cholesterol and the metabolism of cholesterol in the brain can be associated with beta-amyloid plaques formation, which is seen in Alzheimer's disease. Given these implications, we studied if plasma lipid levels can vary in Alzheimer's disease and if these can be used as biomarkers to diagnose and predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Certain mutations in the brain cholesterol transport receptors and proteins and their association with Alzheimer's were also studied. This systematic review abides by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched multiple databases, such as Pubmed, Google Scholar, Pubmed central, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Medline with the help of keywords like Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, plasma lipid biomarkers, cholesterol, brain cholesterol metabolism separately and in combination with each other. We collected 49 quality appraised articles on the association between plasma lipids and Alzheimer's disease and the genetic mutations in alleles related to cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer's disease by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on the finding of the studies reviewed, we found an association between plasma lipids, polymorphisms in genes associated with cholesterol transport, and Alzheimer's disease. Increased serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), sphingolipids, 24S hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), 27O hydroxycholesterol (27O-HC) was associated with Alzheimer's. Decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and phospholipids were noticed. Genetic mutations in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein A (ApoA), ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette transporter 7 (ABCA7), amyloid precursor protein (APP), cytochrome P450 family 46 subfamilies A member 1 (CYP46A1), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are also associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. This study found an association between plasma lipids and Alzheimer's, proving that plasma lipids can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. It may also help predict the prognosis and stage the disease severity. Further studies are needed to find out the exact mechanism behind these changes.
