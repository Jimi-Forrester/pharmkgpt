33572109|t|Neuropsychiatric Consequences of Lipophilic Beta-Blockers.
33572109|a|Beta-blockers are a class of drugs with important benefits in cardiovascular pathology. In this paper, we aim to highlight their adverse and therapeutic effects in the neuropsychiatric field. With respect to permeability, we would like to mention that most beta-blockers are lipophilic and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Observational studies show the presence of neuropsychiatric side effects when taking beta-blockers, and is the reason for which caution is recommended in their use in patients with depressive syndrome. From a therapeutic point of view, most current evidence is for the use of beta-blockers in migraine attacks, essential tremor, and akathisia. Beta-blockers appear to be effective in the treatment of aggressive behavior, beneficial in the prevention of posttraumatic stress syndrome and may play a role in the adjuvant treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is refractory to standard therapy. In conclusion, the relationship between beta-blockers and the central nervous system appears as a two-sided coin. Summarizing the neuropsychiatric side effects of beta-blockers, we suggest that clinicians pay special attention to the pharmacological properties of different beta-blockers.
