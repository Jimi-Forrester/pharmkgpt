38815405|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder. There is a considerable unmet medical need among those suffering from it. HYPOTHESIS AND PURPOSE: Given the link between type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD, hypoglycemic traditional Chinese medicine formulas (TCMFs) may be a treatment for AD. We investigated the possibility of identifying anti-AD medicines in hypoglycemic TCMFs and presented another option for the screening of AD medications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Paralysis of the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) strain CL4176 (caused by amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 aggregates) was used to evaluate the anti-AD effect. The toxicity and neurodegeneration induced by neuronal expression of Abeta in the transgenic C. elegans strain CL2355 were determined using a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) assay. The transgenic Abeta-expressing strain CL 2006 and transgenic tau-expressing strain BR5270 were used to explore the effect of TCMFs on protein expression in C. elegans using ELISAs. Then, network pharmacology was used to determine the mechanism of action. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Support System platform was used to investigate prescription patterns, core drugs, and optimum combinations of hypoglycemic TCMFs for AD. RESULTS: Sixteen hypoglycemic TCMFs prolonged the PT50 (half paralysis time) of the CL4176 strain of C. elegans, reduced the percentage of worms paralyzed. The results of network pharmacology showed that prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) are main targets of hypoglycemic TCMFs. Enriched pathway analysis showed that the cholinergic receptor-related pathway was the core pathway of hypoglycemic TCMFs. According to the "four qi and five flavors" system of TCM theory, the main pharmacological qualities were "cold" and "sweet." Through the analysis by TCMISS, we found that Huangqi-Gegen drug pair as the significant Chinese herbs of hypoglycemic TCMFs. The Huangqi-Gegen pairing had the most robust therapeutic effect when delivered at a 2:1 (v/v) ratio. It reduced the paralysis caused by 5-HT, decreased protein expression of AChE and PTGS2, and reduced Abeta deposition in the brain of the CL2006 strain of C. elegans. CONCLUSIONS: Huangqi-Gegen is a promising treatment of AD, and its mechanism may be induced by suppressing the protein production of AChE and PTGS2, reducing 5-HT intake, and then decreasing Abeta deposition.
