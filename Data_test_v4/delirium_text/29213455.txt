29213455|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome with multiple etiological factors. Evaluation of delirium in different settings, especially the Emergency Department (ED) pertaining to different regions of the world with patients from different cultural and educational backgrounds is needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of delirium and its association with education in an ED in Brazil during a 6-month period. Methods: Patients aged >18 years were randomly selected from ED admissions. The instruments Confusion Assessment. METHOD: (CAM) scale, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Logical Memory (WLM) and Charlson comorbidity score were applied to evaluate delirium, cognitive status, and comorbidities. RESULTS: The prevalence of delirium was10.7%. Delirium patients had significantly lower education, MMSE and WLM (immediate and delayed) scores, with 97.4% presenting episodic memory impairment. Patients with delirium had more history of neurological disorders. Three logistic regression models evaluating the association of variables with delirium were developed. Age and MMSE were retained in the first model, WLM scores in the second, and education in the third. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study estimating the prevalence of delirium in a Brazilian ED. Lower education was associated with the occurrence of delirium.
