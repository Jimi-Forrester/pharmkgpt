9895231|a|The elevation of endogenous thiol-related antioxidants and free radical scavenging enzymes in the brain of C57BL/6 female mice after low-dose gamma-ray irradiation and its inhibitory effect on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced brain damage were investigated. The brain level of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) increased soon after irradiation with 50 cGy of gamma-rays, reached a maximum at 3 h post-treatment, and remained elevated until 12 h. Thioredoxin (TRX) was also transiently increased after irradiation. The activities of free radical scavenging enzymes, including Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, were significantly induced after irradiation as well. Cerebral malondialdehyde was remarkably elevated by MPTP treatment, and this elevation was suppressed by pre-irradiation (50 cGy). The contents of GSH and TRX were significantly decreased by MPTP treatment in comparison with those of the control group. These reductions both seemed to be attenuated by pre-irradiation with gamma-rays. These results suggest that low-dose gamma-ray irradiation induces endogenous antioxidative potency in the brain of mice and might be effective for the prevention and/or therapy of various reactive oxygen species-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
