34795950|t|Peri-operative approach to esophagectomy: a narrative review from the anesthesiological standpoint.
34795950|a|OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes the peri-operative anesthesiological approaches to esophagectomy considering the best up-to-date, evidence-based medicine, discussed from the anesthesiologist's standpoint. BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy is the only curative therapy for esophageal cancer. Despite the many advancements made in the surgical treatment of this tumour, esophagectomy still carries a morbidity rate reaching 60%. Patients undergoing esophagectomy should be referred to high volume centres where they can receive a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, associated with better outcomes. The anesthesiologist is the key figure who should guide the peri-operative phase, from diagnosis through to post-surgery rehabilitation. We performed an updated narrative review devoted to the study of anesthesia management for esophagectomy in cancer patients. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar databases from inception to May 2021. We used the following terms: "esophagectomy", "esophagectomy AND pre-operative evaluation", "esophagectomy AND protective lung ventilation", "esophagectomy AND hemodynamic monitoring" and "esophagectomy AND analgesia". We considered only articles with abstract written in English and available to the reader. We excluded single case-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative anesthesiological evaluation is mandatory in order to stratify and optimize any medical condition. During surgery, protective ventilation and judicious fluid management are the cornerstones of intraoperative "protective anesthesia". Post-operative care should be provided by an intensive care unit or high-dependency unit depending on the patient's condition, the type of surgery endured and the availability of local resources. The provision of adequate post-operative analgesia favours early mobilization and rapid recovery. Anesthesiologist has an important role during the peri-operative care for esophagectomy. However, there are still some topics that need to be further studied to improve the outcome of these patients.
