29526069|t|Clinical and Radiological Outcomes of Posterior Vertebral Column Resection for Severe Spinal Deformities.
29526069|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR) by a single neurosurgeon in a single institution. METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive patients with severe spinal deformities who underwent PVCR between 2010 and 2016 were enrolled. The radiographic measurements included a kyphotic angle of PVCR levels (VCR angle), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis (LL), and spinopelvic parameters. The data of surgical time, estimated blood loss, duration of hospital stay, complications, intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring, and the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 questionnaire were collected using a retrospective review of medical records. RESULTS: The VCR angle, LL, and SVA values were significantly corrected after surgery. The VCR and LL angle were changed from the average of 38.4+-32.1  and -22.1+-39.1  to -1.7+-29.4  (p<0.001) and -46.3+-23.8  (p=0.001), respectively. The SVA was significantly reduced from 103.6+-88.5 mm to 22.0+-46.3 mm (p=0.001). The clinical results using SRS-22 survey improved from 2.6+-0.9 to 3.4+-0.8 (p=0.033). There were no death and permanent neurological deficits after PVCR. However, complications occurred in 19 (55.9%) patients. Those patients experienced a total of 31 complications during- and after surgery. Sixteen reoperations were performed in twelve (35.3%) patients. The incidence of transient neurological deterioration was 5.9% (two out of 34 patients). CONCLUSION: Severe spinal deformities can be effectively corrected by PVCR. However, the PVCR technique should be utilized limitedly because surgery-related serious complications are relatively common.
