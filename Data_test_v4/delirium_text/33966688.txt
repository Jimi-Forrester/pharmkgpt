33966688|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate potential risk factors for mild behavioral impairment (MBI) among non-demented geriatrics. DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Taiwan Alzheimer Disease Association (TADA) Database. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were selected by multistage random sampling of all Taiwan counties. They received in-person interviews between December 2011 and March 2013. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic data, lifestyle and habits, medical comorbidities, cognitive status measured by the Taiwanese Mini-Mental Status Examination (TMSE) and presence of MCI of the participants were collected. Subjects were distributed to the MBI and non-MBI groups. These factors had been evaluated for their effects on MBI in the univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: In total, 6,196 non-demented participants aged 65 years or older, including 409 MBI and 5,787 non-MBI participants, were recruited. After adjustment for age, sex, education, body mass index, lifestyle and habits, medical comorbidities, and MCI, good sleep was associated with lower risk of MBI (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.07 - 0.12). Low body weight (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.21-3.33), low-to-medium education (OR 1.40, 95%CI 1.06-1.85; OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.67-3.21), medical comorbidities of hypertension (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.25-1.95), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00-1.67), cancer (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.37-3.06) were significantly associated with increased MBI risk. MCI neither increased nor decreased risk of MBI (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: Good sleep was associated with lower MBI risk. Underweight, lower education, medical comorbidities of cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia were predictive of MBI.
