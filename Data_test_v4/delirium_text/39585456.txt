39585456|a|PURPOSE: Our perioperative management center provides preoperative intervention and functional and nutritional assessments for colorectal cancer patients aged over 75 years. This study evaluated the associations of preoperative nutritional status with postoperative outcomes and prognosis in colorectal cancer patients aged 75 years or older. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of 71 colorectal cancer patients aged 75 years or older who underwent surgery between July 2020 and September 2022. The Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) was evaluated as a nutritional index. The patients were classified into three groups: SGA-A (well nourished), B (moderately malnourished), and C (severely malnourished), and the correlations with postoperative outcomes and prognosis were examined. RESULTS: The median age of the 71 patients (34 males, 37 females) was 78 (75-92) years, and their median body mass index (BMI) was 22.3 (13.4-31.9) kg/m2. Forty-eight patients had colon cancer, and 23 had rectal cancer. On the SGA, 28 patients were SGA-A, 25 SGA-B, and 18 SGA-C. The SGA-B/C group had significantly higher BMI (p < 0.01) and more ICU admissions (p = 0.02). The G8 score was significantly lower (p = 0.03) in the SGA-B/C group, suggesting coexisting functional decline. In terms of postoperative outcomes, the SGA-B/C group had a significantly longer postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.04). The 3-year OS rates for all stages were 100% in the SGA-A group and 49.7% in the SGA-B/C group (p = 0.03), while the 3-year OS rates for patients excluding Stage IV were 100% in the SGA-A group and 68.5% in the SGA-B/C group, not significantly different (p = 0.14). The 3-year RFS rate was 95.5% in the SGA-A group and 65.3% in the SGA-B/C group (p = 0.15). CONCLUSION: The SGA is a promising nutritional index associated with short-term outcomes in older patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. The SGA can be assessed in a few minutes during an outpatient visit, making it useful for routine clinical use.
