31873837|t|Associations Between Two Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in NINJ2 Gene and Risk of Psychiatric Disorders.
31873837|a|NINJ2 encodes a transmembrane protein that contributes in neurodevelopment and regeneration of neurons. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, and multiple sclerosis. The rs11833579 and rs3809263 SNPs have been associated with risk of ischemic stroke in Iranian population. While the NINJ2 rs12425791 has been with risk of ischemic stroke in East Asian population, the rs11833579 has not been associated with this condition either in East Asian population or Chinese Han population. In the current project, we genotyped rs11833579 and rs3809263 in a large cohort of neuropsychiatric patients including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and methamphetamine addiction. No significant difference was detected in frequencies of alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes between patients and controls. Thus, the current investigation failed to show association between rs11833579 and rs3809263 and the mentioned neuropsychiatric disorders. Future studies are needed to verify our results.
