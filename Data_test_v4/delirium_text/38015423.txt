38015423|t|Regional White Matter Hyperintensities Relate to Specific Cognitive Abilities in Older Adults Without Dementia.
38015423|a|INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are magnetic resonance imaging markers of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are associated with cognitive decline and clinical Alzheimer disease. Previous studies have often focused on global or total WMH; less is known about associations of regional WMHs and cognitive abilities among older adults without dementia. METHODS: A total of 610 older adults with normal cognition (n=302) or mild cognitive impairment (n=308) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression models examined associations between regional WMH volumes and cognition, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele frequency, and pulse pressure. RESULTS: Among all participants, greater regional WMH volume in all lobes was associated with poorer performance on memory and speed/executive functioning. Among participants with normal cognition, greater temporal and occipital WMH volumes were associated with poorer memory, whereas no regional WMH volumes were associated with speed/executive function. DISCUSSION: Results show that greater regional WMH volume relates to poorer cognitive functioning-even among those with normal cognition. Together with results from previous studies, our findings raise the possibility that WMH may be a useful therapeutic target and/or important effect modifier in treatment or prevention dementia trials.
