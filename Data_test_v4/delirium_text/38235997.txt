38235997|t|Enablers and Barriers to Hearing aid Use in People Living With Dementia.
38235997|a|Hearing loss is highly prevalent in dementia; however, people with dementia are less likely to use hearing aids consistently than people with intact cognition are. This qualitative study is the first of its kind to explore factors that influence hearing aid use from the perspective of community-living people with mild to moderate dementia and their care partners. Eleven UK-based dyads from the European SENSE-Cog Randomized Controlled Trial of a sensory intervention for people with dementia completed semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Our findings suggest that the TDF domains environmental context and resources, behavioral regulation, reinforcement, and social influences are of greatest relevance to hearing aid use in dementia. Within these domains, we identified a range of factors that may influence the target behavior of hearing aid use. The findings suggest that adoption of multifaceted, flexible intervention approaches may support hearing aid use in dementia.
