39834108|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify, appraise and synthesize current evidence on different sensory-based interventions on delirium prevention in critically ill patients. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and WeiPu databases from inception to 2 June 2022. The data were updated on 24 December 2022. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42021254328). REVIEW METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were included. Participants in the included studies were critically ill patients aged 18 years or older, and the interventions involved care by sensory-based intervention. And the outcome was the incidence of delirium rated by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU Tool. RESULTS: The 14 studies included in the systematic review indicated a reduction in the effectiveness of sensory-based intervention on the incidence of delirium. Subgroup analyses showed significant effects for auditory stimulation (OR, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.79; p = 0.005) and tactile stimulation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.87; p = 0.01) but not for the effectiveness of visual intervention on the incidence of delirium (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.38-1.30; p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Sensory-based interventions significantly reduce the incidence of delirium in critical patients. It is suggested that when choosing sensory-based interventions, auditory intervention should be preferred.
