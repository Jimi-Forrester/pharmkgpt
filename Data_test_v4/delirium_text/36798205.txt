36798205|t|TFEB-vacuolar ATPase signaling regulates lysosomal function and microglial activation in tauopathy.
36798205|a|Transcription factor EB (TFEB) mediates gene expression through binding to the C oordinated L ysosome E xpression A nd R egulation (CLEAR) sequence. TFEB targets include subunits of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) essential for lysosome acidification. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of wild-type and PS19 (Tau) transgenic mice identified three unique microglia subclusters in Tau mice that were associated with heightened lysosome and immune pathway genes. To explore the lysosome-immune relationship, we specifically disrupted the TFEB-v-ATPase signaling by creating a knock-in mouse line in which the CLEAR sequence of one of the v-ATPase subunits, Atp6v1h , was mutated. We show that the CLEAR mutant exhibited a muted response to TFEB, resulting in impaired lysosomal acidification and activity. Crossing the CLEAR mutant with Tau mice led to higher tau pathology but diminished microglia response. These microglia were enriched in a subcluster low in mTOR and HIF-1 pathways and was locked in a homeostatic state. Our studies demonstrate a physiological function of TFEB-v-ATPase signaling in maintaining lysosomal homoeostasis and a critical role of the lysosome in mounting a microglia and immune response in tauopathy and Alzheimera$ s disease.
