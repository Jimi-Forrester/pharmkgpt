39659949|t|Quercetin: A Flavonoid with Potential for Treating Acute Lung Injury.
39659949|a|In intensive care units, acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome that is frequently encountered. It is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Despite the extensive research conducted by the medical community on its treatment, no specific effective drugs have been identified. Quercetin is a natural flavonoid with many biological activities and pharmacological effects. Research indicates that Quercetin can modulate various targets and signaling pathways, inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, ferroptosis, apoptosis, fibrosis, and bacterial and viral infections in ALI. This regulation suggests its potential therapeutic application for the condition. Currently, there is no comprehensive review addressing the application of Quercetin in the treatment of ALI. This paper begins with a classification of ALI, followed by a detailed summary of the mechanisms through which Quercetin may treat ALI to evaluate its potential as a novel therapeutic option.
