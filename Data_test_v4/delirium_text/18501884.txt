18501884|t|Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
18501884|a|Donepezil hydrochloride is a potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and has been treated for Alzheimer's disease, in which the cholinergic dysfunction is observed. Recently, the degeneration of medial septal cholinergic nuclei in adult rat suppressed the neurogenesis in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was reported. Then, we determined whether donepezil which activated the brain cholinergic system could modulate hippocampal neurogenesis in normal rats. After the injection of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing cells, we orally treated with donepezil (0.5 or 2mg/kg) once a day for 4 weeks. In the other group, we performed 4-week subcutaneous infusion of scopolamine (0.75 or 3mg/day), a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blocker. The doses of donepezil and scopolamine we used in this study were reported to activate and inhibit cholinergic activity in rats, respectively. One day after the completion of drug treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Donepezil increased, but scopolamine decreased, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the DG as compared with the vehicle-treated control. Neither drug had any effects on the percentage of BrdU-positive cells that were also positive for a neuronal marker NeuN, nor the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells in the DG. These results indicate that donepezil enhances and scopolamine suppresses the survival of newborn neurons in the DG without affecting the proliferation of neural progenitor cell and the neuronal differentiation. We also found that chronic treatment of donepezil enhanced, and scopolamine suppressed phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which was involved in cell survival, in the DG. These results suggest that donepezil activates the central cholinergic transmission and enhances the survival of newborn neurons in the DG via CREB signaling.
