30942936|t|Microglial phagocytosis in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
30942936|a|Microglia are the innate immune cells of the brain, which maintain homeostasis by constantly scanning and surveying the environment with their highly ramified processes. In order to exert this function, they need to phagocytose synapses as well as debris and dead cells, a process that is further amplified in pathological conditions. Importantly, it has been shown that microglia phagocytic capacity is altered in the course of neurodegenerative disease, for which aging is one of the highest risk factors. Thus, understanding how phagocytosis is impaired during aging is a priority for future research. Advances in this area are expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of normal cognition during aging, as well as changes that take place in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on how phagocytosis is executed and affected by aging or in age-associated neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we will summarize both protective and deleterious consequences of altered phagocytosis in AD and where relevant in other neurodegenerative diseases.
