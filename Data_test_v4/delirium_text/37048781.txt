37048781|t|Distal Flow Diversion with Anti-Thrombotically Coated and Bare Metal Low-Profile Flow Diverters-A Comparison.
37048781|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The establishment of low-profile flow diverting stents (FDS), for example, the Silk Vista Baby (SVB) and the p48MW, facilitated endovascular treatment of peripheral cerebral aneurysms. This study therefore aims to compare the performance and outcomes of the SVB with those of the p48MW HPC, with a special focus on hemodynamic aspects of peripheral segments and bifurcations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprises 108 patients, who were either treated with the SVB or the p48MW HPC between June 2018 and April 2021. RESULTS: Sixty patients received a SVB and forty-eight patients a p48MW HPC. The SVB was used predominantly in the AcomA-complex, and the p48MW HPC in the MCA bifurcation. Immediately after implantation, significant hemodynamic downgrading (OKM A2-A3, B1-B3, C3) was achieved in 60% in the SVB group vs. 75.1% in the p48MW HPC group. At the second follow-up, after an average of 8.8 and 10.9 months, respectively, OKM D1 was observed in 64.4% of the SVB group vs. 27.3% in the p48MW HPC group. Only 1.7% vs. 6.8% of the aneurysms remained morphologically unaltered (OKM A1). Adverse events with persisting neurologic sequalae at last follow-up were largely comparable in both groups (5.0% vs. 4.2%). CONCLUSION: Immediately after implantation, the p48MW HPC had a more profound hemodynamic impact than the SVB; however, early complete occlusions were achieved in a greater proportion of lesions after implantation of the uncoated SVB.
