18575661|t|[Charles Bonnet syndrome: report of one case managed with haloperidol].
18575661|a|Charles Bonnet syndrome is an underrecognized condition characterized by complex visual hallucinations, ocular problems causing visual deterioration and preserved cognitive status. Its prevalence is 5/1000 in ambulatory ophthalmologic patients. Generally occurs in elderly people in whom it may be confused with delirium or dementia. The first management step is to improve vision, if possible. Hallucinations may be managed pharmacologically. We report a 94 year-old woman with the characteristic clinical picture of the syndrome that improved with haloperidol.
