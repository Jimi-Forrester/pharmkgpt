18401724|a|Ablation of the olfactory bulbs (bulbectomy) in mice and guinea pigs evokes a neurodegenerative process which, in terms of its morphological, biochemical, and behavioral features, is similar to Alzheimer's disease. We report here studies of the long-term sequelae of bulbectomy in rats. One year after surgery, testing of spatial memory in bulbectomized rats (BER) allowed the animals to be divided into two groups-those with good memory (BER-gm) and those with poor memory (BER-pm). Quantitative analysis of the morphofunctional state of neurons showed that BER-pm, as compared with the BER-gm group, had more marked pathological lesions in neurons of the temporal cortex and hippocampus, with significant increases in the numbers of cells showing pyknosis, karyolysis, cytolysis, and vacuolization. Both groups showed decreases in the distribution density of cells in the cortex. In terms of the level of brain beta-amyloid, the study groups fell in the order: BER-pm>BER-gm>control sham-operated rats. These results provide evidence of the long-term nature of changes in the morphofunctional state of neurons in the brains of BER, correlating with their levels of spatial memory.
