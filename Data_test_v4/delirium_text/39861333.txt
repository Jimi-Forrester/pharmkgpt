39861333|t|Trends in Dehydration in Older People: Identifying Landmark Scientific Contributions.
39861333|a|BACKGROUND: Dehydration and low fluid intake cause the most prevalent electrolyte imbalance in older adults and increase their morbi-mortality. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the scientific production on dehydration in older adults. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection database. The data were analysed using two software programs, the Bibliometric package for RStudio version 4.2.2, and VOSviewer 1.6.18 for the analysis of the scientific production, authors, citations, countries and collaborations, journals, research areas, and keywords. RESULTS: A total of 205 articles were selected. An increase in the number of publications has been observed since 2012, with 2021 being the most productive year. With respect to scientific production, although the USA had the most publications, the two most prolific authors were affiliated with an institution located in the UK, with this country having the most collaborations with other countries in the development of the subject matter. The co-occurrence analysis indicated that the words with the highest occurrence were dehydration (n = 103), hydration (n = 39), prevalence (n = 30), mortality (n = 29), and thirst (n = 29). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first bibliometric analysis that shows the publication trends on dehydration in older adults. Although the number of publications is limited, they have increased in number in the last few years. The research trends are centred on the prevalence of dehydration and its related factors. More studies are needed that are centred on interventions to correct the problem, to help fight against the electrolyte imbalances that occur, and to reduce the morbi-mortality associated with this condition.
