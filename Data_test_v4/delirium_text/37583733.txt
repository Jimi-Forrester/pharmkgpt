37583733|a|Objectives The objective is to assess the extent of foot-specific and generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment among individuals diagnosed with plantar fasciitis (PF) at King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia, and to determine the influence of various sociodemographic and clinical factors. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we administered an online survey from March to June 2023 to patients with PF at King Khalid University Hospital. This questionnaire covered sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics, and included the translated Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ). Further, patient data were obtained from hospital records between 2016 and 2023 using the E-SIHI system. Results We recruited 209 patients for the study. Lower FHSQ scores were found in unemployed and low-income participants indicating a worse quality of life (QoL) in the Foot Pain domain, while those aged over 40 years and with low income showed greater impairment in the General Foot Health domain. No single factor influenced the Foot Function or Footwear domains. Worse General Health and Physical Activity scores were associated with low-education and low-income participants and those who did not exercise. Women exhibited a lower QoL than men in all domains except for General Health. Conclusion The QoL of Saudi women with PF was similar to that of women in other countries. However, the patients in the present study reported poorer footwear scores but better General Health scores. Therefore, focusing more on proper footwear-related treatments may help improve the QoL of patients with PF.
