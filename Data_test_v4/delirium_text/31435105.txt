31435105|t|Analysis of the Morbidimortality of Patients with Peritrochanteric Fractures Surgically Treated with Proximal Femoral Intramedullary Rod.
31435105|a|Objective  To analyze the morbimortality of patients with peritrochanteric fractures treated with intramedullary rod and its relationship to the length of hospital stay, the time until surgery and the comorbidities of the patients. Methods  An observational, analytical and retrospective study was carried out through the evaluation of the medical records of 74 patients who underwent surgical treatment of peritrochanteric fractures with intramedullary proximal femoral rods from 2011 to 2014 in a hospital unit. Results  The mean age at the moment of the fracture was 79.7 years, and the mean total hospitalization time was 16.7 days, with an average of 11.3 days until surgery and 5.4 days from surgery to discharge. The incidence of complications during hospitalization in the group aged >= 78.5 years was of 47.6%, while in the younger group it was of 19.4% ( p  = 0.013). The incidence of hospitalization complications in the group that underwent surgery more than 6 days after the fracture was significantly higher: 42.9% ( p  = 0.019). It was also observed that the incidence of complications during hospitalization was significantly associated with a surgical risk index >= 3 ( p  = 0.001) and diabetes mellitus ( p  = 0.001). Conclusion  Complications related to peritrochanteric fractures are significantly related with a high surgical risk index (grades 3 and 4), diabetes mellitus, age (> 78.5 years), and prolonged preoperative hospitalization (> 6 days).
