37543811|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose a significant global health threat. In particular, Alzheimer disease, the most common type causing dementia, remains an incurable disease. Alzheimer disease is thought to be associated with an imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons, and scientists considered ROS modulation as a promising strategy for novel remedies. In the study, human neural cell line SH-SY5Y was used in probing the effect of combining noninvasive high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in protection against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neuron damage. Our result finds that the combination approach has intensified the neuroprotective effect significantly, perhaps due to H-LIPEF and BDNF synergistically increasing the expression level of the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), which induces the survival-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) proteins. The study confirmed the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the downstream pro-survival and antioxidant proteins as the mechanism underlying neuron protection. These findings highlighted the potential of H-LIPEF combined with BDNF in the treatment of NDDs. Furthermore, BDNF-mimetic drugs combining with noninvasive H-LIPEF to patients is a promising approach worthy of further research. This points to strategies for selecting drugs to cooperate with electric fields in treating neurodegenerative disorders.
