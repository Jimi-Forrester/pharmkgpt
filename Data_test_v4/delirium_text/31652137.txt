31652137|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cognitive decline is frequently reported after hospitalisation in the contexts of surgery, delirium and critical care. The question not adequately addressed is whether all types of acute hospitalisations increase the risk of cognitive decline. As acute hospitalisations are common in the elderly, who are also vulnerable to cognitive decline, this possible association is of significant concern. RECENT FINDINGS: This review summarises cognitive outcomes from recent observational studies investigating acute hospitalisation (emergent and elective) in older age adults. Studies were identified from searching Medline, Embase and PsycINFO databases and citations lists. The highest incidence of cognitive decline has been reported following critical care admissions and admissions complicated by delirium, although all types of acute hospitalisations are implicated. Age is the most consistent risk factor for cognitive decline. Several etiological and therapeutic aspects are being investigated, particularly the measurement of inflammatory biomarkers and treatment with anti-inflammatory medications. SUMMARY: Acute hospitalisation for any reason appears to increase the risk of cognitive decline in older adults, but the cause remains elusive. Future research must clarify the nature and modifiers of posthospitalisation cognitive change, a priority in the face of an ageing population.
