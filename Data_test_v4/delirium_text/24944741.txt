24944741|t|Synthesis of [(11)C]Bexarotene by Cu-Mediated [(11)C]Carbon Dioxide Fixation and Preliminary PET Imaging.
24944741|a|Bexarotene (Targretin) is a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist that has applications for treatment of T cell lymphoma and proposed mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease that have been the subject of recent controversy. Carbon-11 labeled bexarotene ([(11)C-carbonyl]4-[1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyltetralin-2-yl)ethenyl]benzoic acid) was synthesized using a Cu-mediated cross-coupling reaction employing an arylboronate precursor 1 and [(11)C]carbon dioxide under atmospheric pressure in 15 +- 2% uncorrected radiochemical yield (n = 3), based on [(11)C]CO2. Judicious choice of solvents, catalysts, and additives, as well as precursor concentration and purity of [(11)C]CO2, enabled the preparation of this (11)C-labeled carboxylic acid. Formulated [(11)C]bexarotene was isolated (>37 mCi) with >99% radiochemical purity in 32 min. Preliminary positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging revealed rapid brain uptake in nonhuman primate in the first 75 s following intravenous administration of the radiotracer (specific activity >0.3 Ci/mumol at time of injection), followed by slow clearance (Delta = -43%) over 60 min. Modest uptake (SUVmax = 0.8) was observed in whole brain and regions with high RXR expression.
