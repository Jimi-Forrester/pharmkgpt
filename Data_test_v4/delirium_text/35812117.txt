35812117|t|Meta-Analysis of the Association Between Asthma and the Risk of Stroke.
35812117|a|Introduction: Asthma and stroke share many risk factors. Previous meta-analysis has indicated that asthma is associated with an increased risk of stroke. However, this study were limited by the small number of articles included and the lack of subgroup analyses of different stroke types and different populations. This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize evidence systematically to investigate the impact of asthma on stroke. Methods: We searched Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science and EMBASE databases and manually identified eligible studies (inception dates to December 25, 2021) that analyzed the association between asthma and stroke. We conducted quality assessment to evaluate the risk of bias of studies and sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results. Results: We included 8 cohort studies and 10 cross-sectional studies comprised 3,011,016 participants. We found patients with asthma had a higher risk of stroke than patients without asthma [relative risk (RR): 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.47]. Moreover, asthma significantly increased the risk of ischemic stroke (RR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.06-1.47) without increasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.87-1.34). Asthma increased the risk of stroke in both men (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10-1.32) and women (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.48) with no significant difference between the sexes. We also found that patients with inactive asthma, child-onset asthma, or no smoking history did not have an increased risk of stroke. Conclusions: These results supported the finding that asthma could significantly increase the risk of stroke, but this impact was not consistent in different populations.
