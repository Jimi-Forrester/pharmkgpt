33925691|t|Role of ABCA7 in Human Health and in Alzheimer's Disease.
33925691|a|Several studies, including genome wide association studies (GWAS), have strongly suggested a central role for the ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This ABC transporter is now considered as an important genetic determinant for late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) by regulating several molecular processes such as cholesterol metabolism and amyloid processing and clearance. In this review we shed light on these new functions and their cross-talk, explaining its implication in brain functioning, and therefore in AD onset and development.
