29933901|t|Clinical management of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) withdrawal delirium with CIWA-Ar protocol.
29933901|a|Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a synthetic drug used mainly for recreational purpose. Although the prevalence of GHB abuse is low in Taiwan, GHB has become increasingly popular in certain subpopulations such as clubbers and men who have sex with men (MSM). GHB dependence could be associated with severe withdrawal syndrome including hallucinations and delirium. Despite systematic studies on detoxification and management of GHB withdrawal have been performed, no validated measurement for severity of GHB withdrawal syndrome is available. Here we present a case of GHB withdrawal delirium that was treated successfully with fixed and symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing regimen based on Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) scale. The utilization of CIWA-Ar in such cases could offer useful guidance for benzodiazepine dosing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of GHB withdrawal delirium in Taiwan.
