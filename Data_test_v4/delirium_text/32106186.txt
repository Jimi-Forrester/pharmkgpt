32106186|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium. DESIGN: Prospective double-blinded observational cohort study. SETTING: Eight-bed mixed PICU (post-surgical and internal medicine) from May 2017 to June 2018. PATIENTS: All children between the ages of 0-13 years who were admitted to the PICU for at least 24 hours were eligible for inclusion, as long as the child was arousable to verbal stimulation. INTERVENTIONS: Two nurses simultaneously and independently assessed each patient for pediatric delirium with the Japanese version of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium; this was compared to the gold standard of psychiatric diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition standards. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-one children were enrolled and 92 assessments (ranging from one to four per subject) were completed. Congenital heart disease patients accounted for 73 enrollees (79%). Forty-three percent of observations were performed in children on invasive mechanical ventilation. Pediatric delirium prevalence (as determined by psychiatric diagnosis) was 53%. The Japanese version of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium demonstrated an optimal scoring cutpoint of 9. Overall, area under the curve was 92%, sensitivity 90% (95% CI, 79-97%), specificity 88% (95% CI, 75-96%), positive predictive value of 90% (95% CI, 79-97%), negative predictive value of 91% (95% CI, 80-97%), and a Cohen's kappa of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.8-0.98). In children on invasive mechanical ventilation, the Japanese version of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium maintained an area under the curve 87%, sensitivity 97%, and specificity 64%. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese version of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium is a valid and reliable tool for use in Japanese PICUs. This will allow for detection of delirium in real-time and may lead to better identification of the population and risk factors for appropriate management and therapeutic and preventative interventions.
