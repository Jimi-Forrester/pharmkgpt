23713771|a|Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are linked to each other. We have recently identified in vitro a high affinity interaction between beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) of AD and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) of T2D which results in the formation of non-fibrillar and non-cytotoxic Abeta-IAPP hetero-oligomers. The Abeta-IAPP interaction delays cytotoxic self-association of both polypeptides albeit it is unable to block it. In this context, IAPP-GI, a soluble conformationally constrained mimic of a non-amyloidogenic and non-toxic IAPP conformer, completely blocks Abeta amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity. Here we studied the hetero-association pathways of Abeta with IAPP and with IAPP-GI. We found that preformed Abeta or IAPP fibrils and cytotoxic assemblies are able to seed amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity in Abeta-IAPP but not in Abeta-IAPP-GI solutions. Initially non-fibrillar and non-toxic Abeta-IAPP but not Abeta-IAPP-GI hetero-oligomers were found to further aggregate into hetero-fibrils and cytotoxic assemblies in a process strongly enhanced under Abeta or IAPP self-assembly promoting conditions. Importantly, our studies provided evidence that initially non-fibrillar and non-toxic Abeta-IAPP hetero-oligomers are able to misfold into hetero-fibrils and indicated a crucial role of the strong amyloidogenic character of IAPP in this process. These results uncover a novel molecular property of the Abeta and IAPP sequences, i.e. their ability to form hetero-fibrils, and offer mechanistic support to a model linking Abeta and IAPP hetero-association to their cytotoxic self-association pathways and thus likely to the pathogenesis of AD and T2D.
