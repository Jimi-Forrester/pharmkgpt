27390640|a|BACKGROUND: Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) has been proposed to improve and facilitate early postoperative outcome in cardiac surgery. The aim of our study was to analyze early postoperative outcome data of patients undergoing cardiac surgery under general anesthesia (GA) with comparison to patients receiving combined TEA and GA. METHODS: Medical records data from 288 patients who underwent elective on-pump cardiac surgery were retrieved and analyzed. Patients were divided into two study groups according to the type of anesthesia used: GA group (n = 141) and TEA group (n = 147). Early postoperative outcome data including quality of analgesia and major organ outcome parameters were compared between the study groups. RESULTS: There was no major difference in early postoperative outcome data between the study groups, except for shorter time to extubation (6.0 +- 10.0 vs. 6.9 +- 8.8 h, respectively, P < 0.05) and hospital stay (10.7 +- 5.9 vs. 12.9 +- 8.8 days, respectively, P < 0.05) in TEA group compared to GA group. Also TEA group as compared to GA group had lower pain numeric rating scale scores (1 +- 1.1 vs. 1.4 +- 1.5 at 24 h, respectively, P < 0.05) and morphine requirements during the first 24 h after surgery (148.2 vs. 193 +- 85.4 mug/kg, respectively, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both anesthetic methods were equivalent in most postoperative outcome measures. Thoracic epidural analgesia provided superior pain relief, shorter time to extubation and earlier hospital discharge.
