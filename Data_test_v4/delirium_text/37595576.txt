37595576|a|Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is characterized by aggregation of tau in the mesial temporal lobe in older individuals. High pathologic tau stage (Braak stage) or a high burden of hippocampal tau pathology has been associated with cognitive impairment in PART. However, the potential underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Cognitive impairment in many neurodegenerative diseases correlates with synaptic loss, raising the question of whether synaptic loss also occurs in PART. To address this, we investigated synaptic changes associated with tau Braak stage and high tau pathology burden in PART using synaptophysin and phospho-tau immunofluorescence. We compared 12 cases of definite PART with 6 controls and 6 Alzheimer disease cases. In this study, the hippocampal CA2 region showed loss of synaptophysin puncta and intensity in cases of PART with either a high stage (Braak IV) or a high burden of neuritic tau pathology. There was also loss of synaptophysin intensity in CA3 associated with a high stage or high burden of tau pathology. Loss of synaptophysin was present in Alzheimer disease, but the pattern appeared distinct. These novel findings suggest the presence of synaptic loss associated with either a high hippocampal tau burden or a Braak stage IV in PART.
