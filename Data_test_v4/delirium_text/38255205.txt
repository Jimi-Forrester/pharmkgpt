38255205|t|Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Rescue Testicular Aging.
38255205|a|BACKGROUND: Testicular aging is associated with diminished fertility and certain age-related ailments, and effective therapeutic interventions remain elusive. Here, we probed the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSC-Exos) in counteracting testicular aging. METHODS: We employed a model of 22-month-old mice and administered intratesticular injections of hUMSC-Exos. Comprehensive analyses encompassing immunohistological, transcriptomic, and physiological assessments were conducted to evaluate the effects on testicular aging. Concurrently, we monitored alterations in macrophage polarization and the oxidative stress landscape within the testes. Finally, we performed bioinformatic analysis for miRNAs in hUMSC-Exos. RESULTS: Our data reveal that hUMSC-Exos administration leads to a marked reduction in aging-associated markers and cellular apoptosis while promoting cellular proliferation in aged testis. Importantly, hUMSC-Exos facilitated the restoration of spermatogenesis and elevated testosterone synthesis in aged mice. Furthermore, hUMSC-Exos could attenuate inflammation by driving the phenotypic shift of macrophages from M1 to M2 and suppress oxidative stress by reduced ROS production. Mechanistically, these efficacies against testicular aging may be mediated by hUMSC-Exos miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hUMSC-Exos therapy presents a viable strategy to ameliorate testicular aging, underscoring its potential therapeutic significance in managing testicular aging.
