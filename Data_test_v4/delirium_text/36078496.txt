36078496|t|The Pictorial Screening Memory Test (P-MIS) for Adults with Moderate Intellectual Disability and Alzheimer's Disease.
36078496|a|In this study, we examined normative data and diagnostic accuracy of a pictorial screening test to detect memory impairment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Spanish-speaking adults with intellectual disability (ID). A total of 94 volunteers with ID (60 controls, 17 MCI, and 17 AD), were evaluated by neuropsychological tests including the PMIS-ID in a cross-sectional validation study. Discriminative validity between the MCI, AD, and control group was analyzed by the area under the ROC curve. A cut-off score of 4.5 on the immediate recall trial had a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 80% to detect memory impairment (AUC = 0.685; 95% CI = 0.506-0.863) in the AD group. The PMIS-ID is a useful screening test to rule out a diagnosis of memory decline in people with moderate level of ID and AD, and it shows good psychometric properties.
