AIM: The aim was to investigate the association between the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean and MIND diets and cognitive performance in elderly with different cognitive profiles. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with participants from neurology outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 96 individuals were classified by a multidisciplinary team into normal controls (NC), individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. MEASUREMENTS: The Brief Cognitive Screening Battery, Mini-Mental State Examination, and a 98-item food frequency questionnaire were applied. Anthropometric data were also collected. Adherence scores to the Mediterranean and MIND diets were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Clinical groups did not differ regarding body mass index or level of adherence to the diets. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean and MIND diets was associated with higher scores on the MMSE and BCSB Learning in the NC group only. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate adherence to the Mediterranean and MIND dietary patterns may be associated with better cognition among healthy seniors living in middle to low income countries.
