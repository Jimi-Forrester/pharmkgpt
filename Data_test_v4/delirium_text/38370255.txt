38370255|a|Background and objective: Hemorheology and blood glucose are commonly used to estimate the risks of thrombosis and stress hyperglycemia after anaesthesia. The sequence of acupoint stimulation might influence the therapeutic effects of acupuncture. In the current study, we aimed at investigating the effect of different acupuncture sequences of "Huiyangjiuzhen" acupoints on the blood glucose and hemorheology in anesthetized rabbits. Methods: Twenty-five rabbits were randomly divided into five groups, including the control group (CG), the positive-sequence group (PSG), the reverse-sequence group (RSG), the disorder-sequence group (DSG), and the random group (RG). Except for the CG and RG, the rabbits in other groups were acupunctured with different sequences of "Huiyangjiuzhen"acupoints when the rabbits were anesthetized. The acupoints in rabbits of the RG were chosen randomly. The levels of blood glucose and hemorheology indexes before and after anaesthesia was detected. Results: In the PSG, Hetab 200/s, Metab 30/s, Hetar 200/s, ERI, hematocrit and plasma viscosity levels were decreased, and the blood glucose level was not changed. In the DSG, the levels of Metab 30/s and hematocrit were decreased, and the blood glucose was increased. In the CG, RSG and RG, no hemorheology indexes were changed and the blood glucose was increased. Conclusion: "Huiyangjiuzhen" acupuncture could decrease the risks of post-operative thrombosis and stress hyperglycemia in anesthetized rabbits. This effectiveness depends on both acupuncture and acupuncture sequence at the "Huiyangjiuzhen" acupoints.
