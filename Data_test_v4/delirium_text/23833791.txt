23833791|a|The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are pentameric ligand-gated cation channels that are found primarily in the central nervous system of mammals and are composed of a and b subunits arranged in various homomeric or heteromeric stoichiometric arrangements (for details, see dos Santos Coura and Granon (1)). The nAChRs have a high affinity for both nicotine and acetylcholine; binding of a ligand to the receptor facilitates the passage of cations into the cell, which alters the polarity of the cell membrane and activates signal transduction pathways that culminate in a cellular response (2). These receptors are believed to be involved in a variety of physiological processes, such as cognitive functions (1), neuroprotection in Parkinson s disease (3), Alzheimer s disease (AD) (4), and the progression of certain cancers (5). The heteromeric a4b2 and the homomeric a7 are the most commonly expressed nAChRs in the brain, and the b2 subunit is a component of most heteromeric nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system. There is much evidence that a4b2-nAChR is involved in normal cognitive functions in animals; it is also implicated in addiction (e.g., smoking) and in the cognitive impairments observed with AD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia (6). a7-nAChR participates in cognitive processes and has a reduced expression in the human schizophrenic brain, and there are indications that it has a therapeutic role in the treatment of AD (7). Although some radiolabeled compounds can be used with positron emission tomography (PET) for the imaging of a4b2-nAChR in the human brain (8), no suitable tracer(s) are available for the noninvasive investigation of a7-nAChR in humans (7). In an effort to develop new ligands for a7-nAChR, two compounds, 2-(6-methyl-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-3-yl)-7-(6-methyl-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-3-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-one (A-752274) and 5-(6-(5-methylhexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl)pyridazin-3-yl)-1H-indole (A-833834) were synthesized and labeled with <sup>11</sup>C ([<sup>11</sup>C]A-752274 and [<sup>11</sup>C]A-833834, respectively) (7). The biodistribution of both tracers was investigated in the mouse brain, and [<sup>11</sup>C]A-752274 was also evaluated for PET imaging of the brain of a baboon. This chapter presents results obtained with [<sup>11</sup>C]A-752274. The biodistribution characteristics of [<sup>11</sup>C]A-833834 are discussed in a separate chapter in MICAD (www.micad.nih.gov) (9).
