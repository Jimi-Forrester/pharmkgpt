20657627|t|How well is cognitive function documented by medical staff in the over-65 age group at the time of acute medical admission?
20657627|a|AIMS: Cognitive function in the elderly has a significant impact on prognosis and functional ability during an acute illness requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This prospective review was designed to measure how well cognitive function in the elderly was documented by medical staff at admission to hospital. Over a 2-week period, 257 patient admissions were reviewed. RESULTS: Of these, only 153 (59%) had their cognitive function documented on admission and only 14% had their premorbid cognitive function documented. Delirium was only diagnosed in 8 patients (3%) with at least 10 others having descriptions of delirious states without the formal diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In keeping with other studies, this audit shows that the documentation of cognitive function by medical staff is poor.
