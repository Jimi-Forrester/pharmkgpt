37197743|t|Collagen for neural tissue engineering: Materials, strategies, and challenges.
37197743|a|Neural tissue engineering (NTE) has made remarkable strides in recent years and holds great promise for treating several devastating neurological disorders. Selecting optimal scaffolding material is crucial for NET design strategies that enable neural and non-neural cell differentiation and axonal growth. Collagen is extensively employed in NTE applications due to the inherent resistance of the nervous system against regeneration, functionalized with neurotrophic factors, antagonists of neural growth inhibitors, and other neural growth-promoting agents. Recent advancements in integrating collagen with manufacturing strategies, such as scaffolding, electrospinning, and 3D bioprinting, provide localized trophic support, guide cell alignment, and protect neural cells from immune activity. This review categorises and analyses collagen-based processing techniques investigated for neural-specific applications, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in repair, regeneration, and recovery. We also evaluate the potential prospects and challenges of using collagen-based biomaterials in NTE. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive and systematic framework for the rational evaluation and applications of collagen in NTE.
