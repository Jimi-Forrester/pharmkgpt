33786015|a|This article chronicles the present situation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in Nigeria. A systematic search was conducted on three bibliographic databases: MEDLINE Complete, Web of Science and Scopus, and supplemented with grey literature searches to assess studies on the effect of COVID-19 on these individuals in Nigeria with data on this group from December 2019 to July 2020. There were no studies found concerning individuals with IDD in Nigeria. This article argues for an urgent call to action by Nigerian policymakers to make data available to help understand the impact of COVID-19 and to develop and implement appropriate interventions. This article provides steps to support and care for these individuals in Nigeria. Forecasting models are recommended which offer better approaches in yielding accurate predictions and provide valuable decisions in the event of future threats and infectious disease outbreak in Nigeria.
