35203923|a|BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunctions (SD) are common but underreported in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have negative impacts on the quality of life (QoL) and partnership. METHODS: We analyzed the data set from the PRISM study for demographics of SD and their influence on quality of life and partnership. RESULTS: 449/861 (52.1%) PD patients reported SD, with male patients being affected more often and having a longer course of disease. The most common SD in men was erectile dysfunction (ED) (n = 152), while women's most frequent complaints were orgasm dysfunction (n = 84) and reduced libido (n = 81). Hypersexual SDs were reported significantly more often by men. Spousal caregivers of patients reporting inability to relax and enjoy sex and reduced libido indicated a negative influence on the relationship in general. Negative effects on the sexual relationship were reported significantly more often for patients with ED, difficulties with sexual arousal, inability to relax and enjoy sex, and reduced libido. Hypersexual dysfunctions showed no effect on the relationship. CONCLUSION: SD is a common but underreported problem in the treatment of patients with PD. Due to the negative influence on the relationship and QoL of patients and caregivers, SD should be assessed routinely.
