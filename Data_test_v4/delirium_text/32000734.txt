32000734|a|BACKGROUND: Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with metabolic abnormalities and NNMT regulates energy metabolism and may also exert a causal role in metabolic disorders. The present study aimed to determine serum NNMT levels in patients with BD and compared the results with that of healthy controls, to explore the correlation between NNMT and clinical and metabolic characteristics. METHODS: The NNMT levels of 80 patients having a manic episode of BD and 65 non-psychiatric control individuals were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Metabolic parameters were evaluated using standard laboratory methods. RESULTS: The serum NNMT levels of bipolar mania patients were significantly lower than that of non-psychiatric controls. Furthermore, the serum levels of NNMT were found to be negatively correlated with Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores and the duration of the illness. Moreover, lower NNMT serum levels were found in patients with a history of antipsychotic medication and dyslipidemia. Our results also demonstrated the different patterns of correlation that exist between the study groups. Serum NNMT levels were found to be negatively correlated with triglyceride, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels in the BD group, while the same was found to be negatively associated only with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the suggestion that lower NNMT serum levels are significantly associated with BD and that serum NNMT has the potential to regulate lipid metabolism in BD patients.
