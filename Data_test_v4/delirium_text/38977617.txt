38977617|t|Instruments for measuring the neuromuscular function domain of vitality capacity in older persons: an umbrella review.
38977617|a|PURPOSE: Recently, handgrip, knee extensor and respiratory muscle strength were proposed as candidate biomarkers to assess the neuromuscular function of vitality capacity in older persons. This umbrella review aims to provide an overview of the available instruments and their measurement properties to assess these biomarkers. METHODS: The databases PubMed, Web of Science and Embase were systematically screened for systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting on handgrip, knee extensor or respiratory muscle strength assessments, resulting in 7,555 articles. The COSMIN checklist was used to appraise psychometric properties and the AMSTAR for assessing methodological quality. RESULTS: Twenty-seven systematic reviews were included in this study. Some of the identified reviews described the psychometric properties of the assessment tools. We found five assessment tools that can be used to measure neuromuscular function in the context of healthy ageing. Those are the handheld dynamometer for handgrip strength, the dynamometer for knee extensor strength and regarding respiratory muscle strength, the sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). CONCLUSION: The handheld dynamometer for hand grip strength, the dynamometer for knee extensor strength, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, MIP and MEP were identified. Therefore, these assessments could be used to identify community-dwelling older adults at risk for a declined neuromuscular function in the context of vitality capacity.
