37605276|a|BACKGROUND: Inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) has been designated limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), with or without co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Approximately, 30-70% AD cases present TDP-43 proteinopathy (AD-TDP), and a greater disease severity compared to AD patients without TDP-43 pathology. However, it remains unclear to what extent TDP-43 dysfunction is involved in AD pathogenesis. METHODS: To investigate whether TDP-43 dysfunction is a prominent feature in AD-TDP cases, we evaluated whether non-conserved cryptic exons, which serve as a marker of TDP-43 dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), accumulate in AD-TDP brains. We assessed a cohort of 192 post-mortem brains from three different brain regions: amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. Following RNA and protein extraction, qRT-PCR and immunoassays were performed to quantify the accumulation of cryptic RNA targets and phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology, respectively. RESULTS: We detected the accumulation of misspliced cryptic or skiptic RNAs of STMN2, KCNQ2, UNC13A, CAMK2B, and SYT7 in the amygdala and hippocampus of AD-TDP cases. The topographic distribution of cryptic RNA accumulation mimicked that of phosphorylated TDP-43, regardless of TDP-43 subtype classification. Further, cryptic RNAs efficiently discriminated AD-TDP cases from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicate that cryptic RNAs may represent an intriguing new therapeutic and diagnostic target in AD, and that methods aimed at detecting and measuring these species in patient biofluids could be used as a reliable tool to assess TDP-43 pathology in AD. Our work also raises the possibility that TDP-43 dysfunction and related changes in cryptic splicing could represent a common molecular mechanism shared between AD-TDP and FTLD-TDP.
