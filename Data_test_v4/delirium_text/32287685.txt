32287685|t|Legionella: a Fascinating Bacterium Uncovered in the Twentieth Century.
32287685|a|In July 1976, the American Legion held a conference at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, PA, to celebrate the nation's bicentennial. This convention resulted in transmission of a gram-negative bacterium to over 200 attendees, who developed a respiratory illness; 34 deaths were attributed to the infections. An investigation of the illness revealed a bacterium that had not been documented before. The disease became known as Legionnaires' disease, and the etiological agent was subsequently named Legionella pneumophila. This is the story of Legionella, with special emphasis on its ecological niche, the diagnosis of human infection, and its isolation from the environment. There are only a handful of diseases that debuted in the 20th or 21st century. They include Legionnaires' disease (the subject of this review), Lyme disease, AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and West Nile virus.
