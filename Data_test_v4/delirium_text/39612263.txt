39612263|t|Validity and Reliability of the Turkish Version of General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition.
39612263|a|The General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) was explicitly developed as a brief cognitive screening tool for general practitioners. It consists of a patient section testing cognition and an informant section asking historical questions. This study aimed to test the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of GPCOG-Tr on older Turkish adults. The study included two hundred thirty (n = 230) community-dwelling individuals aged at least 55. The GPCOG was translated, back-translated, and revised to determine the final GPCOG-Tr. The sample was divided into the patient group (with memory complaints) and the control group (without memory complaints). The GPCOG-Tr was compared against standard criteria for diagnosis of dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition), the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, the Mini-mental State Examination, The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) subscale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The reliability test was done on 30 participants after two weeks. The two-stage method of administering the GPCOG-Tr had a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 92%, a misclassification rate of 11.3%, and a positive predictive value of 92%. The test-retest correlation coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 0.98. The GPCOG-Tr total was at least equivalent to the MMSE and ADAS-Cog in detecting dementia. The GPCOG-Tr displayed solid psychometric properties, offering the general practitioners an efficient cognitive instrument for older Turkish people.
