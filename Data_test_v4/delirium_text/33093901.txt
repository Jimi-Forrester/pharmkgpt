33093901|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been previously implicated in number of diseases. However, the roles of circRNAs in photoaging remain elusive. In the present study, to understand if photoaging influences the levels of circRNA expression, the expression of circRNAs in ultraviolet A (UVA)-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts were profiled. A total of 128 circRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed (fold change >1.5; P<0.05) after UVA exposure, including 39 upregulated and 89 downregulated circRNAs. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes biological pathway analyses indicated that the differentially expressed circRNAs were associated with extracellular matrix organization and metabolism. The present study revealed an altered circRNA expression pattern in human dermal fibroblasts following UVA-irradiation. These results provide not only a basis for in-depth study of the mechanism of skin photoaging but also a new possibility for the prevention and treatment of photoaging and associated skin diseases.
