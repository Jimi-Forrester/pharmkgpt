38248323|t|The Effect of Liraglutide on Axon Regeneration and Functional Recovery after Peripheral Nerve Lesion.
38248323|a|Peripheral nerve injuries inflict severe consequences, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the potential of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in mitigating the consequences of peripheral nerve injury. The existing treatment methods for such injuries underscore the importance of ongoing translational research efforts. Thirty adult Wistar rats underwent sciatic nerve dissection and repair surgery. The nerves were surgically transected using micro scissors at a precise location located 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation site. The study included a control group and two experimental groups, one treated with saline (placebo group) and the other with liraglutide (experimental group) for 12 weeks. Motor function, electromyography (EMG), and biochemical and histopathological analyses were performed after 12 weeks of treatment. Electrophysiological assessments revealed that liraglutide improved the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and motor function compared to the saline-treated group. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated increased NGF expression, total axon number, and diameter and reduced fibrosis in the liraglutide group. Biochemical analyses illustrated liraglutide's antioxidative properties, evidenced by reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Galectin-3 levels were suppressed and GDF-11 levels were modulated by liraglutide, indicating anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Liraglutide is a promising therapeutic intervention for peripheral nerve injuries, promoting functional recovery and histopathological improvement. Its multifaceted positive impact, beyond glycemic control, suggests constructive effects on the acute and chronic inflammatory processes associated with peripheral neuropathy. These findings warrant further research to elucidate molecular mechanisms and facilitate clinical translation. The study contributes valuable insights to the growing understanding of GLP-1 receptor agonists' neuroprotective properties in the context of peripheral nerve injuries.
