The current study aimed to investigate novel molecular effectors of central alpha-klotho in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), while further deciphering its role regulating energy balance in both humans and mice. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from 22 adults undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgeries, and correlations between body weight and alpha-klotho were determined using an alpha-klotho enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. To investigate the effects of alpha-klotho on energy expenditure (EE), 2-day intracerebroventricular (ICV) treatment was performed in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice housed in TSE Phenomaster indirect calorimetry metabolic cages. Immunohistochemical staining for cFOS and patch clamp electrophysiology were used to determine the effects of central alpha-klotho on proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons. Additional stainings were performed to determine novel roles for central alpha-klotho to regulate non-neuronal cell populations in the ARC. Lastly, ICV pretreatment with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) or PI3kinase inhibitors was performed to determine the intracellular signaling involved in alpha-klotho-mediated regulation of ARC nuclei. RESULTS: Obese/overweight human subjects had significantly lower CSF alpha-klotho concentrations compared to lean counterparts (1,044 +- 251 vs. 1616 +- 218 pmol/L, respectively). Additionally, 2 days of ICV alpha-klotho treatment increased EE in DIO mice. alpha-Klotho had no effects on TH neuron activity but elicited varied responses in POMC neurons, with 44% experiencing excitatory and 56% experiencing inhibitory effects. Inhibitor experiments identified an alpha-klotho FGFR PI3kinase signaling mechanism in the regulation of ARC POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons. Acute ICV alpha-klotho treatment also increased phosphorylated ERK in ARC astrocytes via FGFR signaling. CONCLUSION: Our human CSF data provide the first evidence that impaired central alpha-klotho function may be involved in the pathophysiology of obesity. Furthermore, results in mouse models identify ARC POMC neurons and astrocytes as novel molecular effectors of central alpha-klotho. Overall, the current study highlights prominent roles of alpha-klotho FGFR PI3kinase signaling in the homeostatic regulation of ARC neurons and whole-body energy balance.
