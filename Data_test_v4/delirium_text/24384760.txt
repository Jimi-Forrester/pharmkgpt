24384760|t|Comparison of two methods for the estimation of stability of copper(II) bis-complexes with aromatic ligands relevant to Alzheimer's disease.
24384760|a|In order to compare the density functional theory (DFT) and the method with the molecular valence connectivity index of the 3rd order (3chiv) in the estimation of stability constants log beta2, we used copper(II) complexes with thioflavin-based intercalation compounds designed for application in Alzheimer's disease. Correlation of ten log beta2 values calculated by DFT with 3chiv yielded r=0.988 and S.E.=0.85. The correlations of indices I(NG), HOMA and 3chiv with log beta2, and the intercorrelations between the indices revealed the crucial influence of 3chiv on the prediction of the stability of these complexes.
