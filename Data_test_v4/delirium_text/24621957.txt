24621957|t|Identification and quantification of amyloid beta-related peptides in human plasma using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
24621957|a|Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase leads to the generation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). N-terminally or C-terminally truncated Abeta variants have been found in human cerebrospinal fluid and cultured cell media using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, the profile of plasma Abeta variants has not been revealed due to the difficulty of isolating Abeta from plasma. We present here for the first time studies of Abeta and related peptides in human plasma. Twenty-two Abeta-related peptides including novel peptides truncated before the beta-secretase site were detected in human plasma and 20 of the peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Using an internal standard, we developed a quantitative assay for the Abeta-related peptides and demonstrated plasma dilution linearity and the precision required for their quantitation. The present method should enhance the understanding of APP processing and clearance in AD progression.
