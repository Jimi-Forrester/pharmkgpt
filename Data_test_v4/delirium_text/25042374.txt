25042374|a|The pathophysiological mechanism of the serious and frequently occurring disorder delirium is poorly understood. Inflammation and sepsis are known risk factors for ICU delirium and therefore these patients are highly susceptible to delirium. Several studies have been performed to determine which cytokines are most associated with delirium but the results are inconclusive. Also, new biomarkers associated with brain dysfunction and cognitive impairment are still recognized and need to be studied to determine their relation with delirium. In this commentary we address some limitations concerning an interesting new study that warrants directions for future studies.
