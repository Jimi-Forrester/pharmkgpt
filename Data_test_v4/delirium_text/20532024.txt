20532024|a|This article investigates the role that psychiatrists play in the prescription of Alzheimer's disease therapies and the similarities and differences in treatment approach when compared to primary care physicians and neurologists. Psychiatrists account for 7.6 percent of new patient starts on Alzheimer's disease therapies. Similar to other prescribers, over 75 percent of product use by psychiatrists is for two diagnoses: 294-Other Organic Psychiatric Condition and 331-Cerebral Degeneration. The primary difference between psychiatrists and other prescribers is in the concomitant use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and seizure disorder therapies. Specifically, psychiatrists use antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics in combination with Alzheimer's disease therapies in 27 percent, 12 percent, and nine percent of treatment regimens, respectively. In contrast, these drug classes are used concomitantly in less than five percent of treatment regimens for patients treated by neurologists and primary care physicians. An expert commentary is provided.
