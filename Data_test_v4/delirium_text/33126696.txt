33126696|a|Preventing the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), improving the diagnosis, and slowing the progression of these diseases remain a challenge. The aim of this study was to elucidate the association between depression and dementia/AD and to identify possible relationships between these diseases and different sociodemographic and clinical features. In this regard, a case-control study was conducted in Spain in 2018-2019. The definition of a case was: A person >= 65 years old with dementia and/or AD and a score of 5-7 on the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). The sample consisted of 125 controls; among the cases, 96 had dementia and 74 had AD. The predictor variables were depression, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The results showed that depression, diabetes mellitus, and older age were associated with an increased likelihood of developing AD, with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 12.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.3-39.9), 2.8 (95% CI: 1.1-7.1) and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.1-1.2), respectively. Those subjects with treated dyslipidemia were less likely to develop AD (OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-1.1). Therefore, depression and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of dementia, whereas treated dyslipidemia has been shown to reduce this risk.
