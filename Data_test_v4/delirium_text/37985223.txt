37985223|a|INTRODUCTION: Although large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on AD, few have been conducted on continuous measures of memory performance and memory decline. METHODS: We conducted a cross-ancestry GWAS on memory performance (in 27,633 participants) and memory decline (in 22,365 participants; 129,201 observations) by leveraging harmonized cognitive data from four aging cohorts. RESULTS: We found high heritability for two ancestry backgrounds. Further, we found a novel ancestry locus for memory decline on chromosome 4 (rs6848524) and three loci in the non-Hispanic Black ancestry group for memory performance on chromosomes 2 (rs111471504), 7 (rs4142249), and 15 (rs74381744). In our gene-level analysis, we found novel genes for memory decline on chromosomes 1 (SLC25A44), 11 (BSX), and 15 (DPP8). Memory performance and memory decline shared genetic architecture with AD-related traits, neuropsychiatric traits, and autoimmune traits. DISCUSSION: We discovered several novel loci, genes, and genetic correlations associated with late-life memory performance and decline. HIGHLIGHTS: Late-life memory has high heritability that is similar across ancestries. We discovered four novel variants associated with late-life memory. We identified four novel genes associated with late-life memory. Late-life memory shares genetic architecture with psychiatric/autoimmune traits.
