36873202|t|Aberrant degree centrality of functional brain networks in subclinical depression and major depressive disorder.
36873202|a|Background: As one of the most common diseases, major depressive disorder (MDD) has a significant adverse impact on the li of patients. As a mild form of depression, subclinical depression (SD) serves as an indicator of progression to MDD. This study analyzed the degree centrality (DC) for MDD, SD, and healthy control (HC) groups and identified the brain regions with DC alterations. Methods: The experimental data were composed of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) from 40 HCs, 40 MDD subjects, and 34 SD subjects. After conducting a one-way analysis of variance, two-sample t-tests were used for further analysis to explore the brain regions with changed DC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of single index and composite index features was performed to analyze the distinguishable ability of important brain regions. Results: For the comparison of MDD vs. HC, increased DC was found in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in the MDD group. For SD vs. HC, the SD group showed a higher DC in the right STG and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and a smaller DC in the left IPL. For MDD vs. SD, increased DC in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right IPL, and left IPL, and decreased DC in the right STG and right MTG was found in the MDD group. With an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.779, the right STG could differentiate MDD patients from HCs and, with an AUC of 0.704, the right MTG could differentiate MDD patients from SD patients. The three composite indexes had good discriminative ability in each pairwise comparison, with AUCs of 0.803, 0.751, and 0.814 for MDD vs. HC, SD vs. HC, and MDD vs. SD, respectively. Conclusion: Altered DC in the STG, MTG, IPL, and MFG were identified in depression groups. The DC values of these altered regions and their combinations presented good discriminative ability between HC, SD, and MDD. These findings could help to find effective biomarkers and reveal the potential mechanisms of depression.
