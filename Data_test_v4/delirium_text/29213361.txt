29213361|t|Vascular dementia and the cholinergic pathways.
29213361|a|Vascular cognitive impairment/vascular dementia have been the subject of a large number of studies, due to their high prevalence and broad preventive and compensatory therapeutic potential. The knowledge of the cerebral anatomy correlated to the vascular territories of irrigation enables understanding of clinical manifestations, as well as classification into the several types of syndromic presentations. The central cholinergic system exercises important neuromodulatory functions on cerebral circuits related to cognitive and behavioral integration, as well as on vasomotor control related to cerebral blood flow adjustments. The acquisition of data on the anatomy of the cholinergic pathways, including the localization of the nuclei of the basal prosencephalon and the routes of their projections, established an important milestone. The knowledge of the vascular distribution and of the trajectories of the cholinergic pathways allows identification of the strategic points where a vascular lesion can cause interruption. The ensuing denervation leads to cholinergic hypofunction in the involved territories. This information proves important to better evaluate the sites of vascular lesions, emphasizing their strategic localizations in relation to the cholinergic pathways, and offering more robust foundations for treatment aiming at enhancing cholinergic activity.
