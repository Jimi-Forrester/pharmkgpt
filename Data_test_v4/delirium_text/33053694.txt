33053694|t|The Effect of Preoperative Carbohydrate Loading on Clinical and Biochemical Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.
33053694|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Preoperative fasting leads to metabolic stress and causes insulin resistance in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading (OCH) on outcome in patients undergoing planned cardiac surgery by systematically reviewing the literature and synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase/Cinahl/Web of Science/ClinicalTrials databases was performed to identify relevant RCTs from databased inception until 05/03/2020. We included studies that compared outcome measures between OCH with control (placebo or standard starvation). We conducted a random-effect meta-analysis of clinical and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Nine studies (N = 9) were included with a total of 507 patients. OCH significantly decreased aortic clamping duration (n = 151, standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.521 to -0.038, p = 0.023 and differences in means (DM) = -6.388, 95%CI = -11.246 to -1.529, p = 0.010). Patients from treatment groups had shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay (n = 202, SMD = -0.542, 95%CI = -0.789 to -0.295, p < 0.001 and DM = -25.925, 95%CI = -44.568 to -7.283, p = 0.006) and required fewer units of insulin postoperatively (n = 85, SMD = -0.349, 95%CI = -0.653 to -0.044, p = 0.025 and DM = -4.523, 95%CI = -8.417 to -0.630, p = 0.023). The necessity to use inotropic drugs was significantly lower in the OCH group (risk ratio (RR) = 0.795, 95%CI = 0.689 to 0.919, p = 0.002). All other primary outcomes did not reveal a significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative OCH in patients undergoing cardiac surgery demonstrated a 20% reduction in the use of inotropic drugs, a 50% reduction of the length of ICU stay, a 28% decrease in aortic clamping duration and a 35% decrease of postoperative insulin requirement.
