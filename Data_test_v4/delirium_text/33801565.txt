33801565|a|Some studies observed a benefit of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after treatment with safinamide in some non-motor symptoms (NMSs). The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of safinamide on NMS burden in PD. SAFINONMOTOR (an open-label study of the effectiveness of safinamide on non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients) is a prospective open-label single-arm study conducted in five centers from Spain. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline (V1) to the end of the observational period (6 months) (V4) in the non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) total score. Between May/2019 and February/2020 50 patients were included (age 68.5 +- 9.12 years; 58% females; 6.4 +- 5.1 years from diagnosis). At 6 months, 44 patients completed the follow-up (88%). The NMSS total score was reduced by 38.5% (from 97.5 +- 43.7 in V1 to 59.9 +- 35.5 in V4; p < 0.0001). By domains, improvement was observed in sleep/fatigue (-35.8%; p = 0.002), mood/apathy (-57.9%; p < 0.0001), attention/memory (-23.9%; p = 0.026), gastrointestinal symptoms (-33%; p = 0.010), urinary symptoms (-28.3%; p = 0.003), and pain/miscellaneous (-43%; p < 0.0001). Quality of life (QoL) also improved with a 29.4% reduction in the PDQ-39SI (from 30.1 +- 17.6 in V1 to 21.2 +- 13.5 in V4; p < 0.0001). A total of 21 adverse events in 16 patients (32%) were reported, 5 of which were severe (not related to safinamide). Dyskinesias and nausea were the most frequent (6%). Safinamide is well tolerated and improves NMS burden and QoL in PD patients with severe or very severe NMS burden at 6 months.
