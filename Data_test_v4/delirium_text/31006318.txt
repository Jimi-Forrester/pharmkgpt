31006318|t|A Needs Assessment of Family Physicians to Inform Development of Educational Resources on Antipsychotic Use in Dementia.
31006318|a|OBJECTIVES: Objectives of this study were to (1) assess the needs and preferred resources of Iowa physicians to inform the development of educational resources for best practice dementia care and (2) compare the responses of nursing home medical directors with nonmedical directors. METHODS: Of 498 physicians, 101 (20%) completed and returned the survey. Family physicians were obtained from a list of family physicians from the Iowa Board of Medical Examiners. Respondent answers were summarized and presented as total numbers and percentages in tables. Significant differences between medical directors and nonmedical directors were evaluated using chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Medical directors and nonmedical directors had similar preferences for resources used and information needs. Online resources, pocket guides, a handbook, consulting pharmacists, and facility in-services were the most commonly preferred sources of new information. Medical directors were significantly more aware of the Food and Drug Administration warning on antipsychotic use in dementia and treated more nursing home patients. No differences were observed between groups related to confidence in and use of nondrug strategies instead of antipsychotics to manage behavioral symptoms of dementia. CONCLUSION: The results of this survey illustrate physician preferences for information and resources on the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia. Information was used to inform the development of resources to aid physicians and other health care providers in making decisions about managing these symptoms.
