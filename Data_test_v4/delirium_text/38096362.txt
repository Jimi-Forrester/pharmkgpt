38096362|t|Probing Chemical Complexity of Amyloid Plaques in Alzheimer's Disease Mice using Hyperspectral Raman Imaging.
38096362|a|One of the distinctive pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid plaques within the brain of affected individuals. These plaques have traditionally been investigated using labeling techniques such as immunohistochemical imaging. However, the use of labeling can disrupt the structural integrity of the molecules being analyzed. Hence, it is imperative to employ label-free imaging methods for noninvasive examination of amyloid deposits in their native form, thereby providing more relevant information pertaining to AD. This study presents compelling evidence that label-free and nondestructive confocal Raman imaging is a highly effective approach for the identification and chemical characterization of amyloid plaques within cortical regions of an arcAbeta mouse model of AD. Furthermore, this investigation elucidates how the spatial correlation of Raman signals can be exploited to identify robust Raman marker bands and discern proteins and lipids from amyloid plaques. Finally, this study uncovers the existence of distinct types of amyloid plaques in the arcAbeta mouse brain, exhibiting significant disparities in terms of not only shape and size but also molecular composition.
