39524651|t|Design and Synthesis of BODIPY and Its Application in Inhibiting Intestinal Flora.
39524651|a|BODIPY-based photosensitizers were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, revealing structural modifications enhancing the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effects. This research may lead to new PDT strategies for treating bacterial infections, including those resistant to traditional antibiotics, and offers insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease through gut microbiota regulation.
