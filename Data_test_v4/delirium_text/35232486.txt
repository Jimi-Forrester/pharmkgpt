35232486|a|Glial cells play crucial roles in brain homeostasis and pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) injuries and diseases. However, the roles of these cells and the molecular mechanisms toward regeneration in the CNS have not been fully understood, especially the capacity of them toward demyelinating diseases. Therefore, there are still very limited therapeutic strategies to restore the function of adult CNS in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination, a spontaneous regeneration process in the CNS, requires the involvement of multiple cellular and extracellular components. Promoting remyelination by therapeutic interventions is a promising novel approach to restore the CNS function. Herein, we review the role of glial cells in CNS diseases and injuries. Particularly, we discuss the roles of glia and their functional interactions and regulatory mechanisms in remyelination, as well as the current therapeutic strategies for MS.
