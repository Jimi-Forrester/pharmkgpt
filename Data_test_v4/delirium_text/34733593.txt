34733593|t|Evaluation of Serum Electrolyte Levels in Patients With Anemia.
34733593|a|INTRODUCTION: Anemia is one of the most prevalent diseases globally. Various diseases have linked anemia with electrolyte disturbance. However, the local data are limited. In this study, we will determine the prevalence of electrolyte imbalance in anemic patients. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital from January 2021 to July 2021. A total of 500 anemic patients were enrolled in the study after informed consent. Another 500 non-anemic patients were enrolled as the control group. Blood was taken from both groups and send for assessment of electrolytes. RESULTS: Sodium levels were significantly lower in anemic patients compared to non-anemic patients (131.42 +- 0.82 meq/L vs. 135.57 +- 0.42 meq/L; p-value: <0.0001). Potassium levels were significantly higher in anemic patients compared to non-anemic participants (4.37 +- 0.12 meq/L vs. 4.09 +- 0.11 meq/L; p-value: <0.0001). Chloride levels were significantly higher in participants with anemia compared to non-anemic participants (103.92 +- 0.46 meq/L vs. 100.99 +- 0.41 meq/L). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that sodium levels and potassium levels are impacted in patients with anemia compared to patients without anemia. Close monitoring of serum electrolytes is suggested in patients with anemia to avoid complications and life-threatening conditions.
