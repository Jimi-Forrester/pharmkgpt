36290039|a|Antimicrobial therapy is often a life-saving medical intervention for inpatients and outpatients. Almost all medical disciplines are involved in this therapeutic procedure. Knowledge of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is important to avoid drug-related harm. Within the broad spectrum of antibiotic and antifungal therapy, most typical ADRs are known to physicians. The aim of this study was to evaluate relevant pharmacological aspects with which we are not so familiar and to provide further practical guidance. Individual pharmacotherapy management (IPM) as a synopsis of internal medicine and clinical pharmacology based on the entirety of the digital patient information with reference to drug information, guidelines, and literature research has been continuously performed for over 8 years in interdisciplinary intensive care and trauma and transplant patients. Findings from over 52,000 detailed medication analyses highlight critical ADRs and DDIs, especially in these vulnerable patients with polypharmacy. We present the most relevant ADRs and DDIs in antibiotic and antifungal pharmacology, which are less frequently considered in relation to neurologic, hemostaseologic, hematologic, endocrinologic, and cardiac complexities. Constant awareness and preventive strategies help avoid life-threatening manifestations of these inherent risks and ensure patient and drug safety in antimicrobial therapy.
