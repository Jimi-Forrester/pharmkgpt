17900056|a|AIMS: In our work, the factors affecting the plasma level of cytokine, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and liver function tests values in alcohol dependent males after alcohol abuse period were analysed. METHODS: We studied forty-seven alcoholics, without severe liver disease, who were abstinent no longer than 14 days before the study beginning. In all 24-h gastric pH-metry, endoscopy, serum liver function tests and TNF-alfa concentration were estimated. RESULTS: The amount of alcohol drunk within 90 days before the study start correlated with plasma activity of AST, ALT and GGT. The plasma presence of TNF-alpha in 26 subjects was found, but in 21 patients this cytokine level was lower than the method sensitivity (< 0.05 pg/ ml). Using the step-wise method of multiple regression we found, that TNF-alfa level at the study commencement was determined by history of delirium tremens, Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test score, length of alcohol dependence, ALT activity, % of total monitoring time with gastric pH >3, intensity of antral H. pylori colonisation and number of standard drinks drunk for 90 days before the study start (ns). Similar factors determined liver function tests values variance. CONCLUSION: Values of TNF-alpha and liver function tests two weeks after alcohol withdrawal were independently determined by gastric pH, H.pylori infection and smoking, which suggests their potential synergism with a hepatotoxic effect of alcohol drinking.
