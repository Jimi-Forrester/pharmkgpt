36301895|t|Microglia have limited influence on early prion pathogenesis, clearance, or replication.
36301895|a|Microglia (MG) are critical to host defense during prion infection, but the mechanism(s) of this neuroprotection are poorly understood. To better examine the influence of MG during prion infection, we reduced MG in the brains of C57BL/10 mice using PLX5622 and assessed prion clearance and replication using multiple approaches that included bioassay, immunohistochemistry, and Real-Time Quaking Inducted Conversion (RT-QuIC). We also utilized a strategy of intermittent PLX5622 treatments to reduce MG and allow MG repopulation to test whether new MG could alter prion disease progress. Lastly, we investigated the influence of MG using tga20 mice, a rapid prion model that accumulates fewer pathological features and less PrPres in the infected brain. In C57BL/10 mice we found that MG were excluded from the inoculation site early after infection, but Iba1 positive infiltrating monocytes/macrophage were present. Reducing MG in the brain prior to prion inoculation did not increase susceptibility to prion infection. Short intermittent treatments with PLX5622 in prion infected C57BL/10 mice after 80 dpi were unsuccessful at altering the MG population, gliosis, or survival. Additionally, MG depletion using PLX5622 in tga20 mice had only a minor impact on prion pathogenesis, indicating that the presence of MG might be less important in this fast model with less prion accumulation. In contrast to the benefits of MG against prion disease in late stages of disease, our current experiments suggest MG do not play a role in early prion pathogenesis, clearance, or replication.
