37392613|t|Is exposure to chemical pollutants associated with sleep outcomes? A systematic review.
37392613|a|Environmental exposures may influence sleep; however, the contributions of environmental chemical pollutants to sleep health have not been systematically investigated. We conducted a systematic review to identify, evaluate, summarize, and synthesize the existing evidence between chemical pollutants (air pollution, exposures related to the Gulf War and other conflicts, endocrine disruptors, metals, pesticides, solvents) and dimensions of sleep health (architecture, duration, quality, timing) and disorders (sleeping pill use, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing)). Of the 204 included studies, results were mixed; however, the synthesized evidence suggested associations between particulate matter, exposures related to the Gulf War, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, and pesticide exposure with worse sleep quality; exposures related to the Gulf War, aluminum, and mercury with insomnia and impaired sleep maintenance; and associations between tobacco smoke exposure with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing, particularly in pediatric populations. Possible mechanisms relate to cholinergic signaling, neurotransmission, and inflammation. Chemical pollutants are likely key determinants of sleep health and disorders. Future studies should aim to evaluate environmental exposures on sleep across the lifespan, with a particular focus on developmental windows and biological mechanisms, as well as in historically marginalized or excluded populations.
