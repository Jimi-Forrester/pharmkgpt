36557062|t|Relationship between Fasting Times and Emergence Delirium in Children Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging under Sedation.
36557062|a|Background and Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between preoperative fasting time, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and postoperative emergence delirium (ED) in pediatric patients undergoing MRI under sedation. Materials and Methods: 110 pediatric patients were included in the study. Preoperative fasting (solid-fluid) time and FBG were recorded. The development of ED in the patients who underwent MRI under sedation was evaluated with the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) value for 30 min every 5 min in the recovery room. PAED score of >=10 was grouped as having ED, and a PAED score of <10 as without ED at any time. The PAED scores were compared with other variables, ASA, age, weight, MRI examination time, and FBG level and fasting times. The risk factors affecting the occurrence of ED were examined. Results: Mean age was 3.94 +- 1.53 years, mean FBG was 106.97 +- 12.53 mg/dL, fasting time was 10.75 +- 2.61 h, solid food fasting time was 11.92 +- 2.33 h, and thirst time was 10.74 +- 2.58 h. FBG was never associated with PAED measurement at any time (p > 0.05). There was a weak positive correlation between the fasting time and the 0th, 5th, and 10th minute PAED score (r = 0.225; p = 0.018, r = 0.195; p = 0.041, r = 0.195; p = 0.041). There was a weak positive correlation between the solid food fasting time and the PAED score at the 0th, 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th minutes (r = 0.382; p < 0.001, r = 0.357; p < 0.001, r = 0.345; p < 0.001, r = 0.360; p < 0.001, r = 0.240; p < 0.001). There was a weak positive correlation between thirst time and the PAED score at the 0th, 5th, and 10th minutes (r = 0.222; p = 0.020. r = 0.192; p = 0.045, r = 0.199; p = 0.037). The incidence of ED at any time was 34.5%. Conclusions: Prolonged fasting time, solid food fasting time and thirst time are risk factors for developing postoperative ED in children undergoing MRI under sedation.
