38178837|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. To address this, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled study to investigate the therapeutic potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on patients with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)- positive AD. Methods: Participants already undergoing pharmacological treatment and testing positive for amyloid PET were divided into Active-tDCS (n = 8) and Sham-tDCS (n = 8) groups. For 12 weeks, participants or their caregivers administered daily bi-frontal tDCS (YMS-201B+, Ybrain Inc., Seongnam, Korea) at home (2 mA, 30 min). Pre- and post-intervention assessments included neuropsychological tests and blood sample measurements for oligomerized beta-amyloid. Results: The Active-tDCS group demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive domains such as language abilities, verbal memory, and attention span and in frontal lobe functions compared to the Sham-tDCS group. Furthermore, the Active-tDCS group showed a marked reduction in post-intervention plasma Abeta oligomerization tendency level, suggesting changes in pivotal AD-associated biomarkers. Discussion: Our results emphasize the potential therapeutic benefits of tDCS for mild AD patients with amyloid PET positivity and stress the urgency for broader research, considering the global challenges of dementia and the need to pursue innovative therapeutic strategies.
