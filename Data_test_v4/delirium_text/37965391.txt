37965391|a|Our skin and nervous system are tightly connected. Numerous dermatomes on our skin provide sensory information to the brain. Because skin changes can occasionally be the first sign of a neurological problem, understanding skin alterations is crucial as it can indicate early about the underlying condition, which can affect the prognosis of the disease. In these cases, the dermatologists' and neurologists' skills are complementary to each other. In this article, we have categorized diseases with neuro-cutaneous manifestations under different headings, such as infections, metabolic diseases, connective tissue disorders, genodermatoses, nutritional deficiency, and the diagnostic criteria of some commonly encountered diseases. Through tabulation, it has been observed that this categorization can serve as a useful reference for managing day-to-day patients who are either diagnosed with the diseases mentioned above or suspected to have the conditions.
