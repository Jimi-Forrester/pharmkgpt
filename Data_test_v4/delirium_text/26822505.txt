26822505|t|ToF-SIMS analysis of amyloid beta aggregation on different lipid membranes.
26822505|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are considered to be strongly related to Alzheimer's disease. Abeta peptides form a beta-sheet structure on hard lipid membranes and it would aggregate to form amyloid fibrils, which are toxic to cells. However, the aggregation mechanism of Abeta is not fully understood. To evaluate the influence of the lipid membrane condition for Abeta aggregation, the adsorption forms of Abeta (1-40) on mixture membranes of lipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and cholesterol beta-d-glucoside (beta-CG) were investigated by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. As a result, Abeta adsorbed along the localized DMPC lipid on the mixture lipid membranes, whereas it was adsorbed homogeneously on the pure DMPC and beta-CG membranes. Moreover, amino acid fragments that mainly existed in the n-terminal of Abeta (1-40) peptide were strongly detected on the localized DMPC region. These results suggested that the Abeta was adsorbed along the localized DMPC lipid with a characteristic orientation. These findings suggest that the hardness of the membrane is very sensitive to coexisting materials and that surface hardness is important for aggregation of Abeta.
