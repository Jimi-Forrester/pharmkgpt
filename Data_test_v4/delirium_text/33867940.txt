33867940|a|Age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are multifactorial and have diverse genetic and environmental risk factors. Despite the complex nature of the diseases, there is long-standing, and growing, evidence linking microbial infection to the development of AD dementia, which we summarize in this article. Also, we highlight emerging research findings that support a role for parainfection in the pathophysiology of AMD, a disease of the neurosensory retina that has been shown to share risk factors and pathological features with AD. Acute neurological infections, such as Bacterial Meningitis (BM), trigger inflammatory events that permanently change how the brain functions, leading to lasting cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation likewise is a known pathological event that occurs in the early stages of chronic age-related neurodegenerative diseases AD and AMD and might be triggered as a parainfectious event. To date, at least 16 microbial pathogens have been linked to the development of AD; on the other hand, investigation of a microbe-AMD relationship is in its infancy. This mini-review article provides a synthesis of existing evidence indicating a contribution of parainfection in the aetiology of AD and of emerging findings that support a similar process in AMD. Subsequently, it describes the major immunopathological mechanisms that are common to BM and AD/AMD. Together, this evidence leads to our proposal that both AD and AMD may have an infectious aetiology that operates through a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to deleterious outcomes. Last, it draws fresh insights from the existing literature about potential therapeutic options for BM that might alleviate neurological disruption associated with infections, and which could, by extension, be explored in the context of AD and AMD.
