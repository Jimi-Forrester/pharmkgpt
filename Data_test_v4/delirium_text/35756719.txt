35756719|t|Nutritional components as mitigators of cellular senescence in organismal aging: a comprehensive review.
35756719|a|The process of cellular senescence is rapidly emerging as a modulator of organismal aging and disease. Targeting the development and removal of senescent cells is considered a viable approach to achieving improved organismal healthspan and lifespan. Nutrition and health are intimately linked and an appropriate dietary regimen can greatly impact organismal response to stress and diseases including during aging. With a renewed focus on cellular senescence, emerging studies demonstrate that both primary and secondary nutritional elements such as carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, polyphenols, and probiotics can influence multiple aspects of cellular senescence. The present review describes the recent molecular aspects of cellular senescence-mediated understanding of aging and then studies available evidence of the cellular senescence modulatory attributes of major and minor dietary elements. Underlying pathways and future research directions are deliberated to promote a nutrition-centric approach for targeting cellular senescence and thus improving human health and longevity.
