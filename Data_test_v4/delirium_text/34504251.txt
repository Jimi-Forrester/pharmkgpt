34504251|a|We performed pupillometer testing on 132 patients with Parkinson's disease, stratified into two groups according to the disease stage. Neurological examinations and pupillometry were performed in the ON state. Patients in the Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 and 2 comprised the early group, and patients in stages 3-5 formed the late group. We performed age- and sex-matched (2:1) propensity score matching to compensate for the effect of age on pupil light reflex. Eight pupillometer parameters were measured and compared between the two groups. After the propensity score matching, the early group had 64 patients and the late group had 32 patients. The late group had a longer disease duration and took a higher levodopa equivalent dose than the early group. The constriction velocity (P = 0.006) and maximum constriction velocity (P = 0.005) were significantly faster in the early group than in the late group. Pupil size, minimum diameter, and dilation velocity were similar in both groups. The pupillary contraction velocity decreased with the disease progression, suggesting that the progression of Parkinson's disease could be identified by the pupil constriction velocity.
