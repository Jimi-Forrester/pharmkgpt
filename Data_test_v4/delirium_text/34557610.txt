34557610|t|Detecting a valid screening method for sarcopenia in acute care setting.
34557610|a|OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is prevalent among geriatric patients and it has a high rate of negative health related outcomes. Diagnostic and assessment approaches are not always feasible. The aim of the study was to detect a valid screening tool for sarcopenia that could be used easily in acute care setting. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in Geriatrics department, Ain Shams University Hospital. 127 inpatient elderly participants were recruited. Sarcopenia was defined according to the European Working Groups on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria as low skeletal muscle mass with either low handgrip strength or slow gait speed. Muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Two screening methods for sarcopenia were investigated, namely SARC-F questionnaire and Ishii equation including age, handgrip, and calf circumference (CC). RESULTS: Both SARC-F questionnaire and Ishii equation can detect sarcopenia in both genders and both showed good agreement with the standard diagnostic method. Combining SARC-F to Ishii equation improved the diagnostic accuracy, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: SARC-F and Ishii equation could be used as a valid simple screening tool in acute hospital setting. Combing these two screening tools resulted in better diagnostic accuracy with higher sensitivity and specificity.
