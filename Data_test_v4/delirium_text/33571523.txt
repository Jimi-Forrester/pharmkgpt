33571523|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) has been recognized as an early trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) leading to synaptic and cognitive impairments. Abeta can alter neuronal signaling through interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), contributing to synaptic dysfunction in AD. The three major nAChR subtypes in the hippocampus are composed of alpha7-, alpha4beta2-, and alpha3beta4-nAChRs. Abeta selectively affects alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChRs, but not alpha3beta4-nAChRs in hippocampal neurons, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitation. However, how nAChR subtype selectivity for Abeta affects synaptic function in AD is not completely understood. Here, we showed that Abeta associated with alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChRs but not alpha3beta4-nAChRs. Computational modeling suggested that two amino acids in alpha7-nAChRs, arginine 208 and glutamate 211, were important for the interaction between Abeta and alpha7-containing nAChRs. These residues are conserved only in the alpha7 and alpha4 subunits. We therefore mutated these amino acids in alpha7-containing nAChRs to mimic the alpha3 subunit and found that mutant alpha7-containing receptors were unable to interact with Abeta. In addition, mutant alpha3-containing nAChRs mimicking the alpha7 subunit interact with Abeta. This provides direct molecular evidence for how Abeta selectively interacted with alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChRs, but not alpha3beta4-nAChRs. Selective coactivation of alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChRs also sufficiently reversed Abeta-induced AMPA receptor dysfunction, including Abeta-induced reduction of AMPA receptor phosphorylation and surface expression in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, costimulation of alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChRs reversed the Abeta-induced disruption of long-term potentiation. These findings support a novel mechanism for Abeta's impact on synaptic function in AD, namely, the differential regulation of nAChR subtypes.
