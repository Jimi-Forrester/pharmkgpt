21644059|a|RATIONALE: Enhancement of histaminergic neurotransmission or histaminergic plus cholinergic neurotransmission may represent novel strategies for improving cognition in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a novel histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist (MK-3134), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), and their combination in attenuating the cognitive impairment associated with scopolamine. METHODS: Thirty-one subjects were randomized, and 28 completed this double-blind, placebo-controlled, five-period crossover study. Cognition was assessed using the Groton Maze Learning Task (GMLT) as the primary outcome measure. The two primary hypotheses were that donepezil 10 mg and MK-3134 25 mg, respectively, would attenuate scopolamine (0.5 mg)-induced impairment as measured by the GMLT over the first 12 h after scopolamine administration (AUC(1-12)  (h)). A secondary hypothesis was that the combination of donepezil and MK-3134 would attenuate scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment to a greater extent than either agent alone as measured by the GMLT AUC(1-12 h). RESULTS: The primary and secondary hypotheses were not met. Upon examining the time course of the scopolamine effects (an exploratory objective), peak effects were generally observed around 2 h after scopolamine administration. Administration of MK-3134 or donepezil improved performance on the GMLT at the 2-h time point, rather than AUC(1-12 h), compared with scopolamine alone. Moreover, it appeared that the combination of MK-3134 and donepezil blunted the scopolamine effect to a greater extent than either drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory analyses provide evidence for cognitive improvement through inverse agonism of the H3 histamine receptor and for cooperation between human cholinergic and histaminergic neurotransmitter systems.
