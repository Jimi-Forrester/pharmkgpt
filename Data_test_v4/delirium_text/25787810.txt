25787810|a|Amyloid fibrils result from a particular type of protein aggregation, and have been linked with various disorders, including neurodegenerative ones. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta (abeta) fibrils are detected in patients' brain, in the amyloid plaques. These fibrils can be produced in vitro, and their injection into animals' brains generates an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. Based on the structural similarity of amyloid fibrils that are formed from different proteins, we hypothesized that injecting insulin amyloid fibrils into rats' brains could result in amyloid plaque formation. Fourteen male Wistar rats were divided into control and experimental groups (n = 7). The experimental group was bilaterally injected with insulin amyloid in the hippocampus. Seven days after injection, a shuttle box test was performed and the experimental group's memory was found to be impaired. Histological investigation of these rats' brain showed the formation of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus. A limited test has provided preliminary evidence for the stability of these plaques up to 35 days. Further complementary studies are required to fully validate the proposed procedure, which is simple and relatively low cost, and could be suggested as an alternative to models generated with abeta fibrils.
