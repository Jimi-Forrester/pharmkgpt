31306078|a|The diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) can only be confirmed by abnormal protease-resistant prion protein accumulation in post-mortem brain tissue. The relationships between sCJD and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins such as 14-3-3, tau, and alpha-synuclein (a-syn) have been investigated for their potential value in pre-mortem diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning (DL) methods have attracted attention in neurodegenerative disease research. We established DL-aided pre-mortem diagnostic methods for CJD using multiple CSF biomarkers to improve their discriminatory sensitivity and specificity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed on phospho-tau (p-tau), total-tau (t-tau), a-syn, and beta-amyloid (1-42), and western blot analysis was performed for 14-3-3 protein from CSF samples of 49 sCJD and 256 non-CJD Korean patients, respectively. The deep neural network structure comprised one input, five hidden, and one output layers, with 20, 40, 30, 20 and 12 hidden unit numbers per hidden layer, respectively. The best performing DL model demonstrated 90.38% accuracy, 83.33% sensitivity, and 92.5% specificity for the three-protein combination of t-tau, p-tau, and a-syn, and all other patients in a separate CSF set (n = 15) with other neuronal diseases were correctly predicted to not have CJD. Thus, DL-aided pre-mortem diagnosis may provide a suitable tool for discriminating CJD patients from non-CJD patients.
