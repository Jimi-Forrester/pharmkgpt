35280246|t|The Experience of Shiatsu for Care Partners and Persons Living With Dementia: a Qualitative Pilot Study.
35280246|a|Background: Dementia is a progressive neurological condition that affects over 50 million people. It impacts quality of life for those diagnosed, their care partners, and the relationship between the two. Strategies to enhance quality of life and relationships are needed. Shiatsu may improve care partners' well-being. Using touch through shiatsu may offer a meaningful way for care partners to interact with their partners living with dementia. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore care partners' experience of using both self-shiatsu and shiatsu with their partner, as well as to explore care partners' perceptions of the impact of shiatsu on the quality of their relationship. Setting: This study took place at a centre providing programs for persons living with dementia and their care partners. Participants: Participants were current and former attendees of the centre's programs. Research Design: This was a qualitative study with an interpretive/descriptive approach. Care partners were taught self-shiatsu to manage stress and a simplified, short shiatsu routine to use with their partner. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit care partners' experiences and explore their ongoing use of shiatsu at two and six weeks post-workshop. Findings: Four care partners completed the study. A wide range of experiences with shiatsu were described, representing four key themes: Enhanced Awareness, Integrating Shiatsu into the Relationship, Barriers and Facilitators, and Potential and Possibility. Two found self-shiatsu beneficial. Using shiatsu with their partner was a favourable experience for only one, who found it a pleasant way to connect and interact. None of the participants felt using shiatsu with their partners affected their relationship quality. Conclusions: The findings of this study are inconclusive. Self-shiatsu may be a helpful self-management approach for some care partners, but not for others. Shiatsu for persons living with dementia may not fit into the routines of many care partners. For others, however, it may offer a means to connect.
