38666616|t|Raman spectroscopy in the study of amyloid formation and phase separation.
38666616|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, share a common pathological feature of amyloid structure accumulation. However, the structure-function relationship between these well-ordered, beta-sheet-rich, filamentous protein deposits and disease etiology remains to be defined. Recently, an emerging hypothesis has linked phase separation, a process involved in the formation of protein condensates, to amyloid formation, suggesting that liquid protein droplets serve as loci for amyloid initiation. To elucidate how these processes contribute to disease progression, tools that can directly report on protein secondary structural changes are needed. Here, we review recent studies that have demonstrated Raman spectroscopy as a powerful vibrational technique for interrogating amyloid structures; one that offers sensitivity from the global secondary structural level to specific residues. This probe-free technique is further enhanced via coupling to a microscope, which affords structural data with spatial resolution, known as Raman spectral imaging (RSI). In vitro and in cellulo applications of RSI are discussed, highlighting studies of protein droplet aging, cellular internalization of fibrils, and Raman imaging of intracellular water. Collectively, utilization of the myriad Raman spectroscopic methods will contribute to a deeper understanding of protein conformational dynamics in the complex cellular milieu and offer potential clinical diagnostic capabilities for protein misfolding and aggregation processes in disease states.
