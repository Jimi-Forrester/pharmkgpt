36802820|t|Quetiapine for the Treatment of Pediatric Delirium.
36802820|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication of critical illness, with a prevalence of 25% among pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Pharmacological treatment options for ICU delirium are limited to off-label use of antipsychotics, but their benefit remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate quetiapine effectiveness for the treatment of delirium in critically ill pediatric patients and to describe the safety profile of quetiapine. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective review of patients aged <= 18 years who screened positive for delirium via the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD >= 9) and received >= 48 hours of quetiapine therapy was conducted. The relationship between quetiapine and deliriogenic medication doses was evaluated. RESULTS: This study included 37 patients who received quetiapine for the treatment of delirium. The change in sedation requirements before quetiapine initiation to 48 hours after the highest quetiapine dose demonstrated a downward trend; 68% of patients had a decrease in opioid requirements and 43% of patients had a decrease in benzodiazepine requirements. The median CAPD score at baseline was 17 and the median CAPD score at 48 hours after the highest dose was 16. Three patients experienced QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc >= 500), although none developed dysrhythmias. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Quetiapine did not have a statistically significant impact on deliriogenic medication doses. There were minimal changes in QTc and dysrhythmias were not identified. Therefore, quetiapine can be safe to use in our pediatric patients but further studies are needed to find an effective dose.
