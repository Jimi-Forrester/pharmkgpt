37222773|a|The mechanisms of calcium ([Ca2+]) signaling in various human cells have been widely analyzed by scientists due to its crucial role in human organs like the heartbeat, muscle contractions, bone activity, brain functionality, etc. No study is reported for interdependent [Ca2+] and IP3 mechanics regulating the release of ATP in neuron cells during Ischemia in Alzheimer's disease advancement. In the present investigation, a finite element method (FEM) is framed to explore the interdependence of spatiotemporal [Ca2+] and IP3 signaling mechanics and its role in ATP release during Ischemia as well as in the advancement of Alzheimer's disorder in neuron cells. The results provide us insights of the mutual spatiotemporal impacts of [Ca2+] and IP3 mechanics as well as their contributions to ATP release during Ischemia in neuron cells. The results obtained for the mechanics of interdependent systems differ significantly from the results of simple independent system mechanics and provide new information about the processes of the two systems. From this study, it is concluded that neuronal disorders cannot only be simply attributed to the disturbance caused directly in the processes of calcium signaling mechanics, but also to the disturbances caused in IP3 regulation mechanisms impacting the calcium regulation in the neuron cell and ATP release.
