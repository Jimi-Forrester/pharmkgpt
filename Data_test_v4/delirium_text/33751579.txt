33751579|t|Clinical applications for exosomes: Are we there yet?
33751579|a|Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles essential for cell-cell communication in health and disease with the ability to transport nucleic acids, functional proteins and other metabolites. Their clinical use as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic carriers has become a major field of research over recent years, generating rapidly expanding scientific interest and financial investment. Their reduced immunogenicity compared to liposomes or viral vectors and their ability to cross major physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier make them an appealing and innovative option as biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Here, we review the latest clinical developments of exosome biotechnology for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including the most recent COVID-19-related exosome-based clinical trials. We present current exosome engineering strategies for optimal clinical safety and efficacy, and assess the technology developed for good manufacturing practice compliant scaling up and storage approaches along with their limitations in pharmaceutical industry.
