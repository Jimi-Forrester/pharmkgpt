33205929|a|Cognitive impairment or delirium occurs in about 40% of elderly patients after surgery. The increasing number of elderly people has led to a significant increase in the number of cases of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This is one of the most important medical and social problems, the analysis of which is especially difficult, since it requires the coordination of a large number of specialties: anesthesiology, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, neuropsychology, as well as fundamental neurosciences. Thus, a systematic multidisciplinary approach that takes into account all possible factors affecting the condition of patients should be considered. The article is devoted to the main aspects of the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of POCD.
