8675933|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe problems of dementia patients whose spousal caregivers are also cognitively impaired. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: The geriatric assessment clinic at University of California, San Diego, which is one center for the California State sponsored Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Center Program. PATIENTS: During the period from January 1992 through May 1994, 65 patients completed the assessment and met the entry criteria of being demented and having a spousal caregiver. Twelve of the spouses scored six or more error points on the Katzman Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test. MEASUREMENTS: Patient data included age, living situation, other caregivers, use of formal and informal support systems, profiles of medical, cognitive, and functional ability, caregivers interactions, and recommendations from the evaluation. MAIN RESULTS: Dementia patients with cognitively impaired spouses utilized fewer community resources (P = .021) and experienced difficulty with medication compliance (P = .041) more often than those with cognitively normal spousal caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Older caregivers of patients suffering from dementia should be screened for cognitive problems.
