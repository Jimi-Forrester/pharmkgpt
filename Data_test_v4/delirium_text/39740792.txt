39740792|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies on neuroimaging findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with hallucinations and delusions have yielded inconsistent results. We aimed to systematically review neuroimaging findings of delusions and hallucinations in AD patients to describe the most prominent neuroimaging features. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search in three online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in June 2023. We included studies that reported neuroimaging features of AD patients with delusion, hallucination, or psychosis. RESULTS: After the screening, 34 studies with 2241 AD patients were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis. On the basis of the included studies, there are significant changes in the volume and perfusion levels of broad brain areas, including the hippocampus, amygdala, insula, cingulate, occipital, frontal, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices in these patients. Moreover, AD patients with psychosis, hallucinations, or delusions reflected different EEG waves compared to AD patients without these disorders. CONCLUSION: The results of our review provided evidence about the neuroimaging alterations in AD patients suffering from psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions using different imaging methods. AD patients with psychosis, hallucinations, or delusions have significant differences in the volume and perfusion levels of various brain regions along with alterations in EEG waves and biological molecules compared to patients with only AD.
