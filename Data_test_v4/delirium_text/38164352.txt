38164352|t|Effect of 10 Minutes of Prewarming and Prewarmed Intravenous Fluid Administration on the Core Temperature of Patients Undergoing Transurethral Surgery under General Anesthesia.
38164352|a|Background: Patients undergoing transurethral urologic procedures using bladder irrigation are at increased risk of perioperative hypothermia. Thirty minutes of prewarming prevents perioperative hypothermia. However, its routine application is impractical. We evaluated the effect of 10 minutes of prewarming combined with the intraoperative administration of warmed intravenous fluid on patients' core temperature. Methods: Fifty patients undergoing transurethral bladder or prostate resection under general anesthesia were included in this study and were randomly allocated to either the control group or the prewarming group. Patients in the prewarming group were warmed for 10 minutes before anesthesia induction with a forced-air warming device and received warmed intravenous fluid during operations. The patients in control group did not receive preoperative forced-air warming and were administered room-temperature fluid. Participants' core body temperature was measured on arrival at the preoperative holding area (T0), on entering the operating room, immediately after anesthesia induction, and in 10-minute intervals from then on until the end of the operation (Tend), on entering PACU, and in 10-minute intervals during the postanesthesia care unit stay. The groups' incidence of intraoperative hypothermia, change in core temperature (T0 - Tend), and postoperative thermal comfort were compared. Results: The incidence of hypothermia was 64% and 29% in the control group and prewarming group, respectively (P = 0.015). Change in core temperature was 0.93 +- 0.3  C and 0.55 +- 0.4  C in the control group and prewarming group, respectively (P = 0.0001). Thermal comfort was better in the prewarming group (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Ten minutes of prewarming combined with warmed intravenous fluid significantly decreased the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia and resulted in better thermal comfort in patients undergoing transurethral urologic surgery under general anesthesia.
