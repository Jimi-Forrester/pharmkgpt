26398362|t|Onset of psychosis at age 81? With regard to frontal lobe syndromes.
26398362|a|When the frontal lobe of the brain is affected important behavioral changes may occur mainly at the level of executive functioning, i.e., planning, decision-making, judgment and self-perception. However, the behavioral changes may be of different nature with marked indifference and apathy. We report a clinical case of an 81-year-old patient with sudden onset of behavioral changes that were initially interpreted as an acute confusional episode of infectious etiology, but actually they were due to an ischemic lesion in the frontal lobe.
