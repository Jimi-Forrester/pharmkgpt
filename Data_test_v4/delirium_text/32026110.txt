32026110|t|Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index and Controlling Nutritional Status Score can predict postoperative 180-day mortality in hip fracture surgeries.
32026110|a|BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) based on serum albumin level and body weight and the Controlling Nutritional Status Score (CONUT) based on serum albumin level, total cholesterol level, and total lymphocyte count were created to evaluate objectively a patient's nutritional status in 2005. Here we validated the usefulness of the GNRI and the CONUT as a prognostic factor of the 180-day mortality in patients who underwent hip fracture surgeries. We retrospectively collected data from patients with hip surgeries performed from January 2012 to December 2018. The variables required for the GNRI and the CONUT and the factors presumably associated with postoperative mortality including the patients' characteristics were collected from the medical charts. Intergroup differences were assessed with the chi2 test with Yates' correlation for continuity in category variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for differences in continuous variables. We validated the power of the GNRI and the CONUT values to distinguish patients who died <= 180 days post-surgery from those who did not, by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The correlation between these two models was analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation (rho). RESULTS: We retrospectively examined the cases of 607 patients aged 87 +- 6 (range 70-102) years old. The 180-day mortality rate was 5.4% (n = 33 non-survivors). The GNRI value in the non-survivors was 83 +- 9 (range 66-111), which was significantly lower than that in the survivors at 92 +- 9 (range 64-120). The CONUT value in the non-survivors was 6 +- 3 (range 1-11), which was significantly higher than that in the survivors at 4 +- 2 (range 0-11). The AUC value to predict the 180-day mortality was 0.74 for the GNRI and 0.72 for the CONUT. The rho value between these two models was 0.61 in the total of 607 patients and was 0.78 in the 33 non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the GNRI and the CONUT are a simple and useful tool to predict the 180-day mortality in patients who have undergone a hip surgery.
