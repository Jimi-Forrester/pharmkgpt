37959827|t|Synthesis, Spectroscopic Characterization, Catalytic and Biological Activity of Oxidovanadium(V) Complexes with Chiral Tetradentate Schiff Bases.
37959827|a|New oxidovanadium(V) complexes, VOL1-VOL10, with chiral tetradentate Schiff bases obtained by monocondensation reaction of salicylaldehyde derivatives with 1S,2S-(+)-2-amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3-propanediol. All complexes have been characterized using different spectroscopic methods, viz. IR, UV-Vis, circular dichroism, one- (1H, 51V) and two-dimensional (COSY, NOESY) NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the catalytic ability of all compounds in the epoxidation of styrene, cyclohexene, and its naturally occurring monoterpene derivatives, i.e., S(-)-limonene and (-)-alpha-pinene has also been studied, using two different oxidants, i.e., aqueous 30% H2O2 or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). In addition, the biological properties of these chiral oxidovanadium(V) compounds, but also cis-dioxidomolybdenum(VI) complexes with the same chiral Schiff bases, were studied. Their cytotoxic and cytoprotective activity studies with the HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells revealed a concentration-dependent effect in the range of 10-100 muM. Moreover, vanadium(V) complexes, in contrast to cis-dioxidomolybdenum(VI) compounds, demonstrated higher cytotoxicity and lack of cytoprotective ability against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity.
