38282759|a|Introduction: Theoretical models of health behavior are important guides for disease prevention and detection, treatment and rehabilitation, and promotion and maintenance of physical and mental health, but there are no intervention studies related to differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that use theoretical models of health as a guide. In this study, we used a microblogging platform as an intervention vehicle and mobile patient-doctor interactive health education as a means of intervention, with the aim of improving the health behaviors of DTC patients as well as the corresponding clinical outcomes. Methods: This research project is a quantitative methodological study, and the trial will be a single-blind, single-center randomized controlled trial conducted at the Fourth Hospital of Harbin Medical University in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province. The study subjects are patients over 18 years of age with differentiated thyroid cancer who were given radioactive iodine-131 therapy as well as endocrine therapy after radical surgery for thyroid cancer. The intervention group will receive MTM-mhealth, and the realization of health education will rely on the smart terminal WeChat platform. Routine discharge education will be given to the control group at discharge. The primary outcome will be change in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up, and secondary outcomes will include change in self-management behavior, social cognitive and psychological, and metabolic control. Discussion: This study will explore a feasible mHealth intervention program applied to a population of DTC patients using the Multi-theory model of health behavior change (MTM) as a guide, with the aim of evaluating the MTM-based intervention program for clinical outcome improvement in DTC patients, as well as determining the effectiveness of the MTM-based intervention program in improving self-management skills in DTC patients. The results of this study will indicate the feasibility as well as the effectiveness of the application of health theoretical modeling combined with mHealth applications in disease prognostic health management models, and provide policy recommendations and technological translations for the development of mobility-based health management applications in the field of health management.
