38399417|t|Identification of Factors Associated with Mortality in the Elderly Population with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results from a Longitudinal Observational Study from Romania.
38399417|a|The progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to a hospitalization rate of 20%. The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases with age, resulting in severe and atypical clinical forms of the disease. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly population can be attributed to several factors, including the overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, immunosenescence, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota that facilitate the cytokine storm. In light of these observations, we conducted a retrospective analysis based on prospectively collected data between 23 December 2021 and 30 April 2022 (the fourth wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection). We analyzed patients aged over 60 years who were hospitalized in a county hospital in Romania. The primary objective of our study was to assess the risk factors for an unfavorable outcome, while the secondary objective was to assess the clinical and baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients. We included 287 cases with a complete electronic medical record from this available cohort of patients. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate a group of 127 patients that progressed, unfortunately, toward an unfavorable outcome versus 160 patients with a favorable outcome. We used the Combined Ordinal Scale of Severity that combines the WHO ordinal scale and the degrees of inflammation to assess the severity of the patients at the time of the initial assessment. The age group between 70 and 79 years had the highest percentage, accounting for 48.0%-61 patients, of the deceased patients. We noted statistically significant differences between groups related to other cardiovascular diseases, nutritional status, hematological diseases, other neurological/mental or digestive disorders, and other comorbidities. Regarding the nutritional status of the patients, there was a statistically significant unfavorable outcome for all the age groups and the patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2, p = 0.004. The presence of these factors was associated with an unfavorable outcome. Our results indicate that with the presence of cough, there was a statistically significant favorable outcome in the age group over 80 years, p <= 0.049. In terms of the presence of dyspnea in all groups of patients, it was associated with an unfavorable outcome, p <= 0.001. In our study, we analyzed laboratory test results to assess the level of inflammation across various WHO categories, focusing on the outcome groups determined by the average values of specific biomarkers. Our findings show that, with the exception of IL-6, all other biomarkers tend to rise progressively with the severity of the disease. Moreover, these biomarkers are significantly higher in patients experiencing adverse outcomes. The differences among severity categories and the outcome group are highly significant (p-values < 0.001). CART algorithm revealed a specific cut-off point for the WHO ordinal scale of 4 to stand out as an important reference value for patients at a high risk of developing critical forms of COVID-19. The high death rate can be attributed to proinflammatory status, hormonal changes, nutritional and vitamin D deficiencies, comorbidities, and atypical clinical pictures.
