35208924|t|The Combination of In Vitro Assessment of Stress Tolerance Ability, Autoaggregation, and Vitamin B-Producing Ability for New Probiotic Strain Introduction.
35208924|a|The health benefits of probiotics are beyond doubt. The positive effects of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria on the function of many body systems have been repeatedly proven by various studies. To completely realize the potential of probiotic microorganisms, the strains should be tested by the greatest combination of characteristics that contribute to the wellness of the host. In this work, for the first time, a combined assessment of the probiotic properties and vitamin B-producing potential of various species and strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was carried out. The presence of an additional advantage, such as vitamin-producing ability, can prevent vitamin deficiency both at the level of the consumption of fermented foods, when the enrichment will occur naturally on the spot, and during colonization by these intestinal strains, when synthesis will occur in vivo. To select potential probiotics, the stress tolerance ability of 16 lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria strains to low pH values, bile, and proteolytic enzymes, as well as their ability to autoaggregate, were studied under conditions of modeling the gastrointestinal tract in vitro. The ability of the strains to extracellularly accumulate water-soluble B vitamins was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis. Among the tested strains of bifidobacteria, B. adolescentis VKPM AC-1662 is of interest; it was characterized by the greatest stress tolerance ability and the ability to autoaggregate, in addition to the extracellular synthesis of riboflavin and pyridoxine. Among lactic acid bacteria, L. sakei VKPM B-8936 demonstrated the greatest tolerance to low pH, L. plantarum VKPM B-11007 to duodenal conditions, L. acidophilus VKPM B-2213 to pepsin, and L. salivarius VKPM B-2214 to pancreatin. The highest percentage of autoaggregation was observed in L. salivarius VKPM B-2214, which also accumulated the largest amount of pantothenic acid, but it was sensitive to stress conditions. The obtained results could be used to create new products enriched with probiotics and B vitamins.
