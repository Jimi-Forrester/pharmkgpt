2959196|a|Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in 14 patients with Down's syndrome, in 46 patients with Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, and in 114 age-matched controls, using the xenon 133 inhalation technique. Cerebral blood flow was reduced in 13 of 14 Down's patients by a mean of 16.8 +/- 2.5% from expected age-matched normal values. Degrees of regional cerebral blood flow reduction did not differ among the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions in both cerebral hemispheres. The regional cerebral blood flow decreases were similar in magnitude and pattern to those in Alzheimer patients. These findings constitute an additional similarity between the two disorders.
