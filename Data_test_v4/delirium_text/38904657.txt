38904657|a|ABSTRACT: The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to describe physical activity and the factors associated with physical activity among older adults living with dementia on medical units in acute care settings. Measures included accelerometry data from the MotionWatch 8, behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia, use of psychotropic medications, subjective reports of activities of daily living and other types of physical activity (e.g., walking to the bathroom, participating in therapy), delirium severity, and medications. The majority of the 204 participants were White (70%) and female (62%), with a mean age of 83 years. Over 24 hours of assessment, participants engaged in 15 ( SD = 46) minutes of vigorous activity, 43 ( SD = 54) minutes of moderate activity, 2 hours 50 ( SD = 2) minutes of low-level activity, and 20 ( SD = 3) hours of sedentary activity. Subjective walking activities, toileting, evidence of disinhibition, delirium severity, agitation, and use of psychotropic medications were associated with increased physical activity based on the MotionWatch 8. The findings provide information for rehabilitation nurses regarding factors associated with physical activity among patients with dementia admitted to acute care settings as well as some of the challenges associated with measurement of physical activity. Future research needs to continue to explore the impact of behavioral symptoms associated with dementia on physical activity and increase participation in activities that are functionally relevant.
