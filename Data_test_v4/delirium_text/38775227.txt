38775227|t|Association between postoperative hyperactive delirium and major complications in elderly patients undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery: A large-scale cohort study.
38775227|a|AIM: This cohort study aimed to explore the connection between postoperative hyperactive delirium and major complications in elderly patients undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery. METHODS: Elderly patients aged 65 years and older undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery were included in the study. The presence of postoperative hyperactive delirium was assessed, and logistic regression analysis, following propensity score matching, was conducted to investigate the association between postoperative hyperactive delirium and major complications occurring 30 and 90 days post-surgery. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the analysis included 13 590 patients, equally distributed with 6795 in each group. The group experiencing postoperative hyperactive delirium exhibited a significantly elevated risk of 30-day postoperative complications, including acute renal failure, pneumonia, septicemia, and stroke, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.64 to 2.39. Furthermore, this group displayed notably higher rates of 90-day postoperative complications, encompassing mortality, acute renal failure, pneumonia, septicemia, and stroke, with a significantly increased incidence of mortality within 90 days. CONCLUSION: Postoperative hyperactive delirium in elderly patients undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery is significantly linked to an increased risk of major complications at both 30 and 90 days post-surgery. These findings underscore the critical importance of delirium prevention and management in this patient population, offering the potential to reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications.
