33255855|t|Identification of a De Novo Xq26.2 Microduplication Encompassing FIRRE Gene in a Child with Intellectual Disability.
33255855|a|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as transcripts of >200 nucleotides not translated into protein, have been involved in a wide range of regulatory functions. Their dysregulations have been associated with diverse pathological conditions such as cancer, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's diseases and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We report on the case of a five-year-old child with global developmental delay carrying a de novo microduplication on chromosome Xq26.2 region characterized by a DNA copy-number gain spanning about 147 Kb (chrX:130,813,232-130,960,617; GRCh37/hg19). This small microduplication encompassed the exons 2-12 of the functional intergenic repeating RNA element (FIRRE) gene (chrX:130,836,678-130,964,671; GRCh37/hg19) that encodes for a lncRNA involved in the maintenance of chromatin repression. The association of such a genetic alteration with a severe neurodevelopmental delay without clear dysmorphic features and congenital abnormalities indicative of syndromic condition further suggests that small Xq26.2 chromosomal region microduplications containing the FIRRE gene may be responsible for clinical phenotypes mainly characterized by structural or functioning neurological impairment.
