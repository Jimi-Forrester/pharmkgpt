36429213|a|This study investigated the suitability of Penicillium maximae biomass powder and protein isolate as a food product or food ingredient. The biomass powder is rich in proteins (34.8%) and insoluble fiber (36.2%) but poor in lipids (3.1%). Strong water hydration (8.3 g/g, 8.5 g/g) and oil holding (6.9 g/g, 16.3 g/g) capacity were observed in the biomass powder and protein isolate, respectively, besides 100% emulsion stability, indicating multiple applications in the food industry. No locomotor impairment was induced in Drosophila melanogaster flies after consuming extracts of P. maximae biomass powder. Furthermore, decreased production of reactive oxygen species and preservation of survival, viability, and fertility parameters were observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which reinforces the potential of P. maximae biomass for human and animal consumption. Together, the results show the vast food applicability of P. maximae biomass and protein isolate as protein substitutes with several health and environmental benefits.
