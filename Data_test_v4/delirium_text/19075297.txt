19075297|t|Video programming for individuals with dementia: assessing cognitive congruence.
19075297|a|The effect of cognitively congruent video programming on attentional engagement, as measured by the average look duration and the proportion of the video viewed, was examined among long-term care facility residents with Alzheimer's disease. Over a 2-week period, 24 residents viewed 4 cognitively congruent videos and 1 control video (ie, a recorded episode of a local news program) at least once. Level of attentional engagement was significantly higher for cognitively congruent video programs compared to the News. Neither history of television viewing nor cognitive status was related to engagement. The results suggest that video programs with less cognitive complexity may be more engaging for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
