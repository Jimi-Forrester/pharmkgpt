19508211|t|A novel approach to predict protein-protein interactions related to Alzheimer's disease based on complex network.
19508211|a|A protein domain interaction prediction program was complied using C(++) to predict whether a query protein could interact with other hub proteins. It is indicated that the proteins interacting with AATF (Apoptosis-Antagonizing Transcription Factor) possess a common conservative pattern: I-x(0,1)-E-x(2)-[A/E/N/T]-x-[E/K]. Our method is attempted to integrate the characteristics of protein interaction network with the simplest building blocks-conservative patterns.
