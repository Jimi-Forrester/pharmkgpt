18525295|t|Mutation negative "early-onset familial Alzheimer disease": consider screening for tau gene mutations.
18525295|a|Mutations in 3 genes are known to be deterministic for early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. The genes are presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and amyloid precursor protein. As these genes prove to be negative in patients with a clinical diagnosis of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease, a search for tau gene mutations may be appropriate, as illustrated by the following case.
