35799106|a|BACKGROUND: Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) is often used in the postoperative period. However, determining an appropriate opioid dose is difficult. A previous study suggested the usefulness of variable-rate feedback infusion. In this study, we used a dual-channel elastomeric infusion pump to provide changes in PCA infusion rate by pain feedback. METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I-III and 65 to 79 years of age participated in the study. All patients were given a dual-chamber PCA. Patients were randomly allocated to a treatment group (Group D; PCA drugs divided into both chambers) or control group (Group C; PCA drugs only in the constant flow chamber with normal saline in the adjustable flow chamber). The primary outcome was the amount of fentanyl consumption via PCA bolus. The secondary outcome variables were pain score, total fentanyl consumption, rescue analgesic use, patient satisfaction, recovery scores, and adverse events including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). RESULTS: Group D showed decreased fentanyl consumption of the PCA bolus, a decrease in rescue analgesic use, and better patient satisfaction compared with group C. The incidence of PONV was much higher in group C. There was no difference in other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: We showed the usefulness of dual chamber IV-PCA to change the flow rate related to pain feedback without any complications. Our results suggest a noble system that might improve existing IV-PCA equipment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study registered at UMIN clinical trial registry (registered date: 05/03/2020, registration number: UMIN000039702 ).
