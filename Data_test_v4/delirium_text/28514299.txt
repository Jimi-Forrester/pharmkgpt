28514299|a|This study aimed to investigate the perioperative analgesic effect of a buprenorphine transdermal patch in patients who underwent simple lumbar discectomy.In total, 96 patients were randomly divided into parecoxib intravenous injection (Group A), oral celecoxib (Group B), and buprenorphine transdermal patch groups (Group C). The pain status, degree of satisfaction, adverse effects, and condition in which the patient received tramadol hydrochloride for uncontrolled pain were recorded on the night before surgery, postoperative day 1, postoperative day 3, and postoperative day 5.The degree of patient satisfaction in Group C was higher than that in Groups A and B, with minimal adverse effects.The buprenorphine transdermal patch had a better perioperative analgesic effect in patients who underwent simple lumbar discectomy.
