34500469|a|The recent characterization of a group of non-MYC rearranged aggressive B-cell lymphomas, resembling Burkitt lymphoma (BL), characteristically harboring a telomeric 11q loss or combined 11q proximal gains/loss pattern has led to the introduction of the provisional entity of Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration (BLL-11q). Prompted by the discovery of a telomeric 11q loss in an HIV+ high-grade B-cell lymphoma patient, we investigated an extended cohort of aggressive B-cell lymphomas, enriched for cases with histopathological features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, including double- and triple-hit lymphomas (n = 47), for 11q loss/combined 11q proximal gains/loss pattern by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We provide first evidence that 11q aberrations can be found in both BLL in the context of an underlying HIV infection as well as in high-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements. We therefore propose that the clinicopathological spectrum of malignancies carrying this aberration may be broader than previously assumed.
