38239194|a|Purpose: This study reviews the use of mirabilite in traditional Chinese medicine and various preparations by describing its chemical composition, processing methods, pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical research progress. Methods: The applications and processing methods of mirabilite are searched in traditional and modern Chinese medical writings, and the articles on chemical composition, pharmacological effects, toxicology, and clinical studies of mirabilite and its combinations in PubMed and China Knowledge Network are reviewed, sorted, and analyzed. Results: The main chemical component of mirabilite is sodium sulfate decahydrate (Na2SO4 10H2O), followed by small amounts of sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and other inorganic salts. This study systematically organizes the history of the medicinal use of mirabilite in China for more than 2,000 years. This mineral has been used by nine Chinese ethnic groups (Han, Dai, Kazakh, Manchu, Mongolian, Tujia, Wei, Yi, and Tibetan) in a large number of prescription preparations. The Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (2020 edition) records stated that mirabilite can be used for abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, intestinal carbuncle, external treatment of breast carbuncle, hemorrhoids, and other diseases. The traditional processing methods of mirabilite in China include refining, boiling, sauteing, filtration after hot water blistering, and firing. Since the Ming Dynasty, processing by radish has become the mainstream prepared method of mirabilite. Mirabilite can exhibit anti-inflammatory detumescence effects by inhibiting AMS, LPS, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and NO levels and attenuating the upregulation of TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB genes. It can promote cell proliferation and wound healing by increasing the production of cytokines TGFbeta1 and VEGF-A and gastrointestinal motility by increasing the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, and motilin. It can increase the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor and AKT phosphorylation in the liver by up-regulating bile acid synthesis genes; reduce TRB3 expression in the liver, FGF15 co-receptor KLB expression, and FGF15 production in the ileum, and JNK signal transduction; and increase the transcription of CYP7A1 to achieve a cholesterol-lowering effect. Mirabilite also has a variety of pharmacological effects, such as regulating intestinal flora, anti-muscle paralysis, anti-colon cancer, promoting water discharge, and analgesic. Only a few toxicological studies on mirabilite are available. External application of mirabilite can cause local skin to be flushed or itchy, and its oral administration is toxic to neuromuscular cells. The sulfur ions of its metabolites can also be toxic to the human body. At present, no pharmacokinetic study has been conducted on mirabilite as a single drug. This mineral has been widely used in the clinical treatment of inflammation, edema, wound healing, digestive system diseases, infusion extravasation, hemorrhoids, skin diseases, breast accumulation, muscle paralysis, intestinal preparation before microscopic examination, and other diseases and symptoms. Conclusion: Mirabilite has good application prospects in traditional Chinese medicine and ethnomedicine. In-depth research on its processing methods, active ingredients, quality control, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms, and standardized clinical application is needed. This paper provides a reference for the application and research of mirabilite in the future.
