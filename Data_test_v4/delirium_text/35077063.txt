35077063|a|Among the most significant challenges presented to modern medicine is the problem of cognitive disorders. The relevance of her research is determined by the wide spread of disorders of the higher cortical functions, their significant negative impact on the quality of life of patients, as well as high economic costs on the part of the state and the patient's relatives aimed at organizing medical, diagnostic and rehabilitation processes. The main cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly is Alzheimer's disease. Currently, the criteria for the diagnosis of this nosological form have been developed and are widely used in practice. However, it should be noted that their use is most effective if the patient has a detailed clinical picture, at the stage of dementia. In addition, they provide for the study of biomarkers in a number of cases in the cerebrospinal fluid or using positron emission tomography, which presents certain technical difficulties. Especially significant problems arise in the pre-dement stages. This situation dictates the need to search for new promising diagnostic methods that will have high sensitivity and specificity, as well as the possibility of application in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, including in outpatient settings. The article provides information about modern methods of computer neuroimaging, discusses the research directions of individual biomarkers, and also shows the prospects for using diagnostic test panels developed on the basis of graphene biosensors, taking into account the latest achievements of nanotechnology and their integration into medical science.
