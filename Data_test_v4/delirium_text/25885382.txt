Different methods and many drugs have been used to control the postoperative pain. In this study, we evaluate the role of gabapentin premedication vs paracetamol in management of postoperative pain following adenotonsillectomy in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double blind randomized study, 70 children were subjected for adenotonsillectomy classified into two equal groups. Group I: Gabapentin 10 mg/kg was given orally 2 hours before induction of anesthesia (Gabapentin syrup 250 mg/5 ml); Group II: Oral paracetamol 20 mg/kg was given orally 2 hours before induction of anesthesia. All children underwent general anesthesia. Pain score was assisted postoperatively 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 18 hours after recovery using visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULT: Pain score in gabapentin group was significantly less in 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours postoperatively than in paracetamol group (P=0.0003, <0.0001, 0.0004, <0.0001, respectively). The time to first analgesia was longer in the gabapentin group than paracetamol group (7.95+-2.06 hours vs 5.85+-1.87 hours; P<0.0001) and the total amount of pethedine was less in gabapentin group than in paracetamol group (8+-10.05 mg vs 16.25+-11.57 mg; P=0.002). CONCLUSION: Gabapentin premedication improves postoperative analgesia following adenotonsillectomy in children and reduce analgesic requirements in comparison with paracetamol premedication, with no reported side effects.
