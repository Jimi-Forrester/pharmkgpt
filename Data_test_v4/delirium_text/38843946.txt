38843946|t|A marine-derived antioxidant astaxanthin as a potential neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic agent: A review of its efficacy on neurodegenerative conditions.
38843946|a|Astaxanthin is a potent lipid-soluble carotenoid produced by several different freshwater and marine microorganisms, including microalgae, bacteria, fungi, and yeast. The proven therapeutic effects of astaxanthin against different diseases have made this carotenoid popular in the nutraceutical market and among consumers. Recently, astaxanthin is also receiving attention for its effects in the co-adjuvant treatment or prevention of neurological pathologies. In this systematic review, studies evaluating the efficacy of astaxanthin against different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, and spinal cord injury are analyzed. Based on the current literature, astaxanthin shows potential biological activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, its preventive and therapeutic activities against the above-mentioned diseases have been emphasized in studies with different experimental designs. In contrast, none of the 59 studies reviewed reported any safety concerns or adverse health effects as a result of astaxanthin supplementation. The preventive or therapeutic role of astaxanthin may vary depending on the dosage and route of administration. Although there is a consensus in the literature regarding its effectiveness against the specified diseases, it is important to determine the safe intake levels of synthetic and natural forms and to determine the most effective forms for oral intake.
