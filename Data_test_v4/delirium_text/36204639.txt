36204639|a|Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe or critical illness, such as respiratory failure, multi-organ dysfunction or even death. Large-scale genetic association studies have indicated that genetic variations affecting SARS-CoV-2 receptors (angiotensin-converting enzymes, transmembrane serine protease-2) and immune components (Interferons, Interleukins, Toll-like receptors and Human leukocyte antigen) are critical host determinants related to the severity of COVID-19. Genetic background, such as 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 loci were also identified to influence outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current literature focusing on human genetic factors that may contribute to the observed diversified severity of COVID-19. Enhanced understanding of host genetic factors and viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2 could provide scientific bases for personalized preventive measures and precision medicine strategies.
