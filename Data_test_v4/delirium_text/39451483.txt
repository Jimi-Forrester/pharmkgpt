39451483|t|Unveiling the Core Competencies in Neuroscience Nursing Within the Context of Italy: A Qualitative Phenomenological Analysis.
39451483|a|Background: In 2008, the European Association of Neuroscience Nursing (EANN) initiated the NeuroBlend  project, which aimed to delineate the roles and competencies of neuroscience nurses across Europe. This project resulted in the development of the European Competence Profile (ECP), intended to standardize educational pathways and professional recognition for this specialized field. Aim: This study examines the relevance of neuroscience nursing practices to the competencies outlined in NeuroBlend  across different Italian care settings, including multiple sclerosis, pediatric neurosurgery, pediatric neurology, Alzheimer's disease, and substance addiction. Methods: A phenomenological approach was employed, utilizing focus groups to gather the perspectives of nurses on the competencies defined by the NeuroBlend  model. The focus groups were conducted from May 2022 to September 2022. The data collected from the focus groups were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Thirty nurses participated in the focus groups. Thematic analysis revealed the core competencies, such as communication, empathy, flexibility, and reflective skills, as critical in all care settings. The main themes that emerged were relationships with patients and families, personalized care, and continuity of care. Conclusions: The competencies outlined in the NeuroBlend  framework are vital to the role of neuroscience nurses in the settings studied and remain highly relevant in the context of Italian healthcare.
