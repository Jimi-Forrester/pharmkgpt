28304302|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep is an important physiological process and beneficial in the removal of brain metabolites and functional recovery. Prior studies have shown that sleep disorders are significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to characterize the effect of short-term total sleep deprivation (TSD) on plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) concentrations. METHODS: A clinical trial was conducted between March 1, 2016, and April 1, 2016. Twenty volunteers (age 27.3+-3.4 years) with normal cognitive function and sleeping habits were recruited from the local population. Participants underwent 24 h of TSD. Periprocedural blood samples were collected to compare the changes of plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (sLRP-1), soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA). RESULTS: TSD increased morning plasma Abeta40 levels by 32.6% (p < 0.001) and decreased the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio by 19.3% (p < 0.001). A positive relationship was found between TSD duration and plasma Abeta40 level (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) and Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio (r = 0.25, p = 0.003). Plasma concentrations of sLRP1 (p = 0.018) and sRAGE (p = 0.001) decreased significantly after TSD. Abeta40 and Abeta42 plasma concentrations correlated with plasma levels of sLRP1 and sRAGE. Serum SOD decreased after TSD (p = 0.005), whereas serum MDA was increased (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sleep deprivation can lead to an elevation of plasma Abeta40 and decrease of the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. The underlying mechanisms may be related to increased oxidative stress and impaired peripheral Abeta clearance as pathomechanisms of AD.
