19263919|a|Growing numbers of older adults means there will be an increase in the incidence of mental health problems in this population.Therefore, it is essential for nurses, many of whom will provide care for older adults, to be cognizant of current recommended practice related to the most common mental health diagnoses in older adults.These include depression, anxiety, dementia, substance abuse/dependence, and delirium. The purpose of this two-part series is to provide an overview of these diagnoses, as well as recommended assessment strategies and nursing interventions for nurses who provide care to older adults but who may lack specialized training in geropsychiatry. Part 1 covers depression and anxiety; part 2 focuses on dementia, delirium, and substance abuse.
