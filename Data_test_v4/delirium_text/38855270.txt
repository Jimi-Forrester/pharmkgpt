38855270|a|In this editorial we comment on the detrimental consequences that post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) has in the quality of life of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors, highlighting the importance of early onset of multidisciplinary rehabilitation from within the ICU. Although, the syndrome was identified and well described early in 2012, more awareness has been raised on the long-term PICS related health problems by the increased number of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors. It is well outlined that the syndrome affects both the patient and the family and is described as the appearance or worsening of impairment in physical, cognitive, or mental health as consequence of critical illness. PICS was described in order: (1) To raise awareness among clinicians, researchers, even the society; (2) to highlight the need for a multilevel screening of these patients that starts from within the ICU and continues after discharge; (3) to present preventive strategies; and (4) to offer guidelines in terms of rehabilitation. An early multidisciplinary approach is the key element form minimizing the incidence of PICS and its consequences in health related quality of life of both survivors and their families.
