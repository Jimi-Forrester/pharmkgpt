35085044|t|Medicare Beneficiary Factors Associated with Skilled Nursing Facility Lengths of Stay.
35085044|a|The objectives of this study are (1) to identify beneficiary-level characteristics associated with skilled nursing facility (SNF) length of stay (LOS), and (2) to determine if significant differences in LOS exist for vulnerable populations at the individual level or among nursing homes that serve a disproportionate share of vulnerable populations. This study employed 2014-2015 Medicare Long-Term Care Minimum Data Set (MDS v3.0) assessment, fee-for-service claims and enrollment, and 2014 Nursing Home Compare data to examine SNF LOS in Medicare beneficiaries. We used a hierarchical linear model to identify which beneficiary-level characteristics are associated with SNF LOS, while controlling for facility-level characteristics. After controlling for beneficiary-and facility-level characteristics, we found dual eligibility, racial or ethnic minority, depression, and Alzheimer's disease to be associated with longer Medicare covered SNF stays. We found that facilities that served higher proportions of dually eligible individuals tended to have higher average LOS compared to other facilities.
