38849930|t|The protective role of cognitive reserve: an empirical study in mild cognitive impairment.
38849930|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes an aging profile characterized by a cognitive decline that is worse than expected in normal aging but less pervasive and critical than full-blown dementia. In the absence of an effective treatment strategy, it is important to identify factors that can protect against progression to dementia. In this field, it is hypothesized that one aspect that may be a protective factor against the neurotypical outcome of dementia is cognitive reserve (CR). Cognitive reserve is the ability to maintain cognitive functionality despite accumulating brain pathology. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to identify and analyze the differences in CR between healthy adults and patients with MCI. Specifically, it is hypothesized that (i) healthy older adult people have higher CR than older adult people diagnosed with MCI, and (II) CR could predict the classification of subjects into people with or without MCI. METHODS: Two hundred forty-three adults (mean age = 60.4, SD = 7.4) participated in the present study and were classified into three groups based on Petersen's MCI criteria: healthy controls (HC), amnestic MCI (aMCI), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). The Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) was administered to assess the level of CR, FINDINGS: Results showed that HC had significantly higher CR scores than participants diagnosed with aMCI and naMCI. Moreover, a binomial logistic regression suggested that low CR was a significant risk factor for the MCI diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture that emerged from the results showed that lower CR could be considered a characteristic of pathological aging, such as MCI.Public significance statement, Since the brain attempts to cope with life-related changes or pathologies, it is fundamental for both clinicians and researchers to investigate further the factors that contribute to brain resilience. As an indirect expression of brain reserve, cognitive reserve may be both a marker and a predictor of adaptive aging.
