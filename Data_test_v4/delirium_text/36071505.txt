36071505|a|BACKGROUND: Measurements of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) 42/40 ratio in blood plasma may support the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and aid in the selection of suitable participants in clinical trials. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of fully automated prototype plasma Abeta42/40 assays with and without pre-analytical sample workup by immunoprecipitation. METHODS: A pre-selected clinical sample comprising 42 subjects with normal and 38 subjects with low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42/40 ratios was studied. The plasma Abeta42/40 ratios were determined with fully automated prototype Elecsys  immunoassays (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany) by direct measurements in EDTA plasma or after pre-analytical Abeta immunoprecipitation. The diagnostic performance for the detection of abnormal CSF Abeta42/40 was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In an additional post hoc analysis, a biomarker-supported clinical diagnosis was used as a second endpoint. RESULTS: Pre-analytical immunoprecipitation resulted in a significant increase in the area under the ROC curve (AUC) from 0.73 to 0.88 (p = 0.01547) for identifying subjects with abnormal CSF Abeta42/40. A similar improvement in the diagnostic performance by pre-analytical immunoprecipitation was also observed when a biomarker-supported clinical diagnosis was used as a second endpoint (AUC increase from 0.77 to 0.92, p = 0.01576). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary observations indicate that pre-analytical Abeta immunoprecipitation can improve the diagnostic performance of plasma Abeta assays for detecting brain amyloid pathology. The findings may aid in the further development of blood-based immunoassays for Alzheimer's disease ultimately suitable for screening and routine use.
