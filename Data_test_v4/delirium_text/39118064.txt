39118064|a|PURPOSE: Patients with spinal metastases undergoing surgical treatment face challenges related to preoperative anemia, intraoperative blood loss, and frailty, emphasizing the significance of perioperative blood management. This retrospective analysis aimed to assess the correlation between hemoglobin-related parameters and outcomes, identifying key markers to aid in blood management. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who underwent surgical treatment for spinal metastases. Hb-related parameters, including baseline Hb, postoperative nadir Hb, predischarge Hb, postoperative nadir Hb drift, and predischarge Hb drift (both in absolute values and percentages) were subjected to univariate and multivariate analyses. These analyses were conducted in conjunction with other established variables to identify independent markers predicting patient outcomes. The outcomes of interest were postoperative short-term (6-week) mortality, long-term (1-year) mortality, and postoperative 30-day morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients were included. Our study demonstrated that predischarge Hb (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.88, P = 0.007) was an independent prognostic factor of short-term mortality, while baseline Hb (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.88, P < 0.001) was identified as an independent prognostic factor of long-term mortality. Additionally, nadir Hb drift (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.97, P = 0.023) was found to be an independent prognostic factor for postoperative 30-day morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that predischarge Hb, baseline Hb, and nadir Hb drift are prognostic factors for outcomes. These findings provide a foundation for precise blood management strategies. It is crucial to consider Hb-related parameters appropriately, and prospective intervention studies addressing these markers should be conducted in the future.
