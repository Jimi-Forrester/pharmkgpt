35192423|a|The maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis is essential for normal cell function and viability. Excessive cholesterol accumulation is detrimental to cells and serves as the molecular basis of many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes mellitus. The peripheral cells do not have the ability to degrade cholesterol. Cholesterol efflux is therefore the only pathway to eliminate excessive cholesterol from these cells. This process is predominantly mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), an integral membrane protein. ABCA1 is known to transfer intracellular free cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) for generating nascent high-density lipoprotein (nHDL) particles. nHDL can accept more free cholesterol from peripheral cells. Free cholesterol is then converted to cholesteryl ester by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase to form mature HDL. HDL-bound cholesterol enters the liver for biliary secretion and fecal excretion. Although how cholesterol is transported by ABCA1 to apoA-I remains incompletely understood, nine models have been proposed to explain this effect. In this review, we focus on the current view of the mechanisms underlying ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to provide an important framework for future investigation and lipid-lowering therapy.
