35121174|a|Recent drug development efforts targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed to produce effective disease-modifying agents for many reasons, including the substantial presymptomatic neuronal damage that is caused by the accumulation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and tau protein abnormalities, deleterious adverse effects of drug candidates, and inadequate design of clinical trials. New molecular targets, biomarkers, and diagnostic techniques, as well as alternative nonpharmacological approaches, are sorely needed to detect and treat early pathological events. This article analyzes the successes and debacles of pharmaceutical endeavors to date, and highlights new technologies that may lead to the more effective diagnosis and treatment of the pathologies that underlie AD. The use of focused ultrasound, deep brain stimulation, stem cell therapy, and gene therapy, in parallel with pharmaceuticals and judicious lifestyle adjustments, holds promise for the deceleration, prevention, or cure of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
