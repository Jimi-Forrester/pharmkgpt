38509610|a|BACKGROUND: At present, the relationship between serum uric acid and blood glucose is controversial, and even opposite conclusions have been reached. We aimed to investigate the relationship between time in range and serum uric acid and estimate the influence of serum uric acid on blood glucose fluctuations in Chinese patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A total of 458 hospitalized patients with T2DM were selected. According to the SUA level, patients were divided into four groups by quartile: Q1 (<= 254.5 micromol/L), Q2 (254.5-306.0 micromol/L), Q3 (306.0-385.5 micromol/L) and Q4 (> 385.5 micromol/L). The differences in general data, TIR and other clinical indicators between the four groups were assessed. Multifactor regression was used to analyze the relationship between subgroups of SUA and TIR, TBR, TAR, MAGE, SD, ADRR, MODD and M value. Curve fitting was used to analyze the association between TIR and SUA and to identify the inflection point. RESULTS: TIR showed an overall increasing trend with increasing SUA, while HbA1c, TAR, MAGE, SD, ADRR, MODD and M value showed an overall decreasing trend with increasing SUA. Multivariate regression analysis showed that, compared with Q1, there was no correlation between SUA and TIR, TAR, ADRR, SD, or MODD in all models of Q2. In the Q3 and Q4 groups, SUA was correlated with SD, MODD, and MAGE in all models. In the Q4 group, SUA was correlated with TIR, TAR, ADRR, and the M value in all models. When SUA > 306 micromol/L (Q3 and Q4), TIR and SUA have a curve-like relationship, and the inflection point of the fitted curve was SUA = 460 mmol/L. Before the inflection point, beta was 0.1, indicating that when SUA increases by 10 mmol/L, the corresponding TIR increases by 1%. After the inflection point, there was no significant difference in the correlation between TIR and SUA (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a close relationship between TIR and SUA in T2DM patients, it is speculated that SUA in a certain range had a positive protective effect on blood glucose control.
