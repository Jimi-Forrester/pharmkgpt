32128353|t|Option of Using Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters in Elderly Patients With Dementia: An Observational Study.
32128353|a|Background: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) facilitate the treatment of several diseases. Here, we assessed the clinical course of elderly patients with dementia using PICCs. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single dementia treatment center. PICCs were used in elderly inpatients with dementia who required (a) intravenous therapy, supplemental parenteral nutrition, and dysphagia rehabilitation during acute illness; (b) end-of-life care; (c) total parenteral nutrition (TPN); or (d) an alternative to peripheral vascular (PV) access. Results: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled (83.5 +- 6.9 years): 61% were in the acute treatment group, and 17% were in the end-of-life care group. The median catheter lifespan was 42 (23-87.5) days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection was 0.22 per 1,000 PICC-days, and that of deep venous thrombosis was 0.66 per 1,000 PICC-days. Among the patients in acute treatment group, 19% resumed sufficient oral intake after the treatment using PICC, and 36% resumed oral intake of gelatin-like food. Among the patients in the end-of-life care group, 91% received intravenous fluids continuously until death by initially inserted PICC. Conclusion: In elderly patients with dementia, PICCs might be one of the options during the treatment of acute illness as well as for prolonged support during end-of-life care.
