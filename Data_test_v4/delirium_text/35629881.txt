35629881|a|Infections are common and need minimal treatment; however, occasionally, due to inappropriate immune response, they can develop into a life-threatening condition known as sepsis. Sepsis is a global concern with high morbidity and mortality. There has been little advancement in the treatment of sepsis, outside of antibiotics and supportive measures. Some of the difficulty in identifying novel therapies is the heterogeneity of the condition. Metabolic phenotyping has great potential for gaining understanding of this heterogeneity and how the metabolic fingerprints of patients with sepsis differ based on survival, organ dysfunction, disease severity, type of infection, treatment or causative organism. Moreover, metabolomics offers potential for patient stratification as metabolic profiles obtained from analytical platforms can reflect human individuality and phenotypic variation. This article reviews the most relevant metabolomic studies in sepsis and aims to provide an overview of the metabolic derangements in sepsis and how metabolic phenotyping has been used to identify sub-groups of patients with this condition. Finally, we consider the new avenues that metabolomics could open, exploring novel phenotypes and untangling the heterogeneity of sepsis, by looking at advances made in the field with other -omics technologies.
