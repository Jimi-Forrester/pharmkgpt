38546932|a|We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assess the correlation between OCT and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) which shows high diagnostic agreement with findings from postmortem histopathology-the gold standard method. Patients who were diagnosed with AD-related dementia were selected for the study. Patients with a mini mental test (MMT) score between 18 and 23 were included in the study (n = 31). Volunteers with MMT >= 28 and no cognitive impairment were included in the study as the control group (n = 31). OCT imaging was performed in the patient and control groups after detailed ophthalmological examinations including visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements. Brain glucose metabolism measurement was performed using 18 F-FDG PET/computed tomography. When adjusted for age and sex, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) thickness showed a significant difference between groups and the RNFL thickness in the superior temporal and superior nasal quadrants in AD-related mild dementia group showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Furthermore, only the RNFL thickness in the inferior nasal quadrant of the right eye showed a significant difference between the groups (p = 0.016). It is thought that OCT is a promising imaging method in the elderly population due to its low-cost, non-invasive and easily applicability, and therefore, it may contribute in the future as a tool in the periodic follow-up of patients diagnosed with AD.
