34344312|t|A timed activity protocol to address sleep-wake disorders in home dwelling persons living with dementia: the healthy patterns clinical trial.
34344312|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep-wake disorders occur in most persons living with dementia and include late afternoon or evening agitation, irregular sleep-wake rhythms such as daytime hypersomnia, frequent night awakenings, and poor sleep efficiency. Sleep-wake disorders pose a great burden to family caregivers, and are the principal causes of distress, poor quality of life, and institutionalization. Regulating the sleep-wake cycle through the use of light and activity has been shown to alter core clock processes and suggests that a combination of cognitive, physical, and sensory-based activities, delivered at strategic times, may be an effective mechanism through which to reduce sleep-wake disorders. METHODS: A definitive Phase III efficacy trial of the Healthy Patterns intervention, a home-based activity intervention designed to improve sleep-wake disorders and quality of life, is being conducted using a randomized two-group parallel design of 200 people living with dementia and their caregivers (dyads). Specific components of this one-month, home-based intervention involve 4 in-home visits and includes: 1) assessing individuals' functional status and interests; 2) educating caregivers on environmental cues to promote activity and sleep; and 3) training caregivers in using timed morning, afternoon, and evening activities based on circadian needs across the day. The patient focused outcomes of interest are quality of life, measures of sleep assessed by objective and subjective indicators including actigraphy, subjective sleep quality, and the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Caregiver outcomes of interest are quality of life, burden, confidence using activities, and sleep disruption. Salivary measures of cortisol and melatonin are collected to assess potential intervention mechanisms. DISCUSSION: The results from the ongoing study will provide fundamental new knowledge regarding the effects of timing activity participation based on diurnal needs and the mechanisms underlying timed interventions which can lead to a structured, replicable treatment protocol for use with this growing population of persons living with dementia.
