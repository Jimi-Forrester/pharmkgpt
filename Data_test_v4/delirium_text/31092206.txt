31092206|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative cognitive impairment (CI) following surgeries is prevalent in geriatric surgical population aged 60 and older. This meta-analysis was designed to investigate whether the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) has prognostic value on adverse outcomes in aged surgical patients. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and Medline through the Ovid were searched. Meta-analyses were carried out for CI versus non-cognitive impairment (NCI). Quality of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. RESULTS: One randomized controlled trial, two retrospective cohort trials, and 18 prospective cohort trials were included in the meta-analysis. Perioperative diagnosis of CI by the MMSE had higher rates of patients suffering from postoperative delirium (POD) [odd ratio (OR) 5.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.27, 7.71, P < 0.00001], in-hospital mortality (OR 7.51, 95% CI 2.17, 26.02, P = 0.001), mortality within 1 year (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.95,3.29, P < 0.00001). Postoperative CI patients had no extended length of stay in orthopedic [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.10, 95% CI -0.20, 0.17, P = 0.91)] nor rehabilitation wards ((SMD, 0.04; 95% CI, - 0.23 to 0.31; P = 0.78). CONCLUSION: Older patients with perioperative CI were more likely to suffer from POD and mortality. The MMSE showed certain value on risk stratification and prognosis evaluation in geriatric surgical population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42018108739 .
