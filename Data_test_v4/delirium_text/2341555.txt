2341555|t|Prevalence of the Fuld profile in temporal lobe epilepsy.
2341555|a|A pattern of performance on the WAIS-R presumably related to temporal lobe abnormalities associated with Alzheimer's Disease was examined in patients with focal temporal lobe EEG abnormalities to determine if the profile was related to other forms of temporal lobe disease. Among 120 patients with unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe EEG abnormalities, only 4(3%) demonstrated the profile. The presence of the profile was unrelated to laterality of EEG abnormality. These findings were discussed in regard to previous studies and the utility of the so-called Fuld profile.
