35110174|a|AIM: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between social functioning perceptions of the caregivers toward their patients, and their perceived care burden. METHOD: The descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study was carried out between September 2017-September 2019 using two measurement tools, in addition to an introductory information form: the Burden Interview and Social Functioning Scale The study was conducted with caregivers of the 76 addict outpatients and inpatients of the Alcohol and Substance Addiction Treatment Center of a university hospital in Turkey. The study data were evaluated using descriptive statistical analysis and correlation analysis. RESULTS: Of the caregivers, 69.7% were female and had a mean age of 43.32 +- 13.35 years; 52.6% and 47.4% of the all caregivers provided care to substance abusers and alcohol abusers, respectively. Of the addicted individuals receiving care, 78.9% were male, 60.5% were single, and 56.6% were unemployed. The mean age of patients was found to be 35.94 +- 11.75 years, and patients had been given treatment for an average of 7.56 +- 7.26 years. It was found that as caregivers' total mean Social Functioning Scale scores and mean subscale scores increased, their mean Burden Interview scores decreased (p > .05), though this value was not found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: These results are important to support not only the addicted individual but also their caregiver, and to conduct the related treatment and care holistically.
