35783117|a|Objective: The aim of this study is to find the incidence, risks, and reasons for prolonged length of hospital stay, short, long-term mortality, and the factors contributing to mortality of postoperative delirium in proximal femoral fractures. Methods: The data for the study was obtained from National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) and internal hospital computer systems (Medway, ICE, Clinic letters) between January 2018 and December 2019. One hundred seventy-five patients were found have developed postoperative delirium. The outcomes measured were postoperative anemia, lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, urinary retention, cardiac event and stroke, alcohol or drug withdrawal, length of hospital stay, and 30 day and 1 year mortality. Results: The patients who developed delirium were 68 (38.9%) with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 4 and 94 (22.3%) without delirium (p < 0.05). The average length of stay after developing postoperative delirium was 19.69 days compared to 17.4 days for patients without delirium. The mortality at 30 days and 1 year was 10.9% and 37% in patients who had postoperative delirium compared to 2.1% and 2.8% to those without delirium, respectively. Conclusion: Postoperative delirium is three times more common in hip fractures. Early detection and timely management are crucial in the improvement of functional outcomes and mortality.
