18632877|a|Every adult with a diagnosis of progressive dementia is at risk for wandering away or becoming lost. Those with dementia may not have the capacity to remember crucial contact information or recognize an unsafe situation, so enrollment in a program like Alzheimer's Association Safe Return is crucial. One facility-level enrollment plan at the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital in Florida has had a relatively high participation rate. A mailed survey was used to help evaluate that enrollment process and the results are described here. Of 262 respondents to the survey, 193 (74%) indicated the person with dementia enrolled in Safe Return. Potential enrollees need the following facilitators: perception of an unsafe situation, financial support and easy processing. Safe Return is not just focused on those who wander but is essential for all persons with dementia as these individuals can become lost in the course of normal daily activities.
