26862416|a|We report a case of several autoimmune disorders eventually presenting as severe multi organ dysfunction syndrome caused by adult hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Clinical and laboratory tests might lead to fatal misinterpretation without awareness of its diagnostic evaluation, as HLH shares common features with sepsis and immune-mediated systemic inflammatory response syndromes.
