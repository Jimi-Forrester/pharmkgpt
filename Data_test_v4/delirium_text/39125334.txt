39125334|t|Functional Lipids and Cardiovascular Disease Reduction: A Concise Review.
39125334|a|Functional lipids are dietary substances that may have an impact on human health by lowering the risk of chronic illnesses and enhancing the quality of life. Numerous functional lipids have been reported to have potential health benefits in the prevention, management, and treatment of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. However, there is still insufficient and contradictory information in the literature about their effectiveness and associated mechanisms of action. The objective of this review, therefore, is to evaluate available literature regarding these functional lipids and their health benefits. Various studies have been conducted to understand the links between functional lipids and the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Recent studies on phytosterols have reported that CLA, medium-chain triglycerides, and omega-3 and 6 fatty acids have positive effects on human health. Also, eicosanoids, which are the metabolites of these fatty acids, are produced in relation to the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and may modulate disease conditions. These functional lipids are available either in dietary or supplement forms and have been proven to be efficient, accessible, and inexpensive to be included in the diet. However, further research is required to properly elucidate the dosages, dietary intake, effectiveness, and their mechanisms of action in addition to the development of valid disease biomarkers and long-term effects in humans.
