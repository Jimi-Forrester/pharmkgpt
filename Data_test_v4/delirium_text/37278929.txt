37278929|t|Association of Telomere Length with Cognitive Impairment.
37278929|a|Telomere attrition is attributed to Alzheimer's disease (AD), major depressive disorder, stress levels, physical inactivity, short sleep duration, and reduced educational abilities. In this article, we tried to assess the association between the telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes and level of cognitive impairment and its dependence on age and sex. Healthy subjects and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and different AD stages were recruited in the study. All patients were assessed by the same standard diagnostic procedure, including neurological examination-Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Blood samples from 66 subjects (18 men and 48 women, mean age 71.2 +- 0.56 years) were collected for DNA extraction from peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by monochrome multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The data obtained in the study indicate that RTL in PBMCs has a statistically significant association with MMSE score (p < 0.02). Moreover, the sex-specific difference was observed for the association between telomere length and various parameters of MMSE. Also, it has been found that a decrease in RTL by one unit is associated with an increase in the odds to get AD at a ratio of 2.54 (95% CI, 1.25 to 5.17). The results obtained in this research are in coherence with other studies that telomere length may be a valuable biomarker of cognitive decline. However, the potential need for longitudinal studies of telomere length, in order to estimate the influence of hereditary and environmental factors, remains.
