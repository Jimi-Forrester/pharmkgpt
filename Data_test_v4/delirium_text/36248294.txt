36248294|t|MiR-205 Regulates LRRK2 Expression in Dopamine Neurons in Parkinson's Disease through Methylation Modification.
36248294|a|Background: We explored the methylation modification in miR-205 promoter during the pathological changes of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its regulation on Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2), clarified the important role of methylation in miR-205 promoter region in PD, explained the role of miR-205 methylation in the pathological changes of PD, and looked for new targets for PD. Methods: Methylation of miR-205 promoter regions was determined by cell genomic DNA, with model bisulfite treatment, and the transcription of miR-205 and LRRK2 in PD model cells was determined by qPCR, and LRRK2 expression was determined by Western blot. The binding sites of miRNAs in the non-coding region of LRRK2 were analyzed by the targetscan database, and miR-205 expression in 293T cells was controlled. The correlation between miR-205 expression and LRRK2 was determined to clarify the regulation mode of miR-205 on LRRK2. Results: The level of miR-205 were reduced in the SH-SY5Y Parkinson model cells, and its promoter region was highly methylated, while LRRK2 expression decreased in the model cells after 5-Azacytidine inhibition of methylation in miR-205 promoter region. According to the target scan database analysis, LRRK2 non-coding region is a miR-205-specific binding site. After further miR-205 overexpression in 293T cells, the transcription and translation of LRRK2 decreased in cells, which increased after the treatment of miR-205 inhibitor on LRRK2. Conclusion: The methylation modification of miR-205 promoter region could regulate the transcription and translation of LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons, so miR-205 methylation regulation can serve as a new potential target for the treatment of PD.
