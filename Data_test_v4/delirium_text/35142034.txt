35142034|a|INTRODUCTION: In this longitudinal study, we aimed to examine if slowing gait speed preceded cognitive decline and correlated with brain amyloidosis. METHODS: The sample (n = 287) was derived from the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies, with follow-ups between 2000 and 2015. Gait speed was measured by indoor walk, and cognition using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. All participants had CDR = 0 at baseline. Some participants had data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 concentrations at the 2009 examination. RESULTS: Gait speed for participants who worsened in CDR score during follow-up was slower at most examinations. Baseline gait speed could significantly predict CDR change from baseline to follow-up. Subjects with pathological CSF Abeta1- 42 concentrations at the 2009 visit had lost more gait speed compared to previous examinations. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that gait speed decline precedes cognitive decline, is linked to Alzheimer's pathology, and might be used for early detection of increased risk for dementia development.
