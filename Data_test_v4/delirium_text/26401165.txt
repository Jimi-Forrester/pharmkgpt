26401165|t|Increased Mortality Amongst Patients Sustaining Neck of Femur Fractures as In-Patients in a Trauma Centre.
26401165|a|PURPOSE: Neck of Femur (NOF) fracture is a common injury with high mortality that all orthopaedic departments must contend with [1]. The aim of this study was to report incidence and mortality of NOF fractures occurring while patients were being admitted to hospital for other conditions. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all NOF fracture admissions between 1(st) of Jan 2010 to 31(st) of Dec 2012 at a University Hospital trauma centre. Fractures were divided according to the location where the fracture occurred, either in the community (acute NOF) or in-hospital (in-hospital NOF). RESULTS: In-hospital mortality, 30-day, 90-day and 1 year mortality were recorded. There were 1086 patients in the acute NOF fracture group (93.9%) and 70 patients in the in-hospital group (6.1%) over three years. The odds of inpatient death was 2.25 times higher for inpatient NOFs (p=0.012). 86% of all in-hospital NOF fractures occurred on medical and rehabilitation wards. NOF fractures result in increased mortality and morbidity. CONCLUSION: All patients in hospital should be assessed to identify those at high risk of falls and implemented measures should be taken to reduce this.
