34553778|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, with complex pathophysiology that is not fully understood. While beta-amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles define the pathology of the disease, the mechanism of neurodegeneration is uncertain. Ferroptosis is an iron-mediated programmed cell death mechanism characterised by phospholipid peroxidation that has been observed in clinical AD samples. This review will outline the growing molecular and clinical evidence implicating ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD, with implications for disease-modifying therapies.
