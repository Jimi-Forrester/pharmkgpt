34231781|t|Selenium concentrations in elderly people with Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional study with control group.
34231781|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible differences in plasma and erythrocyte concentrations of selenium among elderly with and without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Cross-sectional study, performed with an elderly group with Alzheimer's disease, diagnosed by a geriatric doctor, and compared to an elderly group without the disease, equaling gender, education, and age. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry determined plasma and erythrocyte concentrations of total selenium (Set). RESULTS: The mean age was 74.41+-7.1 years in the Alzheimer's disease group and 71.46+-5.1 years among the control group. The Alzheimer's disease group presented lower plasma concentrations (mean of 45.29+-14.51 microg/dL vs. 55.14+-14.01 microg/dL; p=0.004), and erythrocyte Set (median of 56.36 microg/L vs. 76.96 microg/L; p<0.001). The logistic regression model indicated an association between erythrocyte Set concentrations and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (p=0.028). CONCLUSION: Elderly with Alzheimer's disease present lower selenium concentrations in the evaluated organic compartments.
