39658346|t|beta-Blockers and risk of neuropsychiatric disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
39658346|a|AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between beta-blocker use and neuropsychiatric adverse events, specifically focusing on short-term outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search identified studies reporting neuropsychiatric outcomes in patients using beta-blockers, including randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for outcomes such as dizziness, insomnia, nightmares, drowsiness and delirium. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that beta-blocker use was significantly associated with an increased risk of dizziness (RR 1.72, 95% CI [1.39-2.14]; I2 = 1%, 14 studies) compared to placebo. Lipophilic beta-blockers, especially propranolol, showed an even greater risk of dizziness (RR 3.13, 95% CI [1.44-6.84]; I2 = 0%, three studies). Propranolol was also associated with increased insomnia risk compared to placebo (RR 1.13, 95% CI [1.00-1.28]; I2 = 0%, five studies). Our data did not show statistically significant increases in the reports of nightmares and somnolence. Other adverse effects, including drowsiness, sleep disturbances, hallucinations and delirium, were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a significant association between beta-blocker use and an increased risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events, particularly insomnia and dizziness with higher risks associated with lipophilic beta-blocker use. Given the ambiguity surrounding dizziness and its classification as a neuropsychiatric effect, our findings are exploratory, and we cannot exclude a potential cardiovascular origin for dizziness. Most studies (75%) were published before the CONSORT statement in 1996, indicating potential reporting limitations and a lack of recent research. Additionally, 60% of studies had a high risk of bias, underscoring the need for more rigorous and contemporary investigations into the neuropsychiatric implications of beta-blocker use.
