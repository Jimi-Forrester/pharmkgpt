38138872|t|Probiotics in Postoperative Pain Management.
38138872|a|Postoperative pain is the unpleasant sensory and emotional experience after surgery, its origin being both the inflammatory reaction induced by the surgical trauma on the abdominal wall and the splanchnic pain induced by the activation of nociceptors of the viscera, which are highly sensitive to distension, ischemia, and inflammation. Nowadays, it is well recognized that there is a close relationship between the gut microbiome and pain perception, and that microbiome is highly affected by both anesthesia and surgical manipulation. Thus, efforts to restore the disturbed microbiome via supplementation with beneficial bacteria, namely probiotics, seem to be effective. In this article, the knowledge gained mainly from experimental research on this topic is analyzed, the concluding message being that each probiotic strain works in its own way towards pain relief.
