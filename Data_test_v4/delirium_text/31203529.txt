31203529|a|BACKGROUND: With the increase in the proportion of elderly Lebanese patients, little is known about delirium's prevalence, incidence and correlated factors. AIMS: To identify the prevalence, incidence and factors associated with overall and incident delirium in hospitalized elderly Lebanese patients. METHODS: A convenient sample was recruited from three university hospitals affiliated to the Lebanese university faculty of medical sciences. We included patients aged more than 65 years. Baseline factors were examined upon presentation and the confusion assessment method (CAM) was used to detect prevalent delirium upon admission or within the first 48 h. Enrolled patients were then assessed every other day to detect incident delirium cases. RESULTS: Among the 230 patients included, delirium prevalence was 17% and incidence 8.7%. We found that a history of falls (odds ratio (OR) = 5.12; p = 0.001), immobilization (OR = 7.33; p = 0.035), polypharmacy (OR = 5.07; p = 0.026) along with tachycardia (OR = 6.94; p = 0.03) and severe anemia (OR = 12.5; p = 0.005) upon admission were significant factors associated with overall delirium (incident and prevalent delirium cases). Whereas, living alone was significantly associated with lower odds for overall delirium (OR = 0.03; p = 0.02). Moreover, current smoking (OR = 14; p = 0.02), low oxygen saturation (OR = 9.6; p = 0.008) and severe anemia (OR = 8.4; p = 0.013) upon admission remained significantly associated with higher odds for incident delirium along with urine catheter placement (OR = 7.8; p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Secondary to the burden of delirium and its impact on mortality among elderly population, trying to understand and adjust modifiable factors would promote more appropriate prevention strategies.
