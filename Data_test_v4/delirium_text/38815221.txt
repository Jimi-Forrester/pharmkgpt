38815221|t|Attitudes Toward Caring for the Oldest-Old and Associated Factors.
38815221|a|PURPOSE: To examine the knowledge, stress levels, and attitudes of clinical nurses regarding care for individuals considered the oldest-old (i.e., aged >=80 years) and to identify related factors. METHOD: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, data were collected via an online structured questionnaire survey administered to 128 clinical nurses. RESULTS: Participants had low levels of knowledge about the oldest-old with hearing impairments or mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, delirium), and high levels of stress. Factors influencing attitudes toward the oldest-old were graduate or higher educational level (p = 0.002), >=10 years of work experience (p = 0.049), and lower stress (p = 0.033). The explanatory power of the regression model was 18.1%. CONCLUSION: Further research and development programs should aim to promote positive attitudes toward care for older adults among nurses and develop methods to reduce and better manage stress when caring for these individuals.
