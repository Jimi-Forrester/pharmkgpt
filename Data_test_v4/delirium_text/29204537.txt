29204537|t|Olfactory dysfunction and its measurement in the clinic.
29204537|a|The sense of smell is largely taken for granted by laypersons and medical professionals alike. Indeed, its role in determining the flavor of foods and beverages, as well as in warning of, or protecting against, environmental hazards, often goes unrecognized. This is exemplified, in part, by the fact that most patients presenting to medical clinics with "taste" problems are typically subjected to complex brain imaging and gastroenterological tests without the sense of smell even being tested or considered as a basis of the problem. Aside from frank deficiencies in sweet, sour, bitter, salty and savory (umami) sensations, "taste" disorders most commonly reflect inadequate stimulation of the olfactory receptors via the retronasal route; i.e., from volatiles passing to the receptors from the oral cavity through the nasal pharynx. This article describes the two most common procedures for measuring the sense of smell in the clinic and provides examples of the application of these tests to diseases and other disorders frequently associated with smell loss. Basic issues related to olfactory testing and evaluation are addressed. It is pointed out that smell loss, particularly in later life, can be a harbinger for not only a range of neurodegenerative diseases, but can be a prognostic indicator of early mortality.
