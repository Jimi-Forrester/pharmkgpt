36833961|t|Leisure Programmes in Hospitalised People: A Systematic Review.
36833961|a|Nurses carry out holistic assessments of patients during hospital admission. This assessment includes the need for leisure and recreation. Different intervention programmes have been developed to meet this need. The aim of this study was to investigate hospital leisure intervention programmes described in the literature in order to determine their effects on patient health and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the programmes as reported by health professionals. A systematic review of articles in English or Spanish published between 2016 and 2022 was carried out. A search was performed in the following databases: CINAHL COMPLETE, PubMed, Cochrane Library and Dialnet and the Virtual Health Library and Web of Science resources. A total of 327 articles were obtained, of which 18 were included in the review. The methodological quality of the articles was assessed using the PRISMA, CASPe and STROBE scales. A total of six hospital-based leisure programmes were identified, including a total of 14 leisure interventions. The activities developed in most of the interventions effectively reduced the levels of anxiety, stress, fear and pain in patients. They also improved factors such as mood, humour, communication, wellbeing, satisfaction and hospital adaptation. Among the main barriers to implementing hospital leisure activities is the need for more training, time and adequate spaces for them develop. Health professionals consider it beneficial for the patient to develop leisure interventions in the hospital.
