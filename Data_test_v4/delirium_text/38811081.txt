38811081|a|Amyloid fibrils are insoluble proteins with intricate beta-sheet structures associated with various human diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and prion diseases. Proteins can form aggregates when their structure is misfolded, resulting in highly organized amyloid fibrils or amorphous aggregates. The formation of protein aggregates is a promising research field for mitigating diseases and the pharmaceutical and food industries. It is important to monitor and minimize the appearance of aggregates in these protein products. Several methods exist to assess protein aggregation, that includes from basic investigations to advanced biophysical techniques. Physicochemical parameters such as molecular weight, conformation, structure, and dimension are examined to study aggregation. There is an urgent need to develop methods for the detection of protein aggregation and amyloid fibril formation both in vitro and in vivo. This chapter focuses on a comprehensive discussion of the methods used to characterize and evaluate aggregates and amyloid fibrils.
