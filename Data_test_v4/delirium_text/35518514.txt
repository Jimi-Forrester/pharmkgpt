35518514|a|Banana is a delicious fruit with potent immunomodulatory function. In this study, alpha-d-(1 6)-glucan was purified from banana pulp. It could significantly promote pinocytic activity and production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-6 and TNF-alpha was increased in RAW264.7 macrophages. alpha-d-(1 6)-glucan could not only increase the expression levels of p-p65 and p-IkappaBalpha, but also induce the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 into the nucleus. Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p-ERK, p-JNK and p-p38, were upregulated. These results suggested that NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways were involved in the immunomodulatory mechanisms of alpha-d-(1 6)-glucan. The results revealed that alpha-d-(1 6)-glucan might be the critical component responsible for the health benefits of banana.
