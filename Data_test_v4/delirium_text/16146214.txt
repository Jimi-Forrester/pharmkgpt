16146214|t|[Autopsy case of Lewy body dementia associated with abundant argyrophilic grains].
16146214|a|We report an autopsy case showing neuropathologically abundant Lewy bodies and argyrophilic grains. A Japanese woman without hereditary burden developed parkinsonian gait at the age of 74, following by insomnia, memory disturbance, delirium, resting tremor, rigidity, and retropulsion. About 8 months later, a visual hallucination, concerning small worms, children, and so on, became obvious. About 16 months later, malignant lymphoma was detected. About 17 months later, she died of pneumonia. The total duration of illness was approximately one year and five months. The weight of the brain was 1153 g before fixation. Depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locusceruleus was prominent. Many argyrophilic grains were seen in the temporal lobe (T3, T4), amygdala, and hippocampal CA1. Some ballooned neurons were found in the amygdala. Many Lewy bodies were encountered in the transentorhinal region and cingulated gyrus. A few Lewy bodies were seen in the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes. In this case, neuropathological examination is compatible for dementia of Lewy bodies and argyrophilic grain dementia, and clinical course is consistent with dementia of Lewy bodies. This report may contribute to the elucidation of the clinicopathological hallmarks of argyrophilic grain dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.
