36077227|t|Sex and APOE Genotype Alter the Basal and Induced Inflammatory States of Primary Microglia from APOE Targeted Replacement Mice.
36077227|a|The sex and APOE4 genotype are significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism(s) responsible for this interaction are still a matter of debate. Here, we assess the responses of mixed-sex and sex-specific APOE3 and APOE4 primary microglia (PMG) to lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma. In our investigation, inflammatory cytokine profiles were assessed by qPCR and multiplex ELISA assays. Mixed-sex APOE4 PMG exhibited higher basal mRNA expression and secreted levels of TNFa and IL1b. In sex-specific cultures, basal expression and secreted levels of IL1b, TNFa, IL6, and NOS2 were 2-3 fold higher in APOE4 female PMG compared to APOE4 males, with both higher than APOE3 cells. Following an inflammatory stimulus, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the secreted cytokine level were upregulated in the order E4 female > E4 male > E3 female > E3 male in sex-specific cultures. These data indicate that the APOE4 genotype and female sex together contribute to a greater inflammatory response in PMG isolated from targeted replacement humanized APOE mice. These data are consistent with clinical data and indicate that sex-specific PMG may provide a platform for exploring mechanisms of genotype and sex differences in AD related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
