37237908|a|Cognitive decline frequently occurs with increasing age, but mechanisms contributing to age-associated cognitive decline (ACD) are not well understood and solutions are lacking. Understanding and reversing mechanisms contributing to ACD are important because increased age is identified as the single most important risk factor for dementia. We reported earlier that ACD in older humans is associated with glutathione (GSH) deficiency, oxidative stress (OxS), mitochondrial dysfunction, glucose dysmetabolism and inflammation, and that supplementing GlyNAC (glycine and N-acetylcysteine) improved these defects. To test whether these defects occur in the brain in association with ACD, and could be improved/reversed with GlyNAC supplementation, we studied young (20-week) and old (90-week) C57BL/6J mice. Old mice received either regular or GlyNAC supplemented diets for 8 weeks, while young mice received the regular diet. Cognition and brain outcomes (GSH, OxS, mitochondrial energetics, autophagy/mitophagy, glucose transporters, inflammation, genomic damage and neurotrophic factors) were measured. Compared to young mice, the old-control mice had significant cognitive impairment and multiple brain defects. GlyNAC supplementation improved/corrected the brain defects and reversed ACD. This study finds that naturally-occurring ACD is associated with multiple abnormalities in the brain, and provides proof-of-concept that GlyNAC supplementation corrects these defects and improves cognitive function in aging.
