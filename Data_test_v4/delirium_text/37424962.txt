37424962|a|Introduction: Harmonization protocols that address batch effects and cross-site methodological differences in multi-center studies are critical for strengthening electroencephalography (EEG) signatures of functional connectivity (FC) as potential dementia biomarkers. Methods: We implemented an automatic processing pipeline incorporating electrode layout integrations, patient-control normalizations, and multi-metric EEG source space connectomics analyses. Results: Spline interpolations of EEG signals onto a head mesh model with 6067 virtual electrodes resulted in an effective method for integrating electrode layouts. Z-score transformations of EEG time series resulted in source space connectivity matrices with high bilateral symmetry, reinforced long-range connections, and diminished short-range functional interactions. A composite FC metric allowed for accurate multicentric classifications of Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Discussion: Harmonized multi-metric analysis of EEG source space connectivity can address data heterogeneities in multi-centric studies, representing a powerful tool for accurately characterizing dementia.
