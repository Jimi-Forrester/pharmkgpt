26706862|t|Cyproheptadine for the Prevention of Postoperative Delirium: A Pilot Study.
26706862|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common neurobehavioral complication after major surgeries. There is no conclusive approach for prevention of delirium in these patients. OBJECTIVE: In this study, efficacy of cyproheptadine for prevention of postoperative delirium was evaluated. METHODS: Delirium status of surgical patients was evaluated postoperatively at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) scale. Patients without delirium were assigned to the cyproheptadine or placebo group based on the simple randomization method. Patients received cyproheptadine or placebo tablet at a dose of 4 mg 3 times per day for 7 days. Patients were monitored daily for incidence of delirium. RESULTS: Changes in the incidence rates of delirium over time during the study phase (P = 0.04) and between the groups showed statistically significant differences (P = 0.029). However, severity of delirium was not significantly different between the cyproheptadine and placebo groups during the study period. CONCLUSION: It seems that cyproheptadine with its diverse effects can be a potential option for prevention of postoperative delirium. In this pilot study, cyproheptadine significantly decreased the incidence but not severity of postoperative delirium.
