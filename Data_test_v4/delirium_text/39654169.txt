39654169|a|Sarcopenia can be defined as the loss of muscle mass and strength. It is a poor prognostic factor for many diseases. Our study aims to assess the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with acute pancreatitis using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and hand dynamometry while also investigating its impact on acute pancreatitis. Sixty patients admitted with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were included in this prospective study. Following their admissions, prognostic markers were calculated, muscle strengths were measured using a hand dynamometer, and body compositions were determined using a BIA device. Accordingly, acute pancreatitis patients were divided into 2 groups: sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic. The demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, Ranson score, Glasgow-Imrie score, Balthazar score, APACHE-II score, disease severity according to the Atlanta classification, length of hospital stay, and laboratory findings of the 2 groups were compared. Sarcopenia was identified in 11 cases among those with acute pancreatitis included in the study. In the sarcopenic group, the mean age, Glasgow-Imrie score and number of cases with severe acute pancreatitis according to the Atlanta classification were significantly higher; body mass index, upper arm circumference, skeletal muscle mass index, and grip strength were significantly lower (P < .05). This study is the first to evaluate sarcopenia in acute pancreatitis cases using BIA and hand dynamometry. Sarcopenia may play a significant role in predicting the prognosis of acute pancreatitis.
