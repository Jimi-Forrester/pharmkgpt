36518994|t|A Comprehensive Update of Cerebral Organoids between Applications and Challenges.
36518994|a|The basic technology of stem cells has been developed and created organoids, which have established a strong interest in regenerative medicine. Different cell types have been used to generate cerebral organoids, which include interneurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLs are fundamental for brain development. Abundant studies have displayed that brain organoids can recapitulate fundamental and vital features of the human brain, such as cellular regulation and distribution, neuronal networks, electrical activities, and physiological structure. The organoids contain essential ventral brain domains and functional cortical interneurons, which are similar to the developing cortex and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). So, brain organoids have provided a singular model to study and investigate neurological disorder mechanisms and therapeutics. Furthermore, the blood brain barrier (BBB) organoids modeling contributes to accelerate therapeutic discovery for the treatment of several neuropathologies. In this review, we summarized the advances of the brain organoids applications to investigate neurological disorder mechanisms such as neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, mental disorders, brain cancer, and cerebral viral infections. We discussed brain organoids' therapeutic application as a potential therapeutic unique method and highlighted in detail the challenges and hurdles of organoid models.
