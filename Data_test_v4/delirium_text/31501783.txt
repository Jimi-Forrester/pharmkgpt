31501783|t|Multiple implant therapy with multiple inductions of general anesthesia in non-compliant patients with schizophrenia: A case report.
31501783|a|The effectiveness of dental implants in patients with disability, who are non-compliant during treatment, is controversial because of their poor oral health. Thus, oral health-care and management in such patients is concerning. Moreover, limited information is available on prognosis after implant placement. Herein, we describe a patient with schizophrenia who underwent dental implantation under multiple inductions of general anesthesia (5 times) and required conservative treatment and tooth extraction for multiple dental caries and retained roots because of inadequate oral health-care. Postoperatively, fracture of the prosthodontics and progression of dental caries were observed, and with 3 additional inductions of general anesthesia, conservative treatment, implant surgery, and prosthesis implantation were conducted. Postoperative 12-month follow-up since the last prosthesis implantation showed successful results. For patients with schizophrenia, multiple implantation can reduce horizontal bone loss and achieve aesthetic results compared to treatment with removable prosthodontics and could serve as an alternative treatment modality.
