30367645|a|BACKGROUND: The continuous administration of opioids in critical care patients is a common therapy for the tolerance of mechanical ventilation. Opioid choice has a crucial impact on the length of mechanical ventilation. Owing to its very short context-sensitive half-life, remifentanil widens the available options for sedoanalgetic strategies. Supply disruption of such established intensive care medication has been reported to worsen clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study investigated the influence of a nationwide supply shortage of remifentanil on mechanical ventilation and ventilation-associated outcomes at three perioperative intensive care units (ICUs) in a tertiary care hospital in Vienna. Two groups were followed: patients admitted to the ICU during the remifentanil shortage (July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016) and a control group one year after the remifentanil shortage (July 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017). Included patients were adults, received mechanical ventilation for at least 6 h, were admitted less than 90 days in the respective ICU, and survived their admission. RESULTS: For comparison, Poisson count regression models and logistic regression models were computed. To compensate for multiple testing, the significance level was split (0.02 for the primary and 0.006 for secondary outcome parameters). Patients in the remifentanil shortage group received significantly longer mechanical ventilation (risk ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 2.14-2.24, P <0.001) with significantly prolonged ICU stay (P <0.001), days with non-invasive ventilation (P <0.001), and length of hospital stay (P <0.001). No significant difference was found in the occurrence of pneumonia (P = 0.040) and sepsis (P = 0.061). A greater proportion of patients in the shortage group underwent secondary tracheostomy (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The remifentanil shortage caused a significant impairment of essential outcome parameters in the ICU.
