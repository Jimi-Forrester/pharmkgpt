30003902|a|The phenothiazine methylene blue (MB) is attracting increasing attention because it seems to have beneficial effects in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among other factors, the presence of neuritic plaques of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates, neurofibrilar tangles of tau and perturbation of cytosolic Ca2+ are important players of the disease. It has been proposed that MB decreases the formation of neuritic plaques due to Abeta aggregation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect is far from clear. In this work, we show that MB stimulates the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) in human tissues from AD-affected brain and age-matched controls and also from pig brain and cell cultures. In addition, MB prevents and even blocks the inhibitory effect of Abeta on PMCA activity. Functional analysis with mutants and fluorescence experiments strongly suggest that MB binds to PMCA, at the C-terminal tail, in a site located close to the last transmembrane helix and also that MB binds to the peptide. Besides, Abeta increases PMCA affinity for MB. These results point out a novel molecular basis of MB action on Abeta and PMCA as mediator of its beneficial effect on AD.
