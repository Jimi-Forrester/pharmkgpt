35083791|a|Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Until now, PET imaging of the translocator protein (TSPO) has been widely used to depict the neuroimmune endophenotype of AD. The aim of this review was to provide an update to the results from 2018 and to advance the characterization of the biological basis of TSPO imaging in AD by re-examining TSPO function and expression and the methodological aspects of interest. Although the biological basis of the TSPO PET signal is obviously related to microglia and astrocytes in AD, the observed process remains uncertain and might not be directly related to neuroinflammation. Further studies are required to re-examine the cellular significance underlying a variation in the PET signal in AD.
