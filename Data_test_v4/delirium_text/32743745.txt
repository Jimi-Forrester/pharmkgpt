32743745|a|Reminiscent of the human prion diseases, there is considerable clinical and pathological variability in Alzheimer's disease, the most common human neurodegenerative condition. As in prion disorders, protein misfolding and aggregation is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease, where the initiating event is thought to be the self-assembly of Abeta peptide into aggregates that deposit in the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests that Abeta, similar to the prion protein, can polymerize into a conformationally diverse spectrum of aggregate strains both in vitro and within the brain. Moreover, certain types of Abeta aggregates exhibit key hallmarks of prion strains including divergent biochemical attributes and the ability to induce distinct pathological phenotypes when intracerebrally injected into mouse models. In this review, we discuss the evidence demonstrating that Abeta can assemble into distinct strains of aggregates and how such strains may be primary drivers of the phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease.
