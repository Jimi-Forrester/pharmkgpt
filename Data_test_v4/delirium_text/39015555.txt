39015555|t|Exosome nanovesicles: biomarkers and new strategies for treatment of human diseases.
39015555|a|Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles of cellular origin. One of the main characteristics of exosomes is their ability to carry a wide range of biomolecules from their parental cells, which are important mediators of intercellular communication and play an important role in physiological and pathological processes. Exosomes have the advantages of biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and wide biodistribution. As researchers' understanding of exosomes has increased, various strategies have been proposed for their use in diagnosing and treating diseases. Here, we provide an overview of the biogenesis and composition of exosomes, describe the relationship between exosomes and disease progression, and focus on the use of exosomes as biomarkers for early screening, disease monitoring, and guiding therapy in refractory diseases such as tumors and neurodegenerative diseases. We also summarize the current applications of exosomes, especially engineered exosomes, for efficient drug delivery, targeted therapies, gene therapies, and immune vaccines. Finally, the current challenges and potential research directions for the clinical application of exosomes are also discussed. In conclusion, exosomes, as an emerging molecule that can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, combined with multidisciplinary innovative solutions, will play an important role in clinical applications.
