36119922|t|Nursing Method of Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury and Fracture in the Ambulance.
36119922|a|Craniocerebral injury accounts for 9%-21% of the injuries in all parts of the body, and the incidence rate ranks first in all types of trauma or only lower than limb fractures. This study mainly discusses the nursing methods of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and fractures in ambulances. This study is based on risk factors with moderate-to-higher association strength from retrospective studies. According to the regression coefficients of the logistic regression model, the risk factors were assigned, and the early warning score table of craniocerebral injury complicated with hyponatremia was established. The energy efficiency of the early warning score table was evaluated by case diagnostic test and ROC analysis. At the same time, risk grading is carried out, and the chi-square test is used to test the reliability of the grading standard, so as to identify the risk of hyponatremia in patients with craniocerebral injury early and screen out high-risk patients as the key observation objects of nurses. Based on the early warning score table of craniocerebral injury complicated with hyponatremia, different systematic nursing intervention measures were taken for low-risk patients and high-risk patients, and their application effects were evaluated. The clinical application effect of the systematic nursing intervention program was evaluated by the historical control research method, which provided a reference for the nursing in the ambulance to prevent other complications of patients with craniocerebral injury. The positive rate of prehospital operation can reach 64.44%, and the specific rate can reach 84.44%. 60% of the sample sought better metastatic care in terms of the purpose of using an ambulance. The systematic nursing intervention program has a certain effect on reducing the incidence of hyponatremia in patients with craniocerebral injury and shortening the hospitalization time of patients with craniocerebral injury. The early warning score of craniocerebral injury complicated with hyponatremia developed in this study is concise and practical and can provide a basis for clinical assessment of the risk of hyponatremia in patients with craniocerebral injury.
