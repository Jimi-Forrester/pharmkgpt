37401006|a|Down syndrome (DS) is associated with an ultra-high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding variability in pre-AD cognitive abilities may help understand cognitive decline in this population. The mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential component reflecting the detection of deviant stimuli that is thought to represent underlying memory processes, with reduced MMN amplitudes being associated with cognitive decline. To further understand the MMN in adults with DS without AD, we explored the relationships between MMN, age, and cognitive abilities (memory, language, and attention) in 27 individuals (aged 17-51) using a passive auditory oddball task. Statistically significant MMN was present only in 18 individuals up to 41 years of age and the latency were longer than canonical parameters reported in the literature. Reduced MMN amplitude was associated with lower memory scores, while longer MMN latencies were associated with poorer memory, verbal abilities, and attention. Therefore, the MMN may represent a valuable index of cognitive abilities in DS. In combination with previous findings, we hypothesize that while MMN response and amplitude may be associated with AD-related memory loss, MMN latency may be associated with speech signal processing. Future studies may explore the potential impact of AD on MMN in people with DS.
