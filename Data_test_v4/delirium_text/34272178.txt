The discovery of the Anti NMDA receptor and other antibodies as the causative agents of PAE, has led to an increased need for guidelines for diagnosis and management of these disorders. PAE remains a challenging group of disorders due to their varying presentations and etiology with a prolonged clinical course. The wide spectrum of clinical symptoms involves altered mental status, movement disorders, acute behavioral changes, psychosis, delirium, seizures, and insomnia. This group of disorders was recently recognized in the children.
