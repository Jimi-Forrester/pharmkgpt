39422951|t|Targeting Metals in Alzheimer's Disease: An Update.
39422951|a|One pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the dysregulated metal ions, e.g., zinc, copper, and iron in the affected brain regions. The dysregulation of metal homeostasis may cause neurotoxicity and directly addressing these dysregulated metals through metal chelation or mitigating the downstream neurotoxicity stands as a pivotal strategy for AD therapy. This review aims to provide an up-to-date comprehensive overview of the application of metal chelators and drugs targeting metal-related neurotoxicity, such as antioxidants (ferroptotic inhibitors), in the context of AD treatment. It encompasses an exploration of their pharmacological effects, clinical research progress, and potential underlying mechanisms.
