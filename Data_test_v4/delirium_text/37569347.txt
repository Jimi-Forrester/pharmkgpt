37569347|t|Asiaticoside Mitigates Alzheimer's Disease Pathology by Attenuating Inflammation and Enhancing Synaptic Function.
37569347|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, hallmarked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Due to the uncertainty of the pathogenesis of AD, strategies aimed at suppressing neuroinflammation and fostering synaptic repair are eagerly sought. Asiaticoside (AS), a natural triterpenoid derivative derived from Centella asiatica, is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound-healing properties; however, its neuroprotective function in AD remains unclear. Our current study reveals that AS, when administered (40 mg/kg) in vivo, can mitigate cognitive dysfunction and attenuate neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of microglia and proinflammatory factors in Abeta1-42-induced AD mice. Further mechanistic investigation suggests that AS may ameliorate cognitive impairment by inhibiting the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and promoting synaptic repair. Our findings propose that AS could be a promising candidate for AD treatment, offering neuroinflammation inhibition and enhancement of synaptic function.
