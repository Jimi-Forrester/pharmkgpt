31163630|t|Modulation of Adenosine Receptors and Antioxidative Effect of Beer Extracts in in Vitro Models.
31163630|a|The fight against neurodegenerative diseases is promoting the searching of nutrients, preferably of wide consumption, with proven effects on health. Beer is widely consumed and has potential benefits on health. In this work, three different extracts from dark beer (DB), non-alcoholic beer (NAB), and lager beer (LB) were assayed at 30 min and 24 h in rat C6 glioma and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in order to study their possible protective effects. Cell viability and adenosine A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptor gene expression and protein levels were measured in control cells and in cells challenged with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant stressor. Among the three extracts analyzed, DB showed a greater protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and cell death. Moreover, a higher A1 receptor level was also induced by this extract. Interestingly, A1 receptor level was also increased by NAB and LB extracts, but to a lower extent, and the protective effect of these extracts against H2O2 was lower. This possible correlation between protection and A1 receptor level was observed at 24 h in both C6 and SH-SY5Y cells. In summary, different beer extracts modulate, to a different degree, adenosine receptors expression and protect both glioma and neuroblastoma cells from oxidative stress.
