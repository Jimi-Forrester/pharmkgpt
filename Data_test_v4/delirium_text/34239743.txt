34239743|t|Fatal Brucellosis Infection in a Liver Transplant Patient: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
34239743|a|Brucellosis is the most common zoonosis, particularly in developing countries. The true incidence of human brucellosis is unknown. The WHO points out that 500,000 cases of brucellosis are reported each year from around the world. In Colombia, there is currently no regular surveillance of the event in humans and its prevalence is low due a low clinical suspicion. We report a case of a 66-year-old man, an urban merchant, who had received a liver transplant 11 years ago. The patient presented to the emergency department for two months of fatigue, severe myalgia, paresis of the extremities, loss of muscle strength, and progressive deterioration of functional class. In the emergency room, he became disoriented and was transferred to the intensive-care unit. He had a white blood cell count of 18990/uL and creatine phosphokinase 10302 U/L. Routine blood cultures were positive for Brucella melitensis. The patient reported consumption of unpasteurized bovine milk. He was treated with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. Despite antibiotic management, after one month of hospitalization and in the context of septic shock with multiorgan failure, the patient died. Brucellosis is an unsuspected and underdiagnosed disease. It can occur in people with or without risk factors. Although the mortality is low, immunocompromised patients can develop fatal infections. A presumptive diagnosis can be established through the correlation of patient history and classic laboratory findings, which include transaminitis, anemia, and leukopenia with relative lymphocytosis; however, other findings can help us to guide the diagnosis, such as rhabdomyolysis, which appears as a complication in different infections; however, it had not been described before in brucellosis. A partnership between clinical suspicion laboratory diagnostic tests and improved disease surveillance systems is necessary to fight the disease.
