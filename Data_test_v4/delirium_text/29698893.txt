29698893|a|Three new norditerpenoids alkaloids, 1beta-hydroxy,14beta-acetyl condelphine (1), jadwarine-A (2), jadwarine-B (3) along with two known alkaloids isotalatizidine hydrate (4) and dihydropentagynine (5) were isolated from medicinal plant Delphinium denudatum. The structures of natural products 1-5 were established on the basis of HR-EIMS, 1H and 13C NMR (1D & 2D) spectroscopic data as well as by comparison from literature data. The structures of compound 1 and 4 were also confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. In-vitro AChE and BChE enzyme inhibitory activities of compounds 1-5 and molecular docking studies were performed to investigate the possible molecular inhibitory mechanism of the isolated natural products. Compound 2, 4 and 5 showed competitive inhibitory effects by inhibiting AChE and BChE, respectively, while 1 and 3 showed non-competitive inhibition. This work is the first report that provides a supporting evidence about the use of constituents of Delphinium denudatum in cerebral dementia and Alzheimer diseases.
