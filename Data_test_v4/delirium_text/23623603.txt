23623603|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and neuroinflammatory processes mediated by Abeta plaque-induced microglial cells and astrocytes contribute to AD pathogenesis. The present study examined human placenta amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs), which have potent immunomodulatory and paracrine effects in a Tg2576 (APPswe) transgenic mouse model of AD. AMSCs secreted high levels of transforming growth factor-beta under in vitro inflammatory environment conditions. Six weeks after the intravenous injection of AMSCs, APPswe mice showed evidence of improved spatial learning, which significantly correlated with the observation of fewer Abeta plaques in brain. The number of ED1-positive phagocytic microglial cells associated with Abeta plaques was higher in AMSC-injected mice than in phosphate-buffered saline-injected mice, and the level of Abeta-degrading enzymes (matrix metallopeptidase-9 and insulin-degrading enzyme) was also significantly higher. Furthermore, the level of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, was lower and that of anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta, was higher in AMSC-injected mice than phosphate-buffered saline-injected mice. These effects lasted until 12 weeks after AMSC injection. Taken together, these results collectively suggest that injection of AMSCs might show significant long-lasting improvement in AD pathology and memory function via immunomodulatory and paracrine mechanisms.
