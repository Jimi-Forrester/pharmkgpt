38423195|a|Conflicting evidence exists on the relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. Therefore, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to evaluate the correlation of glucose metabolism measures (glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance indices) and DM status with AD biomarkers of amyloid-beta and tau measured by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid. We selected 37 studies from PubMed and Embase, including 11,694 individuals. More impaired glucose metabolism and DM status were associated with higher tau biomarkers (r=0.11[0.03-0.18], p=0.008; I2=68%), but were not associated with amyloid-beta biomarkers (r=-0.06[-0.13-0.01], p=0.08; I2=81%). Meta-regression revealed that glucose metabolism and DM were specifically associated with tau biomarkers in population settings (p=0.001). Furthermore, more impaired glucose metabolism and DM status were associated with lower amyloid-beta biomarkers in memory clinic settings (p=0.004), and in studies with a higher prevalence of dementia (p<0.001) or lower cognitive scores (p=0.04). These findings indicate that DM is associated with biomarkers of tau but not with amyloid-beta. This knowledge is valuable for improving dementia and DM diagnostics and treatment.
