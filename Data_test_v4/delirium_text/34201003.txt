34201003|t|Impact of Early Mobilization on Recovery after Major Head and Neck Surgery with Free Flap Reconstruction.
34201003|a|Surgery with free flap reconstruction is a standard treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC). Because of the complexity of HNC surgery, recovery can be challenging, and complications are common. One of the foundations of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is early postoperative mobilization. The ERAS guidelines for HNC surgery with free flap reconstruction recommend mobilization within 24 h. This is based mainly on evidence from other surgical disciplines, and the extent to which mobilization within 24 h improves recovery after HNC surgery has not been explored. This retrospective analysis included 445 patients from the Calgary Head and Neck Enhanced Recovery Program. Mobilization after 24 h was associated with more complications of any type (OR = 1.73, 95% CI [confidence interval] = 1.16-2.57) and more major complications (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.00-3.16). When accounting for patient and clinical factors, mobilization after 48 h was a significant predictor of major complications (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.10-6.21) and prolonged length of stay (>10 days; OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.41-5.76). This comprehensive analysis of the impact of early mobilization on postoperative complications and length of stay in a large HNC cohort provides novel evidence supporting adherence to the ERAS early mobilization recommendations. Early mobilization should be a priority for patients undergoing HNC surgery with free flap reconstruction.
