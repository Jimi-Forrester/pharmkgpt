37292756|a|One of the earliest pathophysiological perturbations in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) may arise from dysfunction of fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons (PV-INs). Defining early protein-level (proteomic) alterations in PV-INs can provide key biological and translationally relevant insights. Here, we use cell-type-specific in vivo biotinylation of proteins (CIBOP) coupled with mass spectrometry to obtain native-state proteomes of PV interneurons. PV-INs exhibited proteomic signatures of high metabolic, mitochondrial, and translational activity, with over-representation of causally linked AD genetic risk factors. Analyses of bulk brain proteomes indicated strong correlations between PV-IN proteins with cognitive decline in humans, and with progressive neuropathology in humans and mouse models of Abeta pathology. Furthermore, PV-IN-specific proteomes revealed unique signatures of increased mitochondrial and metabolic proteins, but decreased synaptic and mTOR signaling proteins in response to early Abeta pathology. PV-specific changes were not apparent in whole-brain proteomes. These findings showcase the first native state PV-IN proteomes in mammalian brain, revealing a molecular basis for their unique vulnerabilities in AD.
