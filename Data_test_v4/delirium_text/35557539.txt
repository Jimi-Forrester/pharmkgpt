35557539|t|Periprocedural Strategies for Stroke Prevention in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.
35557539|a|Cerebrovascular events remain a serious complication in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation with an incidence of 2-3% at 30 days. While expanding TAVI to younger low-risk patients, prevention of periprocedural strokes becomes even more important. Different cerebral embolic protection devices have been tested but a clear clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in randomized trials. Due to the multifactorial aetiology with different predisposing factors, stroke prevention should include procedural and periprocedural strategies. This article aims to summarize different approaches and discuss open questions.
