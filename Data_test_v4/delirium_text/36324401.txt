36324401|t|rTg-D: A novel transgenic rat model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy Type-2.
36324401|a|Background: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is common disorder of the elderly, a prominent comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease, and causes vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Previously, we generated a transgenic rat model of capillary CAA type-1 that develops many pathological features of human disease. However, a complementary rat model of larger vessel CAA type-2 disease has been lacking. Methods: A novel transgenic rat model (rTg-D) was generated that produces human familial CAA Dutch E22Q mutant amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in brain and develops larger vessel CAA type-2. Quantitative biochemical and pathological analyses were performed to characterize the progression of CAA and associated pathologies in aging rTg-D rats. Results: rTg-D rats begin to accumulate Abeta in brain and develop varying levels of larger vessel CAA type-2, in the absence of capillary CAA type-1, starting around 18 months of age. Larger vessel CAA was mainly composed of the Abeta40 peptide and most prominent in surface leptomeningeal/pial vessels and arterioles of the cortex and thalamus. Cerebral microbleeds and small vessel occlusions were present mostly in the thalamic region of affected rTg-D rats. In contrast to capillary CAA type-1 the amyloid deposited within the walls of larger vessels of rTg-D rats did not promote perivascular astrocyte and microglial responses or accumulate the Abeta chaperone apolipoprotein E. Conclusion: Although variable in severity, the rTg-D rats specifically develop larger vessel CAA type-2 that reflects many of the pathological features of human disease and provide a new model to investigate the pathogenesis of this condition.
