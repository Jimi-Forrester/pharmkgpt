37510097|a|For more than two years, lingering sequalae of COVID-19 have been extensively investigated. Approximately 10% of individuals infected by COVID-19 have been found to experience long-term symptoms termed "long COVID-19". The neurological and psychiatric manifestations of long COVID-19 are of particular concern. While pathogenesis remains unclear, emerging imaging studies have begun to better elucidate certain pathological manifestation. Of specific interest is imaging with [18F]FDG PET which directly reflects cellular glycolysis often linked to metabolic and inflammatory processes. Seeking to understand the molecular basis of neurological features of long COVID-19, this review encompasses the most recent [18F]FDG PET literature in this area.
