22986093|a|INTRODUCTION: Informal caregivers provide care to dementia patients, and this service prolongs their stay at home. OBJECTIVES: To describe characteristics of dementia patients in the province of Alicante, as well as the profiles and roles of caregivers who assist them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multi-centre prospective study carried out in 4 neurology departments in Alicante (June 2009 to January 2010). Dementia patients' relatives/caregivers were included in sequential order. The following variables were analysed: a) Demographic information pertaining to the patient and caregivers (age, sex, marital and employment status, educational level, relationship to patient); b) patient's family unit; c) motivating factor for primary caregiver (PC); d) secondary caregiver (SC) roles; e) country of citizenship of formal caregiver (FC) and source of remuneration (private/public); f) caregivers' knowledge of dementia. RESULTS: Most of our patients live at home (74.8%), and are female (69%) with Alzheimer's disease (78.4%) in a moderately severe stage (GDS level 4-5, 71.6%). PCs and SCs are mainly women (72.1% and 60.5% respectively), middle-aged and directly related to the patient (sons/daughters account for 64.3% of the PCs and 54.4% of the SCs); most are homemakers with a low educational level. Caregivers in the first category (PC) provide care due to moral obligation (75%), while those in the second (SC) involve patients in leisure or other stimulating activities (82.3%). Absent caregivers tend to be males (73.3%) residing long distances from the relative (52.4%). The FC tends to be female (91.7%), Spanish (81.8%) and privately remunerated. CONCLUSIONS: Women dominate the network of caregivers for dementia patients, whether as principal caregivers, supporting caregivers or formal caregivers (in all cases, they have only limited training in dementia management). Males are largely absent. Better knowledge of the care structure supporting dementia patients may be helpful in the overall management of these patients.
