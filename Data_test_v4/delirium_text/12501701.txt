12501701|a|Oxidative stress may play an important role in neuronal degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These disorders make the elderly not being able to live normally and move freely. So it is necessary to find effective antioxidants to prevent or cure the aged persons from diseases related to neuronal degeneration. Schisanhenol (Sal) and salvianolic acid A (Sal A) are known antioxidants which were isolated from Chinese herbs respectively. SY-L is a totally synthetic new compound. The results showed that Sal, Sal A and SY-L significantly protect cerebral cells from the injuries induced by oxidative stress.
