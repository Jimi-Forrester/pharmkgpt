19291432|t|Sudden death by laryngeal polyp: a case report and review of the literature.
19291432|a|Sudden unexpected death in the context of bizarre or unusual behavior usually relates to acute drug intoxication or excited delirium. We report the case of a man who died suddenly while running naked on a public street. Although the initial death investigation was indicative of excited delirium or drug intoxication, autopsy revealed glottic obstruction by an inflammatory laryngeal polyp. Toxicologic studies were negative and investigation revealed presentation at a hospital the day before death with stridor. It is believed he developed airway obstruction while dressing at home and ran out on the street to find assistance. This case illustrates the importance of a thorough death investigation and a broad differential diagnosis when approaching a forensic autopsy.
