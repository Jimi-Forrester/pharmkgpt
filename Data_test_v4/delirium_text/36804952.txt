We studied whether updating the CP, through prioritization of admission and surgery, improvement in the prevention and treatment of delirium, management of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents and the use of perioperative peripheral nerve block, modifies surgical delay, stay, readmissions, mortality, suffering delirium and functional status at discharge. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective observational study of unicenter cohorts of 468 patients with HF, 220 from 2016 (old VC) and 248 from 2019 (new VC). The variables are: intervention in the first 48hours, surgical delay (hours), stay (days), stay less than 15 days, delirium, functional loss at discharge (Barthel prefracture scale less Barthel scale at discharge), readmission at one month, and mortality at admission, month and year. RESULTS: Median age: 87.0 [interquartile range 8.0], mostly women (76.7%). Significantly, with the new VC, there was a greater number of patients operated on in the first 48hours (27,7% vs 36,8% p=0.036), less surgical delay (72.5 [47,5-110,5] vs 64.0 [42,0-88,0] p<0.001), shorter stay (10,0 [7,0-13,0] vs 8,0 [6,0-11,0] p<0.001), greater number of discharges in 15 days (78,2% vs 91,5% p<0.001), lower delirium (54,1% vs 43,5% p=0.023). No significant changes in readmissions, functional loss at discharge, mortality at admission, 3 months or year. CONCLUSIONS: Updating the VC brings benefits to the patient (less surgical delay, equal functional status at discharge with fewer days of admission) and benefits in management (lower admission) without modifying mortality.
