38849370|a|The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immune receptor that affects cellular phenotypes by modulating phagocytosis and metabolism, promoting cell survival, and counteracting inflammation. Its role in renal injury, in particular, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) or ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced renal injury remains unclear. In our study, WT and Trem2-/- mice were employed to evaluate the role of TREM2 in renal macrophage infiltration and tissue injury after UUO. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from both mouse genotypes were cultured and polarized for in vitro experiments. Next, the effects of TREM2 on renal injury and macrophage polarization in IRI mice were also explored. We found that TREM2 expression was upregulated in the obstructed kidneys. TREM2 deficiency exacerbated renal inflammation and fibrosis 3 and 7 days after UUO, in association with reduced macrophage infiltration. Trem2-/- BMDM exhibited increased apoptosis and poorer survival compared with WT BMDM. Meanwhile, TREM2 deficiency augmented M1 and M2 polarization after UUO. Consistent with the in vivo observations, TREM2 deficiency led to increased polarization of BMDM towards the M1 proinflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, TREM2 deficiency promoted M1 and M2 polarization via the JAK-STAT pathway in the presence of TGF-beta1, thereby affecting cell survival by regulating mTOR signaling. Furthermore, cyclocreatine supplementation alleviated cell death caused by TREM2 deficiency. Additionally, we found that TREM2 deficiency promoted renal injury, fibrosis, and macrophage polarization in IRI mice. The current data suggest that TREM2 deficiency aggravates renal injury by promoting macrophage apoptosis and polarization via the JAK-STAT pathway. These findings have implications for the role of TREM2 in the regulation of renal injury that justify further evaluation.
