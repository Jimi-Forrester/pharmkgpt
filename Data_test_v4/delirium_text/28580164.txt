28580164|t|Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programme for depression in people with early stages of dementia: study protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study.
28580164|a|BACKGROUND: Depression and dementia are major public health problems in the UK. Depression in early-stage dementia is very common and significantly reduces quality of life, speeds cognitive decline and increases functional impairment. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an effective depression prevention programme, and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has suggested that MBCT is a priority for implementation. Alongside this, there is emerging evidence demonstrating promising results in relation to the benefits of adapted mindfulness interventions for people with dementia, suggesting that it could be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms and in slowing deterioration in cognitive functions such as sustained attention, distraction inhibition and task switching. METHODS: The design is a single-blind randomised controlled feasibility trial. Participants with mild to moderate depression and early stages of dementia will be recruited from the participating memory services. Participants will receive either immediate or delayed access to an 8-week MBCT programme. Participants will be assessed by a blind assessor and complete cognitive and mood-related outcome measures before and after the intervention. This feasibility study will test the trial design and assess recruitment, retention, acceptability and adherence, as well as providing preliminary efficacy data. DISCUSSION: This study will inform the design and sample size for a future full randomised controlled trial (RCT), which will be carried out to determine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing depressive symptoms in people with early stages of dementia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ISRCTN16382776.
