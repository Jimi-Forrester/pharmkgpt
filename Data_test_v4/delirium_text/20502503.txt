20502503|a|The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder (Gab) proteins are intracellular scaffolding/docking molecules, and participate in multiple signaling pathways, usually acting as the downstream effector of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)-triggered signal transduction pathway. When phosphorylated by PTKs, Gab proteins can recruit several signaling molecules (p85, SHP2, and Crk), and subsequently activate multiple transmitting signals that are critical for cell growth, survival, differentiation and apoptosis. Recently, it has been reported that Gab2 polymorphism is associated with the increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. This review mainly focuses on the structure and function of Gab2 protein and its role in the pathogenesis of AD.
