35908596|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system disease characterised by degenerative cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. In a society where the global population is gradually ageing, the health threats and financial burdens caused by AD are becoming increasingly severe since AD often occurs in old age. With the in-depth study of AD, many new pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed, among which bidirectional communication between intestinal microbes and the brain has attracted widespread attention. The aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is related to the imbalance of the gut microbiota. Epidemiological investigations have shown that patients with IBD are more likely to suffer from AD. Targeting IBD as a potential AD treatment target has attracted considerable interest. Here, we reviewed the link between chronic intestinal inflammation and central nervous system inflammation and found that IBD patients had a higher risk of AD than non-IBD patients. Preclinical models based on AD also showed that IBD aggravated the condition of AD. We discussed possible biological links between AD and IBD, including the gut-brain axis, autoimmunity, and the gut microbiota. In addition, IBD-induced changes in intestinal microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan, which aggravate the development of AD, were also discussed.
