33271462|a|BACKGROUND: Retinal abnormalities measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been detected in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive impairment is not only found in AD, but 75-90% of PD patients will also develop dementia in the late stage of disease. We assessed whether baseline retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness predicted worsening of cognitive status over time and the correlation between RNFL thickness and the detailed impaired cognitive domains in PD. METHODS: RNFL thickness was measured using high-definition OCT in 78 non-dementia PD patients. Clinical and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and at 3.61 +- 0.65 years follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between RNFL thickness and the changes in cognitive test scores, after adjusting for age, sex, disease duration and education. RESULTS: Analysis of outcomes according to baseline RNFL tertiles showed worse performance in global cognitive tests, delayed memory, and executive functions in patients with a thin RNFL. During follow-up, greater cognitive deterioration was found in thin RNFL tertile patients. Lower baseline average RNFL thickness was associated with greater annualized decline in Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. CONCLUSION: The correlation between RNFL thickness and cognitive dysfunction suggests that OCT may be useful for predicting cognitive dysfunction in PD patients.
