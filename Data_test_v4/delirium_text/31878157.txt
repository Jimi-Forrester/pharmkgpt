31878157|a|Genetic factors behind the increasing incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in young non-smokers are suspected, but have not been identified. Recently, rs6942067, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located upstream of the DCBLD1 gene, was found associated with non-smoking lung adenocarcinoma. To validate if this SNP is also implicated in HNSCC, participants of The Cancer Genome Atlas HNSCC cohort were investigated for rs6942067 status, associated DCBLD1 expression, and clinical characteristics. Occurrence of the rs6942067 GG genotype is significantly higher in young and in HPV negative non-smoking HNSCC than in other HNSCC. Additionally, rs6942067 GG is associated with higher DCBLD1 expression in HNSCC and patients with high DCBLD1 expression have a worse overall survival at three years, both in univariate and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, high DCBLD1 expression is associated with activation of the integrin signaling pathway and its phosphorylation with EGFR and MET. Collectively, these findings suggest that DCBLD1 plays a critical role in HNSCC and demonstrate an association between rs6942067 and clinical characteristics of young age and HPV negative non-smoking status in HNSCC patients.
