38928583|t|Alterations in Neurotrophins in Alcohol-Addicted Patients during Alcohol Withdrawal.
38928583|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is related to mental and somatic disorders that result in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), with 30% of AWS cases leading to life-threatening delirium tremens (DTs). Currently, studies do not support using any one biomarker in DTs. Neurotrophins affect neuromodulation, playing a role in the pathogenesis of AUD, AWS, and DTs. METHODS: This review aims to summarize experimental and clinical data related to neurotrophins and S100B in neuroplasticity, as well as neurodegeneration in the context of AUD, AWS, and DTs. This work used publications that were selected based on the protocol consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: The BDNF level could be a good candidate biomarker for relapse susceptibility, as it is significantly reduced during consumption and gradually increases during abstinence. GDNF influences AUD through its integral role in the function of dopaminergic neurons and ablates the return to alcohol-drinking behavior. NGF protects neurons from ethanol-induced cytotoxic damage and affects recovery from cognitive deficits after brain damage. The NT-3 level is decreased after alcohol exposure and is involved in compensatory mechanisms for cognitive decline in AUD. NT-4 affects oxidative stress, which is associated with chronic alcohol consumption. S100B is used as a biomarker of brain damage, with elevated levels in serum in AUD, and can protect 5-HT neurons from the damage caused by alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: BDNF, GDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NGF, and S100B may be valuable markers for withdrawal syndrome. In particular, the most relevant is their association with the development of delirium complications. However, there are few data concerning some neurotrophins in AWS and DTs, suggesting the need for further research.
