30632006|a|Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and insulin-resistance is commonly seen in patients with Hhcy. Liraglutide (Lir), a glucagon-like peptide that increases the secretion and sensitivity of insulin, has a neurotrophic or neuroprotective effect. However, it is not known whether Lir ameliorates the AD-like pathology and memory deficit induced by Hhcy. By vena caudalis injection of homocysteine to produce the Hhcy model in rats, we found here that simultaneous administration of Lir for 2 weeks ameliorated the Hhcy-induced memory deficit, along with increased density of dendritic spines and up-regulation of synaptic proteins. Lir also attenuated the Hhcy-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta overproduction, and the molecular mechanisms involved the restoration of protein phosphatase-2A activity and inhibition of beta- and gamma-secretases. Phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 also decreased after treatment with Lir. Our data reveal that Lir improves the Hhcy-induced AD-like spatial memory deficit and the mechanisms involve the modulation of insulin-resistance and the pathways generating abnormal tau and Abeta.
