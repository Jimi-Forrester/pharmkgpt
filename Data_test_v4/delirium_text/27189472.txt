27189472|t|Beyond Cholinesterase Inhibition: Anti-Inflammatory Role and Pharmacological Profile of Current Drug Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease.
27189472|a|Inflammation is a common response of an individual against either exogenous or endogenous damage. The role of inflammation and of inflammatory cells recently emerged also in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental evidences show how neurotransmitters, besides their role in the synapses, play a modulatory role during immune response. Drugs used for treatment of dementia symptoms are able to increase neurotransmitters levels, and likely to have a modulatory role during immune response. Aim of this review is to discuss the most recent advances on inflammation role during neurodegeneration and also to individuate the potential anti-inflammatory role played by drugs currently used for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
