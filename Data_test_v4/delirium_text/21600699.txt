21600699|a|The innovative concept of transnasal evaporative cooling for therapeutic hypothermia in cardio-pulmonary-cerebro-resuscitation has therapeutic implications with evidence of rapid and selective brain cooling; however, this author wants to elicit that this concept may hold answers for many physiological phenomena which have not been explored or completely understood up till now. To affirm the physiological role of transnasal cooling, the innovative non-invasive brain temperature monitoring can help the investigators to explore and understand the following transnasal pathophysiological phenomena: (1) understanding correlation of brain temperature and sinus headache secondary to nasal blockade, (2) exploring the therapeutic role of nasal oxygen for prevention of delirium in intubated patients, (3) realizing the impact of controlled enclosed environments on the mood and affect of the inhabitants, (4) understanding the etio-pathogenesis of claustrophobia after excluding the confounding factors of morbid obesity, severe cardiopulmonary disease and incapacitating musculoskeletal diseases, (5) exploring the anthropological role of male pattern of moustache, beard and hair loss, and (6) possible development of a coolant moustache as proposed by the author. In summary, transnasal pathophysiology offers many promising lines of fruitful research to explore the non-olfactory physiological functions of nose in human beings.
