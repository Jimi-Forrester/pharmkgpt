7384303|a|Despite the successes achieved by modern distraneurinomonotherapy, treatment of delirium tremens remains full of complications and high-risk problem. Basing on theoretical considerations regarding the delirium tremens as a form of psychosis, the additional application of a neuroleptic with an antipsychotic action is suggested to achieve a specific treatment, exercising a direct influence both on the psychotic and on the neurovegetative signs of alcoholic delirium. Experiences collected with a combination treatment extending over two years with haloperidol IV and ch clomethiazol oral, point to a decrease in the incidence rate of delirium, a milder course of the delirium itself, and a corresponding decrease in associated complications. This should stimulate further systematic and statistically safe investigations in this field.
