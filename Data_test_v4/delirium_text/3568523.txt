3568523|t|Repeated delirium from homatropine eye-drops. A case report.
3568523|a|The administration of homatropine eye-drops precipitated several episodes of delirium in a 69-year-old woman. The unusual susceptibility of this patient to the central anticholinergic effect of homatropine is perhaps related to a preexisting mild cognitive defect possibly related to a cholinergic neurotransmitter deficit.
