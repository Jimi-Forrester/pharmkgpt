29067326|t|Targeting butyrylcholinesterase for preclinical single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of Alzheimer's disease.
29067326|a|INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo, by molecular imaging of amyloid or tau, is constrained because similar changes can be found in brains of cognitively normal individuals. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which becomes associated with these structures in AD, could elevate the accuracy of AD diagnosis by focusing on BChE pathology in the cerebral cortex, a region of scant BChE activity in healthy brain. METHODS: N-methylpiperidin-4-yl 4-[123I]iodobenzoate, a BChE radiotracer, was injected intravenously into B6SJL-Tg(APPSwFlLon, PSEN1*M146 L*L286 V) 6799Vas/Mmjax (5XFAD) mice and their wild-type (WT) counterparts for comparative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. SPECT, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enabled comparison of whole brain and regional retention of the BChE radiotracer in both mouse strains. RESULTS: Retention of the BChE radiotracer was consistently higher in the 5XFAD mouse than in WT, and differences were particularly evident in the cerebral cortex. DISCUSSION: Cerebral cortical BChE imaging with SPECT can distinguish 5XFAD mouse model from the WT counterpart.
