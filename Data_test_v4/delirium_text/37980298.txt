37980298|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore correlations between insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and markers of metabolic function in a group of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and metabolically healthy volunteers. METHOD: We included 120 individuals (47 with T2DM, 9 with AD, and 64 healthy controls). Serum levels of IDE were measured with commercial kits for ELISA. Differences in IDE levels between groups were analyzed with non-parametric ANCOVA, and correlations were analyzed with Spearman's rank correlations. We also investigated the influence of age, sex, and the use of insulin on the correlation using a non-parametric version of partial correlation. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with T2DM had higher IDE levels than patients diagnosed with AD and healthy controls after adjustment for age and sex. IDE was increasingly associated with body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, C-peptide, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin resistance, and triglycerides. In stratified analyses, we found a decreasing partial correlation between IDE and HbA1c in patients diagnosed with AD and a decreasing partial correlation between IDE and C-peptide in healthy controls. In patients diagnosed with T2DM, we found no partial correlations. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that IDE is essential in metabolic function and might reflect metabolic status, although it is not yet a biomarker that can be utilized in clinical practice. Further research on IDE in human blood may provide crucial insights into the full function of the enzyme.
