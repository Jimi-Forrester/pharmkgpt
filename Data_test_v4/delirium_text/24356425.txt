We developed and delivered a simulation teaching session on delirium, falls, elder abuse and breaking bad news. Simulation mannequins, professional role-players and simulated clinical documentation were all incorporated into scenarios. We evaluated the effect of this intervention on student learning and on students' attitudes towards geriatric medicine. METHODS: third year Newcastle University MBBS students at Northumbria base unit received the simulation-based teaching session. Students' knowledge was assessed using a three question test mapped to learning outcomes for the elder abuse, delirium and falls stations. Each student undertook the test on three occasions: the day before the teaching session, immediately after the session and ~1 month later, allowing evaluation of learning over time. Test scores were also compared with those achieved by another cohort of third year MBBS students at a different base unit, who received traditional ward-based and didactic teaching but no simulation teaching. RESULTS: student knowledge improved significantly after the simulation session and this was maintained when reassessed a month later. Students who received the simulation-based training outperformed those who received usual teaching. Student feedback was overwhelmingly positive and the vast majority of students agreed that the session had a positive impact on their perceptions of geriatric medicine. DISCUSSION: our findings demonstrate the efficacy of simulation-based teaching in undergraduate geriatric medicine, its acceptability to students and its positive influence on students' perceptions of the specialty.
