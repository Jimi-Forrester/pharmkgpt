36657371|t|The TgF344-AD rat: behavioral and proteomic changes associated with aging and protein expression in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
36657371|a|Animal models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are attractive tools for preclinical, prodromal drug testing. The TgF344-AD (Tg) rat exhibits cognitive deficits and 5 major hallmarks of AD. Here we show that spatial water maze (WMZ) memory deficits and proteomic differences in dorsal CA1 were present in young Tg rats. Aged learning-unimpaired (AU) and aged learning-impaired (AI) proteome associated changes were identified and differed by sex. Levels of phosphorylated tau, reactive astrocytes and microglia were significantly increased in aged Tg rats and correlated with the WMZ learning index (LI); in contrast, no significant correlation was present between amyloid plaques or insoluble Abeta levels and LI. Neuroinflammatory markers were also significantly correlated with LI and increased in female Tg rats. The anti-inflammatory marker, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2), was significantly reduced in aged impaired Tg rats and correlated with LI. Identifying and understanding mechanisms that allow for healthy aging by overcoming genetic drivers for AD, and/or promoting drivers for successful aging, are important for developing successful therapeutics against AD.
