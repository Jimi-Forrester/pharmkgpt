27636846|t|Amyloid Plaques Show Binding Capacity of Exogenous Injected Amyloid-beta.
27636846|a|Amyloid plaques, although inducing damage to the immediately surrounding neuropil, have been proposed to provide a relatively innocuous way to deposit toxic soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) species. Here we address this hypothesis by exploring spread and absorption of fluorescent Abeta to pre-existing amyloid plaques after local application in wild-type mice versus APP/PS1 transgenic mice with amyloid plaques. Local intracortical or intracerebroventricular injection of fluorescently-labeled Abeta in APP/PS1 mice with a high plaque density resulted in preferential accumulation of the peptide in amyloid plaques in both conventional postmortem histology and in live imaging using two-photon microscopy. These findings support the contention that amyloid plaques may act as buffers to protect neurons from the toxic effects of momentary high concentrations of soluble Abeta oligomers.
