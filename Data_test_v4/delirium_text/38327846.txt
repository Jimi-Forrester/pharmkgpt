38327846|a|Introduction: Visual naming ability reflects semantic memory retrieval and is a hallmark deficit of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Naming impairment is most prominently observed in the late-onset amnestic and logopenic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) syndromes. However, little is known about how other patients across the atypical AD syndromic spectrum perform on tests of auditory naming, particularly those with primary visuospatial deficits (Posterior Cortical Atrophy; PCA) and early onset (EOAD) syndromes. Auditory naming tests may be of particular relevance to more accurately measuring anomia in PCA syndrome and in others with visual perceptual deficits. Methods: Forty-six patients with biomarker-confirmed AD (16 PCA, 12 lvPPA, 18 multi-domain EOAD), at the stage of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, were administered the Auditory Naming Test (ANT). Performance differences between groups were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests. Correlation analyses were used to examine ANT performance in relation to measures of working memory and word retrieval to elucidate cognitive mechanisms underlying word retrieval deficits. Whole-cortex general linear models were generated to determine the relationship between ANT performance and cortical atrophy. Results: Based on published cutoffs, out of a total possible score of 50 on the ANT, 56% of PCA patients (mean score = 45.3), 83% of EOAD patients (mean = 39.2), and 83% of lvPPA patients (mean = 29.8) were impaired. Total uncued ANT performance differed across groups, with lvPPA performing most poorly, followed by EOAD, and then PCA. ANT performance was still impaired in lvPPA and EOAD after cuing, while performance in PCA patients improved to the normal range with phonemic cues. ANT performance was also directly correlated with measures of verbal fluency and working memory, and was associated with cortical atrophy in a circumscribed semantic language network. Discussion: Auditory confrontation naming is impaired across the syndromic spectrum of AD including in PCA and EOAD, and is likely related to auditory-verbal working memory and verbal fluency which represent the nexus of language and executive functions. The left-lateralized semantic language network was implicated in ANT performance. Auditory naming, in the absence of a visual perceptual demand, may be particularly sensitive to measuring naming deficits in PCA.
