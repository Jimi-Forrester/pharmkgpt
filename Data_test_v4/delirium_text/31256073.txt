31256073|t|beta-catenin-mediated hair growth induction effect of 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid.
31256073|a|The hair follicle is a complex structure that goes through a cyclic period of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) under the regulation of several signaling pathways, including Wnt/ beta-catenin, FGF, Shh, and Notch. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is specifically involved in hair follicle morphogenesis, regeneration, and growth. beta-catenin is expressed in the dermal papilla and promotes anagen induction and duration, as well as keratinocyte regulation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated the activation of beta-catenin by a polyphenolic compound 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid (TCQA) in mice model and in human dermal papilla cells to promote hair growth cycle. A complete regrowth of the shaved area of C3H mice was observed upon treatment with TCQA. Global gene expression analysis using microarray showed an upregulation in hair growth-associated genes. Moreover, the expression of beta-catenin was remarkably upregulated in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that beta-catenin activation by TCQA promoted the initiation of the anagen phase of the hair cycle.
