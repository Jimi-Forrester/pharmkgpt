29663816|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most prominent neurodegenerative disease and has no efficient therapies available so far. Immunotherapy against amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is one of the currently tested therapeutic approaches. Here we have reviewed the available structural knowledge about antibodies tested as passive anti-Abeta immunotherapy in clinical trials. The therapeutic anti-Abeta antibodies differ in their epitope specificity and in recognition and affinity to different Abeta species present in vivo (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 17).
