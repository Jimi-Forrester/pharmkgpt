39083486|a|Hip fracture is a common injury in older adults; however, the optimal timing of surgical treatment remains undetermined in Japan. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to ascertain the rate of early surgery among hip fracture patients and investigate its effectiveness, along with "regional clinical pathways" (patient plan of care devised by Japanese clinicians), in reducing the length of hospital stay (LOS) postoperatively. We hypothesized that performing early surgery along with a regional clinical pathway is effective to reduce the postoperative LOS and complications among hip fracture patients. We examined the data of patients diagnosed with femoral neck and peritrochanteric fractures retrieved from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database between April 2016 and March 2018. Patients were divided into the early (43,928, 34%; surgery within 2 days of admission) and delayed (84,237, 66%; surgery after 2 days of admission) surgery groups. The difference in postoperative LOS between the two groups was 3 days (early vs. delayed: 29 days vs. 32 days). The early surgery group had more cases of intertrochanteric fractures (57% vs. 43%) and internal fixation (74% vs. 55%) than did the delayed surgery group. In contrast, the delayed surgery group had more cases of femoral neck fractures (43% vs. 57%) and bipolar hip arthroplasty (25% vs. 42%) or total hip arthroplasty (1.2% vs. 3.0%). Moreover, the early surgery group showed a lower incidence of complications, except anemia (12% vs. 8.8%). Logistic regression analysis using the adjusted model revealed that early surgery and implementation of regional clinical pathways reduced LOS by 2.58 and 8.06 days, respectively (p<0.001). Early surgery and implementation of regional clinical pathways for hip fracture patients are effective in reducing postoperative LOS, allowing regional clinical pathways to have a greater impact. These findings will help acute care providers when treating hip fracture patients.
