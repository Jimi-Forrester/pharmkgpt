39998043|t|Intensive Therapeutic Plasma Exchange-New Approach to Treat and Rescue Patients with Severe Form of Yellow Fever.
39998043|a|BACKGROUND: Severe yellow fever (YF) can result in acute liver failure (ALF) and high mortality. The role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in managing YF-ALF remains unclear. This study evaluated the impact of TPE strategies in severe YF. METHODS: This observational case-series study evaluated three groups of patients classified according to treatment: G1 (standard intensive care support [ICS]), G2 (ICS + high-volume-TPE [HV-TPE]), and G3 (ICS + intensive TPE). HV-TPE was performed during 3 consecutive days with extra sessions of one plasma-volume, if necessary, whereas intensive TPE consisted of one plasma volume/session performed twice daily, with additional fresh frozen plasma infusion. Hemostatic agents, including tranexamic acid, platelets, and cryoprecipitate, were administered as needed. TPE was de-escalated based on clinical and laboratory parameters. The primary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included (G1: 41, G2: 11, G3: 14). Groups had similar baseline characteristics. Mortality was significantly lower in G3 (14%) compared to G2 (82%) and G1 (85%) (p < 0.001). Additionally, G3 patients showed a higher frequency of undetectable YF viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive TPE is a feasible and effective intervention for severe YF, achieving an 84% reduction in mortality. The limitations of our results are the small sample size, observational and single-center study. Further studies are warranted to elucidate intensive TPE's role in YF management.
