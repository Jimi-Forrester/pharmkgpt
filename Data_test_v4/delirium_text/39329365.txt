39329365|a|The recent, controversial approval of antibody-based treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is fueling a heated debate on the molecular determinants of this condition. The discussion should also incorporate a critical revision of the limitations of preclinical mouse models in advancing our understanding of AD. We critically discuss the limitations of animal models, stressing the need for careful consideration of how experiments are designed and results interpreted. We identify the shortcomings of AD models to recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. We dissect these issues at the quantitative, qualitative, temporal, and context-dependent levels. We argue that these models are based on the oversimplistic assumptions proposed by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) of AD and fail to account for the multifactorial nature of the condition. By shedding light on the constraints of current experimental tools, this review aims to foster the development and implementation of more clinically relevant tools. While we do not rule out a role for preclinical models, we call for alternative approaches to be explored and, most importantly, for a re-evaluation of the ACH.
