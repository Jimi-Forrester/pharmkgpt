36340441|a|Background: Depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by low mood and loss of interest in daily activities. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase blocker, is widely administered for the treatment of hyperuricemia. Recently, its effects on serotonin and depressive like behaviors have been reported. On the other hand, the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protective and regenerative neurotrophic, has been increased by many antidepressants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antidepressant effects of allopurinol and changes in serum level of BDNF compared to those of fluoxetine. Methods: Thirty-five male Wistar albino rats divided into five groups (control, 10 mg/kg fluoxetine, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg allopurinol; n = 7 per group), that received all treatments intraperitoneally, every day. Forced swimming tests (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and open field test (OFT) were performed after 21 days of drug administration. Finally, the serum BDNF levels were measured using the sandwich ELISA method. Results: All doses of allopurinol and fluoxetine reduced the duration of immobility time in FST and TST. No significant changes were observed in the number of lines crossed in OFT between either allopurinol or fluoxetine groups and control group. Serum level of BDNF were significantly higher in fluoxetine and allopurinol 50 and 100 mg/kg groups. Conclusions: Long-term administration of allopurinol 50 and 100 mg/kg have shown antidepressant effects in behavioral tests along with an increase in the amount of serum BDNF concentration. The OFT results suggested that allopurinol did not have any significant effects on motor activity. The increased serum level of the BDNF in the allopurinol group was correlated with FST and TST results. However, it is still not clear whether the antidepressant effects of allopurinol are due to a direct effects on serotonin and/or BDNF or an indirect effect related to its xanthin oxidase inhibition.
