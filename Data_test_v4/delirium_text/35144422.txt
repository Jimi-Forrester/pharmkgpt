35144422|a|BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis was performed on risk factors for postoperative delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to provide theoretical guidance for the prevention of postoperative delirium in ICU patients. METHODS: We conducted a search of Chinese databases using a combination of "meta-analysis", "risk factors for delirium", and "ICU patients with severe illness". "Meta analysis", "Risk factors of delirium", and "ICU severe patients" were used as search terms for English databases. The quality of the literature was evaluated using RevMan 5.3 software for Cochrane reviews. RESULTS: Ten literatures were included, and funnel plots were drawn, most of which were asymmetric and might have publication bias. However, the experimental results of each risk factor were relatively stable, so the experimental conclusions were relatively reliable. Of the 10 studies, there were 7 literatures on age factor, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.29-9.01. There were 9 studies on gender factors, 95% CI: 0.73-1.40. There were 3 studies on drinking factors, 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.08. There were 3 studies on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE- II) scoring factors, 95% CI: 4.54-5.15. There were 4 studies on mechanical ventilation factors, 95% CI: 3.24-11.16. There were 3 studies on mechanical ventilation time factors, 95% CI: -39.92 to 154.97. There were 3 studies on sedative factors, 95% CI: 0.23-15.50. DISCUSSION: Different risk factors can influence the incidence of postoperative delirium in ICU patients with severe illness, which provides theoretical guidance for clinical prevention of delirium incidence.
