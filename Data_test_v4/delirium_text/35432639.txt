35432639|a|Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient wall motion abnormality of the left ventricular apex, accompanied by emotional or physical stress. Although Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally considered a benign disease, severe clinical complications may occur, and early detection of the disease is important. In this report, we present the case of an 86-year-old bedridden woman with a history of bronchial asthma who was transferred to our hospital because of wheezing. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and had communication difficulties. After an asthma attack and improvement, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was identified via electrocardiography. She was unable to complain of any symptoms but showed serial electrocardiographic changes, elevated myocardial markers, and transient left ventricular apical ballooning. The prevalence of dementia increases dramatically with age. This case indicates that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may occur even in patients with severe dementia, who are bedridden and show communication difficulties in a clinical setting.
