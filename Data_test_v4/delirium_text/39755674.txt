39755674|a|Dementia refers to an umbrella phenotype of many different underlying pathologies with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common type. Neuropathological examination remains the gold standard for accurate AD diagnosis, however, most that we know about AD genetics is based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of clinically defined AD. Such studies have identified multiple AD susceptibility variants with a significant portion of the heritability unexplained and highlighting the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the clinically defined entity. Furthermore, despite women's increased susceptibility to dementia, there is a lack of sex-specific genetic studies and understanding of sex-specific background for the disorder. Here, we aim to tackle the heterogeneity of AD by specifically concentrating on neuropathological features and pursuing sex-specific analysis. We bring together 14 different genomic and neuropathology datasets (6960 individuals) and we integrate our GWAS findings with transcriptomic and phenotypic data aiming to also identify biomarkers for AD progression. We uncover novel genetic associations to AD neuropathology, including BIN1 and OPCML. Our sex-specific analysis points to a role for BIN1 specifically in women as well as novel AD loci including QRFPR and SGCZ. Post-GWAS analyses illuminate the functional and biological mechanisms underlying AD and reveal sex-specific differences. Finally, through PheWAS and Mendelian Randomization analysis, we identify causal links with AD neuropathology pointing to disrupted lipid metabolism, as well as impaired peripheral immune response and liver dysfunction as part of a vicious cycle that fuels neurodegeneration.
