DATA SOURCES: Available literature on PubMed and MEDLINE databases. STUDY SELECTION: Available clinical trials and observational studies addressing the reinitiation of select NPMs (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and gabapentinoids) on various outcomes were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Eligible studies were identified by authors, and recommendations were summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: Agitation and delirium are recognized as common complications of patients in the ICU. While there is literature that suggests patients can acutely withdraw from opioids, less data are known about withdrawal from NPM such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and gabapentinoids. However, there is some literature that suggests reinitiating some NPMs may lead to reductions in agitation, delirium, and hospital and ICU length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Additional larger studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reinitiation of select prior-to-admission NPM to prevent agitation and delirium in ICU patients. Multiple factors for NPM reinitiation should be considered, such as reason for admission, organ dysfunction, available route of administration to provide prior-to-admission NPM, concomitant additional medications for agitation and delirium, and safety of these medications for patients in the ICU.
