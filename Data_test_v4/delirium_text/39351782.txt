39351782|t|Antibodies in neurological diseases: Established, emerging, explorative.
39351782|a|Within a few years, autoantibodies targeting the nervous system resulted in a novel disease classification. For several of them, which we termed 'established', direct pathogenicity has been proven and now guides diagnostic pathways and early immunotherapy. For a rapidly growing number of further anti-neuronal autoantibodies, the role in disease is less clear. Increasing evidence suggests that they could contribute to disease, by playing a modulating role on brain function. We therefore suggest a three-level classification of neurological autoantibodies according to the degree of experimentally proven pathogenicity and strength of clinical association: established, emerging, explorative. This may facilitate focusing on clinical constellations in which autoantibody-mediated mechanisms have not been assumed previously, including autoimmune psychosis and dementia, cognitive impairment in cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Based on recent data reviewed here, humoral autoimmunity may represent an additional "super-system" for brain health. The "brain antibody-ome", that is, the composition of thousands of anti-neuronal autoantibodies, may shape neuronal function not only in disease, but even in healthy aging. Towards this novel concept, extensive research will have to elucidate pathogenicity from the atomic to the clinical level, autoantibody by autoantibody. Such profiling can uncover novel biomarkers, enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms, and identify selective therapies.
