Advancements in diagnosis and treatment have aided in properly identifying and improving symptoms in patients. However, a large proportion of iNPH patients remain either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Using PubMed search engine of keywords "normal pressure hydrocephalus," "diagnosis," "shunt treatment," "biomarkers," "gait disturbances," "cognitive function," "neuropsychology," "imaging," and "pathogenesis," articles were obtained for this review. The majority of the articles were retrieved from the past 10 years. The purpose of this review article is to aid general practitioners in further understanding current findings on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of iNPH.
