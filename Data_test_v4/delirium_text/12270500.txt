12270500|t|The role of cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2 activity in prostaglandin E(2) secretion by cultured human adult microglia: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
12270500|a|Microglial cyclo-oxygenase (COX) expression is considered to be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, therefore, constitutes a key target for therapeutic intervention. We investigated the influence of AD plaque associated factors on COX-1 and COX-2 expression and activity in adult human microglial cells in vitro. COX-2 immunoreactivity and mRNA were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), not by AD plaque associated cytokines interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or amyloid (A)beta(1-42). To assess functional COX activity, the release of PGE(2) into the culture medium was determined. LPS and also arachidonic acid (AA) dose-dependently stimulated PGE(2) release. The effects of AA are independent from induction of COX mRNA expression, or of de novo protein synthesis. No effects of either plaque-associated cytokines or Abeta(1-42) on PGE(2) secretion were seen, even when cells were co-stimulated with AA, to provide enough substrate. COX isotype selective inhibitors were used to discern relative contributions of COX-1 and COX-2 activities to microglial PGE(2) secretion. COX-2 and in part COX-1-selective inhibitors inhibited LPS-induced PGE(2) secretion, whereas the AA-induced PGE(2) secretion was reduced by COX-1-selective inhibitors only. Apparently, adult human microglia in vitro (1) constitutively express COX-1, and (2) do not express COX-2 upon exposure to either Abeta or plaque associated cytokines. In the light of microglial COX activity as a potential therapeutical target in AD, the data presented in this study suggest that classical NSAIDs, rather than selective COX-2 inhibitors, are more potent in reducing microglial prostaglandin secretion.
