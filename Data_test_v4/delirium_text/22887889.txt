22887889|a|With the growth of aging population all over the world, a rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently observed. In contrast to FDA-approved western drugs, herbal medicines, featured as abundant ingredients and multi-targeting, have been acknowledged with notable anti-AD effects although the mechanism of action (MOA) is unknown. Investigating the possible MOA for these herbs can not only refresh but also extend the current knowledge of AD pathogenesis. In this study, clinically tested anti-AD herbs, their ingredients as well as their corresponding target proteins were systematically reviewed together with applicable bioinformatics resources and methodologies. Based on above information and resources, we present a systematically target network analysis framework to explore the mechanism of anti-AD herb ingredients. Our results indicated that, in addition to the binding of those symptom-relieving targets as the FDA-approved drugs usually do, ingredients of anti-AD herbs also interact closely with a variety of successful therapeutic targets related to other diseases, such as inflammation, cancer and diabetes, suggesting the possible cross-talks between these complicated diseases. Furthermore, pathways of Ca(2+) equilibrium maintaining upstream of cell proliferation and inflammation were densely targeted by the anti-AD herbal ingredients with rigorous statistic evaluation. In addition to the holistic understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, the integrated network analysis on the MOA of herbal ingredients may also suggest new clues for the future disease modifying strategies.
