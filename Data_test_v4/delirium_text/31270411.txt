31270411|t|The Route to 'Chemobrain' - Computational probing of neuronal LTP pathway.
31270411|a|Chemotherapy causes deleterious side effects during the course of cancer management. The toxic effects may be extended to CNS chronically resulting in altered cognitive function like learning and memory. The present study follows a computational assessment of 64 chemotherapeutic drugs for their off-target interactions against the major proteins involved in neuronal long term potentiation pathway. The cancer chemo-drugs were subjected to induced fit docking followed by scoring alignment and drug-targets interaction analysis. The results were further probed by electrostatic potential computation and ligand binding affinity prediction of the top complexes. The study identified novel off-target interactions by Dactinomycin, Temsirolimus, and Everolimus against NMDA, AMPA, PKA and ERK2, while Irinotecan, Bromocriptine and Dasatinib were top interacting drugs for CaMKII. This study presents with basic foundational knowledge regarding potential chemotherapeutic interference in LTP pathway which may modulate neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in patient receiving these chemotherapies.
