34500807|t|A Novel Synthetic Precursor of Styryl Sulfone Neuroprotective Agents Inhibits Neuroinflammatory Responses and Oxidative Stress Damage through the P38 Signaling Pathway in the Cell and Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease.
34500807|a|A novel class of styryl sulfones were designed and synthesized as CAPE derivatives by our work team, which showed a multi-target neuroprotective effect, including antioxidative and anti-neuroinflammatory properties. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the anti-Parkinson's disease (PD) activity of 10 novel styryl sulfone compounds was screened by the cell viability test and the NO inhibition test in vitro. It was found that 4d exhibited the highest activity against PD among them. In a MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, the biological activity of 4d was validated through suppressing dopamine neurotoxicity, microglial activation, and astrocytes activation. With compound 4d, we conducted the mechanistic studies about anti-inflammatory responses through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation to protect dopaminergic neurons, and antioxidant effects through promoting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The results revealed that 4d could significantly inhibit 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPTP/MPP+)-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in both in vitro and in vivo PD models, thus inhibiting the NF-kappaB-mediated neuroinflammation-related apoptosis pathway. Simultaneously, it could promote Nrf2 nuclear transfer, and upregulate the expression of antioxidant phase II detoxification enzymes HO-1 and GCLC, and then reduce oxidative damage.
