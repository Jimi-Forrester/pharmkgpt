31587075|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between frailty and 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients with intertrochanteric femur fractures. Furthermore, the authors sought to identify a specific frailty index score that would help identify high-risk patients. This retrospective study evaluated 229 consecutive patients 50 years or older who presented to a single level I trauma center for surgical fixation of an intertrochanteric femur fracture. Frailty was determined using a previously validated 11-point modified frailty index (mFI) scale. Primary outcome variables included 30-day morbidity and mortality. Of the 229 patients included in this study, 82 (36%) had a postoperative complication and there were 10 (4%) mortalities. The most common complications were delirium (n=40; 17%) and acute kidney injury (n=25; 11%). Mean mFI score for those who developed a postoperative complication was 0.24 compared with 0.14 for those who did not (P<.001). The mortality rate increased from 0% for mFI of 0 to 11% for mFI of 0.27 or more. Patients with an mFI of 0.27 or more were more than 9 times as likely to have a mortality compared with patients with an mFI of less than 0.27 (P=.006). This study demonstrates that the mFI is associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients aged 50 years or older with intertrochanteric femur fractures. The authors identified an mFI score of 0.27 or more as the most robust predictor of increased 30-day morbidity and mortality following surgical fixation of intertrochanteric femur fractures.
