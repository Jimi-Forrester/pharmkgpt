33542630|a|BACKGROUND: Although numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) have been discovered to participate in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they are still difficult to apply in clinical work. Thus, the identification of novel miRNAs and clarification of their clinical significance are importing for improving the diagnosis and treatment of AD. The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression of miR-128 and its diagnostic value in patients with AD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 117 AD patients and 106 controls were enrolled, and the demographic data, biochemical parameters and serum miR-128 levels were collected. These data were then used to build a logistic regression model, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-128. The relationships between miR-128 and inflammatory factors (IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) were also analyzed from clinical serum data. RESULTS: Our study found that miR-128 was significantly upregulated in the serum samples of AD patients compared with controls, and that this upregulation was negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (r = -0.687, P< 0.01). ROC curve showed that the area under the curve of miR-128 was 0.831. Logistic regression analyses showed that glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, MMSE scores and serum miR-128 levels were statistically significant (P< 0.01), and the ROC curve of the combined detection of these variables was 0.906. The serum miR-128 levels in AD patients were positively correlated with the serum IL-1beta (r=0.798, P<0.01) and serum TNF-alpha levels (r=0.733, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum miR-128 is a candidate diagnostic biomarker in AD patients who achieved good diagnostic performance when used alone or in combination with other factors and may have the potential to be a novel therapeutic target for neuroinflammation.
