36359804|t|Experimental Treatments for Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36359804|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by a complex and prolonged injury process that exacerbates the damage induced by the primary injury and inhibits the potential for regeneration. SCI frequently results in the devastating loss of neurological functions and thus has serious consequences on patient quality of life. Current treatments are limited and focus on early interventions for the acute management of complications. Therefore, the development of novel treatments targeting ongoing injury processes is required to improve SCI outcomes. We aimed to systematically review studies published in the last 10 years that examined experimental treatments with neuroregenerative and neuroprotective capabilities for the improvement of SCI. We analyzed treatments from 44 studies that were identified through a systematic literature search using three databases: PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE (searched through Ovid). We performed a meta-analysis for Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotion test data and collected immunohistochemistry results to demonstrate neuroregenerative and neuroprotective properties of the treatments, respectively. The two treatments that illustrated the most significant improvements in functional recovery using the BBB test were the combined use of tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA) with neural stem cells (NSCs) and Fortasyn  Connect (FC) supplementation. Both treatments also attenuated secondary injury processes as demonstrated through immunohistochemistry. Combined tFNA with NSCs and FC supplementation are promising treatments for the improvement of SCI as they both demonstrate neuroregenerative and neuroprotective properties. Further pre-clinical testing is required to validate and determine the long-term efficacies of these treatments for the improvement of SCI.
