38558801|t|Biomarkers for prediction of CAR T therapy outcomes: current and future perspectives.
38558801|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy holds enormous potential for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Despite its benefits, it is still used as a second line of therapy, mainly because of its severe side effects and patient unresponsiveness. Numerous researchers worldwide have attempted to identify effective predictive biomarkers for early prediction of treatment outcomes and adverse effects in CAR T cell therapy, albeit so far only with limited success. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of predictive biomarkers. Although existing predictive metrics correlate to some extent with treatment outcomes, they fail to encapsulate the complexity of the immune system dynamics. The aim of this review is to identify six major groups of predictive biomarkers and propose their use in developing improved and efficient prediction models. These groups include changes in mitochondrial dynamics, endothelial activation, central nervous system impairment, immune system markers, extracellular vesicles, and the inhibitory tumor microenvironment. A comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors that influence therapeutic efficacy has the potential to significantly improve the course of CAR T cell therapy and patient care, thereby making this advanced immunotherapy more appealing and the course of therapy more convenient and favorable for patients.
