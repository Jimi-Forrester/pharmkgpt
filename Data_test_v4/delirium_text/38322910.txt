38322910|a|Objectives: Postoperative delirium (POD) is considered to be a common complication of spine surgery. Although many studies have reported the risk factors associated with POD, the results remain unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to identify risk factors for POD among patients following spinal surgery. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library for relevant articles published from 2006 to February 1, 2023 that reported risk factors associated with the incidence of POD among patients undergoing spinal surgery. The Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed, and random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each factor. The evidence from observational studies was classified according to Egger's P value, total sample size, and heterogeneity between studies. Results: Of 11,329 citations screened, 50 cohort studies involving 1,182,719 participants met the inclusion criteria. High-quality evidence indicated that POD was associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, older age (>65 years), patients experiencing substance use disorder (take drug >=1 month), cerebrovascular disease, kidney disease, neurological disorder, parkinsonism, cervical surgery, surgical site infection, postoperative fever, postoperative urinary tract infection, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Moderate-quality evidence indicated that POD was associated with depression, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) fitness grade (>II), blood transfusion, abnormal potassium, electrolyte disorder, length of stay, inability to ambulate and intravenous fluid volume. Conclusions: Conspicuous risk factors for POD were mainly patient- and surgery-related. These findings help clinicians identify high-risk patients with POD following spinal surgery and recognize the importance of early intervention.
