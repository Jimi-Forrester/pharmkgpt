36533160|t|Subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia - syndromic approach: recommendations of the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology.
36533160|a|This consensus, performed by the Brazilian Academy of Neurology (BAN) will approach practically how to evaluate patients with cognitive complaints and how to clinically and etiologically diagnose the three clinical syndromes associated with the different stages of cognitive decline: subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. This BAN consensus discusses SCD diagnosis for the first time, updates MCI and dementia diagnoses, recommends the adequate cognitive tests and the relevant etiological work-up and care of patients with cognitive decline at different levels of care within the Brazilian Unified Health System. We also review the main assessment instruments used in Brazil and Latin America.
