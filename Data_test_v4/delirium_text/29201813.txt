29201813|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and risk factors for medical complications in Korean patients suffering from stroke and the impact of such complications on post-stroke functional outcomes. METHODS: We assessed patients enrolled in a prospective cohort study. All recruited patients had suffered a first acute stroke episode and been admitted to nine university hospitals in Korea between August 2012 and June 2015. We analyzed patient and stroke characteristics, comorbidities, prevalence of post-stroke medical complications, and functional outcomes at time of discharge and 3, 6, and 12 months after stroke onset. RESULTS: Of 10,625 patients with acute stroke, 2,210 (20.8%) presented with medical complications including bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, sleep disturbance, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. In particular, complications occurred more frequently in older patients and in patients with hemorrhagic strokes, more co-morbidities, severe initial motor impairment, or poor swallowing function. In-hospital medical complications were significantly correlated with poor functional outcomes at all time points. CONCLUSION: Post-stroke medical complications affect functional recovery. The majority of complications are preventable and treatable; therefore, the functional outcomes of patients with stroke can be improved by providing timely, appropriate care. Special care should be provided to elderly patients with comorbid risk factors.
