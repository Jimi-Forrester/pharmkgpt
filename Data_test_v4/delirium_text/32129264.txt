32129264|t|Neurological Complications in Recipients after Living Donor Liver Transplantation.
32129264|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative treatment for patients with the end-stage liver disease. Amongst the complications post-LT, the neurological complications (NC) are particularly relevant. Our aim is to assess the incidence, risk factors and clinical presentation of NC in recipients after living donor liver transplantation. METHODS: Between November 2011 and December 2013, 149 patients were admitted to ICU in 3 different centres in Egypt after LDLT and were evaluated by full clinical examination, laboratory investigations, neuroimaging and the NC were observed over one month. This study was approved by the ethical committee of the National Research Center. RESULTS: 46 recipients (30.9%) developed neurological complications. The most common neurological complication was Encephalopathy (14.1%) while the least were both central pontine myelinolysis and meningoencephalitis (0.7%). In addition, 7 patients developed cerebrovascular events (either ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes). Patients were then classified into uncomplicated and complicated subgroups according to the highest percentage of neurological complication symptoms. These were encephalopathy, delirium with agitation, hallucinations, and delusions. CONCLUSION: A high incidence of neurological complications (30.9%) after LDLT was recorded, prolonging patient hospital stays. The most common complications were encephalopathy, delirium, hallucinations, delusions, and seizures some of which were drug related.
