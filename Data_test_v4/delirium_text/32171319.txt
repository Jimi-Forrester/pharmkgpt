32171319|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is an important social and medical problem due to its increasing prevalence, the consequences for health and the economic impact on the health care system, but there is no doubt that it also has repercussions on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Hence the importance of understanding and determining the impact of the condition on everyday life from the perspective of the patient's physical, emotional and social well-being. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of hip fracture on HRQoL of people over the age of 65 1 month after surgery, related factors and the effects on functional ability and mood. METHODS: Prospective observational study conducted in the traumatology units of two university hospitals in the province of Caceres with consecutive sampling of all patients over the age of 65 admitted for hip fracture surgery during the study period. Sociodemographic and clinical data were recorded at the time of admission and prospectively at the follow-up visit 1 month later. Clinical, social, quality of life (EQ-5D-), basic functional and instrumental capacity (Barthel Index (BI) and Lawton & Brody Scale), and geriatric depression (Yesavage) variables were collected. RESULTS: The study included 224 patients with a median age of 84.6 years (SD +- 6.1), 76.3% were female. Charlson's comorbidity was 5.3 (SD +- 1.2). The EQ-5D index decreased from 0.62 (SD +- 0.35) to 0.16 at 1 month follow up (SD +- 0.20) p <  0.001. The mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of EQ-5D decreased from 72.8 (SD +-15.8) to 48.3 (SD +- 17.2) p <  0.001. All dimensions of EQ-5D showed a significant reduction from the time of pre-fracture status to 1 month after surgery. Independent factors associated with HRQoL 1 month after surgery were pre-fracture status Barthel Index score, Lawton and Brody scale, presence of depression, and type of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: After a hip fracture, patients experience considerable deterioration in their HRQoL, especially in self-care, daily activities, and mobility. There is also a significant decline in functional capacity for both the basic and instrumental activities of daily living. One month after surgery, HRQoL is a long way from pre-fracture levels.
