METHODS: A total of 160 elderly oral cancer patients who underwent tumor resection surgery and completed our investigation were included in this study. The cancer patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: Group U or Group I. During the perioperative period, Group U received usual care, while Group I received MNI, which is based on usual care and aims to decrease the risk of PD. MNI focused on general geriatric approaches and supportive nursing care. On the day before surgery and the first three postoperative days, nocturnal (20:00-8:00) urine samples were collected. The melatonin sulfate and cortisol levels in the urine samples were determined. Moreover, the RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale), CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) and QoR40 (40-item quality of recovery score) scores were dynamically monitored. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the 2 groups. After surgery, the melatonin sulfate levels in the nocturnal urine of Group I were higher than those in Group U. The cortisol concentrations were lower in Group I compared to those in Group U. Group I achieved better postoperative RASS and QoR40 scores than Group U. Compared to Group U, Group I also experienced less PD (incidence and duration). CONCLUSIONS: MNI ameliorated some postoperative disturbances regarding sleep and stress, decreased the incidence of PD and improved recovery quality.
