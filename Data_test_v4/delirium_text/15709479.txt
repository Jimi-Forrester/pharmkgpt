15709479|t|Cholesterol and amyloid beta fibrillogenesis.
15709479|a|Evidence is accumulating to suggest that cholesterol is a potent risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. An increase in cholesterol level in neuronal membranes may facilitate the generation and aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). Our results and those of other groups suggest that cholesterol has both direct and indirect effects of acceleration of Abeta fibrillogenesis. A novel concept of cholesterol neurobiology is necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying cholesterol-dependent Abeta pathology.
