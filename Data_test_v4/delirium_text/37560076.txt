37560076|t|Study of Cutaneous Manifestations in Alcohol Dependence Syndrome Patients in a Rural Tertiary Care Center in India.
37560076|a|Background: Chronic alcoholism is a multifactorial condition predisposed by environmental, social, and psychological factors. Alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) can present with varied cutaneous and systemic manifestations. The effects of alcohol use include cutaneous infections, infestations, features of malnutrition, exacerbation of pre-existing dermatoses, and alcohol-related dermatoses. This study aimed to analyze and document cutaneous manifestations secondary to infections, infestations, malnutrition, and modifications of pre-existing dermatoses in ADS patients and investigate the correlation between the presence of cutaneous manifestations and duration and quantity of alcohol intake. Methods: The present observational study was carried out in the Department of Dermatology for a period of one year. A total of 172 male patients with ADS presenting with skin manifestations were included in the study. Detailed analysis of history, clinical examination, and relevant investigations were conducted. Findings: Out of 172 male patients with ADS, the most common dermatoses noted were infections (166, 96.5%) and features of malnutrition (161, 93.6%). Exacerbation of pre-existing dermatoses (101, 58.7%) and alcohol-related dermatoses (85, 49.4%) were also observed. Conclusion: Most of the dermatoses were significantly correlated with the quantity of alcohol intake than with its duration, implying that higher quantity of alcohol intake has more impact on cutaneous and systemic manifestations. Identifying the cutaneous manifestations in ADS patients plays an important role in recognizing the underlying systemic disorders which in turn facilitates early intervention and thereby prevents complications.
