30214124|t|Rehabilitation and early mobilization in the critical patient: systematic review.
30214124|a|[Purpose] To review the literature that examines rehabilitation and early mobilization and that involves different practices (effects of interventions) for the critically ill patient. [Materials and Methods] A PRISMA-Systematic review has been conducted based on different data sources: Biblioteca Virtual en Salud, CINHAL, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were used to identify randomized controlled trials, crossover trials, and case-control studies. [Results] Eleven studies were included. Early rehabilitation had no significant effect on the length of stay and number of cases of Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weaknesses. However, early rehabilitation had a significant effect on the functional status, muscle strength, mechanical ventilation duration, walking ability at discharge, and health quality of life. [Conclusion] Rehabilitation and early mobilization are associated with an increased probability of walking more distance at discharge. Early rehabilitation is associated with an increase in functional capacity and muscle strength, an improvement in walking distance and better perception of the health-related quality of life. Cycloergometer and electrical stimulation can be used to maintain muscle strength. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidences.
