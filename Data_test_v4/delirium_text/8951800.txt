8951800|a|This article reviews the significance of changes in the level of cerebrospinal fluid acetylcholinesterase or cholinesterase in patients with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Evidence has shown that the methodology of assaying cerebrospinal fluid acetylcholinesterase or cholinesterase is reliable and the activity of the enzyme is stable. Low acetylcholinesterase or cholinesterase levels presenting in cerebrospinal fluid of a demented individual may confirm the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other organic dementia. A low activity of acetylcholinesterase or cholinesterase existing in cerebrospinal fluid of a non-demented individual may indicate a brain at risk, or that the person is in the preclinical stage of dementia. Recognition of the presence of the preclinical stage may be very beneficial for explaining the real meaning of the 'overlap' in the biochemistry and pathology between dementia and non-dementia, and also very important for prevention and treatment. Therefore, the strategy of prevention and of treatment should no longer be designed to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. In contrast, it should be designed to enhance the neuronal acetylcholinesterase activity or to delay the degeneration of brain acetylcholinesterase system.
