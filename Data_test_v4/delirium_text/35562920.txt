35562920|t|TRPA1 Role in Inflammatory Disorders: What Is Known So Far?
35562920|a|The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a member of the TRP superfamily of channels, is primarily localized in a subpopulation of primary sensory neurons of the trigeminal, vagal, and dorsal root ganglia, where its activation mediates neurogenic inflammatory responses. TRPA1 expression in resident tissue cells, inflammatory, and immune cells, through the indirect modulation of a large series of intracellular pathways, orchestrates a range of cellular processes, such as cytokine production, cell differentiation, and cytotoxicity. Therefore, the TRPA1 pathway has been proposed as a protective mechanism to detect and respond to harmful agents in various pathological conditions, including several inflammatory diseases. Specific attention has been paid to TRPA1 contribution to the transition of inflammation and immune responses from an early defensive response to a chronic pathological condition. In this view, TRPA1 antagonists may be regarded as beneficial tools for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
