39062813|a|Increasing demand for functional beverages is attracting consumers' attention and driving research to expand our knowledge of fermentation using symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) and demonstrate the health effects of consuming kombucha. The objective of this study was to develop innovative recipes for unpasteurized mint/nettle kombucha analogs, and to compare the products obtained under varying conditions in terms of chemical composition, bioactive polyphenols and health-promoting activity. Four variants of kombucha beverages (K1-K4), differing in the addition of sucrose and fermentation temperature, were formulated. The fermentation process provided data indicating the increase of antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and anticholinergic properties, while a decrease in antioxidant capacity was observed. The content of polyphenolics was the highest on the seventh day of fermentation. A higher fermentation temperature and a larger amount of sucrose accelerated the fermentation process, which may be crucial for shortening the production time of kombucha drinks.
