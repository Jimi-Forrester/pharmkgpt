33663036|a|The unexpected emergence and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been pandemic, with long-lasting effects, and unfortunately, it does not seem to have ended. Integrating advanced planning, strong teamwork, and clinical management have been both essential and rewarding during this time. Understanding the new concepts of this novel disease and accommodating them into clinical practice is an ongoing process, ultimately leading to advanced and highly specific treatment modalities. We conducted a literature review through PubMed, Europe PMC, Scopus, and Google Scholar to incorporate the most updated therapeutic principles. This article provides a concise and panoramic view of the cohort of critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We conclude that COVID-19 management includes low tidal volume ventilation, early proning, steroids, and a high suspicion for secondary bacterial/fungal infections. Lung ultrasound is emerging as a promising tool in assessing the clinical response. Managing non-clinical factors such as staff burnout, communication/consent issues, and socio-emotional well-being is equally important.
