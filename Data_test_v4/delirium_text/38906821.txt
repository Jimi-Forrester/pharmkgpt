38906821|a|Background: Delirium prevention in the ICU should focus on a non-pharmacological approach. However, these recommendations are not always applied by care providers. Objective: To select knowledge translation strategies to facilitate the implementation of non-pharmacological best practices to prevent delirium in the ICU. Method: A consensus study was conducted. Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of nonpharmacological methods, and knowledge translation strategies, were identified in two nominal groups. A context assessment was also carried out. Nine professionals and one patient-partner participated. Results: The barriers and facilitators on which consensus was reached were most frequently related to environmental context and resources, intention, and knowledge. The areas of organizational context with the highest levels of agreement were interpersonal relations, culture and leadership. Consequently, knowledge translation strategies were selected to facilitate practices, as well as to modify the environment and improve knowledge. Conclusion: A structured method was used during this study to guide the selection of knowledge translation strategies. The application of these strategies could potentially improve clinical practice in intensive care.
