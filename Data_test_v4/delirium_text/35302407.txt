35302407|t|Rheumatoid Arthritis in Spine Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
35302407|a|STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to synthesize recommendations for perioperative medical management of RA patients and quantify outcomes after spine surgery when compared to patients without RA. METHODS: A search of available literature on patients with RA and spine surgery was performed. Studies were included if they provided a direct comparison of outcomes between patients undergoing spine surgery with or without RA diagnosis. Meta-analysis was performed on operative time, estimated blood loss, hospital length of stay, overall complications, implant-related complications, reoperation, infection, pseudarthrosis, and adjacent segment disease. RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 9 studies with 703 patients with RA undergoing spine surgery and 2569 patients without RA. In RA patients compared to non-RA patients undergoing spine surgery, the relative risk of infection was 2.29 times higher (P = .036), overall complications 1.61 times higher (P < .0001), implant-related complications 3.93 times higher (P = .009), and risk of reoperation 2.45 times higher (P < .0001). Hospital length of stay was 4.6 days longer in RA patients (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of spinal pathology in patients with RA carries an increased risk of infection and implant-related complications. Spine-specific guidelines for perioperative management of antirheumatic medication deserve further exploration. All RA patients should be perioperatively co-managed by a rheumatologist. This review helps identify risk profiles in RA specific to spine surgery and may guide future studies seeking to medically optimize RA patients perioperatively.
