29378075|t|Evidence-Based Practice Guideline: Delirium.
29378075|a|Delirium is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized older adults often superimposed on dementia. Older patients with delirium are more likely than other populations to develop hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and immobility and nutritional issues, as well as to have increased health care costs, longer hospital stays, and long-term care following discharge. Interventions that prevent or mitigate the effects of delirium while promoting recovery are essential for caring for hospitalized older patients. This article is a summary of an evidence-based guideline that includes a framework for addressing delirium that focuses on predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium. In addition, the guideline includes evidence-based assessment and intervention principles, along with a review of reliable and valid assessment instruments. The guideline also identifies measurable outcomes for managing delirium and a quality improvement approach for improving outcomes. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 44(2), 14-24.].
