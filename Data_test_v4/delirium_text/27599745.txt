27599745|t|Brain penetrant liver X receptor (LXR) modulators based on a 2,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole core.
27599745|a|Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists have been reported to lower brain amyloid beta (Abeta) and thus to have potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Structure and property based design led to the discovery of a series of orally bioavailable, brain penetrant LXR agonists. Oral administration of compound 18 to rats resulted in significant upregulation of the expression of the LXR target gene ABCA1 in brain tissue, but no significant effect on Abeta levels was detected.
