34999295|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted utilization volumes and patterns for inpatient psychiatry, though reports have noted inconsistencies on small populations. We obtained demographic and diagnostic data from a retrospective cohort of admitted psychiatric patients at a single-site from March-July 2020 and the corresponding months in 2019. Despite controlling for the modest decrease in inpatient admissions, no statistically significant changes in demographics or utilization was found, except for an increase in patients with substance use disorder (p<0.001). These early findings highlight the demand and necessity for inpatient psychiatry services even during the first COVID-19 spike.
