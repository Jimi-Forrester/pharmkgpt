16209268|a|OBJECTIVE: To approach the possibility and mechanism that Quchiling treats Alzheimer' s disease (AD), we studied the effect of Quchiling water extract-contained serum (QCS) on the secretion of beta-amyloid protein 42 (Abeta42) by Chinese hamster ovary cells which stably express beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP) and mutant preseinlin 1 (M146L). METHODS: The QCS was prepared using rats. The cell model, M146L, producing beta-amyloid protein in vitro was established by transfecting APP and mutant presenilin-1 genes. The mononuclear cell directed cytotoxicity assay (MTF) test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to evaluate the effect of the QCS on the cell model and to analyse Abeta42 secretion. RESULTS: The MTT test indicated that different concentrations of the QCS had no effect on the cultured M146L cell survival. And the ELISA test showed that the secretion of Abeta42 by the M146L cell decreased obviously. CONCLUSION: The suitable dose of the QCS can inhibit the secretion of Abeta42 by M146L cell, and its mechanism will be further studied.
