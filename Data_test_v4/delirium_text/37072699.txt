37072699|a|INTRODUCTION: Aim to evaluate the application of 5 modified frailty index (5-mFI) in predicting postoperative complications in elderly gynecological patients undergoing abdominal surgery. METHODS: A total of 294 elderly gynecological patients who were hospitalized in the affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and underwent abdominal surgery from November 2019 to May 2022 were collected from the Union Digital Medical Record (UniDMR) Browser of the hospital. According to whether postoperative complications (infection, hypokalemia, hypoproteinemia, poor wound healing and intestinal obstruction) occurred, the patients were divided into complication group (n = 98) and non-complication group (n = 196). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors of complications in elderly gynecological patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the predictive value of the frailty index score in elderly gynecological patients with postoperative complications after abdominal surgery. RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 98 of 294 elderly gynecological patients undergoing abdominal surgery, accounting for 33.3%, 5-mFI (OR1.63, 95%CI 1.07-2.46,P = 0.022), age (OR1.08,95%CI 1.02-1.15, P = 0.009), operation time (OR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.01). P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery, and the area under the curve of postoperative complications in elderly gynecological patients was 0.60. (95%CI: 0.53-0.67, P = 0.005) CONCLUSION: Five modified frailty index can effectively predict the occurrence of postoperative complications in elderly gynecological patients.
