34804330|a|INTRODUCTION: non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide especially in developing countries such as Tunisia. We aimed to describe the national burden of non-communicable diseases in 2017 and to analyze disability-adjusted life year trends from 1990 to 2017 in Tunisia by cause and gender. METHODS: we used Joinpoint regression analysis to assess trends of the age standardized disability-adjusted life year rate from 1990 to 2017 and to determine average annual percentage change. RESULTS: non-communicable diseases accounted for 87.7% of total disability-adjusted life year in Tunisia in 2017. The five leading causes of this rate in Tunisia in 2017 were cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, neoplasms, mental disorders and neurological disorders. The trend of disability-adjusted life year rate of non-communicable diseases decreased significantly from 23403.2 per 100.000 (95% CI: 20830.2-26285.8) in 1990 to 18454.6 (95% CI: 15611.3-21555.4) in 2017, with a change of -0.9%; p=0.00. The decrease of the age standardized disability-adjusted life year rate concerned mainly cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms secondly. This decrease was more important in female (change=-1.1, p=0.00) in comparison to males (change=-0.7, p=0.00). On the other hand, the increase of the standardized disability-adjusted life year rate was related to musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, kidney disorders and substance use disorders with a significant annual percentage change of 0.1%, 0.2% and 1.3% (p=0.00) respectively. Conclusion: the implementation of the national strategy is the key solution to mitigate the impact of non-communicable diseases in Tunisia.
