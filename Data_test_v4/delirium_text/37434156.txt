37434156|t|Impaired angiogenesis in ageing: the central role of the extracellular matrix.
37434156|a|Each step in angiogenesis is regulated by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Accumulating evidence indicates that ageing-related changes in the ECM driven by cellular senescence lead to a reduction in neovascularisation, reduced microvascular density, and an increased risk of tissue ischaemic injury. These changes can lead to health events that have major negative impacts on quality of life and place a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Elucidating interactions between the ECM and cells during angiogenesis in the context of ageing is neceary to clarify the mechanisms underlying reduced angiogenesis in older adults. In this review, we summarize ageing-related changes in the composition, structure, and function of the ECM and their relevance for angiogenesis. Then, we explore in detail the mechanisms of interaction between the aged ECM and cells during impaired angiogenesis in the older population for the first time, discussing diseases caused by restricted angiogenesis. We also outline several novel pro-angiogenic therapeutic strategies targeting the ECM that can provide new insights into the choice of appropriate treatments for a variety of age-related diseases. Based on the knowledge gathered from recent reports and journal articles, we provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying impaired angiogenesis with age and contribute to the development of effective treatments that will enhance quality of life.
