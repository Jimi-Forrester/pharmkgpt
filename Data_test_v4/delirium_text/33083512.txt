33083512|a|INTRODUCTION: Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is associated with amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, neurodegeneration, and cerebral small vessel disease, but the temporal relationships among these factors is not well established. METHODS: Data included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load, gray matter (GM) atrophy and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive-Plus (ADAS13) scores for 720 participants and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid (Abeta1-42) for 461 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Linear regressions were used to assess the relationships among baseline WMH, GM, and Abeta1-42 to changes in WMH, GM, Abeta1-42, and cognition at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Baseline WMHs and Abeta1-42 predicted WMH increase and GM atrophy. Baseline WMHs and Abeta1-42 predicted worsening cognition. Only baseline Abeta1-42 predicted change in Abeta1-42. DISCUSSION: Baseline WMHs lead to greater future GM atrophy and cognitive decline, suggesting that WM damage precedes neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Baseline Abeta1-42 predicted WMH increase, suggesting a potential role of amyloid in WM damage.
