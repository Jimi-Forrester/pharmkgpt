36533613|t|Brain Enlarged Perivascular Spaces as Imaging Biomarkers of Cerebrovascular Disease: A Clinical Narrative Review.
36533613|a|Perivascular spaces or Virchow-Robin spaces form pathways along the subarachnoid spaces that facilitate the effective clearance of brain metabolic by-products through intracellular exchange and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. Best seen on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVSs) are increasingly recognized as potential imaging biomarkers of neurological conditions. EPVSs are an established subtype of cerebral small-vessel disease; however, their associations with other cerebrovascular disorders are yet to be fully understood. In particular, there has been great interest in the association between the various parameters of EPVSs, such as number, size, and topography, and vascular neurological conditions. Studies have identified cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between EPVS parameters and vascular events, such as ischemic stroke (both clinical and silent), intracerebral hemorrhage, vascular risk factors, such as age and hypertension, and neurodegenerative processes, such as vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease. However, these studies are limited by heterogeneity of data and the lack of consistent results across studied populations. Existing meta-analyses also fail to provide uniformity of results. We performed a qualitative narrative review with an aim to provide an overview of the associations between EPVSs and cerebrovascular diseases, which may help recognize gaps in our knowledge, inform the design of future studies, and advance the role of EPVSs as imaging biomarkers.
