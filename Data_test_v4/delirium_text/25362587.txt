25362587|t|Synthesis, spectral characterization and enzyme inhibition studies of different chlorinated sulfonamides.
25362587|a|Sulfonamides are adherent to a biologically dynamic category of compounds and are under consideration of many organic synthetic researches to synthesize pharmacologically important compounds. In this demonstrated research work, a benignant series of chlorinated sulfonamides were synthesized and screened against different enzymes. These various chlorinated sulfonamides (3a-i) were set up by pairing of different substituted anilines (2a-i) with 4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (1) under basic pH in an aqueous media. The structures of the synthesized chlorinated sulfonamides were furnished by 1H-NMR, IR &amp; EI-MS. The different enzymes used for the evaluation of bioactivity of all the synthesized compounds were urease, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and lipoxygenase (LOX). All the compounds exhibited good inhibitory activities against these enzymes but the strong activity was shown against BChE and hence can be employed for discovery of 'lead' compounds against Alzheimer's disease (AD).
