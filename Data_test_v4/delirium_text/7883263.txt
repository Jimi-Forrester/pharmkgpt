7883263|a|Anticholinergic delirium is a common side effect of various psychotropic drugs. The correct diagnosis is often delayed. The anticholinergic potential of many psychotropic agents is not known; it may become more manifest as a result of combination and cumulation effects. When the correct diagnosis has been established, a dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug involved may prove effective treatment.
