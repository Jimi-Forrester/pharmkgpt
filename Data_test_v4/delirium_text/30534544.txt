30534544|t|Outcomes of Internal Fixation with Compression Hip Screws in Lateral Decubitus Position for Treatment of Femoral Intertrochanteric Fractures.
30534544|a|PURPOSE: Internal fixation using compression hip screws (CHS) and traction tables placing patients in the supine position is a gold standard option for treating intertrochanteric fractures; however, at our institution, we approach this treatment with patients in a lateral decubitus position. Here, the results of 100 consecutive elderly (i.e., >=45 years of age) patients who underwent internal fixation with CHS in lateral decubitus position are analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2009 and May 2011, 100 consecutive elderly patients who underwent internal fixation with CHS for femoral intertrochanteric fracture were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical outcomes (i.e., Koval score, Harris hip score [HHS]) and radiographic outcomes (i.e., bone union time, amount of sliding of lag screw, tip-apex distance [TAD]) were evaluated. RESULTS: Clinical assessments revealed that the average postoperative Koval score decreased from 1.4 to 2.6 (range, 0-5; P<0.05); HHS was 85 (range, 72-90); and mean bone union time was 5.0 (range, 2.0-8.2) months. Radiographic assessments revealed that anteroposterior average TAD was 6.95 (range, 1.27-14.63) mm; lateral average TAD was 7.26 (range, 1.20-18.43) mm; total average TAD was 14.21 (range, 2.47-28.66) mm; average lag screw sliding was 4.63 (range, 0-44.81) mm; and average angulation was varus 0.72 (range, -7.6 -12.7 ). There were no cases of screw tip migration or nonunion, however, there were four cases of excessive screw sliding and six cases of varus angulation at more than 5 . CONCLUSION: CHS fixation in lateral decubitus position provides favorable clinical and radiological outcomes. This technique is advisable for regular CHS fixation of intertrochanteric fractures.
