36354764|t|Stroke, Seizures, Hallucinations and Postoperative Delirium as Neurological Complications after Cardiac Surgery and Percutaneous Valve Replacement.
36354764|a|(1) Background: Neurological complications such as acute ischemic stroke or postoperative delirium are frequent after cardiac surgery or percutaneous valve replacement. This study aimed to identify corresponding risk factors. (2) Methods: 297 patients with percutaneous valve replacement or cardiac surgery were postoperatively screened for neurological complications such as delirium, stroke, seizures and hallucinations twice daily for three days. Pre- and perioperative risk factors were evaluated in a multivariate model. (3) Results: Neurological complications occurred in 43.8% (n = 130) as composed of delirium (43.43%, n = 129), stroke (2.7%, n = 8), seizures (1.35%, n = 4) and real hallucinations (3.36%, n = 10). Multiple logistic regression revealed an association of neurological complications with lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (Exp(B) 2.042; 95% CI, 1.183-3.525, p = 0.010), older age (Exp(B) 1.071; 95% CI, 1.036-1.107, p < 0.001), red blood cell transfusions until postoperative day 3 (Exp(B) 1.157; 95% CI, 1.030-1.300, p = 0.014), history of heart failure (Exp(B) 1.985; 95% CI, 1.130-3.487, p = 0.017) and increased CRP levels (Exp(B) 1.004; 95% CI, 1.000-1.008, p = 0.037). (4) Conclusions: Postoperative delirium remains a frequent complication after cardiac surgery, while stroke and seizures occur rarely. A preoperative risk profile including older age, history of heart failure and cognitive impairment was identified for a complicated postoperative course. However, the impact of an intense inflammatory response must not be neglected.
