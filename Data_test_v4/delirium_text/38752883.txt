38752883|a|Mangiferin, a naturally occurring potent glucosylxanthone, is mainly isolated from the Mangifera indica plant and shows potential pharmacological properties, including anti-bacterial, anti-inflammation, and antioxidant in sepsis-induced lung and kidney injury. However, there was a puzzle as to whether mangiferin had a protective effect on sepsis-associated encephalopathy. To answer this question, we established an in vitro cell model of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and investigated the neuroprotective effects of mangiferin in primary cultured hippocampal neurons challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neurons treated with 20 mumol/L or 40 mumol/L mangiferin for 48 h can significantly reverse cell injuries induced by LPS treatment, including improved cell viability, decreased inflammatory cytokines secretion, relief of microtubule-associated light chain 3 expression levels and several autophagosomes, as well as attenuated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, mangiferin eliminated pathogenic proteins and elevated neuroprotective factors at both the mRNA and protein levels, showing strong neuroprotective effects of mangiferin, including anti-inflammatory, anti-autophagy, and anti-apoptotic effects on neurons in vitro.
