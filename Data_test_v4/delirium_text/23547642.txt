Our study sought to assess the impact of the initiation of memantine or cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) on the use of antipsychotics. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Quebec provincial health plan database. Patients included in our study had received a diagnosis of AD and were initial users of memantine or ChEIs. The proportion of patients who used antipsychotics was estimated using prescription data dating back to 1 year before and to 1 year after the first prescription of memantine or ChEIs. The difference between the slopes corresponding to the periods pre- and postmemantine or ChEIs was analyzed using an interrupted time series design. RESULTS: The percentage of antipsychotic users increased by 118.3% before and by 68.3% after initiation of a ChEI, and increased by 68.6% before and by 7.0% after initiation of memantine. Antipsychotic trends pre- and post-ChEI initiation were not statistically different (P = 0.89), while a statistical difference was observed when comparing the antipsychotic trends pre- and postmemantine initiation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The initiation of memantine, unlike ChEIs, has a notable stabilization effect on the prescription of antipsychotics in patients with AD.
