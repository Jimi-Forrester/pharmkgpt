27858716|t|Skin Autofluorescence Examination as a Diagnostic Tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Healthy People.
27858716|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. Tissue AGE accumulation can be estimated using the relative simple noninvasive measurement of skin autofluorescence (SAF), a method based on the fluorescent properties of some AGEs. However, possible involvement of tissue AGE accumulation in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has not been fully investigated. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether tissue AGE accumulation estimated by SAF is associated with mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: We analyzed 226 community-dwelling subjects. In addition to several atherosclerosis-related clinical parameters, MCI screening test, assessment of brain atrophy, and SAF were performed on people aged > 40 years. MCI was assessed using the Japanese version of the MCI screening method. Atrophy of the brain was assessed by examining the temporal horn area (THA) by brain MRI. RESULTS: SAF was significantly higher in participants with MCI than in those with normal cognitive function (2.56+-0.55 versus 2.10+-0.41; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses with adjustment for confounding factors including age and THA showed that high SAF > 2.27 was significantly related to the presence of MCI (odds, 6.402; 95% CI, 1.590-25.773, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: We found an association between SAF and MCI, which was independent of brain atrophy, in healthy subjects.
