38327632|a|Introduction: Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been widely used as disease models to test new therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the regenerative potential of stem cells can be improved with the use of biologically active compounds. Our study was designed to explore the effect of honokiol, a small polyphenol molecule extracted from Magnolia officinalis, on the survival and culture time of iPSC-derived neurons from a sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient. This study aimed to generate iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of an AD patient using episomal plasmids with a nucleofector system and differentiate them into neurons. These iPSC-derived neurons were used to investigate the effect of honokiol extracted from M. officinalis on their survival and long-term cultures. Methods: IPSCs were generated from PBMCs of an AD patient by introducing Oct-3/4, Sox2, Klf4, L-Myc, and Lin28 using NucleofectorTM Technology. Differentiation of neurons derived from iPSCs was carried out using inducers and recognized by biomarkers. The viability of iPSC-derived neurons with the addition of honokiol extracted from the bark of M. officinalis was determined by the MTT analytical kit. Results: IPSCs were generated by reprogramming AD patient-derived PBMCs and subsequently converted into neurons. The survival and growth of iPSC-derived neurons were significantly enhanced by adding honokiol in the experiment conditions. Conclusion: AD iPSC-derived neurons had a high viability rate when cultured in the presence of honokiol. These results have shown that AD iPSC-derived neurons can be an excellent model for screening neurotrophic agents and improving the conditions for long-term cultures of human iPSC-derived neurons. Honokiol proves to be a potential candidate for cellular therapeutics against neurodegenerative disorders.
