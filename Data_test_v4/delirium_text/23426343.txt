23426343|t|The clinical and economic costs of delirium after surgical resection for esophageal malignancy.
23426343|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify preoperative risk factors and postoperative consequences that are associated with the occurrence of delirium after esophagectomy for malignancy. BACKGROUND: Delirium is an underdiagnosed, serious complication after major surgery, particularly in the elderly population. METHODS: All patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer (1991-2011) were included. Patients with and without delirium were compared with respect to medical comorbidities, use of neoadjuvant therapy, operative outcomes, postoperative complications, overall cost, and survival. RESULTS: Of the 500 patients included in this analysis, 46 (9.2%) patients developed postoperative delirium. Patients with delirium had higher ASA and Charlson comorbidity index scores. Delirium was associated with a longer hospital (14 +- 7.5 vs 10.9 +- 5.7; P < 0.05) and intensive care unit stay (3.6 +- 3.8 vs 2.7 +- 16.9; P < 0.05) and an increased incidence of pulmonary complications and increased hospital costs. Delirium was preceded by another complication in 32.6% of cases but by a septic complication in only 19.6% of cases. Age was the only preoperative predictor of postoperative delirium in multivariate modeling (P < 0.05). No differences were noted in the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that postoperative delirium is associated with a more complicated and costly recovery after esophagectomy and that age is independently predictive of its development. Delirium has often been thought to be the sequela of other complications; however, this study demonstrates that it presents in isolation or precedes other complications in 67.4% of cases. Focused screening will likely allow targeted preventative strategies to be used in the perioperative period to reduce complications and costs associated with delirium.
