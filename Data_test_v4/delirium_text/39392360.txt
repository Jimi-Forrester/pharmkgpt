39392360|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic neurodegenerative disease in older people, and there is no specific treatment that can stop or reverse its progression. Neobavaisoflavone (NBIF) is a flavonoid that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, but its role in AD has not been revealed. The present study investigated the role and mechanism of NBIF on Abeta25-35-induced brain injury. METHODS: In this experiment, the AD mouse model was established by injection of Abeta25-35 peptides (200 muM, icv), and Donepezil (Don, 10 mg/kg/days), NBIF-L (15 mg/kg/days), and NBIF-H (30 mg/kg/days) were administered orally for 4 weeks. Learning memory, hippocampal pathological changes, pathological markers, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, immune cells were measured in mice. Network pharmacology combined with the GEO database led to the identification of SIRT1, a key target for NBIF intervention in AD, and levels of SIRT1, p-STAT3 and FOXO1 were measured. In addition, the antagonistic activity of SIRT1 transfection silencing against NBIF in Abeta25-35-induced in N9 cells and N2a-APP69 cells was investigated to assess whether the effects caused by NBIF were mediated by SIRT1. RESULTS: The results showed that NBIF ameliorated learning memory and hippocampal neuronal damage, reduced pathological markers, apoptosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and modulated immune cells. SIRT1 is a key target for NBIF intervention in AD, and NBIF upregulates SIRT1 and reduces the expression levels of p-STAT3 and FOXO1. Furthermore, silencing SIRT1 effectively reduced the protective effect of NBIF on Abeta25-35-induced N9 cells and N2a-APP69 cells, which indicated that the protective effect of NBIF on AD is related to SIRT1. CONCLUSIONS: NBIF ameliorated Abeta25-35-induced brain injury by inhibiting apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, which may be mediated through SIRT1 signaling. These findings provide a rationale for NBIF in the treatment of AD and help facilitate the development of clinical therapeutic agents for AD.
