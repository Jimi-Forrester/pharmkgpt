39589947|a|Introduction: As life expectancy increases, the prevalence of frailty and eye diseases (cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy) in the elderly global population is rising. Eye diseases and visual impairment not only contribute to a high incidence of falls, fractures, depression, and social isolation but they also herald cognitive decline and frailty (vision-cognitive impairment). Methods: This narrative review explores the relationship between eye diseases, visual impairment, and frailty, their association with cognitive decline, the current approaches in identifying and managing these conditions and the potential role of interdisciplinary care models. Relevant articles were identified by searching the major databases. Result: Eye diseases are common in elderly individuals and can lead to visual impairment and subsequently contribute to falls, fractures, depression, and social isolation. Visual impairment is strongly linked to cognitive decline, which is a key component of frailty. Reduced sensory input from vision loss leads to decreased cognitive stimulation, reduced engagement in activities such as reading, problem-solving, executive function, attention, and social interactions, which are crucial for maintaining cognitive health. This can lead to a form of "sensory deprivation", which accelerates neurodegenerative processes. As cognitive decline progresses, it creates a feedback loop where individuals may struggle to manage their health, adhere to treatment regimens, or seek timely medical care, exacerbating both cognitive impairment and frailty. Additionally, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is common in older adults with vision loss and may precede clinical dementia. This sense of declining cognitive ability can worsen anxiety and depression, further contributing to frailty. Early intervention has the potential to mitigate the cognitive effects of vision loss (vision-cognitive impairment). Conclusions: Ophthalmologists should play an important role in detecting frailty associated with vision loss. Incorporating frailty assessments into ophthalmic practice can facilitate referrals to geriatric care and early interventions, improving patient outcomes. Geriatricians should be vigilant in identifying visual impairment and referring patients for appropriate ophthalmic investigation and management. Regular vision assessments should be part of comprehensive geriatric evaluations. Future research will assess the beneficial role of community geriatricians in detecting frailty and vision-cognitive impairment. An interdisciplinary and collaborative approach between ophthalmologists and geriatricians can lead to earlier detection, comprehensive management, and improved outcomes in frailty, eye diseases, and cognitive function.
