37048051|t|STAT3 Drives GFAP Accumulation and Astrocyte Pathology in a Mouse Model of Alexander Disease.
37048051|a|Alexander disease (AxD) is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system. AxD-associated mutations cause GFAP aggregation and astrogliosis, and GFAP is elevated with the astrocyte stress response, exacerbating mutant protein toxicity. Studies in mouse models suggest disease severity is tied to Gfap expression levels, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 regulates Gfap during astrocyte development and in response to injury and is activated in astrocytes in rodent models of AxD. In this report, we show that STAT3 is also activated in the human disease. To determine whether STAT3 contributes to GFAP elevation, we used a combination of genetic approaches to knockout or reduce STAT3 activation in AxD mouse models. Conditional knockout of Stat3 in cells expressing Gfap reduced Gfap transactivation and prevented protein accumulation. Astrocyte-specific Stat3 knockout in adult mice with existing pathology reversed GFAP accumulation and aggregation. Preventing STAT3 activation reduced markers of reactive astrocytes, stress-related transcripts, and microglial activation, regardless of disease stage or genetic knockout approach. These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 could potentially reduce GFAP toxicity and provide a therapeutic benefit in patients with AxD.
