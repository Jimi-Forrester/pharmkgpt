30463362|t|The Plasma Membrane: A Platform for Intra- and Intercellular Redox Signaling.
30463362|a|Membranes are of outmost importance to allow for specific signal transduction due to their ability to localize, amplify, and direct signals. However, due to the double-edged nature of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-toxic at high concentrations but essential signal molecules-subcellular localization of ROS-producing systems to the plasma membrane has been traditionally regarded as a protective strategy to defend cells from unwanted side-effects. Nevertheless, specialized regions, such as lipid rafts and caveolae, house and regulate the activated/inhibited states of important ROS-producing systems and concentrate redox targets, demonstrating that plasma membrane functions may go beyond acting as a securing lipid barrier. This is nicely evinced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidases (NOX), enzymes whose primary function is to generate ROS and which have been shown to reside in specific lipid compartments. In addition, membrane-inserted bidirectional H2O2-transporters modulate their conductance precisely during the passage of the molecules through the lipid bilayer, ensuring time-scaled delivery of the signal. This review aims to summarize current evidence supporting the role of the plasma membrane as an organizing center that serves as a platform for redox signal transmission, particularly NOX-driven, providing specificity at the same time that limits undesirable oxidative damage in case of malfunction. As an example of malfunction, we explore several pathological situations in which an inflammatory component is present, such as inflammatory bowel disease and neurodegenerative disorders, to illustrate how dysregulation of plasma-membrane-localized redox signaling impacts normal cell physiology.
