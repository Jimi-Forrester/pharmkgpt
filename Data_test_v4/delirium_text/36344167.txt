36344167|t|N-glycan branching enzymes involved in cancer, Alzheimer's disease and COPD and future perspectives.
36344167|a|Over the past 3 decades, our group has been involved in studies related to the biosynthesis of N-glycan branching and related glycosyltransferases and have purified most of these Golgi-derived enzymes to homogeneity using classical purification methods and cloned the cDNA of GnT-III, IV, V, VI and Fut8 except GnT-IX(Vb) which was obtained by homology cloning. Based primarily on our data, we briefly summarize the significance of three major enzymes and discuss perspectives for future studies on the occasion of Ernesto's 90th birthday celebration.
