38570483|a|Sequence variants in the HERC2 gene are associated with a significant reduction in HERC2 protein levels and cause a neurodevelopmental disorder known as the HERC2-related disorder, which shares clinical features with Angelman syndrome, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, and movement disorders. Remarkably, the HERC2 gene is commonly deleted in individuals with Angelman syndrome, suggesting a potential contribution of HERC2 to the pathophysiology of this disease. Given the known critical role of autophagy in brain development and its implication in neurodevelopmental diseases, we undertook different experimental approaches to monitor autophagy in fibroblasts derived from individuals affected by the HERC2-related disorder. Our findings reveal alterations in the levels of the autophagy-related protein LC3. Furthermore, experiments with lysosomal inhibitors provide confirmation of an upregulation of the autophagy pathway in these patient-derived cells. Mechanistically, we corroborate an interaction between HERC2 and the deubiquitylating enzyme USP20; and demonstrate that HERC2 deficiency leads to increased USP20 protein levels. Notably, USP20 upregulation correlates with enhanced stability of the autophagy initiating kinase ULK1, highlighting the role of HERC2 as an autophagy regulator factor through the USP20-ULK1 axis. Moreover, we show that p38 acts as a modulator of this pathway, since p38 activation disrupts HERC2-USP20 interaction, leading to increased USP20 and LC3-II protein levels. Together, these findings uncover a previously unknown role for HERC2 in autophagy regulation and provide insights into the pathomolecular mechanisms underlying the HERC2-related disorder and Angelman syndrome.
