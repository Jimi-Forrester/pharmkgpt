35656503|t|Supplementation of High Velocity Nasal Insufflation with a Nonrebreather Mask for Severe Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in Adult Patients with COVID-19.
35656503|a|The unique clinical features of COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, as well as the widespread impact leading to resource strain, have led to reconsiderations of classic approaches to respiratory support. HFNO includes high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and high velocity nasal insufflation (HVNI). There are currently no widely accepted criteria for HFNO failure. We report a series of three patients who experienced COVID-19-related acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Each patient was initially managed with HVNI and had a ROX index < 3.85, suggesting HFNO failure was likely. They were subsequently managed with a nonrebreather mask (NRM) overlying and in combination with HVNI at maximal settings and were able to be managed without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.
