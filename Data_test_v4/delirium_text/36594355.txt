36594355|t|Munronin V with 7/7/6 tricarbocyclic framework from Munronia henryi harms inhibits tau pathology by activating autophagy.
36594355|a|Munronin V (1), isolated from Munronia henryi Harms, is the first example, to the best of our knowledge, of an unprecedented 7/7/6 tricarbocyclic framework featuring an unusual A,B-seco-limonoid ring. The structures of munronin V were established from extensive spectroscopic and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) analyses. The novel A,B-seco with two seven-membered lactones was formed as a result of Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Compound 1 activated autophagy and inhibited Tau pathology as revealed by flow cytometric analyses, confocal imaging analysis and western blotting, and this effect was mediated by transcription factor EB (TFEB). These findings suggested that 1 might have potential as a compound for combating Alzheimer's disease.
