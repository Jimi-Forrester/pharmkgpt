30377697|a|APP/PS1/tau triple transgenic (3xTg) mouse is a classical animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has abnormalities in recognition and electrophysiological properties at early 6-month-old age. However, few studies were performed by using simultaneously recording cognitive behavior and brain electrical activity in the conscious 3xTg mice. By using a new wireless recording system, we recorded hippocampal Theta oscillations in 3xTg mice during the process of fear conditioning test. The results showed that: (1) in training session, no significant difference in the fear behavior and hippocampal Theta activity was found between 3xTg mice and WT mice; (2) in test session, 3xTg mice showed a significant decrease in freezing ratio compared with WT mice when they were exposed to conditioning stimulus (CS); (3) the 3xTg mice showed lower peak power in Theta oscillation in both Pre-CS and CS duration compared with WT mice; (4) CS effectively induced an increase in the peak frequency of Theta oscillation in WT mice, but not in 3xTg mice. These results indicated that the impairment of cognition behavior in 3xTg mice was accompanied with the decreased peak power and peak frequency of Theta oscillation in the hippocampus, suggesting that a decline in Theta oscillation might be involved in the impairments of the fear conditioning, and the enhanced hippocampal Theta oscillation may be beneficial for improving AD cognitive function.
