34476314|t|An Opioid-free Anesthesia Protocol for Pediatric Strabismus Surgery: A Quality Improvement Project.
34476314|a|INTRODUCTION: This quality improvement (QI) project tracks a series of 2 Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as we standardized and refined an ambulatory pediatric anesthesia strabismus protocol. We aimed to provide effective pain relief, reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) rates, and be cost-efficient while minimizing perioperative opioids over 5 years. METHODS: We used statistical process control (SPC) charts to analyze real-world data captured from the medical record. We chose the following outcome and process measures to evaluate effectiveness: postoperative morphine rescue rate, maximum pain score in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and PONV rescue rate. We also used 2 balancing measures: postoperative length of stay (LOS) and total anesthesia time. We standardized our anesthesia protocol for our first PDSA cycle (April 2017) by removing intraoperative intravenous acetaminophen and utilizing fentanyl only. For the second PDSA cycle (January 2019), we replaced intraoperative fentanyl with dexmedetomidine. RESULTS: There was a total of 325 pediatric strabismus repair surgeries performed between April 2015 and July 2020. There was no special cause variation detected in the SPC charts for the family of measures chosen to measure effectiveness: postoperative morphine rescue rate, maximum pain score in the PACU, or the PONV rescue rate. The PONV rescue rate was 0 with the removal of opioids. Also, there was no special cause variation for the balancing measures: postoperative LOS or total anesthesia time. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout 2 PDSA cycles, this QI project enabled our team to standardize an opioid-free and cost-efficient anesthesia protocol for pediatric strabismus surgery over 5 years.
