18468705|t|Medial temporal lobe atrophy in vascular dementia: visual temporal lobe rating scale.
18468705|a|Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be measured in several ways. First of all, visual rating scale is a quick and easy measurement. MTA is a sensitive marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but not specific. It has been documented in other dementias including vascular dementia (VD). This study is to evaluate the degree of MTA in VD patients using a standardized visual rating scale and to suggest the importance of the possible role of MTA in VD. Twenty-five VD, 33 AD and 27 non-demented patients underwent a coronal three-dimensional magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo brain MRI sequence. MTA was rated visually using a 5-point rating scale from 0 (no atrophy) to 4 (severe atrophy). The mean summed MTA score was 5.39 in AD, 2.16 in VD and 0.56 in non-demented patients. Most of the VD patients (80%) showed MTA. They were greater in bilateral sides compared with the non-demented group, but milder than in AD. Additionally, MTA of left side score was significantly associated with age. Medial temporal lobe volumes measured visually are smaller in size in patients with VD, although not to the same extent as in AD. This suggests that MTA in VD patients may be associated with pre-existing AD.
