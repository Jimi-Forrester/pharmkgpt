35887991|t|Acute on Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension: Case Series and Review of Management.
35887991|a|Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a distinct form of precapillary pulmonary hypertension classified as group 4 by the World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) and should be excluded during an episode of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients presenting to emergency departments with sudden onset of signs and symptoms of acute PE may already have a pre-existing CTEPH condition decompensated by the new PE episode. Identifying an underlying and undiagnosed CTEPH during acute PE, while challenging, is an important consideration as it will alter the patients' acute and long-term management. Differential diagnosis and evaluation require an interdisciplinary expert team. Analysis of the clinical condition, the CT angiogram, and the hemodynamic situation are important considerations; patients with CTEPH usually have significantly higher sPAP at the time of index PE, which is unusual and unattainable in the context of acute PE and a naive right ventricle. The imaging may reveal signs of chronic disease such as right ventricle hypertrophy bronchial collaterals and atypical morphology of the thrombus. There is no standard for the management of acute on chronic CTEPH. Herein, we provide a diagnostic and management algorithm informed by several case descriptions and a review of the literature.
