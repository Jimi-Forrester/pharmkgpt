37386779|t|Gait and/or balance disturbances associated with Alzheimer's dementia among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment: A longitudinal observational study.
37386779|a|AIMS: To explore whether gait and/or balance disturbances are associated with the onset of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: This study employed a longitudinal retrospective cohort design. METHODS: We obtained data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set collected from 35 National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers between September 2005 and December 2021. The mean age of participants (n = 2692) was 74.5 years with women making up 47.2% of the sample. Risk of incident AD according to baseline gait and/or balance disturbances as measured using the Postural Instability and Gait Disturbance Score, a subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Score, was examined by the Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for baseline demographics, medical conditions and study sites. The mean follow-up duration was 4.0 years. RESULTS: Among all the participants, the presence or the severity of gait and/or balance disturbances was associated with an increased risk of AD. The presence or the severity of gait and/or balance disturbances was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's dementia among the subgroups of female and male participants. CONCLUSION: Gait and/or balance disturbances may increase the risk of developing AD, regardless of sex. IMPACT: Gait and/or balance disturbances among community-dwelling older adults with amnestic MCI may need to be frequently assessed by nurses to identify potential risk factors for cognitive decline. NO PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Given the secondary analysis, patients, service users, caregivers or members of the public were not directly involved in this study.
