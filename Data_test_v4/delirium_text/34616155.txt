34616155|t|A Rehabilitation-Based Multidisciplinary Care Model Reduces Hip Fracture Mortality in Older Adults.
34616155|a|PURPOSE: In older adults, the one-year mortality rate after experiencing a hip fracture ranges between 8% and 36%. The purpose of this study was to look at the efficacy of rehabilitation-based multidisciplinary care for older individuals who had hip fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 185 people (aged 65 and over) with a history of hip fracture surgery between February 2014 and March 2017. A survey was conducted one month and six months following the operation to assess the recovery of 93 individuals who were part of a rehabilitation-based multidisciplinary care program and 92 patients who were getting standard therapy with surgery and unsupervised physical therapy. RESULTS: Physical activity, gait, balance evaluation, and depression scale ratings all had statistical significance (P < 0.05) after participants received rehabilitation-based care services from multidisciplinary medical professionals. Furthermore, the refracture and one-year mortality rates in this rehabilitation-based multidisciplinary care model were lower than in the groups getting standard therapy. CONCLUSION: The research indicates the efficacy of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation strategy provided by a collaborative medical team to older individuals with hip fractures.
