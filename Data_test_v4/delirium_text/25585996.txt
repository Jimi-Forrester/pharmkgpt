25585996|a|Apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (ApoE 4) is known as a risk gene for the late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and the relationship between ApoE 4 and cognitive function of the elderly people has drawn the attention of the scientists. In this study, we investigated the relationship between ApoE 4 and the cognitive function of the old people. A total of 156 old people were investigated, of whom 31 were ApoE 4 carriers. The ApoE 4 primarily influenced the global cognitive function, perceptual speed, and work memory. The results indicate that ApoE 4 has significant negative effect on the cognitive function of the elderly people who are 60 years and older.
