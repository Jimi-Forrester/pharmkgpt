34532026|t|The influence of gastrointestinal pH on speciation of copper in simulated digestive juice.
34532026|a|Speciation can provide knowledge about absorption, reactivity to binding sites, bioavailability, toxicity, and excretion of elements. In this study, the speciation of copper in different model solutions under the influence of gastrointestinal (GI) pH was studied by ion selective electrode (ISE) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). It was found that the electrode response (mV) against Cu2+ decreased with the increase in pH and dropped to the lowest point at pH 7.5 in all model solutions. When amino acids and organic acids were present, the ratio of filtered copper (0.45 mum, pH 7.5) was more than 90%. When casein was present, whey protein, pancreatin, and starch were added, and the ratio of filtered copper was 85.6 +- 0.3, 56.7 +- 8.8, 38.5 +- 5.1, and 1.0 +- 0.3%, respectively. When there is not enough organic ligand, excessive copper will form copper hydroxide precipitation with the increase in pH, but it got the highest electrode response (mV) against Cu2+. From this study, it can be concluded that the speciation of copper in GI tract is strongly influenced by the pH and the composition of food. When there are few ligands coexisting in the GI tract, the concentration of copper ion may be relatively high.
