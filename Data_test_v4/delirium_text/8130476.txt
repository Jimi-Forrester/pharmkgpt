8130476|t|Differential use of computer network services.
8130476|a|In two randomized field experiments, one involving persons living with AIDS (PWAs) and another involving caregivers of Alzheimer's Disease patients (AD caregivers), we evaluated the ComputerLink, an electronic network designed to support home care. ComputerLink offered a feasible and effective means to reach home-bound individuals. PWAs and AD caregivers demonstrated different patterns of ComputerLink use. Two measures of use are employed: number of encounters with the system and number of accesses to specific functions. PWAs used the system more often than did the AD caregivers, and were more likely than the AD caregivers to use private rather than public communication services.
