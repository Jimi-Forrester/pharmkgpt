36302506|t|Key Residue for Aggregation of Amyloid-beta Peptides.
36302506|a|It is known that oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Abeta has two isoforms: Abeta40 and Abeta42. Although the difference between Abeta40 and Abeta42 is only two additional C-terminal residues, Abeta42 aggregates much faster than Abeta40. It is unknown what role the C-terminal two residues play in accelerating aggregation. Since Abeta42 is more toxic than Abeta40, its oligomerization process needs to be clarified. Moreover, clarifying the differences between the oligomerization processes of Abeta40 and Abeta42 is essential to elucidate the key factors of oligomerization. Therefore, to investigate the dimerization process, which is the early oligomerization process, Hamiltonian replica-permutation molecular dynamics simulations were performed for Abeta40 and Abeta42. We identified a key residue, Arg5, for the Abeta42 dimerization. The two additional residues in Abeta42 allow the C-terminus to form contact with Arg5 because of the electrostatic attraction between them, and this contact stabilizes the beta-hairpin. This beta-hairpin promotes dimer formation through the intermolecular beta-bridges. Thus, we examined the effects of amino acid substitutions of Arg5, thereby confirming that the mutations remarkably suppressed the aggregation of Abeta42. Moreover, the mutations of Arg5 suppressed the Abeta40 aggregation. It was found by analyzing the simulations that Arg5 is important for Abeta40 to form intermolecular contacts. Thus, it was clarified that the role of Arg5 in the oligomerization process varies due to the two additional C-terminal residues.
