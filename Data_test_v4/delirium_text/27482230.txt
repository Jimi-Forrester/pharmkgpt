27482230|t|Indirubin-3'-monoxime suppresses amyloid-beta-induced apoptosis by inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation.
27482230|a|Indirubin-3'-monoxime is an effective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, and may play an obligate role in neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we found that indirubin-3'-monoxime improved the morphology and increased the survival rate of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to amyloid-beta 25-35 (Abeta25-35), and also suppressed apoptosis by reducing tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Thr205. Furthermore, indirubin-3'-monoxime inhibited phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Our results suggest that indirubin-3'-monoxime reduced Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis by suppressing tau hyperphosphorylation via a GSK-3beta-mediated mechanism. Indirubin-3'-monoxime is a promising drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease.
