25875281|a|The chronic diseases, comorbidities and rapidly changing needs of frail older persons increase the complexity of caregiving. A comprehensive, systematic and structured collection of data on the status of the frail older person is presumed to be essential in facilitating decision-making and thus improving the quality of care provided. However, the way in which an assessment is completed has a substantial impact on the quality and value of the results. This study examines the online completion of interRAI Home Care assessments, the possible causes for incomplete assessments and the consequences of these factors with respect to the quality of care received. Our findings indicate high nurse engagement and poor physician participation. We also observed the poor completion of items in predominantly medically- oriented sections characterized by, first, the fact that the assessors felt incapable of answering certain questions, second, the absence of required data or of a competent person to fill out the data, and third, the lack of tools necessary for essential measurements. The incompleteness of assessments has a clear negative influence on outcome generation. Moreover, without the added value of support outcomes, the improvement of care quality can be impeded and information technology can easily be seen as burdensome by the assessors. We have observed that multidisciplinary cooperation is an important prerequisite to establishing high-quality assessments aimed at improving the quality of care.
