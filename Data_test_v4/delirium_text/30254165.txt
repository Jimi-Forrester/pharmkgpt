30254165|a|Two of the most predominant features of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and inflammation. The mechanism behind these pathologies remains unknown, but there is evidence to suggest that inflammation may predate the deposition of Abeta. Furthermore, immune activation is increasingly being recognized as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of the disease, and disorders involving systemic inflammation, such as infection, aging, obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and depression are risk factors for the development of AD. Plasminogen (PLG) is primarily a blood protein synthesized in the liver, which when cleaved into its active form, plasmin (PL), plays roles in fibrinolysis, wound healing, cell signaling, and inflammatory regulation. Here we show that PL in the blood is a regulator of brain inflammatory action and AD pathology. Depletion of PLG in the plasma of an AD mouse model through antisense oligonucleotide technology dramatically improved AD pathology and decreased glial cell activation in the brain, whereas an increase in PL activity through alpha-2-antiplasmin (A2AP) antisense oligonucleotide treatment exacerbated the brain's immune response and plaque deposition. These studies suggest a crucial role for peripheral PL in mediating neuroimmune cell activation and AD progression and could provide a link to systemic inflammatory risk factors that are known to be associated with AD development.
