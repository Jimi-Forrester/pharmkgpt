1197465|t|[Liepmann's test and its specific significance in the alcoholic delirium].
1197465|a|The perceptional characteristics of hallucinatory events and the phenomenal forms of artificially produced hallucinations were studied on a total of 210 patients (144 patients with delirium tremens, alcoholic hallucinosis, abstention from alcoholic beverages freedom from abstinence symptoms and 66 subjects with schizophrenia, symptomatic epilepsy, general paralysis, neuroses, and conditions of intoxication). The results of our studies show that Liepmann's test may be used to reliably diagnose genuine hallucinoses. They are usually preceded by a number of different stages, these being the stages of stability of development and full development of prehallucinatory phenomena, simultaneous and suggestive periods of geniune hallucinations. Liepmann's test is specifically distinctive of psychopathological disorders associated with delirium tremens.
