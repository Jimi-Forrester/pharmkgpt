38994778|a|Objective: Postoperative nausea (PN) and vomiting (PONV) in cardiac surgery increases adrenergic stimulation, limits mobilization and oral intake, and can be distressing for patients. The primary aim of our study was to investigate the effect of sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia on the incidence of PONV in cardiac surgery patients undergoing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. Methods: Following ethics committee approval, 62 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery with ERAS protocol were included in this prospective randomized study. After standard induction of anaesthesia, Group S received 1.5-2% sevoflurane and Group P received 50-100 mug kg-1 min-1 propofol infusion as maintenance anaesthetic agent with a bispectral index of 40-50. The incidence of PN and PONV between 0-6 hours (early) and 6-24 hours (late) after extubation was compared as the primary outcome. The incidence of delirium was analyzed as a secondary outcome for similar periods. Results: In the propofol group, 3 patients were excluded due to postoperative tamponade revision and prolonged mechanical ventilation. PN in the early post-extubation period (29% vs. 7.1%, P=0.031) was significantly higher in Group S. The incidence of delirium was similar between the groups in both periods. Conclusion: Propofol may reduce the incidence of PN in the first 6 hours after extubation compared with sevoflurane. We believe that this period will be beneficial for gastrointestinal tolerance as it is the period when oral intake is initiated in patients. In conclusion, propofol maintenance in cardiac surgery patients may facilitate patient rehabilitation as part of the ERAS protocol.
