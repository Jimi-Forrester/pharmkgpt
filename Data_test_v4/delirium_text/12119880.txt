12119880|a|Today, early diagnosis of different forms of dementia is possible with a relatively easy-to-apply set of diagnostic tools. The quality of the medical history, including the information supplied by relatives and friends, together with the psychological and physical findings, determine the diagnostic hit rate. Laboratory investigations and imaging techniques are indispensable for detecting the underlying cause of existing dementia. Standardized rapid screening procedures for the identification of mild cognitive deficits have speeded up the reliable selection of suspicious cases needing referral to a specialist. Identification of individual day-to-day problems and non-cognitive disorders round off the diagnosis of dementia, and establish the conditions for planning a suitable treatment strategy.
