37047347|t|Non-Ceruloplasmin Copper Identifies a Subtype of Alzheimer's Disease (CuAD): Characterization of the Cognitive Profile and Case of a CuAD Patient Carrying an RGS7 Stop-Loss Variant.
37047347|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia whose cause is incompletely defined. Copper (Cu) involvement in AD etiology was confirmed by a meta-analysis on about 6000 participants, showing that Cu levels were decreased in AD brain specimens, while Cu and non-bound ceruloplasmin Cu (non-Cp Cu) levels were increased in serum/plasma samples. Non-Cp Cu was advocated as a stratification add-on biomarker of a Cu subtype of AD (CuAD subtype). To further circumstantiate this concept, we evaluated non-Cp Cu reliability in classifying subtypes of AD based on the characterization of the cognitive profile. The stratification of the AD patients into normal AD (non-Cp Cu <= 1.6 micromol/L) and CuAD (non-Cp Cu > 1.6 micromol/L) showed a significant difference in executive function outcomes, even though patients did not differ in disease duration and severity. Among the Cu-AD patients, a 76-year-old woman showed significantly abnormal levels in the Cu panel and underwent whole exome sequencing. The CuAD patient was detected with possessing the homozygous (c.1486T > C; p.(Ter496Argext*19) stop-loss variant in the RGS7 gene (MIM*602517), which encodes for Regulator of G Protein Signaling 7. Non-Cp Cu as an add-on test in the AD diagnostic pathway can provide relevant information about the underlying pathological processes in subtypes of AD and suggest specific therapeutic options.
