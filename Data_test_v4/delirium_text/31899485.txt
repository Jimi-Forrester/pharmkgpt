31899485|a|The lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A. The observation that missense variants in the encoding GLA gene often lead to structural destabilization, endoplasmic reticulum retention and proteasomal degradation of the misfolded, but otherwise catalytically functional enzyme has resulted in the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. In this context, we have investigated proteostasis regulators (PRs) for their potential to increase cellular enzyme activity, and to reduce the disease-specific accumulation of the biomarker globotriaosylsphingosine in patient-derived cell culture. The PRs also acted synergistically with the clinically approved 1-deoxygalactonojirimycine, demonstrating the potential of combination treatment in a therapeutic application. Extensive characterization of the effective PRs revealed inhibition of the proteasome and elevation of GLA gene expression as paramount effects. Further analysis of transcriptional patterns of the PRs exposed a variety of genes involved in proteostasis as potential modulators. We propose that addressing proteostasis is an effective approach to discover new therapeutic targets for diseases involving folding and trafficking-deficient protein mutants.
