26745259|a|AIM: To identify factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), focusing particularly on functional alterations. METHODS: Cross-sectional multicenter study in subjects aged 65 years or older with mild to moderate AD. HRQoL was measured using the DQoL (five domains: self-esteem, positive affect/humor, negative affect, feeling of belonging, and sense of esthetics). Functional alterations were assessed based on activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). We also recorded socio-demographic characteristics of the patient and their carer, and comprehensive geriatric assessment including MMSE and psycho-behavioral data (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Cornell depression score). Factors associated with each domain of the DQol were identified by multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: In total, 123 subjects were included (mean age 82 +- 6 years, 64% women). Two of the five domains of the DQoL were significantly associated with factors based on functional evaluation. The ability to transfer within the home and the ability to use the telephone were associated with an increase in HRQoL in the 'self-esteem' domain (p = 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). Ability to get dressed without assistance was associated with lower HRQoL in the 'negative affect' domain (p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Alterations in functional capacity have a significant effect on HRQoL in several domains of the DQoL.
