35885428|a|Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid deposition in the brain. OSA is further linked to the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, we analyzed the plasma levels of AD neuropathology biomarkers and their relationships with structural changes of the brain and atherosclerosis. Thirty OSA patients with normal cognition and 34 normal controls were enrolled. Cognitive functions were assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition and Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument. Plasma Abeta-40, Abeta-42, and T-tau levels were assayed using immunomagnetic reduction. The carotid intima-media thickness was measured to assess the severity of atherosclerosis. Structural MR images of brain were acquired with voxel-based morphometric analysis of T1 structural images. The OSA patients exhibited significantly elevated plasma levels of Abeta-42 and T-tau, as well as increased gray matter volume in the right precuneus. Plasma T-tau level is associated with carotid intima-media thickness and gray matter volume of the precuneus. These findings may indicate early changes that precede clinically apparent cognitive impairment. The measurement of these biomarkers may aid in the early detection of OSA-associated morbidity and possible treatment planning for the prevention of irreversible neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction.
