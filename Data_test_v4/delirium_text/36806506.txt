36806506|a|BACKGROUND: The Maintain Your Brain (MYB) trial aims to prevent cognitive decline and dementia through multidomain, web-based risk-reduction. To facilitate translation, it is important to understand drivers of participation. OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics associated with participation in MYB. METHODS: This was an observational ancillary study of MYB, a randomized controlled trial nested within the 45 and Up Study in New South Wales, Australia. We linked 45 and Up Study survey and MYB participation data. The study cohort comprised 45 and Up Study participants, aged 55-77 years at 1 January 2018, who were invited to participate in MYB. 45 and Up Study participant characteristics and subsequent MYB consent and participation were examined. RESULTS: Of 98,836 invited, 13,882 (14%) consented to participate and 6,190 participated (6%). Adjusting for age and sex, a wide range of factors were related to participation. Higher educational attainment had the strongest relationship with increased MYB participation (university versus school non-completion; AdjOR = 5.15; 95% CI:4.70-5.64) and lower self-rated quality of life with reduced participation (Poor versus Excellent: AdjOR = 0.19; 95% CI:0.11-0.32). A family history of Alzheimer's disease was related to increased participation but most other dementia risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, stroke, high blood pressure, and current smoking were associated with reduced participation. CONCLUSION: Higher socio-economic status, particularly educational attainment, is strongly associated with engagement in online dementia prevention research. Increasing population awareness of dementia risk factors, and better understanding the participation barriers in at-risk groups, is necessary to ensure online interventions are optimally designed to promote maximum participation.
