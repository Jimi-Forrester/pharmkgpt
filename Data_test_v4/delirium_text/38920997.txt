38920997|t|Molecular Mechanisms in the Design of Novel Targeted Therapies for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38920997|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse group of diseases characterized by a progressive loss of neurological function due to damage to nerve cells in the central nervous system. In recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in the expanding associated with increasing human life expectancy. Molecular mechanisms control many of the essential life processes of cells, such as replication, transcription, translation, protein synthesis and gene regulation. These are complex interactions that form the basis for understanding numerous processes in the organism and developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, molecular basis refers to changes at the molecular level that cause damage to or degeneration of nerve cells. These may include protein aggregates leading to pathological structures in brain cells, impaired protein transport in nerve cells, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory processes or genetic mutations that impair nerve cell function. New medical therapies are based on these mechanisms and include gene therapies, reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress, and the use of miRNAs and regenerative medicine. The aim of this study was to bring together the current state of knowledge regarding selected neurodegenerative diseases, presenting the underlying molecular mechanisms involved, which could be potential targets for new forms of treatment.
