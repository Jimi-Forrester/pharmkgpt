28587340|a|The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that butylphthalide protects the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model rats by inhibiting apoptosis. Ninety Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into drug, control and blank groups of 30 rats in each. The rats in the drug and control groups were treated to induce AD. Then, the rats in the drug group were administered with butylphthalide daily, the rats in the AD control group were given normal saline, and the rats in the healthy group were fed routinely. All rats were sacrificed after 30 days; the brain tissues were used for testing for apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining method, for determining mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK and P21 protein by western blot analysis, and their cognate mRNA levels by RT-PCR. The results of the TUNEL staining indicated that apoptosis of the brain tissues of rats in the drug group was significantly less than that in the control group and blank group. The protein expression levels of MAPK in the drug group were significantly lower than that in the control group, but higher than that in the normal healthy group (P<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of MAPK in the drug group were significantly lower than those in the control group, but higher than those in the normal healthy group (P<0.05). Based on these results, butylphthalide showed a protective apoptosis-inhibition effect on the brain tissues of the AD rats and this seems to be a consequence of its inhibition of the expressions of MAPK mRNA and MAPK protein in the brain of the rat.
