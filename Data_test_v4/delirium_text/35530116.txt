35530116|t|Cognitive and Functional Abilities in an Older Adult Veteran Before and After Contracting COVID-19.
35530116|a|Background: A 76-year-old male Veteran with a historical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment was assessed at baseline and follow-up as part of two separate, ongoing studies. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the interim. Objective: To report potential effects on cognitive and functional abilities measured before and after contracting COVID-19. Methods: The patient was administered a series of cognitive tests and self-report procedures assessing cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric status. Results: Overall, no discernable pattern of cognitive changes between pre-COVID and post-COVID assessments were noted. Only mild increases in agitation, depression, and irritability were noted on a self-report measure. However, this particular subject has relatively ideal psychosocial circumstances in comparison to the typical older adult Veteran male. It is hypothesized that improved psychosocial conditions will result in less negative cognitive and functional outcomes for older adults diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion: High levels of resilience, social support, and exercise, coupled with lower levels of perceived stress and loneliness may serve as protective factors against cognitive and functional decline in older adults who contract COVID-19.
