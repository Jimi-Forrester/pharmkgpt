38155235|a|Musculoskeletal deficits are among the most common extra-intestinal manifestations and complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aimed to identify crosstalk genes between IBD and osteoporosis (OP) and potential relationships between crosstalk and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-related genes. Three common hub genes from different compared groups are actually the same, namely HDAC6, IL-8, and PPIF. ROC showed that the combined diagnostic value of HDAC6, IL-8, and PPIF was higher than each of the three key hub genes. Immune infiltration results showed that HDAC6 and IL-8 key genes negatively correlated with CD65 bright natural killer cells. USF1 was the common upstream TFs between HDAC6 and PPIF, and MYC was the common upstream TFs between IL-8 and PPIF in RegNetwork. Taken together, this study shows a linked mechanism between IBD and OP via NETs and crosstalk genes. These findings may show light on better diagnosis and treatment of IBD complicated with OP.
