35937840|a|Objective: Hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) share common risk factors and usually co-occur. This study examined the relationship between HTN history and T2DM incidence in a cohort of Chinese hypertensive subjects. Methods: We recruited 443 cases (T2DM and HTN) and 443 sex- and age-matched controls (HTN). The history of peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) was divided into 140-159, 160-179, and >= 180 mmHg, and that of peak diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was divided into 90-99, 100-109, and >= 110 mmHg. Multiple binary logistic regression models were used to explore the association between controlled HTN status and T2DM. Results: Creatinine concentrations were higher in the cases than in the controls (P < 0.05). The HTN duration was longer in the cases than in the controls (14.7 years vs. 13.2 years; P < 0.05). Significant differences were also found in the history of peak SBP and DBP between the cases and controls (both P < 0.05). Creatinine, HTN duration, and family history of T2DM were risk factors for T2DM in hypertensive subjects, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.013 (1.004-1.022), 1.025 (1.003-1.047), and 5.119 (3.266-8.026), respectively. Compared with the lowest level of peak DBP, the odds ratio for T2DM at the highest level of peak DBP was 1.757 (1.074-2.969). Subgroups analyses showed that the effect of the history of peak DBP on T2DM was significantly modified by sex (P-interaction = 0.037). Conclusion: The highest DBP and the longest HTN duration were both independently associated with T2DM in hypertensive subjects.
