38995801|t|Biofluid Detection of Pathological alpha-Synuclein in the Prodromal Phase of Synucleinopathies.
38995801|a|Synucleinopathies are disorders characterized by the aggregation and deposition of pathological alpha-synuclein conformers. The underlying neurodegenerative processes begin years or decades before the onset of cardinal motor symptoms. This prodromal phase may manifest with various signs or symptoms. However, there are no current standardized laboratory tests to ascertain the progression and conversion of prodromal conditions such as mild cognitive impairment, isolated REM sleep behavior disorder or pure autonomic failure. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the diagnostic possibilities using human biofluids as source material to detect pathological alpha-synuclein in the prodromal phase of synucleinopathies. Our review identified eight eligible studies, that investigated pathological alpha-synuclein conformers using cerebrospinal fluid from patients with prodromal signs of synulceinopathies to differentiate this patient group from non-synucleinopathies, while only one study investigated this aspect using blood as medium. While previous studies clearly demonstrated a high diagnostic performance of alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays for differentiating synucleinopathies with Lewy bodies from healthy controls, only few analyses were performed focussing on individuals with prodromal disease. Nevertheless, results for the early detection of alpha-synuclein seeds using alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays were promising and may be of particular relevance for future clinical trials and clinical practice.
