29333252|a|Lower urinary tract symptoms-in particular, storage disorders (for example, urinary incontinence) as well as bladder underactivity-are major health-related problems that increase with age. Yet lower urinary tract symptoms remain under-diagnosed and poorly managed, and incontinence has been cited as the major reason for institutionalization in elderly populations and is one of the most common conditions in primary care practice. Although lifestyle and behavior therapy has been used as a useful treatment regimen for urge incontinence, medications (often used as adjunct) can provide additional benefit. This review will include current therapies used for treatment of urinary incontinence.
