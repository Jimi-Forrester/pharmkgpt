38663363|a|BACKGROUND: As the medical challenges posed by the ageing population become increasingly severe, the proportion of older people among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing every year. SUMMARY: The prevalence of frailty in patients with CKD is significantly higher than that in the general population, and older patients are also a high-risk group for frailty and cognitive impairment. Cognitive frailty, as an important subtype of frailty, is a syndrome characterised by cognitive dysfunction caused by physiological factors, excluding Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. It is characterised by the coexistence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Previous studies have mainly focused on cognitive impairment, and there is limited research on cognitive frailty, particularly in older patients with CKD. KEY MESSAGES: This article provides a comprehensive review of the concept, epidemiology, screening methods, prevention, and treatment measures and possible pathogenesis of cognitive frailty in patients with CKD.
