17690946|t|Serum proteomic profiling of dementia with Lewy bodies: diagnostic potential of SELDI-TOF MS analysis.
17690946|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common senile degenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presentation of overlapping symptoms between these two disorders leads to difficulties in the determination of clinical entities. Serum samples were subjected to surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) analysis in order to identify a diagnostic marker for DLB. Four putative protein peaks (m/z 3,883, 4,964, 7,761 and 10,534) were differentially expressed in DLB patients compared to AD patients and control subjects. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of a multivariate logistic model of the combination of three peaks (m/z 3,883, 7,761 and 10,534) exhibited the highest discriminatory ability of DLB subjects from non-DLB subjects with a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 95.8%, a positive predictive value of 90.9% and a negative predictive value of 92.0%. SELDI-TOF MS profiling, therefore, has revealed a serum signature with high diagnostic potential for DLB.
