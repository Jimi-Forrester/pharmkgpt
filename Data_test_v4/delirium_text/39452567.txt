39452567|t|Determination of Quality Indicators for Microvascular Grafts in Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery-A Retrospective Analysis of 251 Free Flaps.
39452567|a|BACKGROUND: The use of microvascular grafts is the gold standard in oral and maxillofacial surgery for the reconstruction of soft tissue and bony and combined defects. Graft loss is one of the most serious complications in the field of reconstructive surgery. A comprehensive analysis of factors influencing this is, therefore, essential. METHODS: This hypothesis-generating study analyzed 251 patient cases of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the University Hospital Dusseldorf from 2016 to 2020 regarding patient- and therapy-specific parameters for their impact on graft survival. RESULTS: Statistically significant influencing factors were found among the 80 parameters examined: treatment with antiplatelet medication and a BMI >= 24.5 at the time of surgery had a positive influence on graft survival, while existing diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, tracheostomy, and a longer operation time had a statistically relevant negative influence. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the relevance of patient-specific risk stratification and the need for further research to develop a valid risk profile. Identifying high-risk patients with medium-sized defects, where alternatives to microvascular reconstruction are available, appears to be crucial for the clinical outcome.
