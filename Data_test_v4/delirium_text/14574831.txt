14574831|t|Delirium in hospital: an underreported event at discharge.
14574831|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium, an important event in hospital, is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Most patients with delirium recover fully; however, when left untreated, delirium may progress to stupor, coma, or death. Delirium is less likely to resolve completely in elderly patients in whom persistent cognitive deficits commonly occur. The extent to which this information is available to family doctors after discharge was investigated. METHOD: A total of 31 patients with delirium who were referred to consultation-liaison psychiatry were assessed using standardized measures. Medical services completed discharge summaries on these patients; a chart review captured the extent to which the diagnosis of delirium and the involvement of psychiatry was recorded in the discharge summaries. RESULTS: In structured discharge summaries, a reference to delirium occurrence was found in 55% of cases. In unstructured discharge summaries, the reporting was much lower (16% of cases). Delirium was more likely to be reported in women than in men, when it was more severe, or when it was the principal reason for admission, rather than when it occurred during an admission for some other reason. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium episodes that occur during a period of hospitalization for treatment of any medical disorder are underreported, even when specifically diagnosed. Structured discharge summaries tend to increase the rate of reporting.
