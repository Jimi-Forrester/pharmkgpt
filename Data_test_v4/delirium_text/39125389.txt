39125389|a|Methylsulfinyl hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) isolated from Eutrema japonicum is a promising candidate for the treatment of breast cancer, colorectal and stomach cancer, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases, diabetes, and obesity due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Also, its neuroprotective properties, improving cognitive function and protecting dopaminergic neurons, make it an excellent candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. 6-MSITC acts on many signaling pathways, such as PPAR, AMPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Nrf2/Keap1-ARE, ERK1/2-ELK1/CHOP/DR5, and MAPK. However, despite the very promising results of in vitro and in vivo animal studies and a few human studies, the molecule has not yet been thoroughly tested in the human population. Nonetheless, wasabi should be classified as a "superfood" for the primary and secondary prevention of human diseases. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art research on 6-MSITC and its potential clinical uses, discussing in detail the signaling pathways activated by the molecule and their interactions.
