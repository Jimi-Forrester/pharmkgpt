38056310|t|ALS-linked SOD1 mutations impair mitochondrial-derived vesicle formation and accelerate aging.
38056310|a|Oxidative stress (OS) is regarded as the dominant theory for aging. While compelling correlative data have been generated to support the OS theory, a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the accumulation of oxidation-mediated damage and aging has not been firmly established. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a primary antioxidant in all cells. It is, however, susceptible to oxidation due to OS and gains toxic properties to cells. This study investigates the role of oxidized SOD1 derived from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) linked SOD1 mutations in cell senescence and aging. Herein, we have shown that the cell line NSC34 expressing the G93A mutation of human SOD1 (hSOD1G93A) entered premature senescence as evidenced by a decreased number of the 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)-positive cells. There was an upregulation of cellular senescence markers compared to cells expressing the wild-type human SOD1 (hSOD1WT). Transgenic mice carrying the hSOD1G93A gene showed aging phenotypes at an early age (135 days) with high levels of P53 and P16 but low levels of SIRT1 and SIRT6 compared with age-matched hSOD1WT transgenic mice. Notably, the levels of oxidized SOD1 were significantly elevated in both the senescent NSC34 cells and 135-day hSOD1G93A mice. Selective removal of oxidized SOD1 by our CT4-directed autophagy significantly decelerated aging, indicating that oxidized SOD1 is a causal factor of aging. Intriguingly, mitochondria malfunctioned in both senescent NSC34 cells and middle-aged hSODG93A transgenic mice. They exhibited increased production of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) in response to mild OS in mutant humanSOD1 (hSOD1) transgenic mice at a younger age; however, the mitochondrial response gradually declined with aging. In conclusion, our data show that oxidized SOD1 derived from ALS-linked SOD1 mutants is a causal factor for cellular senescence and aging. Compromised mitochondrial responsiveness to OS may serve as an indicator of premature aging.
