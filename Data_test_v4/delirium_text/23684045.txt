23684045|t|Prevalence and clinical correlations of catatonia in older adults referred to a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital.
23684045|a|AIM: To determine the frequency and clinical correlations of catatonia in older patients referred to a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients over 65 years referred to liaison psychiatry were screened for catatonic phenomena with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI) between January and May 2012. Their clinical characteristics and the outcome of treatment were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients over 65 years were referred. Ten (8.9%) met research diagnostic criteria for catatonia and 7 (6.3%) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria for catatonia. All patients presented with the inhibited variant and 5 to 12 catatonic signs. Three patients presented concomitant delirium. The etiology of catatonia was multifactorial, and complications and death were frequent (40% and 20%, respectively). Lorazepam achieved full resolution of catatonia in 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Catatonia in older adults referred to liaison psychiatry in a general hospital is not infrequent and has a multifactorial etiology. The BFCSI is a simple and reliable instrument to detect catatonia in this population. Lorazepam seems to be an effective treatment.
