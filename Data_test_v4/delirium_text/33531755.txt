33531755|t|Evaluation of MR Visual Rating Scales in Major Forms of Dementia.
33531755|a|Objective  The aim of the study is to visually rate major forms of dementia using global cortical atrophy (GCA), medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), and Fazeka's scales and Koedam's score using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The purpose is to correlate the visual rating scales (VRS) with severity of dementia. Materials and Methods  Thirty patients fulfilling DSM 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for Alzheimer's dementia (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) underwent MRI brain. Cortical atrophy, medial temporal, and parietal lobe atrophy were assessed using GCA and MTA scales and Koedam's score, respectively. White matter hyperintensities were assessed using Fazeka's scale. Correlation between VRS and mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores was done using Pearson correlation coefficient. Results  70% of patients had Grade 2 GCA. More patients with AD had higher MTA scores as compared with others with 57% of AD patients showing abnormal for age MTA scores. Fazeka's scale was abnormal for age in 58.33% of VaD and 57% AD patients. Majority (75%) showing severe parietal atrophy (Grade 3 Koedam's score) were AD patients. Disproportionate frontal lobe atrophy was seen in all four (100%) FTD patients. Significant negative correlation was seen between MMSE and GCA scores of all patients ( p -value = 0.003) as well as between MTA and MMSE scores in AD patients ( p -value = 0.00095). Conclusion  Visual rating of MTA is a reliable method for detecting AD and correlates strongly with memory scores. Atrophy of specific regions is seen more commonly in some conditions, for instance, where MTA and parietal atrophy are specific for AD while asymmetric frontal lobe and temporal pole atrophy favor FTD.
