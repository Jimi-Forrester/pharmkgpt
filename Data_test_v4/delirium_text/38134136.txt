38134136|a|BACKGROUND: Labile blood pressure after acute ischaemic stroke requiring mechanical thrombectomy is independently associated with poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study protocol describes is designed to determine whether transauricular nerve stimulation, improves baroreflex sensitivity, reduces blood pressure variability in the first 24 hours after acute ischaemic stroke requiring mechanical thrombectomy. DESIGN: PHASE 2A, PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, SHAM-CONTROLLED RANDOMISED TRIAL: Methods and Analysis: 36 individuals undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke with established hypertension aged >18 years will be randomly allocated to receive bilateral active or sham transauricular nerve stimulation for the duration of the mechanical thrombectomy procedure (AffeX-CT/001 investigational device). The intervention will be repeated for 1h the morning following the mechanical thrombectomy. Non-invasive blood pressure will be measured >=2h for 24h after mechanical thrombectomy. Holter electrocardiographic monitoring will be recorded during transauricular nerve stimulation. Participants, clinicians and investigators will be masked to treatment allocations. The primary outcome will be the coefficient of variation of systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes include additional estimates of blood pressure variability and time/frequency-domain measures of autonomic cardiac modulation An adjusted sample size of 36 patients is required to have a 90% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, a difference in the coefficient of variation in systolic blood pressure of 5+-4mmHg between sham and active stimulation [assuming 5% non-compliance rate in each group]. Ethics: confirmed on 16 March 2023 by HRA and Health and Care Research Wales ethics committee (reference 23/WA/0013). DISCUSSION: This study will provide proof-of-concept data that examines whether non-invasive autonomic neuromodulation can be used to favourably modify blood pressure and autonomic control after acute ischaemic stroke requiring mechanical thrombectomy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration number: NCT05417009.
