34280318|t|COVID-19 Infection: A Neuropsychiatric Perspective.
34280318|a|As a potentially life-threatening disease with no definitive treatment and without fully implemented population-wide vaccination, COVID-19 has created unprecedented turmoil in socioeconomic life worldwide. In addition to physical signs from the respiratory and many other systems, the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric problems, including olfactory and gustatory impairments, encephalopathy and delirium, stroke and neuromuscular complications, stress reactions, and psychoses. Moreover, the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and its indirect effects on neuropsychiatric health in noninfected individuals in the general public and among health care workers are similarly far-ranging. In addition to acute neuropsychiatric manifestations, COVID-19 may also produce late neuropsychiatric sequelae as a function of the psychoneuroimmunological cascade that it provokes. The present article presents a state-of-the-science review of these issues through an integrative review and synthesis of case series, large-cohort studies, and relevant meta-analyses. Heuristics for evaluation and further study of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are offered.
