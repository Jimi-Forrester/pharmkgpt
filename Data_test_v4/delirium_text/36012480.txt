36012480|t|The Role of Bioenergetics in Neurodegeneration.
36012480|a|Bioenergetic and mitochondrial dysfunction are common hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Decades of research describe how genetic and environmental factors initiate changes in mitochondria and bioenergetics across Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mitochondria control many cellular processes, including proteostasis, inflammation, and cell survival/death. These cellular processes and pathologies are common across neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence suggests that mitochondria and bioenergetic disruption may drive pathological changes, placing mitochondria as an upstream causative factor in neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. Here, we discuss evidence of mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and address how mitochondria can drive common pathological features of these diseases.
