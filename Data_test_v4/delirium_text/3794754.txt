3794754|t|The topography of cell loss from locus caeruleus in Alzheimer's disease.
3794754|a|A topographical analysis of nerve cell loss from locus caeruleus in Alzheimer's disease has shown that cell loss is confined to the dorsal areas and occurs uniformly throughout the rostrocaudal length of the locus. By contrast there is no significant cell loss from ventral parts of the locus, at any point along its rostrocaudal length. Dorsally located neurones of the locus project to cerebral cortex; ventrally located neurones to non-cortical areas such as basal ganglia, cerebellum and spinal cord. These data suggest that damage to nerve cells of locus caeruleus in Alzheimer's disease relates primarily to pathological events within their terminal fields, with perikaryal loss following as a secondary retrograde change. The senile plaque may represent the actual site of the damage to nerve terminals.
