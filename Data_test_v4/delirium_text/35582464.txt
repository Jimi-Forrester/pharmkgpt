35582464|t|Association of dissected ascending aorta diameter with preoperative adverse events in patients with acute type A aortic dissection.
35582464|a|BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. AIM: To evaluate the diameter of dissected ascending aorta in patients diagnosed with ATAAD and whether the aortic diameter is associated with preoperative adverse events. METHODS: A total of 108 patients diagnosed with ATAAD who underwent emergency operation under hypothermic circulatory arrest were enrolled in this study. Demographic characteristics and perioperative data were recorded. In all patients, preoperative chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans were performed. RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 61.5 (52.5-70.5) years and median body mass index (BMI) was 28.2 (25.1-32.6) cm2. The number of female patients was 37 (25%). Median diameter of the ascending aorta was 5.0 (4.5-6) cm and 53.8% of the patients had an aortic diameter < 5.0 cm, while 32.3% of the patients had an aortic diameter of 4.5cm and 72.0% had an ascending aorta diameter < 5.5 cm. The diameter of the ascending aorta did not differ in patients with vs without preoperative adverse events: Preoperative neurological dysfunction (P = 0.53) and hemodynamic instability (P = 0.43). Median age of patients with preoperative hemodynamic instability was 65 (57.5-74) years, while it was 60 (51-68) years in patients without (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Although current guidelines suggest replacing the ascending aorta with a diameter > 5.5 cm, most of the patients with ATAAD had an aortic diameter of less than 5.5 cm. The diameter of the ascending aorta in patients diagnose with ATAAD is not associated with preoperative adverse events.
