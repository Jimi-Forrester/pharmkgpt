39543686|t|A signaling pathway map of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1/SERPINE-1): a review of an innovative frontier in molecular aging and cellular senescence.
39543686|a|Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a vital regulator of the fibrinolytic mechanism and has been intricately involved in various physiological and clinical processes, including cancer, thrombosis, and wound healing. The PAI-1 signaling pathway is multifaceted, encompassing numerous signaling molecules and nodes. Recent studies have revealed a novel contribution of PAI-1 during cellular senescence. This review introduces a pathway resource detailing the signaling network events mediated by PAI-1. The literature curated on the PAI-1 system was manually compiled from various published studies, our analysis presents a signaling pathway network of PAI-1, which includes various events like enzyme catalysis, molecular association, gene regulation, protein expression, and protein translocation. This signaling network aims to provide a detailed analysis of the existing understanding of the PAI-1 signaling pathway in the context of cellular senescence across various research models. By developing this pathway, we aspire to deepen our understanding of aging and senescence research, ultimately contributing to the pursuit of effective therapeutic approaches for these complex chronic diseases.
