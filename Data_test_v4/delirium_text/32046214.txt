32046214|t|Network between Cytokines, Cortisol and Occupational Stress in Gas and Oilfield Workers.
32046214|a|To test whether gas and oil field work is accompanied by stress and altered immune function, the perception of workplace stress, levels of salivary cortisol, plasma levels, and mononuclear cell production of cytokines were examined in 80 healthy workers recruited among a population of operators on gas and oilfields. Specific questionnaires for determining the perception of anxiety, occupational stress, and subjective symptoms were administered. Salivary cortisol and cytokines plasma levels were evaluated by Elisa and to investigate immune function, both spontaneous and PHA- or LPS-induced expression and production of cytokines were assessed by qRT-PCR. Workers showed medium stress levels at work, with growth and increased motivation for work, and based on salivary cortisol concentrations, were divided into two groups of <=10 ng/mL (n = 31) or >10 ng/mL (n = 49). Statistically significant higher plasma levels of IL-6, while lower TNFalpha, were detected in workers with cortisol >10 ng/mL. Also, BMI, DL, JD and Job strain were significantly higher in workers with cortisol >10 ng/mL. Thus, even modest variations of cortisol might have a role in the modulation of immune response and worker's vulnerability to health imbalance.Thus, the evaluation of immune status, in addition to cortisol levels, could be useful to prevent illnesses; exacerbation of pre-existing conditions; morbidity; and consequent absences from work, with economic repercussions.
