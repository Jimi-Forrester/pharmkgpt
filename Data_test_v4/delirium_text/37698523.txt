37698523|t|Effect of Neurotoxin Exposure on Blood Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer Disease.
37698523|a|AIM: To determine whether exposure to neurotoxins in midlife is associated with changes in blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration and Alzheimer disease pathology. METHODS: Blood cadmium, lead, neurofilament light (NfL) chain, total tau (TTau), and amyloid beta (Abeta) 40 and Abeta42 concentrations were measured in 1516 participants in the Beaver Dam Offspring Study. Linear mixed-effect models were used to determine associations between baseline cadmium and lead levels and baseline NfL, TTau, and Abeta42/Abeta40, and 10-year change in concentrations using repeated measures of these biomarkers as the outcome. RESULTS: In women, higher cadmium and lead levels were associated with higher baseline TTau concentrations. A higher baseline cadmium level was associated with lower baseline Abeta42/Abeta40 in both men and women. In age-sex-adjusted models, a doubling in baseline cadmium level was associated with a 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0, 0.3) higher increase per year in NfL concentrations. In men, a doubling of baseline lead level was associated with a 0.9% (95% CI: 0.1, 1.7) higher increase per year in TTau concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with relatively higher levels of cadmium and lead had blood biomarker concentrations consistent with more neuronal damage and Alzheimer disease pathology. Environmental exposure to neurotoxins may contribute to neurodegeneration.
