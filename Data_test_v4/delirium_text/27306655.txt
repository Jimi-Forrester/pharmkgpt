27306655|t|[Gly14]-Humanin Protects Against Amyloid beta Peptide-Induced Impairment of Spatial Learning and Memory in Rats.
27306655|a|Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of senile plaques in the brain. Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the plaques is thought to be responsible for the memory loss in AD patients. [Gly14]-humanin (HNG), a derivative of humanin (HN), has much stronger neuroprotective effects than natural HN in vitro. However, clarification of the Abeta active center and the neuroprotective mechanism of HN still need in vivo evidence. The present study first compared the in vivo biological effects of three Abeta fragments (1-42, 31-35, and 35-31) on spatial memory in rats, and investigated the neuroprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of HNG. The results showed that intrahippocampal injection of Abeta1-42 and Abeta31-35 almost equally impaired spatial learning and memory, but the reversed sequence Abeta35-31 did not have any effect; a high dose of Abeta31-35 (20 nmol) produced a more detrimental response than a low dose (2 nmol); Abeta31-35 injection also disrupted gene and protein expression in the hippocampus, with up-regulation of caspase3 and down-regulation of STAT3; pretreatment with HNG not only protected spatial memory but also rescued STAT3 from Abeta-induced disruption; and the neuroprotective effects of HNG were effectively counteracted by genistein, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These results clearly show that sequence 31-35 in Abeta is the shortest active center responsible for the neurotoxicity of Abeta from molecule to behavior; and HNG protects spatial learning and memory in rats against Abeta-induced insults; and probably involves the activation of tyrosine kinases and subsequent beneficial modulation of STAT3 and caspase3.
