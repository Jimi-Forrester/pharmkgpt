37767224|t|Making pre-screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Postoperative delirium among post-acute COVID-19 syndrome - (PACS) a national priority: The Deep Neuro Study.
37767224|a|SARS-CoV-2 effects on cognition is a vibrant area of active research. Many researchers suggest that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms leading to hospitalization, sustain significant neurodegenerative injury, such as encephalopathy and poor discharge disposition. However, despite some post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) case series that have described elevated neurodegenerative biomarkers, no studies have been identified that directly compared levels to those in mild cognitive impairment, non-PACS postoperative delirium patients after major non-emergent surgery or preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients, that have clinical evidence of Alzheimer's without symptoms. According to recent estimates, there may be 416 million people globally on the AD continuum, which include approximately 315 million people with preclinical AD. In light of all the above, a more effective application of digital biomarker and explainable artificial intelligence methodologies that explored amyloid beta, neuronal, axonal, and glial markers in relation to neurological complications in-hospital or later outcomes could significantly assist progress in the field. Easy and scalable subjects' risk stratification is of utmost importance, yet current international collaboration initiatives are still challenging due to the limited explainability and accuracy to identify individuals at risk or in the earliest stages that might be candidates for future clinical trials. In this open letter, we propose the administration of selected digital biomarkers previously discovered and validated in other EU funded studies to become a routine assessment for non-PACS preoperative cognitive impairment, PACS neurological complications in-hospital or later PACS and non-PACS improvement in cognition after surgery. The open letter also includes an economic analysis of the implications for such national level initiatives. Similar collaboration initiatives could have existing prediagnostic detection and progression prediction solutions pre-screen the stage before and around diagnosis, enabling new disease manifestation mapping and pushing the field into unchartered territory.
