32037030|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore caregiver, pharmacist and pharmacy technician attitudes toward burden screening in community pharmacies and assess caregiver burden in community pharmacies. METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in 10 community pharmacies in France. Pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease were included in this study. Two self-reported questionnaires were used to explore attitudes of participants toward the burden screening in community pharmacy and to assess the caregiver burden in community pharmacy. The short version of the Zarit Burden Interview (range 0-7) was used for the burden screening. RESULTS: Fifty-two pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, and 20 caregivers (61.8+-13.7years) participated in this study. Seventy percent of caregivers and 96% of pharmacists/pharmacy technicians stated that caregiver burden screening should be conducted in community pharmacies. 65% of caregivers reported their caregiver status to their community pharmacist. Eighty-two percent of pharmacist/pharmacy technicians thought they had to inform the caregiver's general practitioners (GP) about the detected burden level. Of the 20 included caregivers, 18 had a perception of burden. The mean caregiver burden score detected in this exploratory study was 4.0+-1.7, corresponding to a moderate to severe burden. CONCLUSIONS: According to caregivers' opinion, community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians represent accessible health care professionals in primary care to quantify caregiver burden. The burden screening can be easily incorporated into clinical service offerings in community pharmacy practice. It provides a valuable opportunity to identify high-risk caregivers with the aim of referring them to their GP to prevent the caregiver's frailty.
