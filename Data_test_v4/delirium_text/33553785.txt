33553785|a|Several studies have linked treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with negative psychological outcomes. This study explores the prevalence of negative psychological outcomes in Greek patients (N=29), a year after treatment in ICU. Percentages of participants with anxiety [41%, 95% CI (22%, 60%)] and Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [34%, 95% CI (16%, 53%)] symptoms were similar to the related literature. Percentages of participants with depressive [17%, 95% CI (3%, 32%)] symptoms were rather low. Only 10% of participants reported absence of quality of live issues. Anxiety symptoms were related to desire to talk about the ICU experience (p=0.010), duration of propofol administration (p=0.018) and loss of employment (p=0.019) and negatively related to duration of stay in the ICU (p=0.025). PTSD symptoms were related to experiencing other stressors during the year after the ICU stay (p=0.001), social constraint (p=0.003), duration of propofol administration (p=0.004), loss of employment (p=0.020), low income (p=0.022) and negative ICU memories (p=0.029). Depressive symptoms were related to loss of employment (p=0.003), low income (p=0.029) and social constraint (p=0.033). Patients experience elevated levels of psychological symptoms long after they are discharged from the hospital. Several psychosocial factors emerged as important factors to consider for predicting levels of distress.
