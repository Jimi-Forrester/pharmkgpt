38826471|t|Effect of Machine Learning on Anaesthesiology Clinician Prediction of Postoperative Complications: The Perioperative ORACLE Randomised Clinical Trial.
38826471|a|Background: Anaesthesiology clinicians can implement risk mitigation strategies if they know which patients are at greatest risk for postoperative complications. Although machine learning models predicting complications exist, their impact on clinician risk assessment is unknown. Methods: This single-centre randomised clinical trial enrolled patients age >=18 undergoing surgery with anaesthesiology services. Anaesthesiology clinicians providing remote intraoperative telemedicine support reviewed electronic health records with (assisted group) or without (unassisted group) also reviewing machine learning predictions. Clinicians predicted the likelihood of postoperative 30-day all-cause mortality and postoperative acute kidney injury within 7 days. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the clinician predictions was determined. Results: Among 5,071 patient cases reviewed by 89 clinicians, the observed incidence was 2% for postoperative death and 11% for acute kidney injury. Clinician predictions agreed with the models more strongly in the assisted versus unassisted group (weighted kappa 0.75 versus 0.62 for death [difference 0.13, 95%CI 0.10-0.17] and 0.79 versus 0.54 for kidney injury [difference 0.25, 95%CI 0.21-0.29]). Clinicians predicted death with AUROC of 0.793 in the assisted group and 0.780 in the unassisted group (difference 0.013, 95%CI -0.070 to 0.097). Clinicians predicted kidney injury with AUROC of 0.734 in the assisted group and 0.688 in the unassisted group (difference 0.046, 95%CI -0.003 to 0.091). Conclusions: Although there was evidence that the models influenced clinician predictions, clinician performance was not statistically significantly different with and without machine learning assistance. Further work is needed to clarify the role of machine learning in real-time perioperative risk stratification. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05042804.
