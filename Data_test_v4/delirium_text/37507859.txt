37507859|a|Both beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides and oxidative stress conditions play key roles in Alzheimer's disease. Hemin contributes to the development of the disease as it possesses redox properties and its level increases in pathological conditions or traumatic brain injuries. The aim of this work was to deepen the investigation of the reactivity of the hemin-Abeta16 complex, considering its ability to catalyze oxidation and nitration reactions. We performed kinetic studies in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite with phenolic and catechol substrates, as well as mass spectrometry studies to investigate the modifications occurring on the peptide itself. The kinetic constants were similar for oxidation and nitration reactions, and their values suggest that the hemin-Abeta16 complex binds negatively charged substrates with higher affinity. Mass spectrometry studies showed that tyrosine residue is the endogenous target of nitration. Hemin degradation analysis showed that hemin bleaching is only partly prevented by the coordinated peptide. In conclusion, hemin has rich reactivity, both in oxidation and nitration reactions on aromatic substrates, that could contribute to redox equilibrium in neurons. This reactivity is modulated by the coordination of the Abeta16 peptide and is only partly quenched when oxidative and nitrative conditions lead to hemin degradation.
