35724724|a|A growing body of evidence indicates that several characteristics of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) play a functional role in cognition and could be linked to the progression of cognitive decline in some neurological diseases such as dementia. The present paper reviews previous studies investigating changes in brain oscillations associated to the most common types of dementia, namely Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), and vascular dementia (VaD), with the aim of identifying pathology-specific patterns of alterations and supporting differential diagnosis in clinical practice. The included studies analysed changes in frequency power, functional connectivity, and event-related potentials, as well as the relationship between electrophysiological changes and cognitive deficits. Current evidence suggests that an increase in slow wave activity (i.e., theta and delta) as well as a general reduction in the power of faster frequency bands (i.e., alpha and beta) characterizes AD, VaD, and FTD. Additionally, compared to healthy controls, AD exhibits alteration in latencies and amplitudes of the most common event related potentials. In the reviewed studies, these changes generally correlate with performances in many cognitive tests. In conclusion, particularly in AD, neurophysiological changes can be reliable early markers of dementia.
