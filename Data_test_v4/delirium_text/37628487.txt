37628487|a|BACKGROUND: We believe that parental presence before the induction of anesthesia for surgery among children with a cleft palate/lip would be effective in mitigating their preoperative anxiety. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the states of patients with a cleft palate/lip when their parents accompanied them into operating rooms and clarified their and their parents' cognition using a questionnaire. METHODS: Data were collected via nursing observation when patients and their parents entered the operating room. Furthermore, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to patients and parents after the operation regarding their feelings about parental presence in the operating room. RESULTS: In total, nine patients cried when they entered the surgical room. Furthermore, six patients and three parents reported preoperative anxiety. In addition, eight patients agreed that they were satisfied with the presence of their parents before induction. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the patients cried. However, the presence of parents before the induction of anesthesia was effective in reducing anxiety among most patients and their parents.
