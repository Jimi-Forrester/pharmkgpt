32393056|a|Aim: Impaired methylation of the mitochondrial DNA and particularly in the regulatory displacement loop (D-loop) region, is increasingly observed in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. The present study aims to investigate if common polymorphisms of genes required for one-carbon metabolism (MTHFR, MTRR, MTR and RFC-1) and DNA methylation reactions (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) influence D-loop methylation levels. Materials & methods: D-loop methylation data were available from 133 late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients and 130 matched controls. Genotyping was performed with PCR-RFLP or high resolution melting techniques. Results: Both MTRR 66A > G and DNMT3A -448A > G polymorphisms were significantly associated with D-loop methylation levels. Conclusion: This exploratory study suggests that MTRR and DNMT3A polymorphisms influence mitochondrial DNA methylation; further research is required to better address this issue.
