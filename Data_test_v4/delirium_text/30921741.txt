30921741|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of chalcone Mannich base derivatives as multifunctional agents for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
30921741|a|A series of chalcone Mannich base derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on the multi-target directed ligands design strategy. In vitro assays demonstrated that most of the derivatives exerted potent selective inhibitory potency on AChE with good multifunctional properties. Among them, representative compound 7c exhibited moderate inhibitory potency for EeAChE (IC50 = 0.44 muM) and MAO-B inhibition (IC50 = 1.21 muM), good inhibitory effect on self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (55.0%, at 25 muM), biometal chelating property, moderate antioxidant activity with a value 1.93-fold of Trolox. Moreover, both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and molecular modeling study revealed that 7c showed a mixed-type inhibition, binding simultaneously to CAS and PAS of AChE. In addition, 7c also displayed high BBB permeability. These properties indicated 7c may be a promising multifunctional agent for the treatment of AD.
