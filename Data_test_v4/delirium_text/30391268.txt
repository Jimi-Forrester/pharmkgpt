30391268|t|[Diagnosis and comorbidities of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders].
30391268|a|Circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) result from a disturbed endogenous clock (intrinsic CRSD) or from a misalignment between the biological clock and an imposed environment (extrinsic CRSD). Among intrinsic CRSD, one distinguishes the delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, the advanced sleep-wake phase disorder, the irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder and the non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder. Shift work disorder, jet lag disorder and circadian sleep-wake disorder not otherwise specified are extrinsic CRSD. Prevalences of the different CRSD remain largely unknown. Some CRSD are particularly frequent such as sleep delayed phase syndrome in adolescents. Overall, CRSD are probably under-diagnosed. CRSD generate insomnia and excessive daytime somnolence. A biological clock dysfunction has to be evoked in case of insomnia or sleepiness. Furthermore, as CRSD can overlap with other sleep disorders, their diagnosis and treatment are essential. CRSD cause significant mental, physical or socio-professional sufferings. They are frequently associated with comorbidities, mainly neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Regarding neurodevelopmental comorbidities, therapy using a chronobiological approach is complementary to the usual clinical care. It helps to limit the significant impact of CRSD on quality of live, daytime functioning, social interactions and neurocognitive difficulties in the children. In psychiatry, sleep disorders and circadian rhythms sleep-wake disorders are a factor of vulnerability, of suicidal risk, of relapse and pharmacoresistance. Thus, diagnosis of CRSD associated with a psychiatric disorder is of major importance. Treatment using a chronobiological approach reinforcing the entrainment of the sleep-wake cycle is complementary to usual treatments. Sleep disorders and circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders can be a preclinical sign of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In the elderly, a beginning neurodegenerative disorder can be associated with a CRSD and complaints of sleepiness, nocturnal awakenings and/or irregular sleep-wake cycles. Patients affected by neurogenerative disorders are particularly vulnerable for having CRSD. Data from different studies suggest that CRSD participate in pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Even though treatment of CRSD associated with neurodegenerative disorders is entirely part of the treatment strategy, it remains uncertain to which extend this treatment may impact disease progression.
