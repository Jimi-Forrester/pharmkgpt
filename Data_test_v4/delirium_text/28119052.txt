28119052|t|rBTI reduced beta-amyloid-induced toxicity by promoting autophagy-lysosomal degradation via DAF-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans.
28119052|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, of which beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced toxicity was suggested as a main cause. Some substances with prolongevity effects have been shown to be protective against AD. In a previous study we demonstrated that a recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (rBTI) could prolonge the lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Here, we investigated whether rBTI may benefit to mitigate the AD symptom by feeding the AD model C. elegans CL4176. CL4176 is a transgenic C. elegans expressing human Abeta3-42 in muscle tissue. The results showed that rBTI not only could extend lifespan but also could reduce Abeta toxicity-triggered body paralysis in AD worms. Further study found the accumulation of Abeta was decreased and autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway was activated in AD worms treated with rBTI. Moreover, the inhibition of autophagy reduced rBTI-mediated paralysis delay. Genetic analyses showed rBTI increased the transcriptional activity of dauer formation abnormal-16 (DAF-16) and the disruption of daf-16 abolished rBTI-mediated protective effect in AD worms. Taken together, these data indicated that rBTI promoted the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway to reduce the Abeta-induced toxicity via DAF-16 in an AD model C. elegans, implying that BTI has the potential to protect against AD.
