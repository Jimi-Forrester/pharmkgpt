37155147|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is presently a health challenge in China. Although clinical chemotherapy is prescribed availably, the negative effects and poor prognoses still occur. Genistein has antitumor properties in our previous studies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-CRC effects of genistein remain unclear. Increasing evidences have indicated that the induction of autophagy, one of cell death models, is closely associated with the formation and development of human cancer. In the current study, a systematic bioinformatics approach using network pharmacology and molecular docking imitation was aimed at identifying the pharmacological targets and anti-CRC mechanisms of genistein, characterized by autophagy-related processes and pathways. Moreover, experimental validation was conducted by using clinical and cell culture samples. All 48 potential targets of genistein-anti-CRC-associated autophagy were screened accordingly. Further bioinformatics analyses identified 10 core genistein-anti-CRC targets related to autophagy, and enrichment-assayed results revealed that the biological processes of these core targets might regulate multiple molecular pathways, including the estrogen signaling pathway. Additionally, molecular docking data demonstrated that genistein has a high affinity for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). Both EGFR and ESR1 proteins were highly expressed in clinical CRC samples. Preliminary in vitro data showed that genistein effectively reduced cellular proliferation, activated apoptosis, and suppressed EGFR and ESR1 protein expressions in CRC cells. Our research findings uncovered the molecular mechanisms of genistein against CRC, and the potential drug targets associated with autophagy in genistein treatment of CRC were identified and validated experimentally, including EGFR and ESR1.
