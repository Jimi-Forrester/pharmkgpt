38124759|t|Management of urinary tract infections in the era of antimicrobial resistance.
38124759|a|Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infections globally, imposing a substantial personal and economic burden on individuals and health resources. Despite international health concerns and sustained public awareness campaigns about the emergence of resistant microorganisms through the inappropriate therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents, the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is worsening, and AMR in UTIs represents a critical global healthcare issue. This narrative review summarizes evidence-based scientific material, recommendations from the current medical literature, and the latest clinical guidelines on antibiotic and antibiotic-sparing strategies for managing urological infections, including practical approaches to improve the management of patients with acute and recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) in routine clinical practice. Novel emerging therapies and prophylaxis options are described as potential alternatives to overcome the abuse and overuse of antibiotics and the practical application of the guideline recommendations and issues relating to best practice in managing UTIs.
