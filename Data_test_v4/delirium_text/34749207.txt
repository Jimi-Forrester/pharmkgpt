34749207|t|Host factors: Implications in immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.
34749207|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is more serious in people with underlying diseases, but the cause of healthy people with progressive disease is largely unknown. Host genetic factors such as ACE2 variants, IFITM-3, HLA, TMRSS2, and furin polymorphisms appear to be one of the agents involved in the progression of the COVID-19 and outcome of the disease. This review discusses the general characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including viral features, receptors, cell entry, clinical findings, and the main human genetic factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and get the patients' situation more complex. Further knowledge in this context may help to find a way to prevent and treat this viral pneumonia.
