34562176|a|PURPOSE: Delirium is associated with longer hospital stays and increased medical costs and mortality. This study explored the risk factors for postoperative delirium in gastroenterological surgery and investigated the association between qualitative changes in risk factors and the incidence of postoperative delirium. METHODS: A total of 418 patients > 18 years old who underwent gastroenterological surgery at our department between April 2018 and September 2019 were included. Risk factors were identified by comparing patients with and without postoperative delirium. Continuous variables were evaluated graphically using cubic spline curves. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess independent risk factors. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 6.9%. The cubic spline curve showed that the incidence of postoperative delirium began to increase at 50 years old and increased sharply at 70 years old. A multiple logistic regression analysis of patients > 50 years old identified 5 risk factors: age >= 70 years, preoperative serum albumin <= 3.8 g/dL, psychosis, sedative-hypnotics, and intensive-care unit admission. CONCLUSION: The risk of postoperative delirium increases progressively at 50 years old and sharply at 70 years old. Advanced age, preoperative hypoalbuminemia, psychosis, sedative-hypnotics, and intensive-care unit admission are risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients > 50 years old undergoing gastroenterological surgery.
