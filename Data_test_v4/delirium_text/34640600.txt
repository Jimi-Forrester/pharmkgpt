34640600|t|The Clinical and Neuropathological Features of Sporadic (Late-Onset) and Genetic Forms of Alzheimer's Disease.
34640600|a|The purpose of this review is to compare and highlight the clinical and pathological aspects of genetic versus acquired Alzheimer's disease: Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer's disease in (DSAD) and Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) are compared with the late-onset form of the disease (LOAD). DSAD and ADAD present in a younger population and are more likely to manifest with non-amnestic (such as dysexecutive function features) in the prodromal phase or neurological features (such as seizures and paralysis) especially in ADAD. The very large variety of mutations associated with ADAD explains the wider range of phenotypes. In the LOAD, age-associated comorbidities explain many of the phenotypic differences.
