34745696|t|Acquired Brain Injury in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: Special Considerations for Delirium Protocols.
34745696|a|The goal of this article was to highlight the overlapping nature of symptoms of delirium and acquired brain injury (ABI) in children and similarities and differences in treatment, with a focus on literature supporting an adverse effect of antipsychotic medications on recovery from brain injury. An interdisciplinary approach to education regarding overlap between symptoms of delirium and ABI is important for pediatric intensive care settings, particularly at this time when standardized procedures for delirium screening and management are being increasingly employed. Development of treatment protocols specific to children with ABI that combine both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies will reduce the risk of reliance on treatment strategies that are less preferred and optimize care for this population.
