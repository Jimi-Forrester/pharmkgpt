32595786|t|Therapeutic Angiogenesis with Sound Waves.
32595786|a|Along with the progress of global aging, the prognosis of severe ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains poor, and thus the development of effective angiogenic therapy remains an important clinical unmet need. We have developed low-energy extracorporeal cardiac shock wave therapy as an innovative minimally invasive angiogenic therapy and confirmed its efficacy in a porcine chronic myocardial ischemia model in animal experiments as well as in patients with refractory angina. Since ultrasound is more advantageous for clinical application than shock waves, we then aimed to develop ultrasound therapy for IHD. We demonstrated that specific conditions of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy improve myocardial ischemia in animal models through the enhancement of angiogenesis mediated by endothelial mechanotransduction. To examine the effectiveness of our LIPUS therapy in patients with severe angina pectoris, we are now conducting a prospective multicenter clinical trial in Japan. Furthermore, to overcome the current serious situation of dementia pandemic but with no effective treatments worldwide, we have recently demonstrated that our LIPUS therapy also improves cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Here, we summarize the progress in our studies to develop angiogenic therapies with sound waves.
