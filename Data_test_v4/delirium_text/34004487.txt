34004487|t|Improving Pediatric Delirium Assessment Documentation and Implementation of a Nonpharmacologic Delirium Management Bundle in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit.
34004487|a|BACKGROUND: Pediatric delirium is common, associated with negative patient outcomes, and infrequently assessed in the ICU. Locally, pediatric delirium assessments in the cardiac PICU were infrequently documented resulting in an initiative to increase assessment documentation and implement a nurse-driven management protocol, the Bundle to Eliminate Delirium (BED). METHODS: This was a nurse-driven, quality improvement project in an eleven-bed cardiac PICU at a large academic health care facility. A pre- and postimplementation survey evaluating delirium management perceptions, knowledge, and assessment barriers was emailed to 113 nurses. Nurses received education about general delirium principles and assessment followed by weekly emails that included delirium assessment documentation rates and targeted education. Subsequently, BED education was provided via email followed by BED implementation, inclusion of BED completion rates in weekly emails, and observational audits of BED implementation. FINDINGS: 1522 delirium assessment opportunities were evaluated. Assessment documentation increased by 33%. Nurses reported greater confidence in their ability to manage delirium (P < .05 for numerous aspects of delirium care) and were less likely to report 'positive delirium assessments not acted upon' as a barrier to delirium assessment. BED implementation was inconsistent. DISCUSSION: Nursing education and feedback can increase delirium assessment rates and confidence in management but the impact of BED on these outcomes is not clear. APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Improvement in pediatric delirium care may be obtained through a nurse-driven quality improvement project but an interprofessional approach is needed for optimal management. More studies are needed to identify effective pediatric delirium management strategies such as the BED.
