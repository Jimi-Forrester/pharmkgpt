38677558|a|In clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD), hydromethylthionine mesylate (HMTM) showed reduced efficacy when administered as an add-on to symptomatic treatments, while it produced a significant improvement of cognitive function when taken as monotherapy. Interference of cholinesterase inhibition with HMTM was observed also in a tau transgenic mouse model, where rivastigmine reduced the pharmacological activity of HMTM at multiple brain levels including hippocampal acetylcholine release, synaptosomal glutamate release and mitochondrial activity. Here, we examined the effect of HMTM, given alone or in combination with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, at the level of expression of selected pre-synaptic proteins (syntaxin-1; SNAP-25, VAMP-2, synaptophysin-1, synapsin-1, alpha-synuclein) in brain tissue harvested from tau-transgenic Line 1 (L1) and wild-type mice using immunohistochemistry. L1 mice overexpress the tau-core unit that induces tau aggregation and results in an AD-like phenotype. Synaptic proteins were lower in hippocampus and cortex but greater in basal forebrain regions in L1 compared to wild-type mice. HMTM partially normalised the expression pattern of several of these proteins in basal forebrain. This effect was diminished when HMTM was administered in combination with rivastigmine, where mean protein expression seemed supressed. This was further confirmed by group-based correlation network analyses where important levels of co-expression correlations in basal forebrain regions were lost in L1 mice and partially re-established when HMTM was given alone but not in combination with rivastigmine. These data indicate a reduction in pharmacological activity of HMTM when given as an add-on therapy, a result that is consistent with the responses observed in the clinic. Attenuation of the therapeutic effects of HMTM by cholinergic treatments may have important implications for other potential AD therapies.
