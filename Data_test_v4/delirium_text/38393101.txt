38393101|t|Prevalence, Infection, and Risk to Human Beings of Toxocara canis in Domestic Food-Producing Animals.
38393101|a|Toxocariasis is a significant food-borne zoonotic parasitic disease, and a range of birds and mammals are the paratenic hosts of Toxocara canis. The consumption of raw or undercooked meat and viscera of these paratenic hosts frequently leads to T. canis infection and the development of human toxocariasis. In this review, we will perform an analysis of relevant papers published in the National Center for Biotechnology Infrastructure database on the parasitism, migration, and infection of T. canis in chickens, pigeons, quail, pigs, cattle, sheep, and other food-producing animals, so as to make the public aware of the risk factors of human toxocariasis, improve the public's understanding of T. canis infection, and provide evidence for targeted prevention and control measures.
