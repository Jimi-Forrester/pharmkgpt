37786420|t|Research advances in the clinical application of esketamine.
37786420|a|Esketamine is dextrorotatory ketamine, which is an enantiomer of ketamine. Compared with ketamine, it has the advantages of a fast metabolism, fewer side effects, and strong pharmacological effects, so it is more suitable for clinical use. Esketamine has a powerful analgesic effect and has little effect on breathing. It has a wide range of applications in the fields of pediatric anesthesia, conscious sedation anesthesia, and emergency analgesia. In addition, it is also used for pain that is difficult to relieve with conventional drugs and to prevent postoperative pain. Various routes of administration are also suitable for patients who need short-term analgesia and sedation. As a drug, esketamine inevitably brings some side effects when it is used clinically. In this article, by introducing the mechanism of action and pharmacological characteristics of esketamine, its clinical application is reviewed, and it provides a reference for the more reasonable and safe clinical application of esketamine.
