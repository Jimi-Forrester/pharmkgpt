28808946|t|Perioperative Care of Elderly Surgical Outpatients.
28808946|a|The ambulatory setting offers potential advantages for elderly patients undergoing elective surgery due to the advancement in both surgical and anesthetic techniques resulting in quicker recovery times, fewer complications, higher patient satisfaction, and reduced costs of care. This review article aims to provide a practical guide to anesthetic management of elderly outpatients. Important considerations in the preoperative evaluation of elderly outpatients with co-existing diseases, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different anesthetic techniques on a procedural-specific basis, and recommendations regarding the management of common postoperative complications (e.g., pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting [PONV], delirium and cognitive dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysfunction) are discussed. The role of anesthesiologists as perioperative physicians is important for optimizing surgical outcomes for elderly patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. The implementation of high-quality, evidence-based perioperative care programs for the elderly on an ambulatory basis has assumed increased importance. Optimal management of perioperative pain using opioid-sparing multimodal analgesic techniques and preventing PONV using prophylactic antiemetics are key elements for achieving enhanced recovery after surgery.
