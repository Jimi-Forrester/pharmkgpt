33672828|t|Ambulatory Human Gait Phase Detection Using Wearable Inertial Sensors and Hidden Markov Model.
33672828|a|Gait analysis, as a common inspection method for human gait, can provide a series of kinematics, dynamics and other parameters through instrumental measurement. In recent years, gait analysis has been gradually applied to the diagnosis of diseases, the evaluation of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation progress, especially, gait phase abnormality can be used as a clinical diagnostic indicator of Alzheimer Disease and Parkinson Disease, which usually show varying degrees of gait phase abnormality. This research proposed an inertial sensor based gait analysis method. Smoothed and filtered angular velocity signal was chosen as the input data of the 15-dimensional temporal characteristic feature. Hidden Markov Model and parameter adaptive model are used to segment gait phases. Experimental results show that the proposed model based on HMM and parameter adaptation achieves good recognition rate in gait phases segmentation compared to other classification models, and the recognition results of gait phase are consistent with ground truth. The proposed wearable device used for data collection can be embedded on the shoe, which can not only collect patients' gait data stably and reliably, ensuring the integrity and objectivity of gait data, but also collect data in daily scene and ambulatory outdoor environment.
