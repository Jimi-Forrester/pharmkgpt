METHODS: This study measured the serum S100B, NSE, tau, active caspase 3, M30, and M65 levels in 43 patients with ASD (aged 3-12 years) and in 41 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. ASD severity was rated using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. The serum levels were determined in the biochemistry laboratory using the ELISA technique. The receiver operator characteristics curve method was employed to evaluate the accuracy of the parameters in diagnosing ASD. RESULTS: Serum S100B, tau, NSE, active caspase-3, M30, and M65 levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.002, p = 0.005, p < 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). The cut-off value of S100B was 48.085 pg/ml (sensitivity: 74.4%, specificity: 80.5%, areas under the curve: 0.879, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Apoptosis increased in children with ASD, and neuronal, axonal, and glial cell injury was observed. In addition, S100B may be an important diagnostic biomarker in patients with ASD. Apoptosis, and neuronal, axonal and astrocyte pathologies may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ASD, and further studies are now required to confirm this.
