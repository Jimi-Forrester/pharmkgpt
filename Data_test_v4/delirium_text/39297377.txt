39297377|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive deterioration of the nervous system. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD) are prominently life-threatening examples of neurodegenerative diseases. The complexity of the pathophysiology in neurodegenerative diseases causes difficulties in diagnosing. Although the drugs temporarily help to correct specific symptoms including memory loss and degeneration, a complete treatment has not been found yet. New therapeutic approaches have been developed to understand and treat the underlying pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. With this purpose, clustered-regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) technology has recently suggested a new treatment option. Editing of the genome is carried out by insertion and deletion processes on DNA. Safe delivery of the CRISPR/Cas system to the targeted cells without affecting surrounding cells is frequently investigated. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), that is exosomes, have recently been used in CRISPR/Cas studies. In this review, CRISPR/Cas and EV approaches used for diagnosis and/or treatment in AD, PD, ALS, and HD are reviewed. CRISPR/Cas and EV technologies, which stand out as new therapeutic approaches, may offer a definitive treatment option in neurodegenerative diseases.
