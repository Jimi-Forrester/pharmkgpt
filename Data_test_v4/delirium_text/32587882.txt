32587882|a|INTRODUCTION: Understanding relationships among blood pressure (BP), cognition, and brain volume could inform Alzheimer's disease (AD) management. METHODS: We investigated Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants: 200 controls, 346 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 154 AD. National Alzheimer's Co-ordinating Center (NACC) participants were separately analyzed: 1098 controls, 2297 MCI, and 4845 AD. Relationships between cognition and BP were assessed in both cohorts and BP and atrophy rates in ADNI. Multivariate mixed linear-regression models were fitted with joint outcomes of BP (systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination, Logical Memory, and Digit Symbol) and atrophy rate (whole-brain, hippocampus). RESULTS: ADNI MCI and AD patients with greater baseline systolic BP had higher hippocampal atrophy rates ([r, P value]; 0.2, 0.005 and 0.2, 0.04, respectively). NACC AD patients with lower systolic BP had lower cognitive scores (0.1, 0.0003). DISCUSSION: Higher late-life BP may be associated with faster decline in cognitively impaired elders.
