36552705|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia with cognitive impairment. Various plant-derived phenolics are known to alleviate cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease by radical scavenging and strengthening synaptic plasticity activities. Here, we examined the cognition-improving effect of Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. bark extract (PBE). We identified and quantified phenolics in the PBE using a UHPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. To evaluate the cognition-enhancing effects of PBE, scopolamine-induced amnesic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (5 weeks old) and ion channel antagonist-induced organotypic hippocampal slices of SD rats (7 days old) were used. Twenty-three phenolics were tentatively identified in PBE, 10 of which were quantified. Oral administration of PBE to the scopolamine-induced SD rats improved cognitive impairment in behavioral tests. PBE-fed SD rats showed significantly improved antioxidant indices (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and malondialdehyde content) and reduced acetylcholinesterase activity in hippocampal lysate compared with the scopolamine group. PBE increased the long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and rescued LTP from blockades by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (scopolamine) and N-methyl-D-aspartate channel antagonist (2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) in the organotypic hippocampal slices. These results suggest that polyphenol-rich PBE is applicable as a cognition-improving agent due to its antioxidant properties and enhancement of LTP induction.
