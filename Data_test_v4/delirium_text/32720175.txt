32720175|a|BACKGROUND: Inpatient hospital units vary in staffing ratios, monitoring, procedural abilities, and experience with unique patients and diagnoses. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of patient cohorting upon ventral hernia repair outcomes. METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective review of open ventral hernia repairs between August 2013 and July 2017 was performed. The information of all patient locations during hospitalization, time at location, post-anesthesia care unit duration (PACU), and intensive care unit (ICU) duration was collected. Patient demographics, comorbidities, operative details, cost, and patient outcomes were analyzed. Multivariable analysis of log length of stay (LOS) was assessed with adjustment for clinical and operative factors. RESULTS: 235 patients underwent open ventral hernia repair. 179 patients were admitted to surgical units, 33 non-surgical units, and 23 stayed on both units. Clinical characteristics including patient age, gender, BMI, and medical comorbidities were similar between patients boarded on surgical versus non-surgical units. Hernia, wound, and operative data were also statistically similar. Patients admitted to non-surgical units for any duration experienced longer hospital stay (4 vs. 6 days, p < 0.001). Patients housed on a non-surgical unit were more likely to transfer rooms than patients on surgical units, 42.9% vs. 10.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariable analysis of natural log-transformed LOS showed any stay on a non-surgical unit increased LOS by 1.0 days (95% Cl 0.9-1.2 days, p = 0.026). There were no differences in ICU or PACU stay, cost, or postoperative complications in patients housed on surgical versus non-surgical units. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative surgical patients had an increased length of stay when admitted to non-surgical units. More frequent room transfers occurred in patients admitted to non-surgical units. Evaluation of patient outcomes and LOS in open ventral hernia repair patients based on hospital unit is unique to this study.
