24954898|a|PURPOSE: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is an informative physiological marker for tissue health. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive MRI method of measuring this parameter, but it has proven difficult to measure white matter (WM) CBF due to low intrinsic contrast-to-noise ratio compared with gray matter (GM). Here we combine ultra-high field and optimal sampling strategy (OSS) ASL to investigate WM CBF in reasonable scan times. METHODS: A FAIR-based ASL sequence at 7T was combined with a real-time-feedback OSS technique, to iteratively improve post-label image acquisition times (TIs) on a tissue- and subject-specific basis to obtain WM CBF quantification. RESULTS: It was found 77% of WM voxels gave a reasonable CBF fit. Averaged WM CBF for these voxels was found to be 16.3 +- 1.5 mL/100 g/min (discarding partial-volumed voxels). The generated TI schedule was also significantly different when altering the OSS weighted-tissue-mask, favoring longer TIs in WM. CONCLUSION: WM CBF could be reasonably quantified in over 75% of identified voxels, from a total preparation and scan time of 15 min. OSS results suggest longer TIs should be used versus general GM ASL settings; this may become more important in WM disease studies.
