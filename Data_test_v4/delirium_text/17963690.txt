17963690|t|Single particle detection of Abeta aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease.
17963690|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Today, AD can be diagnosed with certainty only post-mortem, by histopathologic staining of Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue sections. We have developed an ultra-sensitive assay potentially suitable for early and non-invasive diagnosis of AD. This highly specific and sensitive assay uses fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and is sensitive enough to detect even single aggregates in body fluids of AD patients. First results show a clear distinction between AD diseased people and non-demented controls by analysing cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) by confocal scanning of surface captured Abeta aggregates and subsequent two-dimensional fluorescence intensity distribution analysis.
