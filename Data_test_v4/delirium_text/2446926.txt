2446926|t|Isolation of cDNAs coding for epitopes shared by microtubule-associated proteins and neurofibrillary tangle in Alzheimer's disease.
2446926|a|5 cross-hybridizing cDNA clones of sizes 2.2 (3 cDNAs), 1.3 and 0.8 kb corresponding to tau microtubule-associated protein have been isolated from a rat brain lambda gt11 expression library. Antibodies affinity-purified using the fusion protein encoded by the cDNAs were observed to label tau polypeptides on Western blots and Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles.
