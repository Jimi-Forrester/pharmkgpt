15389757|a|Several lines of evidence indicate an involvement of the dopaminergic system in alcoholism, withdrawal, suicidality, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The functionally relevant -141C Ins/Del polymorphism located upstream to exon 1 in the 5'-region of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene might be an interesting candidate gene. We investigated a sample of 1,126 well-characterized, primary chronic alcoholics of German descent according to a phenotype-genotype strategy, i.e., alcoholics suffering from severe withdrawal complications such as seizure or delirium, family history positive (FH+) alcoholics, alcoholics with an antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), alcoholics with an ADHD, and type 1 or type 2 alcoholics according to Cloninger's typology. Compared to the control subjects, there was a significant excess of the -141C Del allele in alcoholics with a paternal and grandpaternal history of alcoholism and in alcoholic subgroups with suicidality or without a history of withdrawal symptoms. There were no significant differences in allele frequency between the entire group or subgroups of alcoholics and healthy controls. Therefore, the -141C Del variant of the DRD2 might be a protective factor against the development of withdrawal symptoms. However, it might also be a risk factor in a highly burdened subgroup of alcoholics with a paternal and grandpaternal history of alcoholism and it might contribute to the substantially higher likelihood of suicide in alcoholics.
