38921449|t|Is Lipid Metabolism of Value in Cancer Research and Treatment? Part II: Role of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators in Inflammation, Infections, and Cancer.
38921449|a|Acute inflammation is the body's first defense in response to pathogens or injury that is partially governed by a novel genus of endogenous lipid mediators that orchestrate the resolution of inflammation, coined specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). SPMs, derived from omega-3-polyunstaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), include the eicosapentaenoic acid-derived and docosahexaenoic acid-derived Resolvins, Protectins, and Maresins. Herein, we review their biosynthesis, structural characteristics, and therapeutic effectiveness in various diseases such as ischemia, viral infections, periodontitis, neuroinflammatory diseases, cystic fibrosis, lung inflammation, herpes virus, and cancer, especially focusing on therapeutic effectiveness in respiratory inflammation and ischemia-related injuries. Resolvins are sub-nanomolar potent agonists that accelerate the resolution of inflammation by reducing excessive neutrophil infiltration, stimulating macrophage functions including phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and tissue repair. In addition to regulating neutrophils and macrophages, Resolvins control dendritic cell migration and T cell responses, and they also reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines, proliferation, and metastasis of cancer cells. Importantly, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that Resolvins reduce tumor progression in melanoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and liver cancer. In addition, Resolvins enhance tumor cell debris clearance by macrophages in the tumor's microenvironment. Resolvins, with their unique stereochemical structure, receptors, and biosynthetic pathways, provide a novel therapeutical approach to activating resolution mechanisms during cancer progression.
