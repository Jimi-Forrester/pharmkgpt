17878737|a|BACKGROUND: Studies on dementia subtypes show a wide variation in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) worldwide. However, studies reporting on Lewy body dementia (LBD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are sparse. AIMS: To describe the prevalence of dementia and subtypes. METHOD: A 34% sample of 5,150 subjects aged 70 years and over in El Prat de Llobregat (Barcelona) were screened by the Mini-Mental State Examination. When scoring <24, participants were assessed to establish a diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 165 subjects diagnosed with dementia (prevalence of 9.4%). Subtypes of dementia were: AD 69.1%, VD 12.7%, LBD 9.1%, FTD 3% and secondary dementia 1.8%. Prevalences were: AD 6.5%, VD 1.2%, LBD 0.9% and FTD 0.3%. CONCLUSIONS: AD and VD were the most common type of dementia. Prevalence of dementia, AD and FTD were similar to those reported, while prevalence of VD and LBD were lower.
