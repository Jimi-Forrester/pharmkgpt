28115709|a|Neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) are major drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are formed by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (BACE) and gamma-secretase. Our previous study showed that the anticancer drug Gleevec lowers Abeta levels through indirect inhibition of gamma-secretase activity. Here we report that Gleevec also achieves its Abeta-lowering effects through an additional cellular mechanism. It renders APP less susceptible to proteolysis by BACE without inhibiting BACE enzymatic activity or the processing of other BACE substrates. This effect closely mimics the phenotype of APP A673T, a recently discovered mutation that protects carriers against AD and age-related cognitive decline. In addition, Gleevec induces formation of a specific set of APP C-terminal fragments, also observed in cells expressing the APP protective mutation and in cells exposed to a conventional BACE inhibitor. These Gleevec phenotypes require an intracellular acidic pH and are independent of tyrosine kinase inhibition, given that a related compound lacking tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, DV2-103, exerts similar effects on APP metabolism. In addition, DV2-103 accumulates at high concentrations in the rodent brain, where it rapidly lowers Abeta levels. This study suggests that long-term treatment with drugs that indirectly modulate BACE processing of APP but spare other BACE substrates and achieve therapeutic concentrations in the brain might be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of AD and could be safer than nonselective BACE inhibitor drugs.
