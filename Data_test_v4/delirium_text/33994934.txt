33994934|t|MicroRNA Dysregulation in Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative Review.
33994934|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disease, affecting the motor system, leading to resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, walking and gait difficulties, and postural instability. The severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta causes striatal dopamine deficiency and the presence of Lewy bodies indicates a pathological hallmark of PD. Although the current treatment of PD aims to preserve dopaminergic neurons or to replace dopamine depletion in the brain, it is notable that complete recovery from the disease is yet to be achieved. Given the complexity and multisystem effects of PD, the underlying mechanisms of PD pathogenesis are yet to be elucidated. The advancement of medical technologies has given some insights in understanding the mechanism and potential treatment of PD with a special interest in the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) to unravel the pathophysiology of PD. In PD patients, it was found that striatal brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra demonstrated dysregulated miRNAs expression profiles. Hence, dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD through modulation of PD-associated gene and protein expression. This review will discuss recent findings on PD-associated miRNAs dysregulation, from the regulation of PD-associated genes, dopaminergic neuron survival, alpha-synuclein-induced inflammation and circulating miRNAs. The next section of this review also provides an update on the potential uses of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic tools for PD.
