36660897|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and dementia cause heavy health burden in mainland China, where few studies have investigated the association between glucose-lowering agents and dementia risk. We aimed to assess the association between use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and dementia incidence in a mainland Chinese population with T2DM. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of T2DM patients who were new users of TZDs or alpha glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) was assembled using the Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database. A Cox model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for controlling potential founding was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of the association between use of TZDs and dementia risk. RESULTS: A total of 49 823 new users of AGIs and 12 752 new users of TZDs were included in the final cohort. In the primary analysis, the incidence of dementia was 195.7 and 78.2 per 100 000 person-years in users of AGIs and TZDs respectively. TZD use was associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia after adjusting for potential confounding using IPTW, with a HR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.38-0.67). The results in various subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the findings of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Use of TZDs is associated with a decreased risk of dementia incidence in a mainland Chinese population with T2DM.
