37667408|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma biomarkers have emerged as promising screening tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of their potential to detect amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain. One such candidate is the plasma Abeta42/40 ratio (Abeta42/40). Unlike previous research that used traditional immunoassay, recent studies that measured plasma Abeta42/40 using fully automated platforms reported promising results. However, its utility should be confirmed using a broader patient population, focusing on the potential for early detection. METHODS: We recruited 174 participants, including healthy controls (HC) and patients with clinical diagnoses of AD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and others, from a university memory clinic. We examined the performance of plasma Abeta42/40, measured using the fully automated high-sensitivity chemiluminescence enzyme (HISCL) immunoassay, in detecting amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET)-derived Abeta pathology. We also compared its performance with that of Simoa-based plasma phosphorylated tau at residue 181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL). RESULTS: Using the best cut-off derived from the Youden Index, plasma Abeta42/40 yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.949 in distinguishing visually assessed 18F-Florbetaben amyloid PET positivity. The plasma Abeta42/40 had a significantly superior AUC than p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL in the 167 participants with measurements for all four biomarkers. Next, we analyzed 99 participants, including only the HC and those with MCI, and discovered that plasma Abeta42/40 outperformed the other plasma biomarkers, suggesting its ability to detect early amyloid accumulation. Using the Centiloid scale (CL), Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between plasma Abeta42/40 and CL was -0.767. Among the 15 participants falling within the CL values indicative of potential future amyloid accumulation (CL between 13.5 and 35.7), plasma Abeta42/40 categorized 61.5% (8/13) as Abeta-positive, whereas visual assessment of amyloid PET identified 20% (3/15) as positive. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta42/40 measured using the fully automated HISCL platform showed excellent performance in identifying Abeta accumulation in the brain in a well-characterized cohort. This equipment may be useful for screening amyloid pathology because it has the potential to detect early amyloid pathology and is readily applied in clinical settings.
