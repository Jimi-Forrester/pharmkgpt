34768733|t|The Spatiotemporal Coupling: Regional Energy Failure and Aberrant Proteins in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
34768733|a|The spatial and temporal coordination of each element is a pivotal characteristic of systems, and the central nervous system (CNS) is not an exception. Glial elements and the vascular interface have been considered more recently, together with the extracellular matrix and the immune system. However, the knowledge of the single-element configuration is not sufficient to predict physiological or pathological long-lasting changes. Ionic currents, complex molecular cascades, genomic rearrangement, and the regional energy demand can be different even in neighboring cells of the same phenotype, and their differential expression could explain the region-specific progression of the most studied neurodegenerative diseases. We here reviewed the main nodes and edges of the system, which could be studied to develop a comprehensive knowledge of CNS plasticity from the neurovascular unit to the synaptic cleft. The future goal is to redefine the modeling of synaptic plasticity and achieve a better understanding of neurological diseases, pointing out cellular, subcellular, and molecular components that couple in specific neuroanatomical and functional regions.
