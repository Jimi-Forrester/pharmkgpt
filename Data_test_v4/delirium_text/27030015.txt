27030015|t|pH Induced Conformational Transitions in the Transforming Growth Factor beta-Induced Protein (TGFbetaIp) Associated Corneal Dystrophy Mutants.
27030015|a|Most stromal corneal dystrophies are associated with aggregation and deposition of the mutated transforming growth factor-beta induced protein (TGFbetaIp). The 4(th)_FAS1 domain of TGFbetaIp harbors ~80% of the mutations that forms amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic aggregates. To understand the mechanism of aggregation and the differences between the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic phenotypes, we expressed the 4(th)_FAS1 domains of TGFbetaIp carrying the mutations R555W (non-amyloidogenic) and H572R (amyloidogenic) along with the wild-type (WT). R555W was more susceptible to acidic pH compared to H572R and displayed varying chemical stabilities with decreasing pH. Thermal denaturation studies at acidic pH showed that while WT did not undergo any conformational transition, the mutants exhibited a clear pH-dependent irreversible conversion from alphabeta conformation to beta-sheet oligomers. The beta-oligomers of both mutants were stable at physiological temperature and pH. Electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering studies showed that beta-oligomers of H572R were larger compared to R555W. The beta-oligomers of both mutants were cytotoxic to primary human corneal stromal fibroblast (pHCSF) cells. The beta-oligomers of both mutants exhibit variations in their morphologies, sizes, thermal and chemical stabilities, aggregation patterns and cytotoxicities.
