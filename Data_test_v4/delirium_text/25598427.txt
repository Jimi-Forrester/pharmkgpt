25598427|t|Sex moderates the effects of the Sorl1 gene rs2070045 polymorphism on cognitive impairment and disruption of the cingulum integrity in healthy elderly.
25598427|a|The SORL1 rs2070045 polymorphism was reported to be associated with SorLA expression in the brain and the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the influence of this polymorphism on cognitive functioning is likely to be moderated by sex. This study aimed to examine the sex moderation on the effects of rs2070045 on neuropsychological performance and the cingulum integrity in Chinese Han population. In this study, 780 non-demented older adults completed a battery of neuropsychological scales. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) of 126 subjects were acquired. We adopted the atlas-based segmentation strategy for calculating the DTI indices of the bilateral cingulum and cingulum hippocampal part for each subject. We used a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to compare the cognitive performance and DTI differences between the rs2070045 genotype. Controlling for age, education, and the APOE e4 status, the influence of sex on the effects of the rs2070045 polymorphism on executive function was observed. We also found an interaction between sex and the rs2070045 polymorphism on the white matter (WM) microstructure of the left cingulum hippocampal part. Furthermore, the mean diffusivity and axial diffusivity of the tract were associated with Trail Making Test performance in T/T men. These results hint that sex moderates the association between the rs2070045 polymorphism and executive function, as well as the WM integrity of the left cingulum hippocampal part. Our findings underscore the importance of considering the influence of sex when examining the candidate genes for cognitive abilities and AD.
