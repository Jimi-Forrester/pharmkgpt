36147063|a|Background: and Importance: Steroids induced psychosis is one of major adverse effects of corticosteroids therapy especially in patients with disease causing low serum albumin level like nephrotic syndrome. The literature review about this adverse effects is lesser in children than adults population. The management is done by tapering dose of steroids in aid of immunosuppressive drug with an antipsychotics drug. Case presentation: Here we present a case of 14 years old female child known case of nephrotic syndrome secondary to Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with steroids induced psychosis who is managed by tapering dose of prednisolone with Tacrolimus as immunosuppressive and Quetiapine as antipsychotic. Conclusion: The prevalence of steroids induced psychosis is higher in our locality which is still unreported due to lack of detailed history and proper diagnosis and it is manageable if early diagnosis and treatment is initiated. Thus, proper counselling to parents about the adverse effect of steroids therapy and timely follow up will prevent Nepalese children from this illness.
