39559877|t|Examining the Role of Community Engagement in Enhancing the Participation of Racial and Ethnic Minoritized Communities in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials; A Rapid Review.
39559877|a|BACKGROUND: Despite higher dementia prevalence in racial and ethnic minoritized communities, they are underrepresented in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Community-based recruitment strategies are believed to yield positive outcomes in various fields, such as cancer and cardiovascular clinical trials, but their outcomes in Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) require further study. In this systematic rapid review, we synthesized the available evidence on community-engaged recruitment strategies in enhancing participation in AD/ADRD clinical trials and observational study participation. METHODS: We searched and identified studies describing a community-based recruitment approach for racial and ethnic minoritized communities across seven databases (Pubmed, OVID MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and EMBASE). RESULTS: Out of 1915 screened studies, 49 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies employed multiple community-based recruitment approaches, including educational presentations, collaborations with community-based faith organizations, community advisory boards, and engagement with local clinics or health professionals. 52% of studies targeted more than one racial and ethnic minoritized population, primarily African Americans and then Hispanic/Latino. Gaps in knowledge about AD/ADRD, its increased risk among minoritized populations, distrust, and stigma were noted as barriers to research participation. Approximately 50% of the studies specified whether they evaluated their recruitment approaches, and in studies where approaches were evaluated, there was substantial heterogeneity in methods utilized. CONCLUSION: The quality of available evidence on the use of community-based recruitment approaches to include racial and ethnic minoritized populations in AD/ADRD research, particularly in clinical trials, is limited. Systematic assessment of recruitment strategies is urgently needed to increase the evidence base around community-engaged recruitment approaches.
