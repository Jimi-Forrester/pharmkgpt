34041122|a|Neuropsychiatric manifestations like cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, stroke headache, seizures in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are quite common. However, psychosis as the sole presenting manifestation of SLE is rarely encountered clinically. If lupus is not kept as differential among patients with acute psychosis, delay in diagnosis and subsequent mismanagement are likely to happen. Here, we present a case of a young female presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and was further evaluated and diagnosed as a case of SLE. The patient was managed with immunosuppressive agents and carried an excellent outcome.
