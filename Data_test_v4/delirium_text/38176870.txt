38176870|t|Effectiveness of general anaesthesia with remimazolam tosilate on intraoperative haemodynamics and postoperative recovery: study protocol for a randomised, positive-controlled, pragmatic clinical trial (GARTH trial).
38176870|a|INTRODUCTION: It is encouraged to estimate the effectiveness of components within the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol through patient-reported outcomes, alongside doctor-reported outcomes and length of hospital stay. At present, studies on the contributions of optimal anaesthetic drugs within the ERAS protocol to patient-reported and doctor-reported outcomes are limited. Therefore, this study aims to pragmatically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of general anaesthesia (GA) with remimazolam tosilate within the ERAS protocol on intraoperative haemodynamics and postoperative recovery in adults undergoing elective surgeries, compared with propofol. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-centre, randomised, blinded, positive-controlled, pragmatic clinical trial. A total of 900 patients, aged >=18 years old, scheduled for an elective surgical procedure under GA will be included. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the remimazolam group (the GA with remimazolam tosilate within the ERAS protocol group) or propofol group (the GA with propofol within the ERAS protocol group), stratified by general surgery, thoracic surgery and other surgeries (including urological surgery and otolaryngology surgery). The primary outcomes include the 24-hour postoperative quality of recovery-40 score and the rate of intraoperative hypotension. Secondary endpoints include the rate of sedative hypotension requiring treatment, the haemodynamic profiles, the 72-hour postoperative quality of recovery-40 score, the functional anaesthetic capability, adverse events and complications, quality of life within 3 months as well as economic health outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (KY-H-2022-005-03-08). Dissemination plans will be presented at scientific meetings and in scientific publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200062520.
