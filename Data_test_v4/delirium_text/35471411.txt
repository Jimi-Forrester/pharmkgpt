35471411|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, which is considered as the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Recently, it is suggested that impaired cerebrovascular function may precede the onset of AD. Claudin-5, which is the most enriched tight junction protein, has been reported to prevent the passage of damaging material at the blood-brain barrier. However, whether claudin-5 impacts AD has no direct evidence. We found a decrease level of claudin-5 in the hippocampus of AD and elder mice. And intravenous injection of claudin-5 improved learning and memory ability in these mice, while knockout of the protein led to impaired learning and memory and long-term potentiation in adult control mice. Furthermore, the effects of claudin-5 are mediated by suppressing inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. Our results suggest benefit effects of claudin-5 on learning and memory, which may provide a new treatment strategy for AD.
