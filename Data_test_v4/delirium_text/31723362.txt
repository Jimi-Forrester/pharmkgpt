31723362|a|PURPOSE: F-18 florapronol (FPN) is the commercially recognized beta-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer in Korea. This study compared the early F-18 florapronol PET with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET between healthy controls (HC) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients. METHODS: A total of 29 subjects (15 HC and 14 AD subjects) underwent F-18 FPN PET and F-18 FDG PET. F-18 FDG PET image was acquired from 30 to 60 min and F-18 FPN PET for 0 to 10 min. F-18 FPN and F-18 FDG images were spatially normalized with transformation matrices obtained from individual CT images and standardized uptake value ration (SUVR) from cerebellum area, and the global mean was calculated using PMOD 3.6. Pearson's correlation coefficients between F-18 FDG and early F-18 FPN for predefined cortical brain regions were calculated. RESULTS: We compared the F-18 FDG and F-18 FPN for SUVR of a specific region in global mean normalization and cerebellum normalization, and most of the correlation coefficient was higher in global mean normalization. In global mean normalization, the correlation coefficient for SUVR of HC was higher than that of AD in all brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: Early F-18 FPN study can be used as a proxy marker for the F-18 FDG PET.
