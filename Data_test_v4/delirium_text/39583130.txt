39583130|a|The disruption of glucose (Glu) metabolism in the human body can lead to conditions such as diabetes and hyperglycemia. Therefore, accurately determining Glu levels is crucial for clinical diagnosis and other applications. Carbon dots (CDs) are a novel category of carbon nanomaterials that exhibit outstanding optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, high water solubility, low production costs, and straightforward synthesis. Recently, researchers have developed various carbon dot sensors for fast and real-time Glu monitoring. In this context, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Glu and CDs for the first time. We categorize the synthetic methods for CDs and the sensing mechanisms, further classifying the applications of carbon dot probes into single-probe sensing, ratiometric sensing, and visual detection. Finally, we discuss the future development needs for CD-based Glu sensors. This review aims to offer insights into advancing Glu sensors and modern medical treatments.
