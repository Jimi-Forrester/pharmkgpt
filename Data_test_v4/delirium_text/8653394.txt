8653394|t|Category and attribute knowledge deterioration in Alzheimer's disease.
8653394|a|A prevalent theory regarding the deterioration of semantic memory in Alzheimer's disease is that it is a bottom-up process. If this is true, performance on tests of attribute knowledge should decline more rapidly than performance on tests of categorical knowledge as dementia severity increases. In the present study, a convincing pattern of findings to either support or reject the theory failed to emerge. This raised questions regarding the ability to separate attribute and categorical knowledge, and whether one can be tested without influence of the other. Questions also were raised regarding the additional cognitive processes needed to complete tasks of semantic memory.
