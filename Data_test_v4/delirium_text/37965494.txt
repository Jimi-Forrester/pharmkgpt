Methods: The microstructure of white matter in patients showing SCD in the preclinical phase of AD (SCD of pre-AD) was evaluated using diffusion images, and voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivities were assessed and compared among participant groups. Significant clusters in the tracts were extracted to determine their associations with alterations in the cognitive domains. Results: We found that individuals with SCD of pre-AD may have subclinical episodic memory impairment associated with the global amyloid burden. Meanwhile, we found significantly reduced FA and lambda1 in the right cingulum (cingulate and hippocampus) in AD dementia, while significantly increased FA and decreased MD as well as lambda23 in the SCD of pre-AD group in comparison with the HC group. Discussion: In conclusion, increased white matter microstructural integrity in the right cingulum (cingulate and hippocampus) may indicate compensation for short-term episodic memory in individuals with SCD of pre-AD in comparison with individuals with AD and healthy elderly individuals.
