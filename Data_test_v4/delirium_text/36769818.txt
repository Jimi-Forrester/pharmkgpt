36769818|a|The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain is homeostatically controlled and contributes to normal neural functions. Inefficiency of control mechanisms in brain aging or pathological conditions leads to ROS overproduction with oxidative neural cell damage and degeneration. Among the compounds showing therapeutic potential against neuro-dysfunctions induced by oxidative stress are the guanine-based purines (GBPs), of which the most characterized are the nucleoside guanosine (GUO) and the nucleobase guanine (GUA), which act differently. Indeed, the administration of GUO to in vitro or in vivo models of acute brain injury (ischemia/hypoxia or trauma) or chronic neurological/neurodegenerative disorders, exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, decreasing the production of reactive radicals and improving mitochondrial function via multiple molecular signals. However, GUO administration to rodents also causes an amnesic effect. In contrast, the metabolite, GUA, could be effective in memory-related disorders by transiently increasing ROS production and stimulating the nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase/cGMP/protein kinase G cascade, which has long been recognized as beneficial for cognitive function. Thus, it is worth pursuing further studies to ascertain the therapeutic role of GUO and GUA and to evaluate the pathological brain conditions in which these compounds could be more usefully used.
