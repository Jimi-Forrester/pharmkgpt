38889331|t|Cordycepin Modulates Microglial M2 Polarization Coupled with Mitochondrial Metabolic Reprogramming by Targeting HKII and PDK2.
38889331|a|The microenvironment mediated by the microglia (MG) M1/M2 phenotypic switch plays a decisive role in the neuronal fate and cognitive function of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the impact of metabolic reprogramming on microglial polarization and its underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study reveals that cordycepin improved cognitive function and memory in APP/PS1 mice, as well as attenuated neuronal damage by triggering MG-M2 polarization and metabolic reprogramming characterized by increased OXPHOS and glycolysis, rather than directly protecting neurons. Simultaneously, cordycepin partially alleviates mitochondrial damage in microglia induced by inhibitors of OXPHOS and glycolysis, further promoting MG-M2 transformation and increasing neuronal survival. Through confirmation of cordycepin distribution in the microglial mitochondria via mitochondrial isolation followed by HPLC-MS/MS techniques, HKII and PDK2 are further identified as potential targets of cordycepin. By investigating the effects of HKII and PDK2 inhibitors, the mechanism through which cordycepin targeted HKII to elevate ECAR levels in the glycolysis pathway while targeting PDK2 to enhance OCR levels in PDH-mediated OXPHOS pathway, thereby inducing MG-M2 polarization, promoting neuronal survival and exerting an anti-AD role is elucidated.
