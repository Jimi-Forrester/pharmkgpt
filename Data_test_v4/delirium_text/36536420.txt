36536420|a|Brain tumors are one of the most mortal cancers, leading to many deaths among kids and adults. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are available options for brain tumor treatment. However, these methods are not able to eradicate cancer cells. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the most important barriers to treat brain tumors that prevents adequate drug delivery to brain tissue. The connection between different brain parts is heterogeneous and causes many challenges in treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) migrate to brain tumor cells and have anti-tumor effects by delivering cytotoxic compounds. They contain very high regenerative properties, as well as support the immune system. MSCs-based therapy involves cell replacement and releases various vesicles, including exosomes. Exosomes receive more attention due to their excellent stability, less immunogenicity and toxicity compare to cells. Exosomes derived from MSCs can develop a powerful therapeutic strategy for different diseases and be a hopeful candidate for cell-based and cell-free regenerative medicine. These nanoparticles contain nucleic acid, proteins, lipids, microRNAs, and other biologically active substances. Many studies show that each microRNA can prevent angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis in glioblastoma. These exosomes can-act as a suitable nanoparticle carrier for therapeutic applications of brain tumors by passing through the BBB. In this review, we discuss potential applications of MSC and their produced exosomes in the treatment of brain tumors.
