This review highlights the complexities surrounding the consumption of chemical substances in excess or for non-medical purposes, obtained through legal prescriptions, over-the-counter purchases, or illicit means, with an emphasis on the predictive role of stressors and individual-level variables in the development of substance use disorders, as well as the influence of the regulatory environment on patterns of consumption. Additionally, the alarming escalation in the mortality rate associated with illicit drug and opioid overdoses is also underscored. The recreational use of prescription medications can lead to significant health risks, particularly when combined with other substances; therefore, the need for interventions and preventive measures to address substance abuse among various populations is imperative. Furthermore, novel insights on substance abuse addiction, exploring the neurobiological mechanisms underlying addiction, and discussing treatment approaches and interventions are elucidated. Advancements in technology for detecting substance abuse are also highlighted, displaying innovative tools for more effective identification and monitoring. In conclusion, the complexities of medications, substance abuse, and the recreational use of plants reveal a landscape marked by overlapping motivations and health implications. The distinction between medical and recreational use is critical for understanding user behavior and addressing public health concerns.
