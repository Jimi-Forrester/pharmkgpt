39201762|t|Estrogen Receptors: A New Frontier in Alzheimer's Disease Therapy.
39201762|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term neurodegenerative condition that leads to the deterioration of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex, resulting in severe dementia. AD is significantly more prevalent in postmenopausal women, suggesting a neuroprotective role for estrogen. Estrogen is now known to regulate a wide array of physiological functions in the body by interacting with three known estrogen receptors (ERs) and with the beta-amyloid precursor protein, a key factor in AD pathogenesis. Recent experimental evidence indicates that new selective ER modulators and phytoestrogens may be promising treatments for AD for their neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties. These alternatives may offer fewer side effects compared to traditional hormone therapies, which are associated with risks such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic dysfunctions. This review sheds light on estrogen-based treatments that may help to partially prevent or control the neurodegenerative processes characteristic of AD, paving the way for further investigation in the development of estrogen-based treatments.
