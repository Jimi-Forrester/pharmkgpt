38845600|t|A retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes following hip fractures in Australian indigenous patients with non-Australian indigenous patients.
38845600|a|BACKGROUND: Australian Indigenous (AI) populations face significant socioeconomic disadvantage and have poorer health outcomes when compared to their non-AI counterparts. There is a paucity of published literature on outcomes following hip fracture in the AI population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes following hip fracture in AI and non- AI patients presenting to a single regional trauma centre. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes of interest were the odds of postoperative delirium and length of stay in hospital. All outcomes were adjusted against collected baseline covariates. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven hip fractures were identified across 125 patients. There were 62 hip fractures in the AI group and 65 in the non-AI group. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was not statistically significant when comparing Indigenous versus non-Indigenous patients (HR = 2.37, P = 0.055). Adjusted odds of postoperative delirium was lower in Indigenous patients (OR = 0.12; P = 0.018). The AI cohort had a 4 day longer median length of stay, which was not statistically significant when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSION: AI patients with hip fractures were younger, had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index Score and American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade, as well as a higher incidence of diabetes and associated end-organ sequalae. There was no difference in all-cause mortality. Odds of postoperative delirium was lower in the AI group. We did not find any difference in the length of hospital stay.
