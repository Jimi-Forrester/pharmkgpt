17004213|a|This article describes an experience of providing nursing care to an eighty year-old patient with urinary tract infection (UTI). The author cared for this patient in the role of clinical geriatric nurse specialist from May 11 to 23 in 2005. Through comprehensive assessment, careful review of medical records, contact with family and nursing home healthcare workers, it was determined that the patient's cognition and physical function declines were due to delirium resulting from the last time the patient had been hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). In order to prevent incidents of delirium, three nursing goals were set: controlling infection, avoidance of delirium recurrence, and recovery of prior levels of physical function and self-care ability. Nursing interventions used included UTI control, tube and catheter removal as early as possible, control of environmental factors, and muscle strength and exercise training. After two weeks of care, the patient could take food orally and the nasogastric (NG) tube had been successfully removed. Physical function and self-care ability improved from "dependent" to "partial assistance". Although UTI was controlled, removal of the foley tube failed due to prostate hypertrophy. No delirious event occurred during hospitalization and cognitive functions improved. From this experience, early assessment and intervention should be conducted for high-risk elderly patients in order to prevent delirious events and declines in cognitive and physical functions. The author hopes this case report will prove a useful reference to nurses charged with caring for elderly patients at risk for delirium.
