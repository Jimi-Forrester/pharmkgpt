32821449|t|Analysis of Anesthesia Administration in the Endoscopy Unit in Terms of Patient Profile and Complications: Retrospective Study.
32821449|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze patients undergoing endoscopic interventions in terms of comorbid diseases, preoperative anesthesia management predictions, intraoperative-postoperative complications and requirements for intensive care. METHOD: Records of patients who underwent procedures under anesthesia in the endoscopy unit were retrospectively screened. The patients' preoperative anesthesia evaluation, intraoperative anesthesia, and postoperative recovery data and intensive care monitoring requirements were recorded. The data obtained were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: It was identified that the preoperative risk prediction of patients was statistically significant for intraoperative and postoperative monitoring. Comorbid disease and high age were determined to increase the requirements for intensive care after the procedure. Increased need for qualified admission was determined in patients with desaturation and hypotension. CONCLUSION: A prerequisite for reliable administration of anesthesia is having detailed information about the patient and being prepared for possible complications. When examined from this aspect, analysis of the patient profile undergoing procedures in the endoscopy unit is important. In our study, we revealed the presence of elderly patients and comorbid disease(s) in the patient group who underwent procedures in this unit. The need for detailed preliminary evaluation of the patients undergoing these types of procedure and requirements for intensive care after the procedure, if necessary, should definitely be considered.
