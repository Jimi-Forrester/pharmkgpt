39000092|t|Prodromic Inflammatory-Oxidative Stress in Peritoneal Leukocytes of Triple-Transgenic Mice for Alzheimer's Disease.
39000092|a|Inflammatory-oxidative stress is known to be pivotal in the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the involvement of this stress at the peripheral level in the disease's onset has been scarcely studied. This study investigated the pro-inflammatory profile and oxidative stress parameters in peritoneal leukocytes from female triple-transgenic mice for AD (3xTgAD) and non-transgenic mice (NTg). Peritoneal leukocytes were obtained at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 15 months of age. The concentrations of TNFalpha, INFgamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-10 released in cultures without stimuli and mitogen concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide presence were measured. The concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), lipid peroxidation, and Hsp70 were also analyzed in the peritoneal cells. Our results showed that although there was a lower release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by 3xTgAD mice, this response was uncontrolled and overstimulated, especially at a prodromal stage at 2 months of age. In addition, there were lower concentrations of GSH in leukocytes from 3xTgAD and higher amounts of lipid peroxides at 2 and 4 months, as well as, at 6 months, a lower concentration of Hsp70. In conclusion, 3xTgAD mice show a worse pro-inflammatory response and higher oxidative stress than NTg mice during the prodromal stages, potentially supporting the idea that Alzheimer's disease could be a consequence of peripheral alteration in the leukocyte inflammation-oxidation state.
