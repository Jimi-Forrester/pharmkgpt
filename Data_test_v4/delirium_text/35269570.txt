35269570|t|Novel Insight into the Serum Sphingolipid Fingerprint Characterizing Longevity.
35269570|a|Sphingolipids (SLs) are structural components of the lipid bilayer regulating cell functions. In biological fluids, their distribution is sex-specific and is at variance in aging and many disorders. The aim of this study is to identify SL species associated with the decelerated aging of centenarians. SLs, extracted from serum of adults (Ad, 35-37 years old), aged (Ag, 75-77 years old) and centenarian (C, 105-107 years old) women were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in combination with mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SL biosynthetic enzymes. Results indicated in Ag and C vs. Ad a comparable ceramides (Cers) increase, whereas dihydroceramide (dhCer) decreased in C vs. Ad. Hexosylceramides (HexCer) species, specifically HexCer 16:0, 22:0 and 24:1 acyl chains, increased in C vs. Ag representing a specific trait of C. Sphingosine (Sph), dihydrosphingosine (dhSph), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P), increased both in Ag and C vs. Ad, with higher levels in Ag, indicating a SL fine-tuning associated with a reduced physiological decline in C. mRNA levels of enzymes involved in ceramide de novo biosynthesis increased in Ag whereas enzymes involved in sphingomyelin (SM) degradation increased in C. Collectively, results suggest that Ag produce Cers by de novo synthesis whereas C activate a protective mechanism degrading SMs to Cers converting it into glycosphingolipids.
