35347127|a|Disruption of mental functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders is accompanied by selective degeneration of brain regions. These regions comprise large-scale ensembles of cells organized into systems for mental functioning, however the relationship between clinical symptoms of dementia, patterns of neurodegeneration, and functional systems is not clear. Here we present a model of the association between dementia symptoms and degenerative brain anatomy using F18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and dimensionality reduction techniques in two cohorts of patients with AD. This reflected a simple information processing-based functional description of macroscale brain anatomy which we link to AD physiology, functional networks, and mental abilities. We further apply the model to normal aging and seven degenerative diseases of mental functions. We propose a global information processing model for mental functions that links neuroanatomy, cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology.
