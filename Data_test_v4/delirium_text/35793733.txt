35793733|t|Association of delirium screening on hospitalized adults and postacute care utilization: A retrospective cohort study.
35793733|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with delirium have increased hospital length of stay (LOS), morbidity and mortality. Impact of delirium on postacute care (PAC) utilization is not fully characterized. Impact of screening for delirium on general medicine patients is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess impact of screening for delirium on inpatient PAC utilization. METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study at an academic tertiary care center in Charleston, SC. Patients were selected from adults hospitalized from home and discharged alive between June 2014 and June 2018. The brief confusion assessment method (bCAM) screening was conducted and documented by nursing on admission and every shift thereafter. Outcome measure was the proportion of patients discharged to facility. RESULTS: Of 93,388 non-ICU adult admission between June 2014 and June 2018, 4.4% of those not screened for delirium were discharged to facility versus 15.0% in those screened and 41.4% in those screening positive. Multivariable regression analysis showed that patients screened for delirium were 2.3 times more likely to discharge to facility (95% CI (2.145, 2.429)) while those with a positive bCAM were 3.3 times more likely than those with a negative bCAM to discharge to facility (95% CI (2.949, 3.712)). CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for demographics, medication orders and comorbidities there was an association between screening for delirium, positive delirium screen and discharge to facility. An appreciation of where and why patients are discharged is imperative to optimize both patient care and cost utilization.
