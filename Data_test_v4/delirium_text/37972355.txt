37972355|a|Recently, some researchers claimed neuropathological changes lead to Alzheimer's-like brains after severe infection of SARS-CoV-2. Several mechanisms have been postulated on how SARS-CoV-2 neurological damage leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. Neurobiochemical changes during infection may significantly induce Alzheimer's disease in severely COVID-19 infected people. The immune system is also compromised while infected by this novel coronavirus. However, recent studies are insufficient to conclude the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19. This review demonstrates the possible pathways of neuropathological changes induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in AD patients or leading to AD in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this study delineates the challenges for COVID-19 infected AD patients and the mechanism of actions of natural compounds and alternative treatments to overcome those. Furthermore, animal studies and a large cohort of COVID-19 survivors who showed neuroinflammation and neurological changes may augment the research to discover the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19.
