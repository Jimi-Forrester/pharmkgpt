17408857|a|Accumulating evidence implicates a role for altered iron and copper metabolism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, imbalances in the levels of the various forms of iron at different stages of AD have not been examined. In this pilot study we extracted and measured the levels of loosely bound, non-heme and total iron and copper in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with mild-moderate AD (n=3), severe AD (n=8) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=6), using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Additionally, the expression of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) was examined in relation to the pathological hallmarks of AD and DLB, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and Lewy bodies, by immunohistochemistry. We found significantly decreased loosely bound iron in the hippocampal white matter of mild-moderate and severe AD patients and a trend towards increased non-heme iron in the hippocampal gray matter of severe AD patients. Furthermore, decreased levels of total copper were seen in severe AD and DLB frontal cortex compared to controls, suggesting an imbalance in brain metal levels in both AD and DLB. The decrease in loosely bound iron in mild-moderate AD patients may be associated with myelin breakdown seen in the beginning stages of AD and implicates that iron dysregulation is an early event in AD pathogenesis.
