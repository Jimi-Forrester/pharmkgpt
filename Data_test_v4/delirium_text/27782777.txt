27782777|t|Identification of novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitors through e-pharmacophore-based virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations.
27782777|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder is the most common cause of dementia among elderly people. To date, the successful therapeutic strategy to treat AD is maintaining the levels of acetylcholine via inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The present study involves identification of newer AChE inhibitors by dual approach of e-pharmacophore and structure-based virtual screening of Asinex library. Robustness of docking protocol was validated by enrichment calculation with ROC value .71 and BEDROC value .028. Among 11 selected hits, ZINC72338524 with best MM-GBSA dG binding shows optimal range of CNS properties and ligand-AChE complex stability. Further, molecular dynamics study revealed its molecular interactions with Trp86, Phe338, and Tyr341 amino acid residues of catalytic anionic site and Tyr124, Ser125, and Trp286 amino acid residues of peripheral anionic site. Physicochemical properties and ADMET risk prediction indicates their potential in druggability and safety.
