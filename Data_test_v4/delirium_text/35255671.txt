35255671|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery can elicit both physical and psychological responses. Prayer, exercise therapy, education, hypnosis, and music are expected to be able to overcome pain, anxiety, and immobilization in the cardiac surgery. This study was to create a smartphone-based peri-operative nursing intervention model that was able to reduce pain, anxiety, and increase early mobilization cardiac surgery patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study consisted of three stages. The first stage was research and development, the second was true experimental design, and the third was cross sectional design. The samples size was 86 respondents. The intervention models for the treatment group comprised of a smartphone-based therapy of prayer, education, exercise, hypnosis, and music. The control group was given standard hospital intervention according to the clinical pathway. RESULTS: The majority of respondents were adults, male, high school graduate in the treatment group and bachelor graduate in the control group, CABG type of surgery, and having pain history. The intervention had a significant effect on reducing pain scale and anxiety level as well as increasing early mobilization (p<0.05). The intervention had a direct effect on pain and anxiety, but it had no direct effect on early mobilization. However, it gave indirect effect on early mobilization that was mediated by anxiety. CONCLUSION: The models can be used by nurses to reduce pain, anxiety and to increase early mobilization on cardiac surgery patients.
