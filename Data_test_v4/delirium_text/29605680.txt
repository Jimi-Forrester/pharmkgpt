29605680|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium, a serious condition observed in critically ill patients, clinically presents with impaired cognition and consciousness. The relationship between delirium and peripheral levels of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is unclear. Thus we conducted a meta-analysis to address this issue. METHODS: Seven major electronic databases were searched from inception until October 2, 2017 to obtain relevant clinical variables to compare the difference in IGF-1 levels between delirious and non-delirious elderly in-patients. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: We studies 10 articles involving 294 delirious patients (mean age 73.0 years) and 604 non-delirious patients (mean age 76.9 years). We found that peripheral levels of IGF-1 in patients with delirium were significantly lower than in those without delirium (Hedges' g = -0.209, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.393 to -0.026, p = 0.025). Meta-regression analyses found that no variables such as percentage of cognitive impairment, mean age, and female proportion contribute to heterogeneity in terms of the entire population. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that lower peripheral levels of IGF-1 could be associated with a higher incidence of delirium among elderly patients. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to investigate the association between peripheral levels of IGF-1 and delirium.
