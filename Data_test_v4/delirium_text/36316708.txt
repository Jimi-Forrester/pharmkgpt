36316708|a|Tauopathies are a category of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of abnormal tau protein-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an Abeta-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n = 706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no Abeta plaques (average age of death of 83.1 yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p < 0.0001). When controlling for age, AI-derived NFT counts still significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment (p = 0.04 in the entorhinal cortex; p = 0.04 overall). In contrast, Braak stage did not predict cognitive impairment in either age-adjusted or unadjusted models. These findings support the hypothesis that NFT burden correlates with cognitive impairment in PART. Furthermore, our analysis strongly suggests that AI-derived metrics of tau pathology provide a powerful tool that can deepen our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in cognitive impairment.
