35289775|t|Perioperative Delta Sodium and Post-Liver Transplant Neurological Complications in Liver Transplant Recipients.
35289775|a|BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia before liver transplant (LT) increases risk of post-LT neurological complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, but it is unknown to what extent change in sodium from pre- to post-LT influences risk of central nervous system (CNS) sequelae. We assessed the relationship between pre- to post-LT delta sodium and prevalence of CNS complications during LT hospitalization. METHODS: We performed retrospective single-center chart review of 1265 adults with cirrhosis who underwent LT (2011-2020). Delta sodium is defined as the difference between  maximum sodium within 48 h post-LT and lowest sodium within 7 d pre-LT. Primary outcomes are post-LT CNS events during same hospitalization-encephalopathy, delirium, seizure, coma, osmotic demyelination syndrome, or other altered mental status, determined by International Classification of Diseases codes. Secondary outcome is length of hospital stay post-LT (LOS). Logistic regression modeled association between delta sodium and post-LT CNS outcomes; negative binomial regression modeled LOS. RESULTS: Median age was 59 y, 36% were female, and median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 20. Median delta sodium was 8 mmol/L (interquartile range, 5-11). One hundred ninety-four (15%) experienced post-LT CNS complications. In multivariable analysis, controlling for confounders including pre-LT hyponatremia, every 5 mmol/L increase in delta sodium associated with 47% greater odds of CNS complication (95% confidence interval, 22%-77%). Delta sodium also associated with 7% increased LOS in adjusted regression (95% confidence interval, 3%-12%). CONCLUSIONS: Adult LT recipients with higher perioperative delta sodium shifts displayed a higher risk of post-LT CNS complications, even after adjusting for pre-LT sodium. LT recipients, even those with pre-LT hyponatremia, may benefit from maintenance of stable serum sodium levels to minimize post-LT CNS complications.
