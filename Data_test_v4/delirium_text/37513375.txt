37513375|t|The Potential Role of Timosaponin-AIII in Cancer Prevention and Treatment.
37513375|a|Cancer, as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has challenged current chemotherapy drugs. Considering that treatments are expensive, alongside the resistance of tumor cells to anticancer drugs, the development of alternative medicines is necessary. Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, a recognized and well-known medicinal plant for more than two thousand years, has demonstrated its effectiveness against cancer. Timosaponin-AIII (TSAIII), as a bioactive steroid saponin isolated from A. asphodeloides, has shown multiple pharmacological activities and has been developed as an anticancer agent. However, the molecular mechanisms of TSAIII in protecting against cancer development are still unclear. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the anticancer effects of TSAIII, including proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, autophagy mediation, migration and invasion suppression, anti-angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and antioxidant effects. The pharmacokinetic profiles of TSAII are also discussed. TSAIII exhibits efficacy against cancer development. However, hydrophobicity and low bioavailability may limit the application of TSAIII. Effective delivery systems, particularly those with tissue/cell-targeted properties, can also significantly improve the anticancer effects of TSAIII.
