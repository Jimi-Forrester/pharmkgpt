34207484|a|Alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (alphaGPC) is a precursor of acetylcholine and can increase acetylcholine concentration in the brain. In addition, alphaGPC has a role in cholinergic function as well as monoaminergic transmission, including dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. These monoaminergic systems are related to feelings and emotions, including motivation, reward processing, anxiety, and depression. However, the precise effects of alphaGPC on human feelings and emotions remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated changes in the subjective feelings of healthy volunteers using the KOKORO scale before and after administering alphaGPC. Thirty-nine volunteers participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants completed a KOKORO scale test to quantify self-reported emotional states, three times each day for two weeks preceding treatment and then for a further two weeks while self-administering treatment. alphaGPC treatment show a tendency to increase motivation during the intervention period. Furthermore, motivation at night was significantly higher in the alphaGPC group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). However, alphaGPC did not show any effects on anxiety. These data suggest that alphaGPC can be used to increase motivation in healthy individuals.
