29399562|a|The antidiabetic drug metformin has been found to have beneficial effects in various neurological disorders; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here we report that metformin protects neuronal cells from quinolinic acid (QUIN)-induced excitotoxicity. For this, we pretreated N18D3 neuronal cells with metformin prior to QUIN for 24 h. We found that pretreating the cells with metformin significantly improved cell survival rate in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced apoptotic cell death, as revealed by a MTT assay and DAPI staining, respectively. Calcium imaging using fluo-4 showed that metformin (100 microM) inhibited the intracellular calcium increase that was induced by QUIN. In addition, mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic genes, p21 and Bax, was decreased and of anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, was increased with metformin treatment compared to QUIN-induced cells. The immunoreactivity of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was elevated in cells treated with metformin, indicating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the neuroprotective effects of metformin in QUIN-induced cell death. Collectively, our data demonstrates that metformin exerts its neuroprotective effects by inhibiting intracellular calcium increases, allowing it to regulate ERK1/2 signaling and modulate cell survival and death genes.
