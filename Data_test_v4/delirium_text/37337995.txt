37337995|a|The formation of amyloid filaments through templated seeding is believed to underlie the propagation of pathology in most human neurodegenerative diseases. A widely used model system to study this process is to seed amyloid filament formation in cultured cells using human brain extracts. Here, we report the electron cryo-microscopy structures of tau filaments from undifferentiated seeded SH-SY5Y cells, that transiently expressed N-terminally HA-tagged 1N3R or 1N4R human tau, using brain extracts from individuals with Alzheimer's disease or corticobasal degeneration. Although the resulting filament structures differed from those of the brain seeds, some degree of structural templating was observed. Studying templated seeding in cultured cells, and determining the structures of the resulting filaments, can thus provide insights into the cellular aspects underlying neurodegenerative diseases.
