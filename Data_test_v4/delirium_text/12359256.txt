12359256|t|NMR and CD studies on the interaction of Alzheimer beta-amyloid peptide (12-28) with beta-cyclodextrin.
12359256|a|Polymerization of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) has been identified as a major feature of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of the formation of these toxic polymers of Abeta has emerged as an approach for developing therapeutics for AD. NMR and CD spectra were used to investigate the interaction between cyclodextrin and Abeta(12-28) peptide, which was reported to be an important region for forming amyloid fibrils. CD spectral analyses show that of the alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins only beta-cyclodextrin inhibits the aggregation of Abeta(12-28) at pH 5.0. Analysis of the one-dimensional proton NMR spectra of Abeta(12-28) and the mixture of Abeta(12-28) with beta-cyclodextrin clearly indicates that there are chemical shift changes in the aromatic ring of Phe19 and the methyl groups of Val18 in the peptide. The NOESY spectra show cross-peaks between H-3 and H-5 of beta-cyclodextrin and the aromatic protons of Phe19 and Phe20. These chemical shift differences and NOEs demonstrate that there is an interaction between Abeta(12-28) and beta-cyclodextrin. Analysis of the cross-peak intensity in the NOESY spectra reveals that the aromatic rings of Phe19 and 20 are generally inserted into beta-cyclodextrin at the broad side and are oriented toward the narrow side of the cavity.
