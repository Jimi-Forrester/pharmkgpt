38801041|t|Best Practices for Treating Blind and Visually Impaired Patients in the Emergency Department: A Scoping Review.
38801041|a|Introduction: Blind and visually impaired individuals, an under-represented population of the emergency department (ED), possess comorbidities and have a higher chance of in-hospital sequelae, including falls. This potentially vulnerable population, if not treated mindfully, can be subject to decreased quality of care, recurrent and/or longer hospitalizations, persistence of health issues, increased incidence of falls, and higher healthcare costs. For these reasons, it is crucial to implement holistic practices and train clinicians to treat blind and visually impaired patients in the ED setting. Methods: We identified and used a comprehensive article describing best practices for the care of blind and visually impaired patients to establish the ED-specific recommendations presented in this paper. A scoping review of the literature was then performed using PubMed to identify additional articles to support each recommendation. To ensure that recommendations could be implemented in a representative, scalable, and sustainable manner, we consulted an advocate for the blind to help refine and provide additional suggestions. Results: We identified 14 recommendations that focus on communication strategies, ED resource access, and continuity of care. The main recommendation is for the clinician to support the unique healthcare needs of the visually impaired individual and maintain the patient's autonomy. Another recommendation is the consistent use of assistive devices (eg, canes, guide dogs) to aid patients to safely ambulate in the ED. Also identified as best practices were discharge education with the use of a screen reader and timely follow-up with a primary care physician. Conclusion: While we summarize a variety of recommendations in this article, it is important to implement only the strategies that work best for the patients, personnel, and environment specific to your ED. After implementation, it is vital to refine (as frequently as needed) the interventions to optimize the strategies. This will enable the provision of exceptional and equal care to blind and visually impaired patients in the ED.
