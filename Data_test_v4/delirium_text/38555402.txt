38555402|t|Mathematical topology and geometry-based classification of tauopathies.
38555402|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, are associated with the presence of neurofibrillary lesions formed by tau protein filaments in the cerebral cortex. While it is known that different morphologies of tau filaments characterize different neurodegenerative diseases, there are few metrics of global and local structure complexity that enable to quantify their structural diversity rigorously. In this manuscript, we employ for the first time mathematical topology and geometry to classify neurodegenerative diseases by using cryo-electron microscopy structures of tau filaments that are available in the Protein Data Bank. By employing mathematical topology metrics (Gauss linking integral, writhe and second Vassiliev measure) we achieve a consistent, but more refined classification of tauopathies, than what was previously observed through visual inspection. Our results reveal a hierarchy of classification from global to local topology and geometry characteristics. In particular, we find that tauopathies can be classified with respect to the handedness of their global conformations and the handedness of the relative orientations of their repeats. Progressive supranuclear palsy is identified as an outlier, with a more complex structure than the rest, reflected by a small, but observable knotoid structure (a diagrammatic structure representing non-trivial topology). This topological characteristic can be attributed to a pattern in the beginning of the R3 repeat that is present in all tauopathies but at different extent. Moreover, by comparing single filament to paired filament structures within tauopathies we find a consistent change in the side-chain orientations with respect to the alpha carbon atoms at the area of interaction.
