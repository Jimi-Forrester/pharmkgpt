33903893|a|As a member of the Ras superfamily, Rab proteins are small GTP-binding proteins. In the process of endocytosis of macromolecules and substances delivery between organelles, Rab proteins act on vesicle formation, transport, tethering and fusion by recruiting their effectors, therefore being key regulatory factors in vesicle trafficking. Disturbance of localizations and functions of Rab proteins and their effectors are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases. This review focuses on the main functions of Rab proteins and their possible roles in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.
