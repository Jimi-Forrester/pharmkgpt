34206442|t|The Occurrence and Biological Activity of Tormentic Acid-A Review.
34206442|a|This review focuses on the natural sources and pharmacological activity of tormentic acid (TA; 2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-2-en-28-oic acid). The current knowledge of its occurrence in various plant species and families is summarized. Biological activity (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-osteoarthritic, antinociceptive, antioxidative, anti-melanogenic, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic) confirmed in in vitro and in vivo studies is compiled and described. Biochemical mechanisms affected by TA are indicated. Moreover, issues related to the biotechnological methods of production, effective eluents, and TA derivatives are presented.
