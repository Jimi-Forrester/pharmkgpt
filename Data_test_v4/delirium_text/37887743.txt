37887743|t|In Vivo Efficacy of Curcumin and Curcumin Nanoparticle in Trypanosoma congolense, Broden 1904 (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae)-Infected Mice.
37887743|a|Curcumin (CUR) is known for its wide folkloric effects on various infections; however, its solubility status has remained a hindrance to its bioavailability in the host. This study evaluated the comparative effects of CUR and CUR-nanoparticle in vitro on T. congolense, T. b. brucei, and T. evansi. Additionally, CUR and CUR-nanoparticle anti-Trypanosoma efficacy were assessed in vivo against T. congolense. All the CUR-nanoparticles were two folds more effective on the T. congolense as compared to CUR in vitro, with recorded efficacy of 3.67 +- 0.31; 7.61 +- 1.22; and 6.40 +- 3.07 muM, while the CUR-nanoparticles efficacy was 1.56 +- 0.50; 28.16 +- 9.43 and 13.12 +- 0.13 muM on T. congolense, T. b. brucei, and T. evansi, respectively. Both CUR and CUR-nanoparticles displayed moderate efficacy orally. The efficacy of CUR and CUR-nanoparticles in vivo was influenced by solubility, presence of food, and treatment period. CUR-treated mice were not cured of the infection; however, the survival rate of the orally treated mice was significantly prolonged as compared with intraperitoneal-treated mice. CUR-nanoparticles resulted in significant suppression of parasitemia even though relapsed was observed. In conclusion, CUR and CUR-nanoparticles possess moderate efficacy orally on the trypanosomes as compared to the intraperitoneal treatment.
