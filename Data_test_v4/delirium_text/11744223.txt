11744223|a|There is circumstantial evidence that the reelin signaling pathway may contribute to neurodegeneration in the adult brain and could be linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present immunohistochemical report we studied the reelin expression profile in double-transgenic mice that express both human mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and human mutant presenilin-1. We were able to demonstrate that reelin immunostaining was found together with human APP in the neuritic component of many AD-typical plaques in both hippocampus and neocortex. This observation gives the first evidence for the association of reelin with amyloid deposits.
