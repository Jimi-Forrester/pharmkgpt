28760679|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) is a pathogenic peptide associated with many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The retinal inflammation in response to Abeta is implicated in the pathogenesis of several ocular diseases including age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's-related optic neuropathy and glaucoma. In the present study, we found that a single intravitreal injection of oligomeric Abeta1-40 in mouse activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NF-kappaB signaling, induced the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-6. In addition, Abeta1-40 caused retinal function impairment while no noticeable morphological changes were observed under light microscope. Furthermore, immunohistochemical results showed that Abeta1-40 enhanced the number of Iba1-positive cells in the inner retina. The mRNA expressions of LXRalpha and LXRbeta decreased in the neuroretina of the Abeta1-40-injected mice. No significant difference was found on the protein expressions of LXRs and ABCA1 in both neuroretina and RPE/choroid complex between the Abeta1-40-injected group and the control group. A synthetic LXR ligand, TO901317 (TO90), enhanced the expressions of LXRalpha and ABCA1 at both mRNA and protein levels in the Abeta1-40-injected mice, while the LXRbeta expression was unchanged. TO90 preserved ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes and reduced the number of Iba1-positive cells in the Abeta1-40-treated retina. Furthermore, TO90 down-regulated the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, as well as the expressions of p-IkappaBalpha, NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1beta in the Abeta1-40-injected animals. We suggest that activation of LXRalpha and its target gene ABCA1 exerts potent anti-inflammatory effect on the Abeta-treated retina.
