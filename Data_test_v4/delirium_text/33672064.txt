33672064|a|The main epigenetic features in aging are: reduced bulk levels of core histones, altered pattern of histone post-translational modifications, changes in the pattern of DNA methylation, replacement of canonical histones with histone variants, and altered expression of non-coding RNA. The identification of epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to the early detection of age-associated subclinical changes or deficits at the molecular and/or cellular level, to predict the development of frailty, or even more interestingly, to improve health trajectories in older adults. Frailty reflects a state of increased vulnerability to stressors as a result of decreased physiologic reserves, and even dysregulation of multiple physiologic systems leading to adverse health outcomes for individuals of the same chronological age. A key approach to overcome the challenges of frailty is the development of biomarkers to improve early diagnostic accuracy and to predict trajectories in older individuals. The identification of epigenetic biomarkers of frailty could provide important support for the clinical diagnosis of frailty, or more specifically, to the evaluation of its associated risks. Interventional studies aimed at delaying the onset of frailty and the functional alterations associated with it, would also undoubtedly benefit from the identification of frailty biomarkers. Specific to the article yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.
