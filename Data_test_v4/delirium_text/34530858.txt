34530858|t|Galantamine prevents and reverses neuroimmune induction and loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis following adolescent alcohol exposure.
34530858|a|BACKGROUND: Binge ethanol exposure during adolescence reduces hippocampal neurogenesis, a reduction which persists throughout adulthood despite abstinence. This loss of neurogenesis, indicated by reduced doublecortin+ immunoreactivity (DCX+IR), is paralleled by an increase in hippocampal proinflammatory signaling cascades. As galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, has anti-inflammatory actions, we tested the hypothesis that galantamine would prevent (study 1) or restore (study 2) AIE induction of proinflammatory signals within the hippocampus as well as AIE-induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS: Galantamine (4 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) was administered to Wistar rats during adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5.0 g/kg ethanol, 2 days on/2 days off, postnatal day [P] 25-54) (study 1, prevention) or after AIE during abstinent maturation to adulthood (study 2, restoration). RESULTS: Results indicate AIE reduced DCX+IR and induced cleaved caspase3 (Casp3) in DCX-expressing immature neurons. Excitingly, AIE induction of activated Casp3 in DCX-expressing neurons is both prevented and reversed by galantamine treatment, which also resulted in prevention and restoration of neurogenesis (DCX+IR). Similarly, galantamine prevented and/or reversed AIE induction of proinflammatory markers, including the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, suggesting that AIE induction of proinflammatory signaling mediates both cell death cascades and hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, galantamine treatment increased Ki67+IR generally as well as increased pan-Trk expression specifically in AIE-treated rats but failed to reverse AIE induction of NADPH-oxidase (gp91phox). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our studies suggest that (1) loss of neurogenesis after AIE is mediated by persistent induction of proinflammatory cascades which drive activation of cell death machinery in immature neurons, and (2) galantamine can prevent and restore AIE disruptions in the hippocampal environmental milieu to then prevent and restore AIE-mediated loss of neurogenesis.
