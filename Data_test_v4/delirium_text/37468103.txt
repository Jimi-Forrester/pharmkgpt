37468103|t|Mammalian neurotoxins, Blarina paralytic peptides, cause hyperpolarization of human T-type Ca channel hCav3.2 activation.
37468103|a|Among the rare venomous mammals, the short-tailed shrew Blarina brevicauda has been suggested to produce potent neurotoxins in its saliva to effectively capture prey. Several kallikrein-like lethal proteases have been identified, but the active substances of B. brevicauda remained unclear. Here we report Blarina paralytic peptides (BPPs) 1 and 2 isolated from its submaxillary glands. Synthetic BPP2 showed mealworm paralysis and a hyperpolarization shift (-11 mV) of a human T-type Ca2+ channel (hCav3.2) activation. The amino acid sequences of BPPs were similar to those of synenkephalins, which are precursors of brain opioid peptide hormones that are highly conserved among mammals. However, BPPs rather resembled centipede neurotoxic peptides SLPTXs in terms of disulfide bond connectivity and stereostructure. Our results suggested that the neurotoxin BPPs were the result of convergent evolution as homologs of non-toxic endogenous peptides that are widely conserved in mammals. This finding is of great interest from the viewpoint of the chemical evolution of vertebrate venoms.
