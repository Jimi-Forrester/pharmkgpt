30794655|t|HEWL interacts with dissipated oleic acid micelles, and decreases oleic acid cytotoxicity.
30794655|a|Senile plaques are well-known hallmarks of Alzheimer's Diseases (AD). However, drugs targeting tangles of the protein tau and plaques of beta-amyloid have no significant effect on disease progression, and the studies on the underlying mechanism of AD remain in high demand. Growing evidence supports the protective role of senile plaques in local inflammation driven by S100A9. We herein demonstrate that oleic acid (OA) micelles interact with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and promote its amyloid formation. Consequently, SH-SY5Y cell line and mouse neural stem cells are rescued from OA toxicity by co-aggregation of OA and HEWL. Using atomic force microscopy in combination with fluorescence microscopy, we revealed that HEWL forms round-shaped aggregates in the presence of OA micelles instead of protofibrils of HEWL alone. These HEWL amyloids act as a sink for toxic OA micelles and their co-aggregate form large clumps, suggesting a protective function in amyloid and OA cytotoxicity.
