9497952|t|Prostatic meningeal carcinomatosis presenting as delirium tremens.
9497952|a|We report an unusual case of prostatic carcinomatous meningitis and remind clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion of meningeal involvement when patients with advanced prostatic cancer present with cerebral symptoms, back pain, or neurologic findings. The diagnosis may require repeated cytologic examinations of cerebrospinal fluid, and immunocytochemical stains should be considered to confirm a prostatic source if malignant cells are identified. Androgen ablative therapy may give prolonged remissions, especially in patients with previously untreated tumours.
