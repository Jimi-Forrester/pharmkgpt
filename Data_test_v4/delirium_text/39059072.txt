39059072|t|7-Amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazines as CK1delta inhibitors: Exploring substitutions at the 2 and 5-positions.
39059072|a|CK1delta is a serine-threonine kinase involved in several pathological conditions including neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Specifically, it seems that an inhibition of CK1delta could have a neuroprotective effect in these conditions. Here, a series of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazines were developed as ATP-competitive CK1delta inhibitors. Both positions 2 and 5 have been explored leading to a total of ten compounds exhibiting IC50s comprised between 29.1 microM and 2.08 microM. Three of the four most potent compounds (IC50 < 3 microM) bear a thiophene ring at the 2 position. All compounds have been submitted to computational studies that identified the chain composed of at least 2 atoms (e.g., nitrogen and carbon atoms) at the 5 position as crucial to determine a key bidentate hydrogen bond with Leu85 of CK1delta. Most potent compounds have been tested in vitro, resulting passively permeable to the blood-brain barrier and, safe and slight neuroprotective on a neuronal cell model. These results encourage to further structural optimize the series to obtain more potent CK1delta inhibitors as possible neuroprotective agents to be tested on models of the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases.
