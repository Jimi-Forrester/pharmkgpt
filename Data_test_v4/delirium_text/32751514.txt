32751514|t|The Use of Bispectral Index Monitoring Does Not Change Intraoperative Exposure to Volatile Anesthetics in Children.
32751514|a|The exposure of infants and children to volatile anesthetics, such as sevoflurane, has been a topic of concern with respect to the potential risk for long term neurocognitive effects. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the perioperative utilization of Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring alters the sevoflurane delivery and exposure to children. This is a prospective randomized trial of two groups of healthy ambulatory day surgery patients (2 to 12 years). The patients in both groups had the BIS applied soon after the induction of general anesthesia, but only the anesthesiologists in the group randomized to BIS visible were able to see the BIS values. All of the patients received general anesthesia with sevoflurane. This study found no difference in the overall exposure to sevoflurane between both groups (mean end-tidal sevoflurane level of 1.8 in both groups, P = 084). The duration of time in the recovery room, the time to meet discharge criteria, the Pediatric Agitation Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scores were not statistically different between the groups. The application and utilization of intraoperative BIS monitoring does not alter the sevoflurane administration nor the discharge readiness nor the recovery profile in healthy ambulatory children.
