36454623|a|To alleviate the dilemma of drug administration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, it is of great significance to develop a new drug delivery system. In this study, a subcutaneously implanted microneedle (MN) device with a swellable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) needle body and a dissolvable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) backing layer was designed. The backing layer quickly dissolved once the MN was introduced into the subcutaneous, and the hydrogel needles were implanted in the subcutaneous to enable prolonged drug release. Compared with oral administration, the MN system offers the benefits of a high administration rate, a fast onset of effect, and a longer duration of action. By detecting the concentration of acetylcholine (ACH) and Abeta 1-42, it was found that MN administration exhibited a stronger therapeutic effect. The biological safety of the MN system was also assessed, and no obvious signs of hemolysis, cytotoxicity, and inflammatory reaction were observed. Together, these findings suggested that the MN system is a convenient, efficient, and safe method of delivering donepezil hydrochloride (DPH) and may provide AD patients with a novel medicine administration option.
