31977154|a|Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men and the second leading cause of tumor-associated deaths worldwide, with increasing incidence rates over the last 10 years. Recently, miR-195 was reported to be hypermethylated at its promoter CpG island and down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the function of miR-195 and the underlying mechanisms in PCa remain unknown. Here, we report that a significant down-regulation of microRNA-195 (miR-195) in PCa tissues and cell lines was associated with promoter methylation status. Overexpression of miR-195 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin) in PCa cells. We further demonstrated that transfection with a miR-195 inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine on the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of PCa cells. In summary, our findings suggest that miR-195 may function as a crucial tumor suppressor in PCa.
