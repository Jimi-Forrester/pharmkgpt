37190512|t|The Effects of Four Compounds That Act on the Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Systems on Working Memory in Animal Studies; A Literature Review.
37190512|a|The dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are two of the most important neuronal pathways in the human brain. Almost all psychotropic medications impact at least one neurotransmitter system. As a result, investigating how they affect memory could yield valuable insights into potential therapeutic applications or unanticipated side effects. The aim of this literature review was to collect literature data from animal studies regarding the effects on memory of four drugs known to act on the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. The studies included in this review were identified in the PubMed database using selection criteria from the PRISMA protocol. We analyzed 29 articles investigating one of four different dopaminergic or serotonergic compounds. Studies conducted on bromocriptine have shown that stimulating D2 receptors may enhance working memory in rodents, whereas inhibiting these receptors could have the opposite effect, reducing working memory performance. The effects of serotonin on working memory are not clearly established as studies on fluoxetine and ketanserin have yielded conflicting results. Further studies with better-designed methodologies are necessary to explore the impact of compounds that affect both the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems on working memory.
