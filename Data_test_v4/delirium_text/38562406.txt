38562406|t|Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on postoperative sleep disturbance in older patients undergoing lower limb major arthroplasty: a prospective, double-blind, pilot, randomised controlled trial.
38562406|a|Background: Postoperative sleep disturbance (PSD) is a common and serious postoperative complication and is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on PSD in older patients undergoing lower limb major arthroplasty. Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, pilot, randomised, sham-controlled trial, patients 65 years and over undergoing lower limb major arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive active tDCS (a-tDCS) or sham tDCS (s-tDCS). The primary outcomes were the objective sleep measures on postoperative nights (N) 1 and N2. Results: 116 inpatients were assessed for eligibility, and a total of 92 patients were enrolled; 47 received a-tDCS and 45 received s-tDCS. tDCS improved PSD by altering the following sleep measures in the a-tDCS and s-tDCS groups; the respective comparisons were as follows: the promotion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time on N1 (64.5 (33.5-105.5) vs 19.0 (0.0, 45.0) min, F=20.10, p<0.001) and N2 (75.0 (36.0-120.8) vs 30.0 (1.3-59.3) min, F=12.55, p<0.001); the total sleep time on N1 (506.0 (408.0-561.0) vs 392.0 (243.0-483.5) min, F=14.13, p<0.001) and N2 (488.5 (455.5-548.5) vs 346.0 (286.5-517.5) min, F=7.36, p=0.007); the deep sleep time on N1 (130.0 (103.3-177.0) vs 42.5 (9.8-100.8) min, F=24.4, p<0.001) and N2 (103.5 (46.0-154.8) vs 57.5 (23.3-106.5) min, F=8.4, p=0.004); and the percentages of light sleep and REM sleep on N1 and N2 (p<0.05 for each). The postoperative depression and anxiety scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. No significant adverse events were reported. Conclusion: In older patients undergoing lower limb major arthroplasty, a single session of anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed a potentially prophylactic effect in improving postoperative short-term objective sleep measures. However, this benefit was temporary and was not maintained over time.
