38328053|a|Cytosolic aggregation of the nuclear protein TDP-43 is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, but the triggers for TDP-43 aggregation are still debated. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregation requires a double event. One is up-concentration in stress granules beyond a threshold, and the other is oxidative stress. These two events collectively induce intra-condensate demixing, giving rise to a dynamic TDP-43 enriched phase within stress granules, which subsequently transitions into pathological aggregates. Mechanistically, intra-condensate demixing is triggered by local unfolding of the RRM1 domain for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and by increased hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain. By engineering TDP-43 variants resistant to intra-condensate demixing, we successfully eliminate pathological TDP-43 aggregates in cells. We conclude that up-concentration inside condensates and simultaneous exposure to environmental stress could be a general pathway for protein aggregation, with intra-condensate demixing constituting a key intermediate step.
