39074152|t|mRNA and circRNA mislocalization to synapses are key features of Alzheimer's disease.
39074152|a|Proper transport of RNAs to synapses is essential for localized translation of proteins in response to synaptic signals and synaptic plasticity. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by accumulation of amyloid aggregates and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles followed by widespread synapse loss. To understand whether RNA synaptic localization is impacted in AD, we performed RNA sequencing on synaptosomes and brain homogenates from AD patients and cognitively healthy controls. This resulted in the discovery of hundreds of mislocalized mRNAs in AD among frontal and temporal brain regions. Similar observations were found in an APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse model. Furthermore, major differences were observed among circular RNAs (circRNAs) localized to synapses in AD including two overlapping isoforms of circGSK3beta, one upregulated, and one downregulated. Expression of these distinct isoforms affected tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells substantiating the importance of circRNAs in the brain and pointing to a new class of therapeutic targets.
