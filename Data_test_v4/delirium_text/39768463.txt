39768463|t|Review of Supplements That Patients Commonly Report Using for Dementia.
39768463|a|Dietary supplements are readily available over the counter in the United States and are used by the majority of older adults to address a variety of concerns and conditions. Many older adults report using dietary supplements for cognitive health-either to address memory loss or dementia or in efforts to prevent cognitive decline. Our objective for this narrative review is to summarize the available efficacy and safety data for several supplements commonly reported in our clinic as being used for symptoms of dementia. Using a validated survey instrument, we conducted a survey of patients in our tertiary referral center memory clinic population to assess for the most commonly reported supplements for cognition. In our review, we compare the strength of published medical and scientific evidence to advertising or other lay press claims made about the nine most reported supplements with the aim of providing a representation of general trends in this industry. We found little or no scientific evidence available to support the use of any of these substances to ameliorate memory loss or other cognitive symptoms. Although most appear safe in the studies conducted to date, several authors have highlighted the lack of Food and Drug Administration oversight in the supplement industry, raising concerns over unknown or undeclared contaminants in these over-the-counter products. This review will better prepare clinicians to discuss these considerations with their patients who are considering the use of dietary supplements.
