7828123|a|This paper highlights recent advances in the pharmacological management of geriatric affective disorders and dementia. The current roles of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) in the treatment of depression in old age are discussed. Recent findings pertaining to continuation and maintenance of antidepressant treatment are also addressed. The treatment of bipolar affective disorder in the elderly has received much less study than has unipolar depression. A number of issues relating to efficacy, side-effects and optimal blood levels of lithium, carbamazepine and valproate in bipolar disorder remain unresolved and await further study. Finally, drug treatment of the cognitive impairment and psychiatric complications of Alzheimer's disease is reviewed.
