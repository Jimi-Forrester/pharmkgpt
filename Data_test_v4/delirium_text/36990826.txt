36990826|a|Postoperative delirium is an important complication of surgery and is associated with poor long-term cognitive outcomes, although the neural basis underlying this relationship is poorly understood. Neuroimaging studies and network-based approaches play an important role in our understanding of the mechanism by which delirium relates to longitudinal cognitive decline. A recent resting state functional MRI study is reviewed, which shows reduced global connectivity up to 3 months after delirium, supporting recent models of delirium and opening the door for applying this approach to understanding the complex inter-relationship between delirium and dementia.
