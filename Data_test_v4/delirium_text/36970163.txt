36970163|a|Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a form of interstitial lung disease that develops in response to acute lung injury. SARS-CoV-2 causes a wide range of lung and extrapulmonary disease, but there are few data suggesting an association between COVID-19 and OP. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed severe progressive OP with significant morbidity. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 pneumonia is one of the secondary causes of organizing pneumonia (OP).Early initiation of steroids in OP is associated with improvement in symptoms and prognosis.A prolonged course of steroids may be needed in COVID-induced OP.
