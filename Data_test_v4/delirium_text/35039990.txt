35039990|a|BACKGROUND: The pandemic implied dramatic changes in public health assets. In Italy, some Stroke Units were transformed into sub-intensive COVID-19 Units, making the management of neurological patients demanding. We described how the flow of neurological emergencies was affected by the pandemic impact. METHODS: We analyzed accesses to the Emergency Department (ED) of the "Maggiore della Carita" Hospital, Piedmont, Italy, during a period of 8 months (COVID time; March to May 2020 and October 2020 to February 2021) and analyzed the admissions to the Neurology Unit and the underlying diagnosis. We also evaluated potential changes in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the same period. These variables were compared with two equivalent periods of time (2019-2020; 2018-2019). RESULTS: During the COVID time, there was a clear-cut reduction of the total ED accesses compared to NoCOVID times. However, admissions for acute neurological conditions showed a mild but non-significant decrease (6.3%vs.7.3%). The same applied to acute ischemic stroke, which represented the most common condition (47.7%). The proportion of patients who underwent emergent reperfusion therapies remained unchanged. Furthermore, no difference was found in door-to-needle and door-to-groin intervals between COVID time and NoCOVID times. On the contrary, the onset-to-door interval was significantly longer during the COVID time (p value: 0.001). DISCUSSION: While the percentage of admissions following an ED access grew dramatically, those to the Neurology Unit showed overall only a slight non-significant decrease. This finding implicitly reflects the serious and urgent nature of many neurological diseases, compelling people to access EDs at any time.
