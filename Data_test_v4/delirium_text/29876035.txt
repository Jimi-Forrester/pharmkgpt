29876035|t|Oral health and implant therapy in Parkinson's patients: review.
29876035|a|Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases, second only to Alzheimer's disease. It is a progressive disease that inevitably leads the patient to death, in most cases for pneumonia ab ingestis. It affects 120 people out of 100,000 and more frequently affects men than women. The main symptoms are divided into motor, non-motor and behavioral ones. The main motors symptoms are tremor, bradykinesia and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms include autonomic nervous dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, sexual dysfunction, excessive sweating due to hypothalamic dysfunction, constipation), insomnia, OSAS, and olfactory dysfunction. Behavioral symptoms are depression, dementia and psychosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, through a systematic review of literature, the oral health status of the Parkinson's patient compared with the general population with particular reference to the incidence of caries and periodontal disease, the patient's management during dental interventions and the possibility of rehabilitating the patient with implanted therapy.
