34006542|t|Study protocol for a randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind phase II study of the efficacy of morphine for dyspnoea in patients with interstitial lung disease (JORTC-PAL 15).
34006542|a|INTRODUCTION: Dyspnoea is common in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and often refractory to conventional treatment. Little is known about the efficacy of systemic morphine for dyspnoea in patients with ILD. The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy of a single subcutaneous morphine injection for dyspnoea in patients with ILD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a multicentre, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blinded phase II study of a single subcutaneous morphine injection for dyspnoea in patients with ILD. In patients with ILD who have dyspnoea at rest refractory to conventional treatment will be eligible for participation in this study. The morphine dose will be 2 mg. The primary endpoint is changes in dyspnoea intensity from baseline to 60 min after treatment as measured using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale and compared between the morphine and placebo groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained by the Osaka City University Certified Review Board. The results of this study will be submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal and the findings will be presented at international scientific conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: jRCTs051190030; pre-results.
