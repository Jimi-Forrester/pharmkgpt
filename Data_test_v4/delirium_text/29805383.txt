29805383|t|Efficacy and Safety of MLC601 in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer Disease: An Extension 4-Year Follow-Up Study.
29805383|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Currently, there is no disease-modifying therapy for AD. We aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of MLC601 in the treatment of AD. METHODS: In this open-label extension study, patients with mild to moderate AD according to DSM-IV criteria were recruited. Patients received MLC601 capsules 3 times a day for 4 years. Cognitive function was assessed every 6 months using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores. Safety profiles, including adverse events (AEs), and treatment-related abnormality in laboratory tests were also reported. RESULTS: Of a total of 122 patients, 105 completed the study. The mean age was 66.8 +- 6.3 years at the beginning of the study. Sixty-five (61.9%) were female. The mean (+-SD) change in MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores at the end of the study was 2.1 (+-3.8) and -5.1 (+-8.7), respectively. Repeated measure analysis revealed a statistically significant change in both scores (p < 0.001). No patient left the study due to an AE. No abnormality was noted in lab tests. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly reported AEs. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of treating AD patients with MLC601 over 4 years has been demonstrated in the present study. Overall, it seems that the safety and efficacy of MLC601 is promising compared to currently prescribed treatments.
