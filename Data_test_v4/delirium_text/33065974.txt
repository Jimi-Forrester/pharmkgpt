33065974|t|The Impact of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 Axis in Neurological Disorders.
33065974|a|Fractalkine (FKN, CX3CL1) is a transmembrane chemokine expressed by neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). CX3CL1 signals through its unique receptor, CX3CR1, that is expressed in microglia. Within the CNS, fractalkine acts as a regulator of microglia activation in response to brain injury or inflammation. During the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the roles that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling pathway plays in the neuropathology of a diverse array of brain disorders. However, the reported results have proven controversial, indicating that a disruption of the CX3CL1 axis induces a disease-specific microglial response that may have either beneficial or detrimental effects. Therefore, it has become clear that the understanding of neuron-to-glia signals mediated by CX3CL1/CX3CR1 at different stages of diseases could provide new insight into potential therapeutic targets. Hence, the aim of this review is to provide a summary of the literature on the emerging role of CX3CL1 in animal models of some brain disorders.
