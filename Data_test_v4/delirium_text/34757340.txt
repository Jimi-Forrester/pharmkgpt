34757340|t|Ultrasound-guided Multiple Nerve Blocks: A Safe and Effective Anesthetic Modality in Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients.
34757340|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare the feasibility of ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blocks (fascia iliaca compartment block+sacral plexus block+superior cluneal nerve block) with general anesthesia in geriatric hip fracture patients. METHODS: Ninety-four patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group N received ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blocks and group G received general anesthesia. Primary outcome measures included perioperative Pain Threshold Index (PTI) and Numerical Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures comprised the following: (1) perioperative Delirium Index and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; (2) perioperative Comfort Index; (3) perioperative opioid consumption (within 72 hours postoperatively); and (4) postoperative side effects (within 72 h postoperatively). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients completed the study. Baseline PTI was comparable between the groups. However, intraoperative PTI was significantly lower in group N than in group G. Preoperative and postoperative Comfort Index scores were comparable between the groups. Moderate delirium (24 to 72 h postoperatively) was significantly higher than the baseline in group G. Early moderate delirium (24 h postoperatively) was significantly higher in group G than in group N. Severe delirium was comparable between the groups and within each group. High intraoperative PTI was associated with high opioid consumption. The intravenous sufentanil dose in group G was twice of that in group N. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar between the groups. DISCUSSION: Ultrasound-guided multiple nerve blockade may be an alternative to the common anesthetic procedures used for geriatric hip fracture patients. It provided satisfactory intraoperative pain management and reduced early postoperative cognitive disorders.
