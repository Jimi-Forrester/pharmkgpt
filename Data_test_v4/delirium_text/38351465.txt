38351465|t|Analgesic efficacy of local infiltration anaesthesia versus femoral nerve block in alleviating postoperative wound pain following total knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
38351465|a|Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often involves significant postoperative pain, necessitating effective analgesia. This meta-analysis compares the analgesic efficacy of local infiltration anaesthesia (LIA) and femoral nerve block (FNB) in managing postoperative wound pain following TKA. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this meta-analysis was structured around the PICO framework, assessing studies that directly compared LIA and FNB in TKA patients. A comprehensive search across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library was conducted without time restrictions. Studies were included based on specific criteria such as participant demographics, study design and outcomes like pain scores and opioid consumption. Quality assessment utilized the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. The statistical approach was determined based on heterogeneity, with the choice of fixed- or random-effects models guided by the I2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis and evaluation of publication bias using funnel plots and Egger's linear regression test were also conducted. From an initial pool of 1275 articles, eight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies conducted in various countries from 2007 to 2016. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in resting and movement-related Visual Analogue Scale scores post-TKA between the LIA and FNB groups. However, LIA was associated with significantly lower opioid consumption. The quality assessment revealed a low risk of bias in most studies, and the sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these findings. There was no significant publication bias detected. Both LIA and FNB are effective in controlling postoperative pain in TKA patients, but LIA offers the advantage of lower opioid consumption. Its simplicity, cost-effectiveness and opioid-sparing nature make LIA the recommended choice for postoperative analgesia in knee replacement surgeries.
