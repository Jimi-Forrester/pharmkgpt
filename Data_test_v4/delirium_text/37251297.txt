37251297|a|Introduction: Pediatric sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a rare otological emergency. With the emergence of the Coronavirus 19 pandemic, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are among the essential household items. Many hand sanitizers are frequently coupled with scents that young children may find pleasant. Case Report: A 5-year-old girl presented to our clinic with hearing loss after the consumption of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. A pure tone audiogram showed bilateral SSNHL. The child was prescribed systemic corticosteroids resulted in a slight improvement in hearing thresholds. The child was followed up at 6 and 18 months showing no further improvement in hearing thresholds. Conclusion: Although various infective, vascular, and immune responses have been proposed, alcohol-based hand sanitizer consumption has not been reported to present with SSNHL to the best of our knowledge. In the current scenario of the Coronavirus pandemic, otorhinolaryngologists must keep in mind that SSNHL may occur as a result of hazardous alcohol-based hand disinfectant consumption.
