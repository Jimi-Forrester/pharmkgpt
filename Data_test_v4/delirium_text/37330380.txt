37330380|a|HIV-associated comorbidities, such as ischemic stroke, are prevalent in people with HIV (PWH). Several studies both in animal models and humans have revealed an association between activation of the inflammasome in HIV-1 infection and stroke. The gut microbiota is an important component in controlling neuroinflammation in the CNS. It has also been proposed to be involved in the pathobiology of HIV-1 infection, and has been associated with an increase in activation of the inflammasome. In this review, we provide an overview of the microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis, focusing on the NLRP3 inflammasome and dysregulation of the microbiome as risk factors that may contribute to the outcome of ischemic stroke and recovery in PWH. We also focus on the potential of targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome as a novel therapeutic approach for PWH who are at risk of developing cerebrovascular diseases.
