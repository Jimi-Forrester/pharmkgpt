38998552|a|Sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) is an under-exploited crop with great potential due to its nutritional and medicinal characteristics. A Sacha inchi protein isolate (SII), obtained from defatted Sacha inchi flour (SIF), was hydrolyzed by Bioprotease LA 660 under specific conditions. The hydrolysates were characterized chemically, and their digestibility and antioxidant capacity were evaluated by in vitro cell-free experiments to select the hydrolysate with major antioxidant activity. Sacha inchi protein hydrolysate at 20 min (SIH20B) was selected, and the anti-inflammatory capacity was evaluated by RT-qPCR and ELISA techniques, using two different doses in monocytes THP-1 stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results obtained showed that the in vitro administration of SIH20B down-regulated the TNF-alpha gene and reduced the release of this cytokine, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 were up-regulated in LPS-stimulated monocytes and co-administrated with SIH20B. The peptides contained in SIH20B were identified, and the 20 more relatively abundant peptides with a mass by 1 kDa were subjected to in silico analysis to hypothesize those that could be responsible for the bioactivity reported in the hydrolysate. From the identified peptides, the peptides AAGALKKFL and LGVKFKGGL, among others, are proposed as the most biologically actives. In conclusion, SIH20B is a novel, natural source of high-value-added biopeptides that could be used as an ingredient in formulations of food or nutraceutical compounds.
