33720892|t|Executive Function and Physical Function Among Community-Dwelling Egyptian Older Adults.
33720892|a|BACKGROUND: The ongoing scientific debate regarding the association between physical function and cognitive impairment has focused mainly on global cognitive performance rather than specific cognitive functions tests and the importance of recognition of its associations and any factors that could play a role later in the prevention of such decline. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between physical function, using handgrip strength (HGS) and Timed Up-and-Go test (TUGT), and executive function (EF), using Clock Drawing Test (CDT), among community-dwelling Egyptian elderly. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 5 social clubs in Cairo, Egypt and included a sample of 136 elderly males and females aged>=55 years old. All participants had their physical function assessed using TUGT, and measurement of HGS using a pneumatic hand-held dynamometer. Assessment of EF using CDT was also done. RESULTS: Higher CDT scores were significantly associated with both better HGS, and lower TUGT (OR = 3.77, and 0.65 respectively). This persisted even after adjustment for age and gender (OR = 2.56, and 0.71 respectively) and after further adjustment for weight, systolic blood pressure, education, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and physical activity (O.R. = 4.79, and 0.76 respectively). Adjustment for both male and female genders showed an association between physical (HGS and TUGT) and EF was stronger among men. CONCLUSION: A strong association between CDT score and both of HGS and TUGT was found among the studied sample. Higher HGS and lower TUGT was significantly associated with better performance in the CDT. This association is stronger in males than in females for both HGS and TUGT.
