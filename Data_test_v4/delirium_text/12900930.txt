12900930|t|Spatial patterns of mammalian brain aging: distribution of cathepsin D-immunoreactive cell bodies and dystrophic dendrites in aging dogs resembles that in Alzheimer's disease.
12900930|a|Elevated levels of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D are found in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and co-occur with intraneuronal tangles. The present study tested whether increases in cathepsin D would emerge during aging in another mammalian species. Regional brain patterns of cathepsin D immunostaining were compared in dogs ages 0.35 to 16 years. Accumulations of immunopositive material were evident in neuronal cell bodies in many forebrain sites in middle-age to old dogs (>/=6 years). Three types could be distinguished: (1) dense aggregates with no particular position within the cell body; (2) crescent-shaped "caps" that occupied one pole of the cell body; and (3) very dense "spikes" that extended from the cell body for variable distances into the apical dendrite; these spikes were found in only a few areas, most notably the subiculum and layer V of neocortex. The spikes appeared between ages 2 and 5 years and increased steadily with age thereafter. Spikes were found in the subiculum in the aged human brain but only infrequently; they were, however, present in large numbers in AD brains. These results established that brain aging in dogs is (1) well advanced by middle age, (2) varies markedly across regions, and (3) in at least some of its aspects (dystrophic dendrites) is prominent in areas known to exhibit pathology early in the course of AD. Combined with previous results for rats, these findings indicated that changes in cathepsin D observed in AD, in particular in the temporal lobe, reflect a generalized mammalian pattern of brain aging.
