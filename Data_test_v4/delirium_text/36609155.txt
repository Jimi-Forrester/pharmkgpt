36609155|a|An increasing number of experimental and clinical observation suggest that the use of anaesthetics is closely associated with postoperative central nervous system (CNS) complications, such as delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Brain energy rescue is an emerging therapeutic strategy for central nervous system disease (CNSDs). However, the effect of anaesthetics on nerve cell energy utilisation, especially microglia, and its potential effects on cell function still unclear. Elucidating the effects of anaesthetics on lipid droplets, which are specific lipid storage organs, and phagocytosis of microglia is crucial to discover a new therapeutic concept for postoperative CNS complications. Here, we studied the effects of the commonly used anaesthetic midazolam on lipid droplets and phagocytosis in immortalised microglial BV2 cells. Lipid droplets were assessed by flow cytometry and triglyceride quantification. The phagocytosis of BV2 cells was evaluated by detecting their phagocytosis by latex beads. Additionally, the autophagy of BV2 cells was evaluated by western blot and observation under microscopy. Our results showed that midazolam caused lipid droplet accumulation and reduced phagocytosis in BV2 cells, and inhibition of lipid droplet accumulation partially restored phagocytosis. Furthermore, midazolam blocks autophagic degradation by increasing phosphorylated TFEB in BV2 cells, inhibition of midazolam-increased phosphorylated TFEB might contribute to the improvement of autophagic flux by rapamycin. Moreover, promoting autophagy reverse the lipid droplet accumulation and phagocytosis decrease. This study suggests autophagy is a target for attenuating lipid droplet accumulation, normal degradation of lipid droplets is important for maintaining microglia phagocytosis and attenuating the side effects of midazolam on the CNS.
