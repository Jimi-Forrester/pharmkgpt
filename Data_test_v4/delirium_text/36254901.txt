36254901|t|The use of cerebral oximetry in cardiac surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
36254901|a|High prevalence of cerebral desaturation is associated with postoperative neurological complications in cardiac surgery. However, the evidence use of cerebral oximetry by correcting cerebral desaturation in the reduction of postoperative complications remains uncertain in the literature. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of cerebral oximetry on the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in cardiac surgery. Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from their inception until April 2021. All randomized controlled trials comparing cerebral oximetry and blinded/no cerebral oximetry in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery were included. Observational studies, case series, and case reports were excluded. A total of 14 trials (n = 2,033) were included in this review. Our pooled data demonstrated that patients with cerebral oximetry were associated with a lower incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction than the control group (studies = 4, n = 609, odds ratio [OR]: 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.04 to 0.54, P = 0.003, I2 = 88%; certainty of evidence = very low). In terms of postoperative delirium (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.50-1.14, P = 0.18, I2 = 0%; certainty of evidence = low) and postoperative stroke (OR: 0.81 95%CI: 0.37-1.80, P = 0.61, I2 = 0%; certainty of evidence = high), no significant differences (P > 0.05) were reported between the cerebral oximetry and control groups. In this meta-analysis, the use of cerebral oximetry monitoring in cardiac surgery demonstrated a lower incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution due to the low level of evidence, high degree of heterogeneity, lack of standardized cognitive assessments, and cerebral desaturation interventions.
