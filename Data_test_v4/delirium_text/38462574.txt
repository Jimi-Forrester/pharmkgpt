38462574|a|Neurons from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the first to accumulate tau protein aggregates and degenerate during prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this vulnerability will help reveal genes and pathways at play during incipient stages of the disease. Here, we use a data-driven functional genomics approach to model ECII neurons in silico and identify the proto-oncogene DEK as a regulator of tau pathology. We show that epigenetic changes caused by Dek silencing alter activity-induced transcription, with major effects on neuronal excitability. This is accompanied by gradual accumulation of tau in the somatodendritic compartment of mouse ECII neurons in vivo, reactivity of surrounding microglia, and microglia-mediated neuron loss. These features are all characteristic of early AD. The existence of a cell-autonomous mechanism linking AD pathogenic mechanisms in the precise neuron type where the disease starts provides unique evidence that synaptic homeostasis dysregulation is of central importance in the onset of tau pathology in AD.
