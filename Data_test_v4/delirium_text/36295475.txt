36295475|t|Proximal Femoral Fractures in the Elderly: A Few Things to Know, and Some to Forget.
36295475|a|Hip fractures are a leading cause of hospitalisation in elderly patients, representing an increasing socioeconomic problem arising from demographic changes, considering the increased number of elderly people in our countries. Adequate peri-operative treatment is essential to decrease mortality rates and avoid complications. Modern management should involve a coordinated multidisciplinary approach, early surgery, pain treatment, balanced fluid therapy, and prevention of delirium, to improve patients' functional and clinical outcomes. The operative treatment for intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures is intramedullary nail or sliding/dynamic hip screw (DHS) on the basis of the morphology of the fracture. In the case of neck fractures, total hip replacement (THR) or hemiarthroplasty are recommended. However, several topics remain debated, such as the optimum thromboprophylaxis to reduce venous thromboembolism or the use of bone cement. Postoperatively, patients can benefit from early mobilisation and geriatric multidisciplinary care. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a prolonged time to operation with a subsequent increased complication rate have burdened frail and elderly patients with hip fractures. Future studies are needed with the aim to investigate better strategies to improve nutrition, postoperative mobility, to clarify the role of home-based rehabilitation, and to identify the ideal analgesic treatment and adequate tools in case of patients with cognitive impairment.
