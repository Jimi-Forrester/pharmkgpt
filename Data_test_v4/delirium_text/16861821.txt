The effects of the anticholinesterase drugs galantamine and donepezil were studied in a model with sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia in rats. The animals were trained in the shuttle-box active avoidance test and in step-through and step-down passive avoidance tests. In the active avoidance test, hypoxic rats showed a decrease in the number of avoidances in the learning session and in retention. The hypoxic rats receiving galantamine showed an increase in the number of avoidances during the learning session. The groups in hypoxia treated with donepezil had an increased number of avoidances in the learning session. In memory retention tests, significant differences were not observed in the hypoxic animals treated with galantamine or donepezil. In the step-through passive avoidance test, rats treated with galantamine had no change in the latency of reactions during the learning session and memory retention tests. In the step-down passive avoidance test, the animals treated with galantamine had increase latency of reactions during the learning and short- or long-memory retention tests. The hypoxic rats receiving donepezil had increased latency of reactions in the step-down short memory retention test. Our results suggest that galantamine and donepezil improve cognitive functions in a model of hypoxia.
