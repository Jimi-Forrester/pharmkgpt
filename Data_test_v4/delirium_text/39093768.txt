39093768|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to summarize the intensive care experience of a patient undergoing combined multi-organ cluster ("larynx-trachea-thyroid-hypopharynx-esophagus") transplantation. METHODS: The intensive care management plan for this case was developed by a multidisciplinary team, with focus on 6 aspects: (1) stabilizing the circulation and reducing anastomotic tension by position management to improve the survival chances of transplanted organs, (2) adopting goal-directed analgesia and sedation protocols, as well as preventing anastomotic fistula, (3) implementing a bedside ultrasound-guided nutrition plan, (4) employing "body-mind" synchronous rehabilitation to facilitate functional recovery, (5) taking antirejection treatment and protective isolation measures, (6) monitoring and nursing thyroid function. RESULTS: During the intensive care, the patient's vital signs were stable. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator and transferred to the general ward for further treatment at 9 days postoperatively, and discharged upon recovery at 58 days postoperatively. The patient was in good condition during follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study provides reference for the care of patients who undergo similar transplantation in the future.
