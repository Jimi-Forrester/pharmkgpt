27728931|a|The non-clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-357, a highly lipophilic (clogP>6) potential agent for the amelioration of Alzheimer's disease, was investigated in rats and dogs. A long half-life (t1/2) in plasma was observed in animals and a low total body clearance with high distribution volume was consistent with the long t1/2. The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies using radiolabeled TAK-357 revealed that the total radioactivity was highly distributed to the adipose tissues and sustained with high concentration for over 4 weeks after oral administration. The metabolite analysis also revealed that the main component in the plasma and adipose tissues was unchanged TAK-357. The major elimination route of absorbed TAK-357 was suggested to be by metabolism. An ADME study indicated that the adipose tissue is the main depot of remaining TAK-357 in the body and slow release from the adipose tissues contributes to the long t1/2. The PK of highly lipophilic compounds have a tendency to be affected by body weight changes especially changes in the adipose tissues. Therefore, it is considered that the relationship between the plasma levels of TAK-357 and the body weight should be evaluated carefully during the clinical trials.
