33298084|t|A quantitative proteomics analysis for small molecule Stemazole's effect on human neural stem cells.
33298084|a|BACKGROUND: Stemazole is a novel small molecule that has been suggested to have the ability to protect multiple stem cells. The proliferation-promoting activity and promising neuroprotective effects of stemazole make it a prospective drug for neurodegenerative disease treatment. METHODS: Since previous studies have shown that it protective effect in extreme conditions, to understand more aspects of stemazole, in this study, a systematic tandem mass tags (TMT)-labelled proteomics approach was used to address the whole proteome expression profile with or without stemazole in normal conditions instead of extreme conditions. Bioinformatics analyses, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses, were employed. RESULTS: The effect of stemazole on the expression profiles of neural stem cells was obtained. A total of 408 proteins with changes at the abundance level of two groups were identified: 178 proteins increase in abundance and 240 proteins decrease in abundance, respectively. Low abundance of some mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential may indicate stemazole has cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: It is the first proteomics research about stemazole, and the possible cytotoxicity of stemazole has been reported for the first time. The information about proteins that were affected by stemazole and more characteristics of stemazole will help obtain a complete picture of this small molecule drug. These findings provide a scientific basis for further stemazole treatment research.
