39126108|t|Therapeutic Transplantation of Human Central Nervous System Organoids for Neural Reconstruction.
39126108|a|Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) often leads to irreversible neurological deficits, and there are currently few effective treatments available. However, recent advancements in regenerative medicine have identified CNS organoids as promising therapeutic options for addressing CNS injuries. These organoids, composed of various neurons and supporting cells, have shown potential for direct repair at injury sites. CNS organoids resemble the structure and function of actual brain tissue, which allows them to adapt and function well within the physiological environment when transplanted into injury sites. Research findings suggest that CNS organoids can replace damaged neurons, form new neural connections, and promote neural recovery. This review highlights the emerging benefits, evaluates preclinical transplantation outcomes, and explores future strategies for optimizing neuroregeneration using CNS organoids. With continued research and technological advancements, these organoids could provide new hope for patients suffering from neurological deficits.
