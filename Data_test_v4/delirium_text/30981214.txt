30981214|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Progressive dysfunction of cholinergic transmission is a well-known characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide oligomers are known to play a central role in AD and are suggested to impair the function of the cholinergic nicotinic ACh receptor alpha7 (alpha7nAChR). However, the mechanism underlying the effect of Abeta on alpha7nAChR function is not fully understood, limiting the therapeutic exploration of this observation in AD. Here, we aimed to detect and characterize Abeta binding to alpha7nAChR, including the possibility of interfering with this interaction for therapeutic purposes. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We developed a specific and quantitative time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET)-based binding assay for Abeta to alpha7nAChR and pharmacologically characterized this interaction. KEY RESULTS: We demonstrated specific and high-affinity (low nanomolar) binding of Abeta to the orthosteric binding site of alpha7nAChR. Abeta binding was prevented and reversed by the well-characterized orthosteric ligands of alpha7nAChR (epibatidine, alpha-bungarotoxin, methylylcaconitine, PNU-282987, S24795, and EVP6124) and by the type II positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596 but not by the type I PAM NS1738. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our TR-FRET Abeta binding assay demonstrates for the first time the specific binding of Abeta to alpha7nAChR, which will be a crucial tool for the development, testing, and selection of a novel generation of AD drug candidates targeting Abeta/alpha7nAChR complexes with high specificity and fewer side effects compared to currently approved alpha7nAChR drugs.
