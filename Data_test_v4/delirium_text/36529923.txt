36529923|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction caused by sepsis that manifests as a range of brain dysfunctions from delirium to coma. It is a relatively common complication of sepsis associated with poor patient prognosis and mortality. The pathogenesis of SAE involves neuroinflammatory responses, neurotransmitter dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, abnormal blood flow regulation, etc. Neuroinflammation caused by hyperactivation of microglia is considered to be a key factor in disease development, which can cause a series of chain reactions, including BBB disruption and oxidative stress. Metabolic reprogramming has been found to play a central role in microglial activation and executive functions. In this review, we describe the pivotal role of energy metabolism in microglial activation and functional execution and demonstrate that the regulation of microglial metabolic reprogramming might be crucial in the development of clinical therapeutics for neuroinflammatory diseases like SAE.
