31804347|t|Perioperative outcomes in geriatric patients undergoing hip fracture surgery with different anesthesia techniques: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
31804347|a|BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses assessing anesthetic techniques in adult patients undergoing hip fractures surgery are available. However, whether the anesthetic technique is associated with risk of mortality and complications in geriatric patients with hip fractures remains unclear. This study was conducted to assess postoperative outcomes of anesthesia technique in geriatric patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. METHODS: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CNKI, and CBM were searched from inception up to May 25, 2018. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the perioperative outcomes of technique of anesthesia (general or regional [epidural/spinal/neuraxial]) in geriatric patients (>=60 years old) undergoing hip fracture surgery were included. Two investigators independently screened studies for inclusion and performed data extraction. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I and Chi-square tests. The odds ratio (OR) of the dichotomous data, mean difference (MD) of continuous data, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the pooled data. RESULTS: Eleven retrospective and 2 RCTs were included. There was no difference in 30-day mortality (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.86-1.08; P = .51) between the general and regional anesthesia groups. In-hospital mortality (OR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.17-1.36; P < .001), acute respiratory failure (OR = 2.66; 95% CI 2.34-3.02; P < .001), length of hospital stay (MD = 0.33; 95% CI 0.24-0.42; P < .001), and readmission (OR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.18; P = .03) were significantly reduced in the regional anesthesia group. Pneumonia (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.91-1.07; P = .79), heart failure (OR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.86-1.09; P = .62), acute myocardial infraction (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.99-1.16; P = .10), acute renal failure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 0.97-1.79; P = .07), cerebrovascular accident (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.82-1.42; P = .58), postoperative delirium (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 0.16-13.97; P = .72), and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 0.84-2.38; P = .19) were similar between the two anesthetic techniques. CONCLUSION: General anesthesia is associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, longer hospital stays, and higher readmission. There is evidence to suggest that regional anesthesia is associated with improved perioperative outcomes. Large RCTs are needed to explore the most optimal anesthetic techniques for geriatric patients with hip fractures before drawing final conclusions. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018093582.
