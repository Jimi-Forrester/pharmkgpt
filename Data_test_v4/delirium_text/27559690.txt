27559690|a|In 2008, using a model of compression brain ischemia, we presented the first evidence that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants of the SkQ family, i.e. SkQR1 [10-(6'-plastoquinonyl)decylrhodamine], have a neuroprotective action. It was shown that intraperitoneal injections of SkQR1 (0.5-1 mumol/kg) 1 day before ischemia significantly decreased the damaged brain area. Later, we studied in more detail the anti-ischemic action of this antioxidant in a model of experimental focal ischemia provoked by unilateral intravascular occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The neuroprotective action of SkQ family compounds (SkQR1, SkQ1, SkQTR1, SkQT1) was manifested through the decrease in trauma-induced neurological deficit in animals and prevention of amyloid-beta-induced impairment of long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices. At present, most neurophysiologists suppose that long-term potentiation underlies cellular mechanisms of memory and learning. They consider inhibition of this process by amyloid-beta1-42 as an in vitro model of memory disturbance in Alzheimer's disease. Further development of the above studies revealed that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants could retard accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau-protein, as well as amyloid-beta1-42, and its precursor APP in the brain, which are involved in developing neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease.
