37588010|t|Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for early-onset Alzheimer's disease - A case report.
37588010|a|Background: Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a rare form of AD defined as exhibiting signs and symptoms before age 65. Several studies have shown high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to be an effective treatment for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD when applied to the left and/or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with clear improvements found on standardized assessments of cognitive function. Case report: Here, we present a case report of a 44-year-old patient with clinical and laboratory characteristics of definite early-onset AD. Findings: rTMS led to marked cognitive improvements. We hope to inspire more clinical interest in exploring rTMS for treatment of dementia.
