39455919|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are significant neurodegenerative disorders with increasing prevalence worldwide. Lifestyle and dietary factors, including micronutrients, have been suggested as modifiable risk factors for disease development. This study aims to investigate the association between micronutrients and cognitive ability in these diseases. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 105 participants with MCI and AD was conducted. Dietary assessments were performed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and micronutrient intake was calculated based on nutrient content. Disease severity was evaluated using the Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST). Statistical analyses, including correlation coefficients and multiple regression models, were employed to examine the association between micronutrients and disease progression. RESULTS: The results revealed significant correlations between disease severity and several micronutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids (B = -0.2, P = 0.01), carotenoids (B = -0.19, P = 0.02), dietary antioxidant compounds, including vitamins A, C, D, E (B = -0.19, P = 0.02), selenium (B = -0.17, P = 0.03), alpha-carotene (B = -0.16, P = 0.04), beta-carotene (B = -0.17, P = 0.03), and lycopene (B = -0.16, P = 0.04). Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids was associated with slower disease progression. Furthermore, the levels of these micronutrients declined in advanced stages of the disease. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acids and carotenoids may affect the cognitive ability and disease progression. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causality and explore the therapeutic implications of these findings for the prevention and management of MCI and AD.
