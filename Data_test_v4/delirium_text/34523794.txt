34523794|t|Adiponectin improves amyloid-beta 31-35-induced circadian rhythm disorder in mice.
34523794|a|Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone, which is closely associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has potential preventive and therapeutic significance. In the present study, we explored the relationship between adiponectin and circadian rhythm disorder in AD, the effect of adiponectin on the abnormal expression of Bmal1 mRNA/protein induced by amyloid-beta protein 31-35 (Abeta31-35), and the underlying mechanism of action. We found that adiponectin-knockout mice exhibited amyloid-beta deposition, circadian rhythm disorders and abnormal expression of Bmal1. Adiponectin ameliorated the abnormal expression of the Bmal1 mRNA/protein caused by Abeta31-35 by inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). These results suggest that adiponectin deficiency could induce circadian rhythm disorders and abnormal expression of the Bmal1 mRNA/protein, whilst exogenous administration of adiponectin may improve Abeta31-35-induced abnormal expression of Bmal1 by inhibiting the activity of GSK3beta, thus providing a novel idea for the treatment of AD.
