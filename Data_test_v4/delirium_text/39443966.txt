39443966|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive dysfunction in older adults. One of the AD pathological factors, beta-Amyloid (Abeta), triggers inflammatory responses and phagocytosis of microglia. C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) induces over-reactive inflammatory responses in several virus infections. Yet, the role of CLEC5A in AD progression remains unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the contribution of CLEC5A to Abeta-induced microglial activation and behavioral deficits. METHODS: The AD mouse model was crossed with Clec5a knockout mice for subsequent behavioral and pathological tests. The memory deficit was revealed by the Morris water maze, while the nociception abnormalities were examined by the von Frey filament and hotplate test. The Abeta deposition and microglia recruitment were identified by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The inflammatory signals were identified by ELISA and western blotting. In the Clec5a knockdown microglial cell model and Clec5a knockout primary microglia, the microglial phagocytosis was revealed using the fluorescent-labeled Abeta. RESULTS: The AD mice with Clec5a knockout improved Abeta-induced memory deficit and abnormal nociception. These mice have reduced Abeta deposition and increased microglia coverage surrounding the amyloid plaque, suggesting the involvement of CLEC5A in AD progression and Abeta clearance. Moreover, the phagocytosis was also increased in the Abeta-stressed Clec5a knockdown microglial cell lines and Clec5a knockout primary microglia. CONCLUSION: The Clec5a knockout ameliorates AD-like deficits by modulating microglial Abeta clearance. This study implies that targeting microglial Clec5a could offer a promising approach to mitigate AD progression.
