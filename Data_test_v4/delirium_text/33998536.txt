33998536|t|Baseline Neurodegeneration Influences the Longitudinal Effects of Tau on Cognition.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to test whether t-tau influences the longitudinal effects of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phospho-tau (p-tau) on memory and executive function (EF) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: 319 MCI individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with baseline and 2-year CSF Abeta, p-tau, t-tau, and neuropsychological assessments were studied. Mediation and moderation analyses evaluated the role of t-tau in the effects of Abeta and p-tau on memory and EF over 2 years. RESULTS: We found that high baseline p-tau but not Abeta was associated with higher t-tau and lower memory scores at 2 years follow-up. The association between p-tau and memory impairment was partially mediated by t-tau, whereby higher p-tau was indirectly associated with lower memory via higher t-tau. t-tau also moderated the association between p-tau and memory. When t-tau level was relatively lower, higher p-tau was associated with lower memory scores at 2 years. When t-tau level was higher, the memory scores were low regardless of the p-tau level. CONCLUSION: Tau-induced neurodegeneration is one key pathway by which AD pathology (p-tau) affects memory impairment. Furthermore, in individuals with lower levels of tau-induced neurodegeneration, higher levels of p-tau were required for memory impairment. Our findings suggest that t-tau plays a significant role in how early AD pathology affects cognitive outcomes.
