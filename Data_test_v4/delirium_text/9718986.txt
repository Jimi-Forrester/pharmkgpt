9718986|t|Vitronectin expression in Purkinje cells in the human cerebellum.
9718986|a|Vitronectin (Vn) is a multi-functional protein that has a role in cell adhesion, and regulation of complement and blood coagulation. It has been shown to colocalize with amyloid beta peptide containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's (AD) disease. Its normal localization in human brain tissue has not been described. In this study, Vn immunoreactivity in Purkinje cells in the human cerebellar cortex is demonstrated. This staining was present in sections from both neurologically normal and disease-affected cases. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction procedures, Vn mRNA was detected in RNA extracted from human cerebellum and cortex, from human NT2-derived neurons and from undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.
