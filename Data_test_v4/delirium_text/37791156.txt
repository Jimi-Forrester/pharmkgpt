37791156|t|Multimodal Management of Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome in a 17-Year-Old Male.
37791156|a|New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is a clinical presentation, not a specific diagnosis, in which healthy people are suddenly struck by prolonged seizures that do not respond to at least two anti-seizure drugs and do not have a clear structural, toxic, or metabolic cause.Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is considered a sub-category of NORSE. Our patient is a 17-year-old male admitted to the pediatric ward after a self-limited convulsive episode at home, noted to occur following five days of upper respiratory infection symptoms accompanied by fever. After multiple generalized tonic-clonic seizures necessitating treatment, he went into status epilepticus despite multiple antiepileptic drugs. The possibility of FIRES had been considered from the onset of refractory status epilepticus; as a result, an intensive multimodal treatment regimen was proactively implemented with some clinical improvement.
