36839300|a|The defense mechanism against harmful stimuli is inflammation. Indeed, neurodegenerative disorders can arise as a result of a persistent neuroinflammation. Beta-amyloid (Abeta1-42) is an early trigger in the origination of Alzheimer's disease, leading to synaptic and cognitive impairments. Virgin olive oil (VOO) is correlated with a decreased risk of developing immune-inflammatory disorders, but the potential effects of the phenolic fraction (PF) from VOO in the modulation of neuroinflammatory processes in neutrophils remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the ability of the PF to modulate the activation of Abeta1-42-stimulated primary human neutrophils, focusing on the expression of gene and surface markers and the release of pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant mediators. Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in Abeta1-42-treated neutrophils, among other changes, was reported. Furthermore, pretreatment with PF prevented neutrophil activation. The beneficial effects in the modulation of inflammatory responses show the relevance of VOO to achieve a healthier diet that can help prevent inflammatory diseases.
