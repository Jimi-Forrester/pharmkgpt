33675348|t|Distribution and metabolism of [14C]-resveratrol in human prostate tissue after oral administration of a "dietary-achievable" or "pharmacological" dose: what are the implications for anticancer activity?
33675348|a|BACKGROUND: The dietary polyphenol resveratrol prevents various malignancies in preclinical models, including prostate cancer. Despite attempts to translate findings to humans, gaps remain in understanding pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relations and how tissue concentrations affect efficacy. Such information is necessary for dose selection and is particularly important given the low bioavailability of resveratrol. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine concentrations of resveratrol in prostate tissue of men after a dietary-achievable (5 mg) or pharmacological (1 g) dose. We then examined whether clinically relevant concentrations of resveratrol/its metabolites had direct anticancer activity in prostate cell lines. METHODS: A window trial was performed in which patients were allocated to 5 mg or 1 g resveratrol daily, or no intervention, before prostate biopsy. Patients (10/group) ingested resveratrol capsules for 7-14 d before biopsy, with the last dose [14C]-labeled, allowing detection of resveratrol species in prostate tissue using accelerator MS. Cellular uptake and antiproliferative properties of resveratrol/metabolites were assessed in cancer and nonmalignant cell cultures using HPLC with UV detection and cell counting, respectively. RESULTS: [14C]-Resveratrol species were detectable in prostate tissue of all patients analyzed, with mean +- SD concentrations of 0.08 +- 0.04 compared with 22.1 +- 8.2 pmol/mg tissue for the 5 mg and the 1 g dose, respectively. However, total [14C]-resveratrol equivalents in prostate were lower than we previously reported in plasma and colorectum after identical doses. Furthermore, resveratrol was undetectable in prostate tissue; instead, sulfate and glucuronide metabolites dominated. Although resveratrol reduced prostate cell numbers in vitro over 7 d, the concentrations required (>=10 microM) exceeded the plasma maximum concentration. Resveratrol mono-sulfates and glucuronides failed to consistently inhibit cell growth, partly due to poor cellular uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Low tissue concentrations of resveratrol species, coupled with weak antiproliferative activity of its conjugates, suggest daily doses of <=1 g may not have direct effects on human prostate.This trial was registered at clinicaltrialsregister.eu as EudraCT 2007-002131-91.
