33522564|t|Associations of Salivary Total Antioxidant Capacity With Cortical Amyloid-Beta Burden, Cortical Glucose Uptake, and Cognitive Function in Normal Aging.
33522564|a|BACKGROUND: Determining susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in asymptomatic individuals requires from noninvasive, simple, and inexpensive markers that can be easily obtained in primary care settings. While saliva meets all these requirements, there is a lack of evidence linking salivary constituents to in vivo AD pathology in aging. METHODS: We examined the potential of salivary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) for identifying global cortical amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden, deficits in regional glucose uptake, and poorer cognition in 71 cognitively normal older adults. We further assessed whether salivary TAC-related cognitive performance was associated with higher Abeta load and lower cortical glucose consumption. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses adjusted by age, sex, years of education, and ApoE4 status showed that salivary TAC was associated with slower processing speed and poorer sustained attention, as well as with higher Abeta load and lower glucose metabolism in cortical regions vulnerable to cognitive aging and AD. Results also revealed that lower scores in processing speed and sustained attention were associated with greater Abeta burden and lower regional glucose consumption, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings support the use of salivary TAC for preventive screening and detection of cerebral vulnerability to AD. Further research is needed to evaluate the utility of salivary TAC as a clinical marker.
