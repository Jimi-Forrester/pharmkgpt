15541707|t|Cognitive reserve and the neurobiology of cognitive aging.
15541707|a|A hypothetical construct of "cognitive reserve" is widely used to explain how, in the face of neurodegenerative changes that are similar in nature and extent, individuals vary considerably in the severity of cognitive aging and clinical dementia. Intelligence, education and occupational level are believed to be major active components of cognitive reserve. Here, we summarize the main features of cognitive aging and their neuropathological correlates. We describe the neurobiology of cognitive aging and conclude that perturbations of neural health attributable to oxidative stress and inflammatory processes alone are insufficient to distinguish cognitive aging from Alzheimer's disease. We introduce the concept of cognitive reserve and illustrate its utility in explaining individual differences in cognitive aging. Structural and functional brain imaging studies suggest plausible neural substrates of cognitive reserve, probably involving processes that support neuroplasticity in the aging brain. The cognitive reserve hypothesis conforms with reported associations between early and mid life lifestyle choices, early education, lifelong dietary habit, leisure pursuits and the retention of late life mental ability.
