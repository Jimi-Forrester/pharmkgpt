36290992|t|Systematic Screening of Trigger Moieties for Designing Formaldehyde Fluorescent Probes and Application in Live Cell Imaging.
36290992|a|Formaldehyde (FA) is involved in multiple physiological regulatory processes and plays a crucial role in memory storage. Meanwhile, FA has a notorious reputation as a toxic compound, and it will cause a variety of diseases if its level is unbalanced in the human body. To date, there have been numerous fluorescent probes for FA imaging reported. Among them, the probes based on the 2-aza-Cope rearrangement have attracted the most attention, and their applications in cell imaging have been greatly expanded. Herein, we screened the various trigger moieties of FA fluorescent probes based on the mechanism of 2-aza-Cope rearrangement. FA-2, in which a fluorophore is connected to a 4-nitrobenzylamine group and an allyl group, demonstrated the highest sensitivity, selectivity, and reaction kinetics. Furthermore, FA-Lyso, derived from FA-2, has been successfully designed and applied to monitor exogenous and endogenous FA fluctuations in lysosomes of living cells.
