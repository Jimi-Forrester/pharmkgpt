37748061|a|AMPA receptors (AMPARs) play a critical role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and dysfunction or dysregulation of AMPARs could lead to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the dynamics and/or longitudinal changes of AMPARs in vivo during AD pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, employing 5xFAD SEP-GluA1 KI mice, we investigated endogenous AMPA receptor dynamics in a whisker deflection-associated Go/No-go learning paradigm. We found a significant increase in synaptosomal AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 in WT mice after learning, while no such changes were detected in 7-mo-old 5xFAD mice. Daily training led to an increase in endogenous spine surface GluA1 in Control mice, while this increase was absent in 5xFAD-KI mice which correlates with its learning defects in Go/No-go paradigm. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the onset of abnormal AMPAR dynamics corresponds temporally with microglia and astrocyte overactivation. Our results have shown that impairments in endogenous AMPA receptor dynamics play an important role in learning deficits in 5xFAD mice and AD pathogenesis.
