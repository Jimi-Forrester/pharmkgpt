36535944|a|The elevation of cytokine levels in body fluids has been associated with numerous health conditions. The detection of these cytokine biomarkers at low concentrations may help clinicians diagnose diseases at an early stage. Here, we report an asymmetric geometry MoS2 diode-based biosensor for rapid, label-free, highly sensitive, and specific detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine. This sensor is functionalized with TNF-alpha binding aptamers to detect TNF-alpha at concentrations as low as 10 fM, well below the typical concentrations found in healthy blood. Interactions between aptamers and TNF-alpha at the sensor surface induce a change in surface energy that alters the current-voltage rectification behavior of the MoS2 diode, which can be read out using a two-electrode configuration. The key advantages of this diode sensor are the simple fabrication process and electrical readout, and therefore, the potential to be applied in a rapid and easy-to-use, point-of-care, diagnostic tool.
