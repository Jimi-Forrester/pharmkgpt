38799246|t|Knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 among Indian medical undergraduates: a questionnaire-based study.
38799246|a|Background: The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) has emerged as a recent pandemic, increasing the need for epidemiological studies and studies on public health. Only some studies have evaluated the awareness of medical undergraduates in India and other countries, leading to a lack of literature. Methods: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, India, between June to August 2020. An online survey using Google Forms was circulated among undergraduate medical students in India by a convenient sampling method for data collection. Descriptive analysis was derived based on frequencies and percentages, and the association with age, gender, and year of undergraduate training medical course was derived using the chi-square test. Results: Altogether, 630 students from India responded to the survey, with a maximum response from students studying in the second year (38.7%). Nearly 63.85% of responders identified themselves as females. Knowledge regarding the human-to-human transmission of the virus, symptoms, complications, definition of "close contact, quarantine, and its indications was adequate among the students, with more than 70% correct responses. However, one-fourth of the students needed to gain more knowledge about masks. Respiratory hygiene was poor among 24.8%. Nearly 40% of students were unaware of the management of patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: There is a need for regular quality training and institutional programs on infection control of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases across all Indian medical colleges to educate undergraduate medical students, who are future healthcare professionals, thus minimizing the risk of transmission and providing standardized care for patients.
