32911797|a|Maternal influenza A viral infections in humans are associated with low birth weight, increased risk of pre-term birth, stillbirth and congenital defects. To examine the effect of maternal influenza virus infection on placental and fetal growth, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intranasally with influenza A virus A/CA/07/2009 pandemic H1N1 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at E3.5, E7.5 or E12.5, and the placentae and fetuses collected and weighed at E18.5. Fetal thymuses were pooled from each litter. Placentae were examined histologically, stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD34 (hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen) and vascular channels quantified. RNA from E7.5 and E12.5 placentae and E7.5 fetal thymuses was subjected to RNA sequencing and pathway analysis. Placental weights were decreased in litters inoculated with influenza at E3.5 and E7.5. Placentae from E7.5 and E12.5 inoculated litters exhibited decreased labyrinth development and the transmembrane protein 150A gene was upregulated in E7.5 placentae. Fetal weights were decreased in litters inoculated at E7.5 and E12.5 compared to controls. RNA sequencing of E7.5 thymuses indicated that 957 genes were downregulated >=2-fold including Mal, which is associated with Toll-like receptor signaling and T cell differentiation. There were 28 upregulated genes. It is concluded that maternal influenza A virus infection impairs fetal thymic gene expression as well as restricting placental and fetal growth.
