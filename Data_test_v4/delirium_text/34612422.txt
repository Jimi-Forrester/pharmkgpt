34612422|t|Molecular mechanisms of resveratrol and EGCG in the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation and disruption of Abeta42 protofibril: similarities and differences.
34612422|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) into fibrillary deposits is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and inhibiting Abeta aggregation and clearing Abeta fibrils are considered as promising strategies to treat AD. It has been reported that resveratrol (RSV) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), two of the most extensively studied natural polyphenols, are able to inhibit Abeta fibrillization and remodel the preformed fibrillary aggregates into amorphous, non-toxic species. However, the mechanisms by which RSV inhibits Abeta42 aggregation and disrupts Abeta42 protofibril, as well as the inhibitory/disruptive mechanistic similarities and differences between RSV and EGCG, remain mostly elusive. Herein, we performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on Abeta42 dimers (the early aggregation state of Abeta42) and protofibrils (the intermediate of Abeta42 fibril formation and elongation) in the absence/presence of RSV or EGCG molecules. Our simulations show that both RSV and EGCG can bind with Abeta42 monomers and inhibit the dimerization of Abeta42. The binding of RSV with Abeta42 peptide is mostly viapi-pi stacking interactions, while the binding of EGCG with Abeta42 is mainly through hydrophobic, pi-pi stacking, and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Moreover, both RSV and EGCG disrupt the beta-sheet structure and K28-A42 salt bridges, leading to a disruption of Abeta42 protofibril structure. RSV mainly binds with residues whose side-chains point inwards from the surface of the protofibril, while EGCG mostly binds with residues whose side-chains point outwards from the surface of the protofibril. Furthermore, RSV interacts with Abeta42 protofibrils mostly viapi-pi stacking interactions, while EGCG interacts with Abeta42 protofibrils mainly via hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. For comparison, we also explore the effects of RSV/EGCG molecules on the aggregation inhibition and protofibril disruption of the Iowa mutant (D23N) Abeta. Our findings may pave the way for the design of more effective drug candidates as well as the utilization of cocktail therapy using RSV and EGCG for the treatment of AD.
