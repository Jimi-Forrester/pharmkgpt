38214579|t|Borneol-Modified Schisandrin B Micelles Cross the Blood-Brain Barrier To Treat Alzheimer's Disease in Aged Mice.
38214579|a|Objective: Schisandrin B (Sch B) is a bioactive dibenzocyclooctadiene derizative that is prevalent in the fruit of Schisandra chinensis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Sch B has a neuroprotective action by reducing oxidative stress and effectively preventing inflammation. It follows that Sch B is a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the drug's solubility, bioavailability, and lower permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can all reduce its efficacy during the therapy process. Therefore, this study constructed borneol-modified schisandrin B micelles (Bor-Sch B-Ms), which increase brain targeting by accurately delivering medications to the brain, effectively improving bioavailability. High therapeutic efficacy has been achieved at the pathological site. Methods: Bor-Sch B-Ms were prepared using the thin film dispersion approach in this article. On the one hand, to observe the targeting effect of borneol, we constructed a blood-brain barrier (BBB) model in vitro and studied the ability of micelles to cross the BBB. On the other hand, the distribution of micelle drugs and their related pharmacological effects on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage were studied through in vivo administration in mice. Results: In vitro studies have demonstrated that the drug uptake of bEnd.3 cells was increased by the borneol alteration on the surface of the nano micelles, implying that Bor-Sch B-Ms can promote the therapeutic effect of N2a cells. This could result in more medicines entering the BBB. In addition, in vivo studies revealed that the distribution and circulation time of medications in the brain tissue were significantly higher than those in other groups, making it more suitable for the treatment of central nervous system diseases. Conclusion: As a novel nanodrug delivery system, borneol modified schisandrin B micelles have promising research prospects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
