35647570|a|Background: Filipino Americans (FAs) are the third-largest Asian American subgroup in the United States (US). Some studies showed that FAs experience more cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) than other Asian subgroups and non-Hispanic Whites. The increased prevalence of CMD observed in FAs could be due to genetics and social/dietary lifestyles. While FAs are ascribed as an Asian group, they have higher burdens of CMD, and adverse social determinants of health compared to other Asian subgroups. Therefore, studies to elucidate how FAs might develop CMD and respond to medications used to manage CMD are warranted. The ultimate goals of this study are to identify potential mechanisms for reducing CMD burden in FAs and to optimize therapeutic drug selection. Collectively, these investigations could reduce the cardiovascular health disparities among FAs. Rationale and design: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological design to enroll 300 self-identified Filipino age 18 yrs. or older without a history of cancer and/or organ transplant from Virginia, Washington DC, and Maryland. Once consented, a health questionnaire and disease checklist are administered to participants, and anthropometric data and other vital signs are collected. When accessible, we collect blood samples to measure basic blood biochemistry, lipids, kidney, and liver functions. We also extract DNA from the blood or saliva for genetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. CMD prevalence in FAs will be compared to the US population. Finally, we will conduct multivariate analyses to ascertain the role of genetic and non-genetic factors in developing CMD in FAs. Virginia Commonwealth University IRB approved all study materials (Protocol HM20018500). Summary: This is the first community-based study to involve FAs in genomics research. The study is actively recruiting participants. Participant enrollment is ongoing. At the time of this publication, the study has enrolled 97 participants. This ongoing study is expected to inform future research to reduce cardiovascular health disparities among FAs.
