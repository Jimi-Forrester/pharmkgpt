37283724|a|Recent studies uncovered that Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a common, opportunistic bacterium in the oral cavity, is associated with a growing number of systemic diseases, ranging from colon cancer to Alzheimer's disease. However, the pathological mechanisms responsible for this association are still poorly understood. Here, we leverage recent technological advances to study the interactions between Fn and neutrophils. We show that Fn survives within human neutrophils after phagocytosis. Using in vitro microfluidic devices, we determine that human neutrophils can protect and transport Fn over large distances. Moreover, we validate these observations in vivo by showing that neutrophils disseminate Fn using a zebrafish model. Our data support the emerging hypothesis that bacterial dissemination by neutrophils is a mechanistic link between oral and systemic diseases. Furthermore, our results may ultimately lead to therapeutic approaches that target specific host-bacteria interactions, including the dissemination process.
