38434059|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that causes increased memory loss, mood swings, behavioral disorders, and disruptions in daily activities. Polymer scaffolds for the brain have been grown under laboratory, physiological, and pathological circumstances because of the limitations of conventional treatments for patients with central nervous system diseases. The blood-brain barrier prevents medications from entering the brain, challenging AD treatment. Numerous biomaterials such as biomolecules, polymers, inorganic metals, and metal oxide nanoparticles have been used to transport therapeutic medicines into the nervous system. Incorporating biocompatible materials that support neurogenesis through a combination of topographical, pharmacological, and mechanical stimuli has also shown promise for the transfer of cells to replenish dopaminergic neurons. Components made of naturally occurring biodegradable polymers are appropriate for the regeneration of nerve tissue. The ability of natural-based materials (biomaterials) has been shown to promote endogenous cell development after implantation. Also, strategic functionalization of polymeric nanocarriers could be employed for treating AD. In particular, nanoparticles could resolve Abeta aggregation and thus help cure Alzheimer's disease. Drug moieties can be effectively directed to the brain by utilizing nano-based systems and diverse colloidal carriers, including hydrogels and biodegradable scaffolds. Notably, early investigations employing neural stem cells have yielded promising results, further emphasizing the potential advancements in this field. Few studies have fully leveraged the combination of cells with cutting-edge biomaterials. This study provides a comprehensive overview of prior research, highlighting the pivotal role of biomaterials as sophisticated drug carriers. It delves into various intelligent drug delivery systems, encompassing pH and thermo-triggered mechanisms, polymeric and lipid carriers, inorganic nanoparticles, and other vectors. The discussion synthesizes existing knowledge and underscores the transformative impact of these biomaterials in devising innovative strategies, augmenting current therapeutic methodologies, and shaping new paradigms in the realm of Alzheimer's disease treatment.
