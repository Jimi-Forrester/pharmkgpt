35889377|a|Roasting is a key step for preparing sesame oil that leads to important changes in its organoleptic properties and quality. In this study, white sesame seeds were roasted for 20 min in an electric oven at different temperatures (120, 150, 180, 210, 250 and 300  C). The oils extracted from unroasted and roasted seeds were compared for their chemical composition: fatty acids (including trans isomers), phytosterols, lignans (sesamin and sesamolin), tocopherols and total phenolic compounds, as well as their oxidative stability and antiradical capacity. There were no obvious differences in the oil densities, refractive indexes or iodine values, but the saponification values were affected by temperature. Relevant primary and secondary lipid oxidation were observed at T > 250  C, resulting in a higher p-anisidine value and K232 as well as K268 values. Roasting improved oil yield (from 33.5 to 62.6%), increased its induction period (from 5.5 to 10.5 h) and enhanced the total phenolic content (from 152 to 194 mg/100 g) and antiradical activity of the extracted oil. Depending on roasting temperature, a gradual decline was recorded in total amounts of phytosterols (up to 17.4%), gamma-tocopherol (up to 10.6%), sesamolin (maximum of 27.5%) and sesamin (maximum of 12.5%). All the investigated oils presented a low quantity in triglyceride polymers, clearly below the maximum tolerated quantity according to the European regulation. The optimal roasting temperature for obtaining high nutritional grade oil within the permissible values was 210  C. The unsaponifiable components (including lignans and sterols) extracted from roasted seeds have been shown to be natural additives to fresh meatball products to extend shelf life. The results of this study may help to boost the nutritional content of plant-based diets by allowing for the use of roasted sesame seed oil and its components.
