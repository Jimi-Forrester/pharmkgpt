15844755|t|Cholesterol and apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease.
15844755|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in North America and Europe. The incidence of the disease rises dramatically with age. AD is a complex multifactorial disorder that involves numerous susceptibility genes, but the exact pathogenesis and biochemical basis of AD is not well understood Cholesterol is receiving a great deal of attention as a potentially crucial factor in the etiology of AD. Almost all cholesterol in the brain is synthesized in the brain. Cholesterol exits the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the form of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) or by first being converted to a more polar compound, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is elevated in individuals with AD. The key event leading to AD appears to be the formation and aggregation in the brain of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, a proteolytically derived product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cholesterol has been demonstrated to modulate processing of APP to Abeta. High levels of cholesterol are associated with increased risk of AD. Patients taking cholesterol-lowering statins have a lower prevalence of AD. ApoE, which transports cholesterol throughout the brain, exhibits an isoform-specific association with AD such that the E4 isoform, by unknown mechanisms, shifts the onset curve toward an earlier age.
