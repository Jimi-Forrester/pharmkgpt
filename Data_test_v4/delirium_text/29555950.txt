29555950|t|Zinc ion rapidly induces toxic, off-pathway amyloid-beta oligomers distinct from amyloid-beta derived diffusible ligands in Alzheimer's disease.
29555950|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Zinc (Zn) ion interacts with the pathogenic hallmark, amyloid-beta (Abeta), and is enriched in senile plaques in brain of AD patients. To understand Zn-chelated Abeta (ZnAbeta) species, here we systematically characterized ZnAbeta aggregates by incubating equimolar Abeta with Zn. We found ZnAbeta40 and ZnAbeta42 both form spherical oligomers with a diameter of ~12-14 nm composed of reduced beta-sheet content. Oligomer assembly examined by analytical ultracentrifugation, hydrophobic exposure by BisANS spectra, and immunoreactivity of ZnAbeta and Abeta derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) are distinct. The site-specific 13C labeled solid-state NMR spectra showed that ZnAbeta40 adopts beta-sheet structure as in Abeta40 fibrils. Interestingly, removal of Zn by EDTA rapidly shifted the equilibrium back to fibrillization pathway with a faster kinetics. Moreover, ZnAbeta oligomers have stronger toxicity than ADDLs by cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. The ex vivo study showed that ZnAbeta oligomers potently inhibited hippocampal LTP in the wild-type C57BL/6JNarl mice. Finally, we demonstrated that ZnAbeta oligomers stimulate hippocampal microglia activation in an acute Abeta-injected model. Overall, our study demonstrates that ZnAbeta rapidly form toxic and distinct off-pathway oligomers. The finding provides a potential target for AD therapeutic development.
