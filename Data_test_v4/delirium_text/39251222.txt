39251222|t|[Significance and Response to APOE Genetic Testing in the Anti-amyloid-beta Therapy Era].
39251222|a|Conventionally, APOE genetic testing has not been recommended as a component of the standard diagnostic and management practices for Alzheimer's disease. However, recent research highlights the importance of this test, particularly for assessment of the safety profile of anti-amyloid-beta therapies. Therefore, the current United States guidelines for the administration of lecanemab explicitly advise APOE genetic testing. However, integration of this testing into clinical practice is associated with many clinical, ethical, legal, and economic challenges. It is important to initiate comprehensive discussions to address these multifaceted issues in Japan.
