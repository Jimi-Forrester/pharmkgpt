18547874|a|Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a pivotal role in centrally-mediated physiological responses including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of IL-6 are elevated in multiple pathophysiological conditions including Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune disease, and meningitis. Despite this, the effect of IL-6 on central regulation of sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) remains unknown which limits understanding of sympathetic-immune interactions in health and disease. In the present study we determined the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v, lateral ventricle) administration of IL-6 on splenic SND in urethane-chloralose-anesthetized rats. A second goal was to determine if icv injected IL-6 enters the brain parenchyma and acts as a volume transmission signal to access areas of the brain involved in regulation of sympathetic nerve outflow. i.c.v administration of IL-6 (10 ng, 100 ng, and 400 ng) significantly and progressively increased splenic SND from control levels in baroreceptor-denervated Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of 100-ng and 400-ng IL-6 resulted in significantly higher SND responses when compared to those elicited with a 10-ng dose. Sixty minutes following icv administration, fluorescently labeled IL-6 was not distributed throughout the parenchyma of the brain but was localized to the periventricular areas of the ventricular system. Brain sections counter-stained for the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) revealed that IL-6 and the IL-6R were co-localized in periventricular areas adjoining the third ventricle. These results demonstrate that icv IL-6 administration increases splenic SND, an effect likely achieved via signaling mechanisms originating in the periventricular cells.
