34849851|a|The striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex is a highly conserved eukaryotic signaling hub involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. In filamentous fungi, STRIPAK controls multicellular development, hyphal fusion, septation, and pathogenicity. In this study, we analyzed the role of the STRIPAK complex in the nematode-trapping fungus Duddingtonia flagrans which forms three-dimensional, adhesive trapping networks to capture Caenorhabditis elegans. Trap networks consist of several hyphal loops which are morphologically and functionally different from vegetative hyphae. We show that lack of the STRIPAK component SipC (STRIP1/2/HAM-2/PRO22) results in incomplete loop formation and column-like trap structures with elongated compartments. The misshapen or incomplete traps lost their trap identity and continued growth as vegetative hyphae. The same effect was observed in the presence of the actin cytoskeleton drug cytochalasin A. These results could suggest a link between actin and STRIPAK complex functions.
