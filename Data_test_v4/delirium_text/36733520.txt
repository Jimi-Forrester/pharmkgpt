36733520|t|The predictors of postoperative delirium at surgical units in Sudan: A multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective study.
36733520|a|Background: Knowledge of potential and amenable risk factors involved in the development of postoperative delirium (POD) is imperative for successful prevention and subsequent management. Objective: The current study objective was to delineate the risk factors associated with the occurrence of POD among patients undergoing surgical procedures. Methods: This multi-center (6 hospitals), cross-sectional prospective hospital-based study recruited 415 subjects aged >=50 years who were scheduled to undergo different types of surgery. Delirium Observational Screening Scale used for the diagnosis of POD. Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire used for assessing the nutritional and the hydration status of patients. Pre and postoperative risk factors analyzed by univariate (chi square) and then multivariate analyses and the incidence rate of POD, was reported. Results: The main outcome measure was the development of POD. Out of the 385, only 43 subjects (11.2%) developed POD. High American Society of Anesthesiologists score (OR: 10.76, 95% CI: 1.379-83.99, P =0.023), duration of surgery (OR: 5.426, 95% CI: [2.249-13.092]; P =0.0001), were the strongest independent risk factors for the development of POD. Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living score (OR: 3.227, 95% CI: [1.177-8.844], P =0.023), and age >= 70 years (OR: 1.174, 95% CI: [1.015-1.359]; P =0.027) were additional strongest independent risk factors for the development of POD. Conclusion: Based on analysis or study, we found High American Society of Anesthesiologist sore, Katz-ADL, duration of surgery, and advanced age were predictors of POD. Our findings suggest preventive measures initiated in subjects identified at risk of developing POD. These results support the healthcare providers in the early prevention, diagnosis, and timely management of POD.
