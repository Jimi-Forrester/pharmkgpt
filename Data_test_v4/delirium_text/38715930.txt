38715930|a|Aim: Reducing the blood transfusion volume is important in severe trauma. We hypothesized that carbazochrome sodium sulfonate (CSS) combined with tranexamic acid (TXA) would reduce blood transfusions in severe trauma. Methods: From April 2017 to March 2023, data were collected from patients (aged >=16 years) admitted to our hospital for trauma and administered packed red blood cells (pRBC) and plasma transfusions within 12 h postinjury. Patients infused with CSS and TXA (CSS + TXA group) were compared with those infused with TXA alone (TXA group). The outcomes were blood product transfusion volumes within and after 24 h, the number of patients receiving >6 units of pRBC transfusion after 24 h, duration of intensive care unit and in-hospital stays, and 28-day in-hospital mortality. Results: In total, 138 patients were included in the study. In the univariate analyses, the CSS + TXA group (n = 62) showed a significant reduction in the total pRBC transfusion volume, in-hospital days, and number of patients receiving >6 units of pRBCs in the delayed phase. Based on the multivariate logistics regression analysis, only the CSS + TXA group had a significantly lower adjusted odds ratio for receiving >6 units of pRBC transfusion after 24 h. During the in-hospital days, the CSS + TXA group did not experience an increased incidence of major complications when compared with the TXA group. Conclusion: In patients with trauma, treatment with CSS with TXA may reduce the requirement for blood transfusion after 24 h. Moreover, this treatment can improve admission outcomes without increasing complications.
