26257808|a|BACKGROUND: Critical care patients are at higher risk for untreated pain. Pain has persistent and untreated effects on most of the body systems and results in development of complications, chronic pain, and increased length of stay. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the implementation of a pain management program on the length of stay in patients with decreased level of consciousness, admitted in Al-Zahra hospital intensive care units (ICUs) in 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial, 50 subjects with decreased level of consciousness were selected by convenient sampling from the ICU wards of Al-Zahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran and were randomly assigned to two groups of study and control. Pain management program was applied on the study group and routine care was implemented in the control group. Data including demographic data and length of stay of patients in the ICUs were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test, independent t-test, and paired t-test. RESULTS: Results showed that out of 50 subjects attending the study, there were 40% female and 60% male subjects in study, and 52% female and 48% male subjects in control group. (P = 0.395). Overall mean length of stay of the patients in the ICUs was significantly lower in the case group [3.2 (1.4)] days compared to the control group [7.4 (4.8) days] (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that overall mean length of stay of patients in the ICUs was significantly lower in the study group compared to the control group. It is suggested to use this program for patients in ICUs with decreased level of consciousness after a general surgery.
