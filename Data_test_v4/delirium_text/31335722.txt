31335722|a|BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of multiple training modalities (MTM) on senior fitness and neuropsychiatric function in the elderly with subjective memory complaints (SMC). METHODS: This study was conducted in 24 elderly subjects with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0 and instrument of ascertainment of dementia 8 (AD8) score of <2. The participants were classified into SMC (n = 7) and non-SMC (n = 17).All were assigned to receive multiple training modalities (1 hour for each training: physical fitness activities, calligraphy or drawing, and meditation) twice a week over a 16-week period.A series of senior fitness test, and neuropsychiatric tests, namely the Traditional Chinese version Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), were conducted before and after the intervention. We compared the differences of pre/posttest-MTM and SMC/non-SMC in senior fitness and the neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between SMC and non-SMC groups in demographic characteristics. MTM showed significant improvement in senior fitness and CESD, but not in CASI and MMSE. Significant change in recent memory subscale of CASI was only observed in SMC group, whereas improvement of partial senior fitness and CESD were observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: MTM had effects in enhancing senior fitness and improving depressive syndromes in the elderly. MTM contributed to greater improvement in recent memory function in the SMC group than in the non-SMC group.
