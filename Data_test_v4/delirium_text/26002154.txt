26002154|t|Methods to monitor monocytes-mediated amyloid-beta uptake and phagocytosis in the context of adjuvanted immunotherapies.
26002154|a|Antibody-mediated capture of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in peripheral blood was identified as an attractive strategy to eliminate cerebral toxic amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and murine models. Alternatively, defective capacity of peripheral monocytes to engulf Abeta was reported in individuals with AD. In this report, we developed different approaches to investigate cellular uptake and phagocytosis of Abeta, and to examine how two immunological devices--an immunostimulatory Adjuvant System and different amyloid specific antibodies--may affect these biological events. Between one and thirteen months of age, APPswe X PS1.M146V (TASTPM) AD model mice had decreasing concentrations of Abeta in their plasma. In contrast, the proportion of blood monocytes containing Abeta tended to increase with age. Importantly, the TLR-agonist containing Adjuvant System AS01B primed monocytes to promote de novo Abeta uptake capacity, particularly in the presence of anti-Abeta antibodies. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that cells achieved Abeta uptake and internalization followed by Abeta degradation via mechanisms that required effective actin polymerization and proteolytic enzymes such as insulin-degrading enzyme. We further demonstrated that both Abeta-specific monoclonal antibodies and plasma from Abeta-immunized mice enhanced the phagocytosis of 1 mum Abeta-coated particles. Together, our data highlight a new biomarker testing to follow amyloid clearance within the blood and a mechanism of Abeta uptake by peripheral monocytes in the context of active or passive immunization, and emphasize on novel approaches to investigate this phenomenon.
