30852877|t|Global Synchronization Index as an Indicator for Tracking Cognitive Function Changes in a Traumatic Brain Injury Patient: A Case Report.
30852877|a|Traumatic brain injury is a main cause of long-term neurological disability, and many patients suffer from cognitive impairment for a lengthy period. Cognitive impairment is a fatal malady to that limits active rehabilitation, and functional recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury. In severe cases, it is impossible to assess cognitive function precisely, and severe cognitive impairment makes it difficult to establish a rehabilitation plan, as well as evaluate the course of rehabilitation. Evaluation of cognitive function is essential for establishing a rehabilitation plan, as well as evaluating the course of rehabilitation. We report a case of the analysis of electroencephalography with global synchronization index and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography applied, for evaluation of cognitive function that was difficult with conventional tests, due to severe cognitive impairment in a 77-year-old male patient that experienced traumatic brain injury.
