31460317|a|Intracellular thiols (e.g., cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione) play critical roles in biological functions. Glutathione is the most abundant cellular thiol which is important for preserving redox homeostasis in biosystems. Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) for selective detection of thiol-containing biomolecules through the combination of self-assembly of monodisperse carbon-encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and in situ photopolymerization. Typically, the polyacrylamide-based PCs were prepared by a cross-linking agent containing disulfide bonds. Interestingly, the specific chemical reaction between the disulfide bonds and thiol-containing biomolecules leads to the decrease of the cross-linking degree for the RPCs, triggering the swelling of the hydrogel and increase of the NP lattice spacing. The reduced glutathione (10-6 to 10-2 mol/L) can be determined by measuring the diffracted wavelength or visually observing the structural color change. Moreover, the RPCs can be used to detect different kinds of thiol-containing biomolecules by a simple color variation due to different reaction rates between disulfide bonds and different thiol-containing biomolecules. This study provides a facile yet effective strategy for visualized determination of the thiol-containing biomolecules.
