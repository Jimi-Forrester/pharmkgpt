34681392|a|Few studies have documented the effects of fermented milk on intestinal colitis, which are mediated by regulating various microbial and inflammatory processes. Here, we investigated the effects of fermented milk with Lactobacillus paracasei PS23 on intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in vivo. As L. paracasei PS23 grew poorly in milk, a coculture strategy with yogurt culture was provided to produce fermented milk (FM). The results indicated that the coculture exhibited a symbiotic effect, contributing to the better microbial and physicochemical property of the fermented milk products. We further evaluated the anti-colitis effect of fermented milk with L. paracasei PS23 in vitro. Both PS23-fermented milk (PS23 FM) and its heat-killed counterpart (HK PS23 FM) could protect or reverse the increased epithelial permeability by strengthening the epithelial barrier function in vitro by increasing transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). In vivo analysis of the regulation of intestinal physiology demonstrated that low-dose L. paracasei PS23-fermented ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, with a significant attenuation of the bleeding score and reduction of fecal calprotectin levels. This anti-colitis effect may be exerted by deactivating the inflammatory cascade and strengthening the tight junction through the modification of specific cecal bacteria and upregulation of short-chain fatty acids. Our findings can clarify the role of L. paracasei PS23 in FM products when cocultured with yogurt culture and can elucidate the mechanisms of the anti-colitis effect of L. paracasei PS23 FM, which may be considered for therapeutic intervention.
