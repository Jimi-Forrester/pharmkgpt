35080744|a|Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have great capacity for immune regulation. MSCs provide protective paracrine effects, which are partially exerted by extracellular vesicles (EVs). It has been reported that MSCs-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) contain soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and even microRNAs, which confer them similar anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects to MSCs. Moreover, MSCs modulate microglia activation through a dual mechanism of action that relies both on cell contact and secreted factors. Microglia cells are the central nervous system immune cells and the main mediators of the inflammation leading to neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we investigated whether MSC-EVs affect the activation of microglia cells by beta-amyloid aggregates. We show that the presence of MSC-EVs can prevent the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and nitric oxide (NO). Both are up-regulated in neurodegenerative diseases representing chronic inflammation, as in Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that MSC-EVs are internalized by the microglia cells. Further, our study supports the use of MSC-EVs as a promising therapeutic tool to treat neuroinflammatory diseases.Significance StatementIt has been reported that mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles have therapeutic effects in the treatment of various degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Extracellular vesicles are loaded with proteins, lipids and RNA and act as intercellular communication mediators. Here we show that extracellular vesicles can be taken up by murine microglial cells. In addition, they partially reduce the activation of microglial cells against beta-amyloid aggregates. This inhibition of microglia activation may present an effective strategy for the control/therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
