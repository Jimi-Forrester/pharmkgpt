10961441|t|Clinical experience with Cerebrolysin.
10961441|a|Cerebrolysin is a peptidergic drug which displays neurotrophic action in various animal models. It is used for the treatment of dementia and in this report we provide evidence for the long-term clinical efficacy of Cerebrolysin in Alzheimer's disease. This evidence is based on our clinical experience with Cerebrolysin, stemming from our participation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a compassionate use programme initiated thereafter, and a PET study. Our data suggests, that Cerebrolysin is a safe and effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease and that repeat treatments may maintain function in patients over the long-term.
