34458787|t|Site-specific single point mutation by anthranilic acid in hIAPP8-37 enhances anti-amyloidogenic activity.
34458787|a|Amylin or hIAPP, together with insulin, plays a significant role in glucose metabolism. However, it undergoes beta-sheet rich amyloid formation associated with pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction leading to type-2 diabetes (T2D). Recent studies suggest that restricting beta-sheet formation in it may halt amyloid formation, which may limit the risk for the disease. Several peptide-based inhibitors have been reported to prevent aggregation. However, most of them have limitations, including low binding efficiency, active only at higher doses, poor solubility, and proteolytic degradation. Insertion of non-coded amino acids renders proteolytically stable peptides. We incorporated a structurally rigid beta-amino acid, Anthranilic acid (Ant), at different sites within the central hydrophobic region of hIAPP and developed two singly mutated hIAPP8-37 peptidomimetics. These peptidomimetics inhibited the amyloid formation of hIAPP substantially even at low concentration, as evident from in vitro ThT, CD, FT-IR, TEM, and Congo red staining birefringence results. These peptidomimetics also disrupted the preformed aggregates formed by hIAPP into non-toxic species. These beta-amino acid-based peptidomimetics can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards T2D or other protein misfolding diseases.
