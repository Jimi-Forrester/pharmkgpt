26180207|t|Network Disruption and Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-Beta and Phospho-Tau Levels in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
26180207|a|Synaptic dysfunction is a core deficit in Alzheimer's disease, preceding hallmark pathological abnormalities. Resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to assess whether functional connectivity patterns, as an index of synaptic dysfunction, are associated with CSF biomarkers [i.e., phospho-tau (p-tau) and amyloid beta (Abeta42) levels]. We studied 12 human subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, comparing those with normal and abnormal CSF levels of the biomarkers. We also evaluated the association between aberrant functional connections and structural connectivity abnormalities, measured with diffusion tensor imaging, as well as the convergent impact of cognitive deficits and CSF variables on network disorganization. One-third of the patients converted to Alzheimer's disease during a follow-up period of 2.5 years. Patients with abnomal CSF p-tau and Abeta42 levels exhibited both reduced and increased functional connectivity affecting limbic structures such as the anterior/posterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial temporal areas in different frequency bands. A reduction in posterior cingulate functional connectivity mediated by p-tau was associated with impaired axonal integrity of the hippocampal cingulum. We noted that several connectivity abnormalities were predicted by CSF biomarkers and cognitive scores. These preliminary results indicate that CSF markers of amyloid deposition and neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease associate with a dual pattern of cortical network disruption, affecting key regions of the default mode network and the temporal cortex. MEG is useful to detect early synaptic dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease brain pathology in terms of functional network organization. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this preliminary study, we used magnetoencephalography and an integrative approach to explore the impact of CSF biomarkers, neuropsychological scores, and white matter structural abnormalities on neural function in mild cognitive impairment. Disruption in functional connectivity between several pairs of cortical regions associated with abnormal levels of biomarkers, cognitive deficits, or with impaired axonal integrity of hippocampal tracts. Amyloid deposition and tau protein-related neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease are associated with synaptic dysfunction and a dual pattern of cortical network disorganization (i.e., desynchronization and hypersynchronization) that affects key regions of the default mode network and temporal areas.
