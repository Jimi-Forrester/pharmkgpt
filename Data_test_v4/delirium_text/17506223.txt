17506223|t|Common genetic factors for depression and cardiovascular disease.
17506223|a|There is increasing knowledge regarding the considerable comorbidity between depression and cardiovascular disease, which are two of the most common disorders in developed countries. The associated vulnerability is not unidirectional, as the presence of cardiovascular disease can also influence mood states. Although this may be the result of psychological factors, common biological mechanisms, including genetic ones, are thought to be responsible for this interaction; we can thus question whether variations in genes could be predisposing factors. Regarding the multiple interactions in the mechanisms between depression and cardiovascular system disorders, e.g., dysfunctions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and sympathoadrenal axis and the response to stress, the importance of the serotonergic and immune systems, or the impact on the renin-angiotensin system, several candidate genes are being investigated. However, despite the interest in unraveling the potential susceptibility genes for both disorders, most available studies have so far dealt with the impact of polymorphisms in relation to either depression or cardiovascular disease. A few recent studies have now examined the effects of gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, and are investigating the impact of "depression-related" variants on cardiac response to stress. The first promising results were obtained with the serotonin transporter, and it may be hypothesized that this polymorphism interacts via the impact of the S allele on depression and via the effect of the L allele on platelet activation. However, the role played by various other candidate genes remains to be determined, especially regarding the question as to whether they are indicative of common pathophysiological mechanisms, or for identifying a subgroup of patients with somatic disorders that are more closely related to psychiatric symptoms.
