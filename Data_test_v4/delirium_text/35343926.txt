35343926|t|Using a real-time ABCDEF compliance tool to understand the role of bundle elements in mortality and delirium.
35343926|a|BACKGROUND: ABC-123, a novel Epic electronic medical record real-time score, assigns 0 to 3 points per bundle element to assess ABCDEF bundle compliance. We sought to determine if maximum daily ABC-123 score (ABC-MAX), individual bundle elements, and mobility were associated with mortality and delirium-free/coma-free intensive care unit (DF/CF-ICU) days in critically injured patients. METHODS: We reviewed 6 months of single-center data (demographics, Injury Severity Score [ISS], Abbreviated Injury Scale of the head [AIS-Head] score, ventilator and restraint use, Richmond Agitation Sedation Score, Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, ABC-MAX, ABC-123 subscores, and mobility level). Hospital mortality and likelihood of DF/CF-ICU days were endpoints for logistic regression with ISS, AIS-Head, surgery, penetrating trauma, sex, age, restraint and ventilator use, ABC-MAX or individual ABC-123 subscores, and mobility level or a binary variable representing any improvement in mobility during admission. RESULTS: We reviewed 172 patients (69.8% male; 16.3% penetrating; median age, 50.0 years [IQR, 32.0-64.8 years]; ISS, 17.0 [11.0-26.0]; AIS-Head, 2.0 [0.0-3.0]). Of all patients, 66.9% had delirium, 48.8% were restrained, 51.7% were ventilated, and 11.0% died. Age, ISS, AIS-Head, and penetrating mechanism were associated with increased mortality. Restraints were associated with more than 70% reduction in odds of DF/CF-ICU days. Maximum daily ABC-123 score and mobility level were associated with decreased odds of death and increased odds of DF/CF-ICU days. Any improvement in mobility during hospitalization was associated with an 83% reduction in mortality odds. A and C subscores were associated with increased mortality, and A was also associated with decreased DF/CF-ICU days. B and D subscores were associated with increased DF/CF-ICU days. D and E subscores were associated with decreased mortality. CONCLUSION: Maximum daily ABC-123 score is associated with reduced mortality and delirium in critically injured patients, while mobility is associated with dramatic reduction in mortality. B and D subscores have the strongest positive effects on both mortality and delirium. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III.
