30774334|t|Effect of superparamagnetic nanoparticles coated with various electric charges on alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid proteins fibrillation process.
30774334|a|BACKGROUND: Most of nanoparticles are nontoxic and have high absorption capability. Therefore, nanoparticles binding can effectively restrain fibrillation of beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein proteins and eventually prevent the toxicity of pathogenesis peptide of Alzheimer. Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) contain iron oxide core which can be connected to a special part through magnetic coating. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the effect of SPIONs with different charges was simultaneously examined on the fibrillation of both beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein proteins by applying Thioflavin-T assay. RESULTS: According to the results of the investigation on amyloid-fibrillation mechanism in both beta-amyloids and alpha-synucleins, it was revealed that negatively-charged nanoparticles encoded to -COOH by dextran-coating were able to have a considerable absorption decrease from 17,000-12,000 after 320 minutes delay to lag phase and decrease in binding level of thioflavin-T particles to beta-sheets. CONCLUSION: The different concentrations of these nanoparticles and special coating of each particle had an effect on the kinetics of beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein fibrillations.
