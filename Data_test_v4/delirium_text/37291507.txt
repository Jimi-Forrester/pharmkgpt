37291507|t|The effects of the administration sequence and the type of hypnotics on the development of remifentanil-induced chest wall rigidity: a randomized controlled trial.
37291507|a|BACKGROUND: Research on remifentanil-induced chest wall rigidity is limited. Furthermore, its incidence is unknown, and the clinical factors influencing its development remain unclear. This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of the administration sequence of hypnotics and remifentanil as well as the type of hypnotic administered on the development of remifentanil-induced chest wall rigidity. METHODS: A total of 125 older patients aged [Formula: see text] 65 years, who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia, were enrolled in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups; Thio-Remi, Pro-Remi, Remi-Thio, or Remi-Pro. After confirming the loss of consciousness and achieving a target effect-site concentration of 3 ng/mL remifentanil, the development of remifentanil-induced chest wall rigidity was evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of chest wall rigidity was significantly higher in the remifentanil-hypnotic group than in the hypnotic-remifentanil (opposite sequence) group (55.0% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that remifentanil-hypnotic administration was a significant predictor of the development of chest wall rigidity (crude odds ratio 4.42, 95% confidence interval 1.99; 9.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with hypnotics potentially reduces the development of chest wall rigidity during the induction of balanced anesthesia with remifentanil in older patients.
