31797041|a|PURPOSE: This study reviews our experience with deep neck space infections (DNIs) requiring surgical intervention, including cervical necrotizing fasciitis. The aim of the study was to identify predisposing and aggravating factors of the disease and recognize the possible factors that can lead to life-threatening complications and slow down the healing process. METHODS: We compare the results to previous data from 1985 to 2005 to find possible alterations and changing trends. The characteristics of four lethal cases are described. This retrospective analysis includes patient data from 2004 to 2015 in tertiary referral hospital and in total, 277 patients were found. RESULTS: Surgical drainage through a neck opening +- intraoral incision was made in 215 (77.6%) patients, an intraoral incision was only made in 62 patients (22.4%). ICU care was needed in 66 (23.8%) cases. Odontogenic etiology (44.8%) was the most common origin. The most common comorbidity was a psychiatric disorder and/or dementia and occurred in 55 (19.9%) patients. Patients with underlying illnesses were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (p = 0.020), required a longer ICU stay (p = 0.004) and repeated surgery (p = 0.009). Gas formation seemed to be predictive of a more severe course of infection. Early extraction of the odontogenic foci was related to a lower length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: The annual numbers have risen from 14 to 24 cases per year when compared to previous data. DNIs remain a cause of lethal complications; the mortality was 1.4% and overall complications occurred in 61 (22.0%) patients.
