31916975|a|Therapeutic patient education (TPE) is the process by which health professionals impart information to help patients self-manage their chronic disease: it is an essential part of treatment of long-term diseases and conditions. Memory loss and other cognitive disorders are usually considered as obstacles to TPE for patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders (ADRD). Over 100 patients with different forms of ADRD and caregivers have benefited from TPE programs since 2011 at the Limoges University Clinical and Research Memory Center. Participants report better understanding of the disease and improved relationships. TPE may prevent anxiety and depression in patient and in caregivers, and reduce burden of caregivers. General guidelines and perspectives for TPE in ADRD are outlined.
