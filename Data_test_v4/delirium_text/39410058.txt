39410058|a|(1) Background: The non-enzymatic glycation of proteins is a significant contributor to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and intermediates that are responsible for diabetic complications. It is imperative to explore effective inhibitors to prevent protein glycation. (2) Methods: This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory potential of various aqueous ethanol extracts of poplar-type propolis on AGEs and oxidative modifications in bovine serum albumin (BSA)-glucose and BSA-methylglyoxal models. (3) Results: The results revealed that these propolis extracts exhibited significant effectiveness in inhibiting the formation of total AGEs, pentosidine, and Nepsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML). Furthermore, the investigation discovered that these propolis extracts can effectively inhibit oxidative modification, based on measuring the levels of carbonyl and thiol groups and analyzing tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Notably, 75% ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity, surpassing the chemical inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG). (4) Conclusions: The remarkable anti-glycation potency of aqueous ethanol extracts of poplar-type propolis can be attributed to their elevated contents of phenolic compounds, especially abundant flavonoids, which inhibit the formation of AGEs by scavenging free radicals, decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and capturing reactive carbonyl species (RCS) in the protein glycation process. Our results indicate that poplar-type propolis may be a potential AGE inhibitor and could be used to develop functional foods and nutraceuticals to prevent diabetic complications.
