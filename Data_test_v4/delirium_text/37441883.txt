37441883|a|BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of cases being reported of neurological manifestations of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and monkeypox, both during the course of the infection and as a presenting symptom. We aim to review the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and monkeypox in pediatric patients and their management. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review that included cohort studies and case series or reports involving a pediatric population of patients with a confirmed COVID-19 or monkeypox infection and their neurological manifestations. We searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. RESULTS: From 1136 articles identified, 127 studies were included. Headache, stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, seizure, nerve palsies, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were the most common neurological symptoms caused by COVID-19, whereas encephalitis was commonly seen in patients with monkeypox. Rare neurological manifestations of COVID-19 included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, plexopathies, demyelinating disorders, encephalitis, etc., and rare neurological manifestations of monkeypox included headache. CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the importance of investigating possible neurological manifestations and closely monitoring these patients to develop a better understanding of the treatment strategies that can be adopted.
