27813444|a|Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be challenging as numerous diseases mimic the characteristics of AD. In this light, recent guidelines developed by different associations and working groups point out the need for biomarkers to support AD diagnosis. This paper discusses 18F-labeled radiotracers (which are indicated for PET imaging of the brain) and ongoing clinical studies that aim to generate new evidence for the usage of amyloid imaging. In addition to their relatively long half-life, these agents are known for their high sensitivity and high negative predictive values for detection of neuritic Abeta plaques. Comparisons with other biomarkers are provided and implications of diagnostic disclosures discussed. Finally, recent data from clinical trials underscore the importance of amyloid PET for detecting, quantifying and monitoring Abeta plaque deposits.
