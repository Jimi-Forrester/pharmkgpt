37895109|a|Recently, an increase in the incidence of brain tumors has been observed in the most industrialized countries. This event triggered considerable interest in the study of heavy metals and their presence in the environment (air, water, soil, and food). It is probable that their accumulation in the body could lead to a high risk of the onset of numerous pathologies, including brain tumors, in humans. Heavy metals are capable of generating reactive oxygen, which plays a key role in various pathological mechanisms. Alteration of the homeostasis of heavy metals could cause the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and induce DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and the alteration of proteins. A large number of studies have shown that iron, cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, and mercury levels were significantly elevated in patients affected by gliomas. In this study, we try to highlight a possible correlation between the most frequently encountered heavy metals, their presence in the environment, their sources, and glioma tumorigenesis. We also report on the review of the relevant literature.
