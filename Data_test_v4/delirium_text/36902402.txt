36902402|t|Deferiprone and Iron-Maltol: Forty Years since Their Discovery and Insights into Their Drug Design, Development, Clinical Use and Future Prospects.
36902402|a|The historical insights and background of the discovery, development and clinical use of deferiprone (L1) and the maltol-iron complex, which were discovered over 40 years ago, highlight the difficulties, complexities and efforts in general orphan drug development programs originating from academic centers. Deferiprone is widely used for the removal of excess iron in the treatment of iron overload diseases, but also in many other diseases associated with iron toxicity, as well as the modulation of iron metabolism pathways. The maltol-iron complex is a recently approved drug used for increasing iron intake in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, a condition affecting one-third to one-quarter of the world's population. Detailed insights into different aspects of drug development associated with L1 and the maltol-iron complex are revealed, including theoretical concepts of invention; drug discovery; new chemical synthesis; in vitro, in vivo and clinical screening; toxicology; pharmacology; and the optimization of dose protocols. The prospects of the application of these two drugs in many other diseases are discussed under the light of competing drugs from other academic and commercial centers and also different regulatory authorities. The underlying scientific and other strategies, as well as the many limitations in the present global scene of pharmaceuticals, are also highlighted, with an emphasis on the priorities for orphan drug and emergency medicine development, including the roles of the academic scientific community, pharmaceutical companies and patient organizations.
