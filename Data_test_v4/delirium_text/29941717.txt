The pathological changes include the formation of senile plaques-containing beta-amyloid (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), loss of neurons, and synapses. So far, the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. This study was aimed to review the major pathogenesis of AD-related to the published AD studies in recent 20 years. DATA SOURCES: The author retrieved information from the PubMed database up to January 2018, using various search terms and their combinations, including AD, Abeta, NFTs, pathogenesis, and genetic mutation. STUDY SELECTION: The author included data from peer-reviewed journals printed in English and Chinese on pathophysiological factors in AD. He organized these informations to explain the possible pathogenesis in AD. RESULTS: There are many amounts of data supporting the view that AD pathogenesis so far there mainly are Abeta toxicity, tau protein, gene mutation, synaptic damages, intermediate neurons and network abnormalities, changes in mitochondrial function, chemokines, etc., Its nosogenesis may be involved in multiple theories and involved in multiple molecular signaling pathways, including Abeta, tau protein, and synaptic anomaly; mutual relationship between the mechanisms urge jointly neuronal degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the research advances in the pathogenesis of AD. Future research has needed to fully disclose the association between multiple pathogenesis at the same time to interdict multiple signaling pathways, etc.
