35279225|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuroinflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, in particular Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Alterations in the blood-brain barrier may allow peripheral blood lymphocytes to enter the central nervous system; these may participate in disease pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the peripheral blood lymphocyte profiles of patients with AD and PD and their association with the disease and its progression. METHODS: The study included 20 patients with AD, 20 with PD, and a group of healthy individuals. Ten of the patients with AD and 12 of those with PD were evaluated a second time 17 to 27 months after the start of the study. Lymphocyte subpopulations and their activation status were determined by flow cytometry. All patients underwent neurological examinations using internationally validated scales. RESULTS: Compared to healthy individuals, patients with AD and PD showed significantly higher levels of activated lymphocytes, lymphocytes susceptible to apoptosis, central memory T cells, and regulatory T and B cells. As the diseases progressed, there was a significant decrease in activated cells (CD4+ CD38+ and CD8+ CD38+ in PD and AD, CD4+ CD69+ and CD8+ CD69+ in PD), T cells susceptible to apoptosis, and some regulatory populations (CD19+ CD5+ IL10+ in PD and AD, CD19+ CD5+ IL10+ FoxP3+, CD4+ FoxP3+ CD25+ CD45RO+ in PD). In patients with AD, disease progression was associated with lower percentages of CD4+ CD38+ cells and higher percentages of effector CD4 cells at the beginning of the study. Significant differences were observed between both diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotypes associated with AD and PD and their severity. Considering effective blood-brain communication, our results open new avenues of research into immunomodulation therapies to treat these diseases.
