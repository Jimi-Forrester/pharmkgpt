27479259|a|Emergence Delirium in children after general anesthesia is a common and self limitating event. Although it might be seen as being harmless it can cause other serious complications and might leave both parents and other caregivers with a negative impression behind. Although the cause may still not be clear, potential predictors can be named: preschool age, the use of fast acting volatile anesthestics, higher preoperative anxiety levels and postoperative pain.A child-focused approach to reduce preoperative anxiety focusing on distraction methods rather than pharmacological sedation may be the key as well as sufficient postoperative pain control and the use of total intravenous anesthesia. Parenteal presence during induction of anaesthesia (PPIA) may be beneficial to reduce preoperative anxiety levels, but has failed to prove a better outcome regarding ED.The use of age adopted scores/scales to diagnose ED and Pain are mandatory.In the case of an ED event it is most important to protect the child from self injury and the loss of the iv-line. Postoperative pian needs to be ruled out before treating ED. Most cases can be treated by interrupting the situation and putting the child "back to sleep". Short acting drugs as Propofol have been used successfully due to its pharmacodynamics and short acting profile. Alternatively alpha-agonists or ketamin may be preferred by other authors. If potential predictors and a positive history are present, prophylactic treatment should be considered. A TIVA or the use of alpha-2-agonists have proven to be successful in reducing the risk of an ED. Midazolam may reduce preoperative anxiety but not the incidence of ED and should therefore be used carefully and is not a good choice in PACU for the treatment of ED.Parents who witnessed ED in their children should be guided and followed up. Explaining this phenomenon to parents beforehand should be part of the pre anaesthesia clinic talk and written consent.Standard protocols should be in place for treatment in the postoperative period.
