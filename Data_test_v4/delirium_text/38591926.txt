38591926|t|Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Informant Assessment of Geriatric Delirium Scale.
38591926|a|Background and purpose: <p>Delirium is a common complication developing in el&shy;der&shy;ly patients. Therefore, it is important to diagnose delirium earlier. Family caregivers&nbsp;play an active role in early diagnosis of de&shy;lirium and build a bridge between health pro&shy;fessionals and patients. The purpose of this research was to achieve the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Informant Assessment of Geriatric Delirium Scale (I-AGeD).</p>. Methods: <p>This is a methodological study. The sample comprised 125 caregivers ac&shy;cepting to participate in the study and offering care to older patients with hip fracture aged &ge;60 years. Data were gathered preoperatively and on postoperative days 0, 1 and 2. After achieving the linguistic and content validity of the scale, the known-groups comparison was used to achieve its construct validity. The ROC curve analysis was made to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the scale. Item-total correlations, item analysis based on the difference between the upper 27% and lower 27%, Kuder&ndash;Richardson 20 (KR-20) coefficient and parallel forms reliability with the NEECHAM Confusion Scale were adapted to assess discriminant indices of the items in the I-AGeD.</p>. Results: <p>The item-total correlation coeffi&shy;cients of the scale ranged from 0.54 to 0.89 and KR-20 coefficient ranged from 0.09 to 0.91 depending on the measurement times. According to the ROC curve analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the scale were &ge; 91% and &ge; 96% respectively. The parallel forms reliability analysis showed a highly significant, strong negative relation at each measurement between the I-AGeD and the NEECHAM Confusion Scale.&nbsp;</p>. Conclusion: <p>The I-AGeD is valid and reliable to diagnose delirium in older Turkish patients in perioperative processes.</p>.
