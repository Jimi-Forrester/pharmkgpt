25206534|a|Mice carrying mutant amyloid-beta precursor protein and presenilin-1 genes (APP/PS1 double transgenic mice) have frequently been used in studies of Alzheimer's disease; however, such studies have focused mainly on hippocampal and cortical changes. The severity of Alzheimer's disease is known to correlate with the amount of amyloid-beta protein deposition and the number of dead neurons in the locus coeruleus. In the present study, we assigned APP/PS1 double transgenic mice to two groups according to age: young mice (5-6 months old) and aged mice (16-17 months old). Age-matched wild-type mice were used as controls. Immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (a marker of catecholaminergic neurons in the locus coeruleus) revealed that APP/PS1 mice had 23% fewer cells in the locus coeruleus compared with aged wild-type mice. APP/PS1 mice also had increased numbers of cell bodies of neurons positive for tyrosine hydroxylase, but fewer tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers, which were also short, thick and broken. Quantitative analysis using unbiased stereology showed a significant age-related increase in the mean volume of tyrosine droxylase-positive neurons in aged APP/PS1 mice compared with young APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the mean volume of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons was positively correlated with the total volume of the locus coeruleus. These findings indicate that noradrenergic neurons and fibers in the locus coeruleus are predisposed to degenerative alterations in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice.
