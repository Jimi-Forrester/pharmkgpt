35127437|a|COVID-19 can cause irreversible lung damage from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic respiratory failure associated with post COVID-19 de novo fibrosis or worsening of an underlying fibrotic lung disease. Pregnant women are at increased risk for invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 22,000 hospitalizations and 161 deaths for COVID-19 in pregnant women. Between August 2020 and September 2021, five patients underwent bilateral lung transplant (LT) for COVID-19 ARDS at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. De-identified demographics data, clinical characteristics, perioperative challenges, explanted lung pathology, and post-transplant outcomes are described. In post-hospitalization follow-up (median survival 273 days), we see improving endurance and excellent lung function. One patient did not survive to hospital discharge and succumbed to complications 5 months after LT. We report the first cases of bilateral LT in two postpartum women.
