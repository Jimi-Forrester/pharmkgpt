36157835|a|BACKGROUND: Hypoxemia is a common complication in older patients during postoperative recovery and can cause pulmonary complications. Therefore, reducing the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia is a clinical concern. AIM: To investigate the clinical efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNCO) in the resuscitation period of older orthopedic patients. METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 60 older patients who underwent orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups: those who used conventional face mask and those who used HFNCO. All patients were treated with 60% oxygen for 1 h after extubation. Patients in the conventional face mask group were treated with a combination of air (2 L) and oxygen (2 L) using a traditional mask, whereas those in the HFNCO group were treated with HFNCO at a constant temperature of 34  C and flow rate of 40 L/min. We assessed the effectiveness of oxygen therapy by monitoring the patients' arterial blood gas, peripheral oxygen saturation, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The characteristics of the patients were comparable between the groups. One hour after extubation, patients in HFNCO group had a significantly higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen (paO2) than that of patients in conventional face mask group (P < 0.001). At extubation and 1 h after extubation, patients in both groups showed a significantly higher arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (paCO2) than the baseline levels (P < 0.001). There were no differences in the saturation of peripheral oxygen, paO2, and paCO2 between the groups before anesthesia and before extubation (P > 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in paO2 between the two groups before anesthesia and 1 h after extubation and immediately after extubation and 1 h after extubation (P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the oxygen tolerance score before leaving the room, airway humidification, and pulmonary complications 3 d after surgery between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: HFNCO can improve oxygen partial pressure and respiratory function in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery under general endotracheal anesthesia. Thus, HFNCO can be used to prevent postoperative hypoxemia.
