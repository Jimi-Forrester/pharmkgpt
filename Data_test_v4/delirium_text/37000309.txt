37000309|a|PURPOSE: The actual state of mental health care use and related factors in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer is not well understood in Japan. This study aimed to (1) examine the actual state of mental health care use among AYA patients with cancer and (2) describe socio-demographic and related factors associated with mental health care use. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of AYA patients with cancer aged 15-39 who first visited the National Cancer Center Hospital in Japan (NCCH) between January 2018 and December 2020. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between social background characteristics and mental health care use. The association between the patient's course of cancer treatment and mental health care use was analyzed to help identify which patients might benefit from early mental health intervention. RESULTS: Among 1,556 patients, 945 AYA patients with cancer were registered. The median age at the time of the study was 33 years (range, 15-39 years). The prevalence of mental health care use was 18.0% (170/945). Age 15-19 years, female gender, urogenital cancer, gynecological cancer, bone or soft tissue cancer, head and neck cancer, and stage II-IV disease were associated with mental health care use. Regarding treatment, palliative treatment, chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were associated with mental health care use. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with mental health care use were identified. Our findings potentially contribute to psychological support interventions for AYA patients with cancer.
