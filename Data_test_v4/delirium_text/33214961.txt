33214961|t|Cystocerebral Syndrome: An Updated Review and a New Proposed Mechanism for an Often Forgotten Cause of Delirium.
33214961|a|Cystocerebral syndrome is an often forgotten cause of delirium in elderly males, which is quite easily treated. We reviewed the current body of literature documenting cystocerebral syndrome and proposed a new mechanism of action explaining why all patients identified thus far have been male. Data was obtained from articles describing cases of cystocerebral syndrome, urinary retention, and confusion in addition to delirium via a PubMed database search. We reviewed all articles describing cases of cystocerebral syndrome via the PubMed database using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords of "cystocerebral syndrome," urinary retention and confusion," and "delirium and urinary retention or cystocerebral syndrome," and identified eight cases of cystocerebral syndrome including the original publication by Blackburn and Dunn. We found that all patients reported in the literature were males older than 70 years and often with concomitant benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) who presented with acute episodes of delirium that rapidly responded to bladder decompression. The authors seek to update the medical community regarding this uncommon phenomenon of delirium in elderly male patients. We also propose that the lack of female patients in the literature is reflective of their decreased intraurethral flow resistance as is currently being described in other avenues of research in the field of urodynamics.
