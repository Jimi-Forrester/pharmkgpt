30529383|t|Postoperative Outcomes in SAVR/TAVR Patients With Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.
30529383|a|To assess the predictive value of preoperative cognitive impairment on postoperative in-hospital, short-term, and mid-term outcomes among patients undergoing surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Articles were identified in EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed. Eligible articles compared the outcomes of patients with and without preoperative cognitive impairment who underwent aortic valve replacement and were published in English between January 1, 1997 and November 1, 2017. The quality of included observational studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The strength of the body of evidence was also assessed. A total of 6163 abstracts were screened by 2 independent reviewers and 31 full-text articles were reviewed. Eight studies met inclusion criteria. The studies included 1 case-control, 5 prospective cohort, and 2 retrospective cohort studies. Given the paucity and heterogeneity of studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Five studies were of good quality. Preoperative cognitive impairment is a risk factor for postoperative delirium in 2 studies, increased mid-term mortality in 2 studies, and increased length of stay, risk of discharge to a health-care facility or progressive disability in 1 study. However, given the paucity and methodological flaws of the included studies, the body of evidence on the predictive value of preoperative cognitive impairment on postoperative outcomes remains weak. This systematic review highlights the need for more good quality studies to provide evidence regarding the incidence of cognitive impairment and associations with poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement.
