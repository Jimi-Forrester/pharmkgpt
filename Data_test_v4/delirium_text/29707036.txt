29707036|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of chlorogenic acids (CGAs) intake on cognitive function. METHODS: In this pilot study, the Cogstate and CNS Vital Signs test batteries were used to evaluate cognitive function in 8 healthy elderly men and women complaining of subjective memory loss after a 6-month intake of a test beverage containing 330 mg of CGAs just before bedtime. RESULTS: After a 6-month CGA intake period, significant improvement was observed in the One Back Test of the Cogstate, the Shifting Attention Test, and Finger Tapping Test as well as in the composite memory, verbal memory, complex attention, cognitive flexibility, executive function, and motor speed domains of the CNS Vital Signs test battery. CONCLUSION: A 6-month intake of CGAs may improve attentional, executive, and memory functions in the elderly with complaints of subjective memory loss.
