38261256|t|Association Between Neurodegenerative Diseases and an Increased Risk of Epilepsy Based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
38261256|a|Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by transient brain dysfunction, attributed to a multitude of factors. The purpose of this study is to explore whether neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), have a causal effect on epilepsy. Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used to analyze the causal association between neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, ALS, and MS) and epilepsy based on single nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies, including inverse-variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, and weighted mode methods. The reliability and stability of the MR analysis results were assessed by the MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO, and heterogeneity tests. Forty-three SNPs were selected for the MR analysis of MS and epilepsy. The inverse-variance weighted method showed a significant causal association between MS and increased risk of epilepsy (odds ratio 1.046; 95% confidence interval 1.001-1.093; P = 0.043). However, AD (P = 0.986), PD (P = 0.894), and ALS (P = 0.533) were not causally associated with epilepsy. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. The MR study confirmed the causal relationship between genetically predicted MS and epilepsy but did not support the causal relationship between genetically predicted AD, PD, and ALS on epilepsy.
