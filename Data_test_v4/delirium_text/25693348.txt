25693348|a|In recent years, the aging population has been growing, and the operative techniques and anesthetic methods have advanced. With these developments and medical support, the number of operations on very elderly patients has been increasing. We report the perioperative management of off-pump CABG for a 93-year-old man. When the heart was displaced during the operation, hypotension was induced and a marked reduction of his bispectral index (BIS) to "1" appeared. During the perioperative period, the patient developed delirium that was difficult to manage, but he was discharged from the hospital without any complications on POD 21. As part of the perioperative management, intraoperative cerebral circulatory management with attention to cerebral perfusion and prevention of postoperative delirium is crucial.
