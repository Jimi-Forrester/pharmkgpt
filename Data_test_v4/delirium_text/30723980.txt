30723980|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive form of dementia, accompanied by a range of behavioural and psychological symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify current clinical practice for the treatment of DLB in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a survey of medical doctors engaged in the management of dementia in Japan. Participants were divided into two groups: psychiatrists (Group P) and neurologists or neurosurgeons (Group NS). Doctors completed a questionnaire and we analysed their responses to compare the two groups with regard to diagnosis and treatment of DLB, and in particular the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). RESULTS: Responses suggested that Group P conducted biomarker examinations less frequently and decided on their own therapeutic strategies more frequently than did Group NS. Both groups most frequently selected hallucinations/delusions as the symptoms given highest treatment priority. More than 70% of respondents in both groups reported having difficulties in treating BPSD. Atypical antipsychotics were more frequently prescribed by Group P, but were also prescribed in 70% of patients in Group NS. A third of patients received atypical antipsychotics for more than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The responses to this survey highlighted the difficulties faced by clinicians managing patients with DLB and identified the need to effectively treat BPSD in such patients.
