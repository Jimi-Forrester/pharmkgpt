36613915|t|Mitochondrial Genetic Background May Impact Statins Side Effects and Atherosclerosis Development in Familial Hypercholesterolemia.
36613915|a|Heredity of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) can present as a dominant monogenic disorder of polygenic origin or with no known genetic cause. In addition, the variability of the symptoms among individuals or within the same families evidence the potential contribution of additional factors than monogenic mutations that could modulate the development and severity of the disease. In addition, statins, the lipid-lowering drugs which constitute the first-line therapy for the disease, cause associated muscular symptoms in a certain number of individuals. Here, we analyze the evidence of the mitochondrial genetic variation with a special emphasis on the role of CoQ10 to explain this variability found in both disease symptoms and statins side effects. We propose to use mtDNA variants and copy numbers as markers for the cardiovascular disease development of FH patients and to predict potential statin secondary effects and explore new mechanisms to identify new markers of disease or implement personalized medicine strategies for FH therapy.
