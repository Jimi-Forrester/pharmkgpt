24044897|a|Increased cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha) immunoreactivity and transcript were observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain associated with amyloid deposits. Thus, the present study examined whether cPLA2alpha upregulation participate in cortical neuron damage induced by aggregated Abeta1-42 and determined its role in the signaling events leading to damage, using an antisense technology. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to 1muM aggregated Abeta1-42 for 24h induced up-regulation and activation of cPLA2alpha and apoptotic cell death of about 30% as detected by: cell count, MTT reduction, caspases-3 and -8 activation, DAPI and TUNEL staining, that were prevented by inhibition of cPLA2alpha up-regulation and activity in the presence of antisense against cPLA2alpha (AS). cPLA2alpha was rapidly activated upon addition of aggregated Abeta1-42, as determined by its phosphorylated form on serine 505, and this activity was dependent on NADPH oxidase activity. NOX2- and NOX4-NADPH oxidase upregulation at 24h of aggregated Abeta1-42 exposure was not affected by the presence of AS, but superoxide production was reduced, probably due to NOX2 inhibition. cPLA2alpha upregulation led to activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) as its activity was inhibited in the presence of AS, and could be restored by addition of arachidonic acid. Addition of ceramide analog induced caspase-8 activation leading to caspase-3 activation and apoptotic neuronal death. In conclusion, our results suggest that cPLA2alpha activity plays a crucial role in the signaling cascade leading to apoptotic neuronal death by aggregated Abeta1-42 probably via activation of N-SMase, ceramide production and caspases-3 and -8.
