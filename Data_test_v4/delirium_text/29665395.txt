29665395|t|Label-free colorimetric sensor for sensitive detection of choline based on DNAzyme-choline oxidase coupling.
29665395|a|Changes in choline levels can be associated with diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, fatty liver, interstitial lung abnormalities, autism and so on. Therefore, quantitative determination of choline is important in the biological and clinical analysis. So far, several methods have been investigated for measuring choline in the body fluids, each of which has disadvantages such as the need for specialist ability, complexity, and high cost. For this purpose, a facile and sensitive colorimetric biosensor based on DNAzyme-choline oxidase coupling used for the determination of choline. In this method, the first, choline oxidase produces H2O2 and betaine in the presence of choline and oxygen, then, the DNAzyme converts colorless ABTS into green ABTS+ radicals. Compared to the previous methods, the linear range and the limit of detection of this talented biosensor were 0.1-25 muM and 22 nM. Choline measurement using this biosensor has shown satisfactory selectivity and repeatability. Its recovery was 96.9-103.7%, which shows the reliability of biosensor assay in biological samples. Simplicity, low cost, naked eye, high sensitivity, and precision are the benefits of this biosensor. Taken to gather, the proposed system can be considered as a great biosensor for measuring choline levels especially in point of care diagnostic.
