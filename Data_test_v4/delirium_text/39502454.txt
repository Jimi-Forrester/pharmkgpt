39502454|a|Background: Each year world-wide about 65 million people sustain a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom after mTBI. We examine the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on fatigue in patients with mTBI using data from the CRASH-3 trial. Methods: The CRASH-3 trial randomised 9,202 patients with traumatic brain injury and no significant extracranial bleeding to receive TXA or placebo within 3 hours of injury. The primary outcome was death from head injury within 28 days of injury. The methods and results are presented elsewhere. Fatigue was recorded as "None", "Moderate" or "Extreme." This study examines the effect of TXA on extreme fatigue in the 2,632 patients with mTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score>=13). Our analyses were not prespecified. Results: Our study primary outcome, extreme fatigue, was reported for 10 (0.8%) of 1,328 patients receiving TXA and 19 (1.5%) of 1,288 patients receiving placebo (risk ratio [RR]=0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-1.09). Death within 28 days of injury was reported for 34 (2.6%) of 1,328 patients receiving TXA versus 47 (3.6%) of 1,288 patients receiving placebo (RR=0.70, 95% CI 0.45-1.08). Among patients allocated to TXA, 44 (3.3%) patients either died or reported extreme fatigue versus 66 (5.1%) patients among those allocated to placebo (RR=0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.94). This composite outcome is disproportionately influenced by deaths which account for 74% (81 from 110) of events. Conclusions: We found no evidence that tranexamic acid reduces fatigue in patients with mTBI. Given, 1) our analyses were not prespecified, 2) our outcome measure is not based on a validated fatigue severity scale, and 3) TBI patients can suffer from hospital-induced delirium, which hinders clinician assessment, these results need to be replicated in another study.
