37862201|t|Mitophagy in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.
37862201|a|Mitochondria are critical cellular energy resources and are central to the life of the neuron. Mitophagy selectively clears damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria through autophagic machinery to maintain mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Mature neurons are postmitotic and consume substantial energy, thus require highly efficient mitophagy pathways to turn over damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. Recent evidence indicates that mitophagy is pivotal to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. However, more work is needed to study mitophagy pathway components as potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we briefly discuss the characteristics of nonselective autophagy and selective autophagy, including ERphagy, aggrephagy, and mitophagy. We then introduce the mechanisms of Parkin-dependent and Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways under physiological conditions. Next, we summarize the diverse repertoire of mitochondrial membrane receptors and phospholipids that mediate mitophagy. Importantly, we review the critical role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Last, we discuss recent studies considering mitophagy as a potential therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Together, our review may provide novel views to better understand the roles of mitophagy in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.
