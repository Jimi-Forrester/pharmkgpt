37144543|t|A Review of Extracellular Vesicles in COVID-19 Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention.
37144543|a|The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing, and has necessitated scientific efforts in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Interestingly, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been crucial in these developments. EVs are a collection of various nanovesicles which are delimited by a lipid bilayer. They are enriched in proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites, and naturally released from different cells. Their natural material transport properties, inherent long-term recycling ability, excellent biocompatibility, editable targeting, and inheritance of parental cell properties make EVs one of the most promising next-generation drug delivery nanocarriers and active biologics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many efforts have been made to exploit the payload of natural EVs for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, strategies that use engineered EVs to manufacture vaccines and neutralization traps have produced excellent efficacy in animal experiments and clinical trials. Here, the recent literature on the application of EVs in COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, damage repair, and prevention is reviewed. And the therapeutic value, application strategies, safety, and biotoxicity in the production and clinical applications of EV agents for COVID-19 treatment, as well as inspiration for using EVs to block and eliminate novel viruses are discussed.
