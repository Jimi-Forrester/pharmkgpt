35717886|a|BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of diseases characterised by language, behavioural and motor symptoms. Among the different subcortical regions implicated in the FTD symptomatology, the hypothalamus regulates various bodily functions, including eating behaviours which are commonly present across the FTD spectrum. The pattern of specific hypothalamic involvement across the clinical, pathological, and genetic forms of FTD has yet to be fully investigated, and its possible associations with abnormal eating behaviours have yet to be fully explored. METHODS: Using an automated segmentation tool for volumetric T1-weighted MR images, we measured hypothalamic regional volumes in a cohort of 439 patients with FTD (197 behavioural variant FTD [bvFTD]; 7 FTD with associated motor neurone disease [FTD-MND]; 99 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia [svPPA]; 117 non-fluent variant PPA [nfvPPA]; 19 PPA not otherwise specified [PPA-NOS]) and 118 age-matched controls. We compared volumes across the clinical, genetic (29 MAPT, 32 C9orf72, 23 GRN), and pathological diagnoses (61 tauopathy, 40 TDP-43opathy, 4 FUSopathy). We correlated the volumes with presence of abnormal eating behaviours assessed with the revised version of the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory (CBI-R). RESULTS: On average, FTD patients showed 14% smaller hypothalamic volumes than controls. The groups with the smallest hypothalamic regions were FTD-MND (20%), MAPT (25%) and FUS (33%), with differences mainly localised in the anterior and posterior regions. The inferior tuberal region was only significantly smaller in tauopathies (MAPT and Pick's disease) and in TDP-43 type C compared to controls and was the only regions that did not correlate with eating symptoms. PPA-NOS and nfvPPA were the groups with the least frequent eating behaviours and the least hypothalamic involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal hypothalamic volumes are present in all the FTD forms, but different hypothalamic regions might play a different role in the development of abnormal eating behavioural and metabolic symptoms. These findings might therefore help in the identification of different underlying pathological mechanisms, suggesting the potential use of hypothalamic imaging biomarkers and the research of potential therapeutic targets within the hypothalamic neuropeptides.
