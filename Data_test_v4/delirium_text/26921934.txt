26921934|t|Pilot study of a preventive multicomponent nurse intervention to reduce the incidence and severity of delirium in hospitalized older adults: MID-Nurse-P.
26921934|a|BACKGROUND: Although multicomponent interventions are the gold standard for delirium management, few nurse-led interventions in Acute Geriatric Units (AGU) are described. OBJECTIVES: To analyze if a preventive multicomponent non-pharmacologic nurse-led intervention randomized clinical trial (MID-Nurse Study) is feasible (pilot study), and can reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of delirium in hospitalized older adults in an AGU. DESIGN: Parallel-group double-blind randomized clinical trial (pilot Study). SETTING: AGU Complejo Hospitalario Universitario, Albacete (Spain). PARTICIPANTS: 50 patients >=65 years hospitalized in the AGU. Intervention group (IG) 21, control group (CG) 29. INTERVENTION: After risk factor analysis, all participants in the IG received a daily multicomponent non-pharmacologic intervention (orientation, sensorial deficit, sleep, mobilization, hydration, nutrition, drug chart review, elimination, oxygenation, pain) by the intervention nurses. The CG received usual care. MEASUREMENTS: Daily delirium presence with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and severity with the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS). Outcome measures were delirium incidence, prevalence, severity, and number of days with delirium, mortality, length of stay, use of physical restraint measures, and use of drugs for delirium control. RESULTS: Mean age 86.5 (48% women). 21 participants presented delirium during hospitalization (14CG and 7 IG). Process, resources, management, and scientific objectives were considered positive, making the study feasible. Delirium prevalence (33.3% vs 48.3%) and incidence (14.3% vs 41.4%; p=0.039) were reduced in the IG compared to CG. Total delirium severity was lower in the IG compared to the CG (35.0 vs 65.0; p=0.040). Mortality was not different between groups (CG 17.2% vs IG 19.0%). CONCLUSION: The MID-Nurse Study is feasible, and a multicomponent nurse-led intervention on patients with delirium in an AGU can reduce delirium prevalence, incidence, and severity. The clinical trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02558777.
