35098972|a|BACKGROUND: The SINgapore GERiatric intervention study to reduce cognitive decline and physical frailty (SINGER) randomised controlled trial (RCT) uses a multidomain lifestyle interventions approach, shown to be effective by the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) trial, to delay cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the SINGER multidomain lifestyle interventions in older adults at risk for dementia to delay cognitive decline. PARTICIPANTS: 1200 participants between 60-77 years old, with Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) dementia risk score >=6, fulfilling at least one of the following LIBRA index for diet, cognitive activity, physical activity and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score >=18, <=27 points, will be recruited across Singapore. METHODS: SINGER is a 2-year multi-site RCT consisting of multidomain interventions: dietary advice, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk factors management. Participants will be randomised into either the Self-Guided Intervention (SGI; general lifestyle and health information and resources) or Structured Lifestyle Intervention (SLI) group. The SLI comprises diet training (6 group and 3 individual sessions over 12 months); exercise (supervised: 1-hour twice weekly for 6 months, unsupervised: 2-3/week for the rest of the study duration); cognitive sessions (15-30 minutes/session, 3/week for 6 months, together with 10 workshops in 24 months). Vascular management takes place every 3-6 months or otherwise as specified by study physicians. The primary outcome is global cognition measured using the modified Neuropsychological Battery assessing performance in various domains, such as episodic memory, executive function and processing speed. Secondary outcome measures include: domain-specific cognition and function, imaging evidence of brain and retinal changes, incidence and progression of chronic diseases, blood biomarkers, quality of life, mental health and cost-benefit analysis. CONCLUSIONS: SINGER is part of the Worldwide-FINGERS international network, which is at the forefront of harmonizing approaches to effective non-pharmacological interventions in delaying cognitive decline in older adults at risk of dementia. By establishing the efficacy of multidomain interventions in preventing cognitive decline, SINGER aims to implement the findings into public health and clinical practices by informing policy makers, and guiding the design of community- and individual-level health promotion initiatives.
