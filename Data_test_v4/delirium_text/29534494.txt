29534494|t|Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Activity of the Novel Harmine Derivative ZC-14 in Sf9 Cells.
29534494|a|Harmine, one of the natural beta-carboline alkaloids extracted from Peganum harmala L., exhibits broad spectrum but limited insecticidal ability against many pests. So there is an urgent need to synthesize novel derivatives with high efficiency. In the present study, a new synthetic compound, [1-(2-naphthyl)-3-(2-thioxo-1,3,4-oxadiazol-5-yl) beta-carboline] (ZC-14), showed a strong proliferation inhibition effect against the Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneously, apoptosis induced by 7.5 mug/mL ZC-14 was confirmed with physiological and biochemical evidence, including typical apoptosis characteristics with shrinkage, apoptotic bodies, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, a clear DNA ladder, and a series of apoptotic rates. In addition, mitochondria were confirmed to be involved in apoptosis induced by ZC-14 accompanied with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and increased expression of cleaved-caspase-3. However, harmine could not induce apoptosis at the same concentration. In summary, these data indicated that compound ZC-14 has a higher cytotoxicity than harmine against Sf9 cells. Besides, it exhibited an anti-proliferative effect in Sf9 cells via inducing apoptosis in which the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway plays a crucial role.
