37229352|t|Associations Between Serum Folate Level and HOMA-IR in Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
37229352|a|Background: Adequate intake of folic acid (FA) has been proven essential for metabolism, cellular homeostasis, and antioxidant effects in diabetic patients. Our aim was to evaluate the association between serum folate levels and the risk of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to provide new ideas and approaches for reducing the risk of T2DM. Methods: This was a case-control study involving 412 participants (206 with T2DM). Anthropometric parameters, islet function, biochemical parameters and body composition of T2DM group and control group were determined. Correlation analysis and logistic regression were used to evaluate the risk factors associated with the onset of insulin resistance in T2DM. Results: The folate levels in type 2 diabetic patients with insulin resistance were significantly lower than those in patients without insulin resistance. Logistic regression showed that FA and high-density lipoprotein were independent influencing factors for insulin resistance in diabetic patients (P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, the degree of insulin resistance in diabetic patients was in a significant inverse relationship with folate levels (P< 0.05). We also found that below the serum FA threshold of 7.09 ng/mL insulin resistance was significantly more elevated. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the risk of insulin resistance increases with the decrease in serum FA levels in T2DM patients. Monitoring folate levels in these patients and FA supplementation are warranted preventive measures.
