33415189|t|Postoperative Delirium After Esophagectomy: The Efficacy of Continual Monitoring Using the NEECHAM Confusion Scale.
33415189|a|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Although a majority of nurses understand that delirium is a major issue in perioperative care, professional barriers to routine monitoring using delirium assessment tools exist. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of continual monitoring of postoperative delirium in patients that have undergone esophagectomy using the Neelon and Champagne (NEECHAM) Confusion Scale (NCS). METHODS: Demographic data and case histories were obtained from medical records. We conducted NCS scoring for 1 week after surgery and verified the daily changes in scores. Patients were classified into normal, neurocognitive-change, and complication groups for the analysis of the influence of preoperative neurocognitive changes and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Data from 19 patients were analyzed. NCS scores decreased sharply on the first day and then significantly recovered each day. The normal group exhibited a steady recovery process, but the other groups deviated from this progression. The incidence of delirium was highest on the first day. The incidence in the normal group decreased each day, but other groups developed delirium for an extended time. In the NCS subscale score analyses, the information processing score was low in the neurocognitive-change group. The complication group exhibited delayed recovery of the physiologic control score. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the recovery process of mental function after esophagectomy as well as the impact of preoperative neurocognitive changes and postoperative complications. Continual monitoring of postoperative mental function may predict postoperative delirium. For early detection and prevention of delirium, nurses should monitor postoperative mental function via daily observation.
