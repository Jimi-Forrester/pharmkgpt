37333896|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious refractory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which mostly caused by high-energy trauma. Existing interventions such as hormone shock and surgery are insufficient options, which relate to the secondary inflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Hydrogel with neuron-protective behaviors attracts tremendous attention, and black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) encapsulating with Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) hydrogels (E@BP) is designed for inflammatory modulation and SCI treatment in this study. E@BP displays good stability, biocompatibility and safety profiles. E@BP incubation alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation of primary neurons and enhances neuronal regeneration in vitro. Furthermore, E@BP reconstructs structural versus functional integrity of spinal cord tracts, which promotes recovery of motor neuron function in SCI rats after transplantation. Importantly, E@BP restarts the cell cycle and induces nerve regeneration. Moreover, E@BP diminishes local inflammation of SCI tissues, characterized by reducing accumulation of astrocyte, microglia, macrophages, and oligodendrocytes. Indeed, a common underlying mechanism of E@BP regulating neural regenerative and inflammatory responses is to promote the phosphorylation of key proteins related to AKT signaling pathway. Together, E@BP probably repairs SCI by reducing inflammation and promoting neuronal regeneration via the AKT signaling pathway.
