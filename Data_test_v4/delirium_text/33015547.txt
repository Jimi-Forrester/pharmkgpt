33015547|t|COVID-19-Induced Psychosis and Suicidal Behavior: Case Report.
33015547|a|The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with different types of stressors: fear of infection, financial burden, and social isolation. Additionally, COVID-19 infection seems to increase the risk for neuropsychiatric symptoms including psychosis. We present a case of a 52-year-old male with no previous psychiatric history who developed severe paranoia leading to a suicide attempt. He was successfully treated with a combination of milieu treatment, pharmacotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. We add to the nascent literature that COVID-19, as other coronaviruses, can increase the risk for severe psychosis and suicidal behavior.
