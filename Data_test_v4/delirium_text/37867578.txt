37867578|a|Introduction: Many older people present to emergency departments annually, often with complex geriatric syndromes, yet current acute care models and traditional admissions process may under-serve their needs. The multidisciplinary Aged Care Rapid Investigation and Assessment (ARIA) Unit seeks to bridge this gap, by actively identifying and assessing patients. Methods: A prospective case-control study was undertaken at a single-centre tertiary referral institution. Patients were eligible for inclusion in ARIA group if admitted to ARIA via case-finding by the geriatrician or Aged Care Services Emergency Team, whilst standard geriatric admissions formed the control group. This study evaluates whether ARIA reduced hospital length-of-stay (LOS) and representation rates. Results: 370 patients were included (185 each arm) with similar baseline demographics, frailty scores, and Charlson Comorbidity Indices. Patients admitted to ARIA had significantly shorter hospital LOS than those via standard pathway (3.3 days [IQR2.2-5.8] vs 7.5 days [IQR4.2-13.7], p < 0.00001). There were no significant differences in 90-day representation rates (n = 66 [35.7%] vs n = 64 [34.6%], p = 0.82). Discussion/Conclusion: Introduction of an ARIA unit with a targeted approach to frontline geriatric services and case-finding is associated with improved LOS of older acute hospital patients. An economical cost analysis of this study would be beneficial in exploring potential financial savings.
