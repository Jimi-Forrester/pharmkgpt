METHODS: Eighty patients of knee replacement under epidural and general anesthesia were randomly divided into warming blood transfusion and infusion (WBI) group (n = 40) and control group (n = 40). The changes of nasopharyngeal temperature, middle cerebral artery blood flow, CERO2, and SjVO2 of the two groups were recorded at each time point for the assessment of the postoperative overall quality of recovery and cognitive recovery situation. RESULTS: The nasopharyngeal temperatures of the two groups at different time points after transfusion were significantly lower than that at T1, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). The CERO2 values of the two groups at T3 were significantly higher than at T1, while the SjVO2 values were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The WBI can significantly reduce the occurrence of the perioperative hypothermia, while it has no significant effect toward cerebral oxygen metabolism, postoperative overall recovery, and recovery of cognitive function.
