36872782|t|The Influence of Agricultural Work and Plasma Uric Acid on Hospital Admission for Alzheimer's Disease.
36872782|a|BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental neurotoxins associated with agricultural work, such as pesticides, may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. There is strong evidence that such exposure is associated with the development of PD; for AD the current evidence is equivocal. Several mechanisms are proposed to mediate this environmental toxicity, one of which is oxidative stress. Uric acid (UA) is an endogenous antioxidant, low levels of which are also implicated in neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether agricultural work was a risk factor for AD in a population in which its association with PD was established, and whether UA was also associated with AD in this cohort. METHODS: Hospital records of subjects meeting criteria for AD (n = 128) or vascular dementia (VaD) (n = 178) after hospital admission for symptoms of dementia were studied. History of agricultural work and plasma UA were recorded and their relationship to diagnosis determined. RESULTS: In contrast to previous findings in this population in which agricultural work was strongly associated with PD, a history of agricultural work was not over-represented in hospital admission for AD versus VaD. AD was associated with a reduced level of circulating UA compared with VaD. CONCLUSION: Agricultural work as a likely proxy for exposure to pesticides appears not to be a risk factor for AD to the extent found in PD, perhaps reflecting their differences in neuronal pathology. Nevertheless, findings with UA suggests that oxidative stress may be an important factor in AD pathogenesis.
