38427199|t|Noninvasive Visualization of Amyloid-Beta Deposits in Alzheimer's Amyloidosis Mice via Fluorescence Molecular Tomography Using Contrast Agent.
38427199|a|Alzheimer's disease is pathologically featured by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque and neurofibrillary tangles. Compared to small animal positron emission tomography, optical imaging features nonionizing radiation, low cost, and logistic convenience. Optical detection of Abeta deposits is typically implemented by 2D macroscopic imaging and various microscopic techniques assisted with Abeta-targeted contrast agents. Here, we introduce fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), a macroscopic 3D fluorescence imaging technique, convenient for in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the animal brain without the involvement of cranial window opening operation. This chapter aims to provide the protocols for FMT in vivo imaging of Abeta deposits in the brain of rodent model of Alzheimer's disease. The materials, stepwise method, notes, limitations of FMT, and emerging opportunities for FMT techniques are presented.
