25137376|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of susceptibility-weighted imaging in the detection of intracranial hemorrhage after heat stroke and in the prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of eight patients after heat stroke, with a score of 3 to 9 in Glasgow Coma Scale. The MR studies were performed with a 1.5 T scanner. Susceptibility-weighted imaging data were collected within 2-5 days after heat stroke. The study was approved by ethics committee, and written informed consents were obtained from family members of the patients. RESULTS: Punctate hemorrhages were detected in brain stem, corona radiata and frontal lobe by susceptibility-weighted imaging for three patients. Among the three cases, two patients came to death in the 5th day and the 25th day after heat stroke respectively. Another patient became a persistent vegetative state and died about 3 months later. Five patients with no hemorrhage detected gradually recovered and cerebellar dysfunction remained to various degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition characterized by hyperthermia and accompanied by various complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a very useful tool for detection of intracranial hemorrhage and may probably evaluate the prognosis after heat stroke.
