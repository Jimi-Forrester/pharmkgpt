39187176|a|Heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic are prevalent in the environment due to both natural and anthropogenic sources, leading to significant public health concerns. These heavy metals are known to cause damage to the nervous system, potentially leading to a range of neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study examines the complex relationship between heavy metal exposure and AD, focusing on the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and potential therapeutic approaches. This review article highlights how these metals can impair brain function through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitter disruption, ultimately contributing to neurodegenerative diseases like AD. It also addresses the challenges in diagnosing heavy metal-induced cognitive impairments and emphasizes the need for further research to explore effective treatment strategies and preventive measures against heavy metal exposure.
