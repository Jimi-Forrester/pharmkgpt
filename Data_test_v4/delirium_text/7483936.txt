The article presents results of examination of 689 patients with alcoholic psychosis (407 with delirium, 189 with hallucinations, 93-paranoids), who have suffered 2093 psychotic attacks within 10 recurrences. It was found, that change of syndromes from the 1st to the 10th attack followed in a declining order and the character of syndromologic transformation was steadily-advanced. Two variants of transformation of alcoholic psychosis were revealed: the tendency to preservation of an initial clinical form during the following recurrent attacks and the tendency to changing psychopathologic syndrome.
