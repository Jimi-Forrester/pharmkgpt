38735057|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of perioperative melatonin and melatonin agonists in preventing postoperative delirium (POD). METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through December 2022. The primary outcome was efficacy based on the incidence of POD (POD-I). Secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety according to the length of hospital or intensive care unit stay, in-hospital mortality, and adverse events. Subgroup analyses of POD-I were based on the type and dose of drug (low- and high-dose melatonin, ramelteon), the postoperative period (early or late), and the type of surgery. RESULTS: In the analysis (16 RCTs, 1981 patients), POD-I was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (risk ratio [RR] = 0.57). POD-I was lower in the high-dose melatonin group than in the control group (RR = 0.41), whereas no benefit was observed in the low-dose melatonin and ramelteon groups. POD-I was lower in the melatonin group in the early postoperative period (RR = 0.35) and in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary surgery (RR = 0.54). CONCLUSION: Perioperative melatonin or melatonin agonist treatment suppressed POD without severe adverse events, particularly at higher doses, during the early postoperative period, and after cardiopulmonary surgery.
