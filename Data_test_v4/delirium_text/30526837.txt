30526837|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by cognitive deficits and neuropathological lesions such as Tau aggregates and amyloid plaques, but also associated with metabolic and neuroendocrine abnormalities, such as impairment of cerebral insulin. However, the origin of these symptoms and their relationship to pathology and cognitive disorders remain poorly understood. Insulin is a hormone involved in the control of peripheral and central energy homeostasis, and insulin-resistant state has been linked to increased risk of dementia. It is now well established that brain insulin resistance can exacerbate Tau lesions. Conversely, recent data indicate that Tau protein can modulate insulin signalling in the brain, creating a vicious circle precipitating the pathological AD. This review aims to highlight our current understanding of the role of insulin in the brain and its relationship with Tau protein in the context of AD and Tauopathies.
