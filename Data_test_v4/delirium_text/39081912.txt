39081912|a|Background and Aims: Intrathecal morphine (ITM) or erector spinae plane (ESP) block reduces postsurgical pain in patients who underwent kidney transplantation surgeries. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of both modalities in terms of duration and quality of postoperative analgesia along with postoperative fentanyl consumption. Methods: We conducted a randomised study and analysed 60 patients posted for elective live-related kidney transplantation surgery. They were randomised into two groups. Group M patients received ITM, whereas Group E patients received ESP block. We standardised the postoperative analgesia for both groups with intravenous fentanyl-based patient-controlled analgesia. The primary outcome was to compare the quality of analgesia using the numerical rating scale score between the groups. The secondary outcome was to observe the effect of both modalities on the duration of analgesia, postoperative fentanyl consumption, rescue analgesics requirement, catheter-related bladder discomfort and any complications. Results: We found significantly lower pain scores at rest and while coughing in Group M at all time intervals, except at 24 h while coughing. The mean time to first analgesia requirement was significantly longer in Group M than in Group E (P = 0.002). No significant difference was found in postoperative consumption of total fentanyl (P = 0.065) and rescue analgesia in both groups. In Group M, there was significantly more nausea, vomiting and pruritus (P = 0.001). Conclusions: ITM provides long-lasting postoperative analgesia at the cost of higher side effects than ESP block.
