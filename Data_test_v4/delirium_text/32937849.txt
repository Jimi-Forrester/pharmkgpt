32937849|t|PET Imaging for Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disorders Associated with Mitochondrial Dysfunction.
32937849|a|Oxidative stress based on mitochondrial dysfunction is assumed to be the principal molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the effects of oxidative stress on the neurodegeneration process in living patients remain to be elucidated. Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) can directly evaluate subtle biological changes, including the redox status. The present review focuses on recent advances in PET imaging for oxidative stress, in particular the use of the Cu-ATSM radioligand, in neurodegenerative disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Since reactive oxygen species are mostly generated by leakage of excess electrons from an over-reductive state due to mitochondrial respiratory chain impairment, PET with 62Cu-ATSM, the accumulation of which depends on an over-reductive state, is able to image oxidative stress. 62Cu-ATSM PET studies demonstrated enhanced oxidative stress in the disease-related brain regions of patients with mitochondrial disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, the magnitude of oxidative stress increased with disease severity, indicating that oxidative stress based on mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to promoting neurodegeneration in these diseases. Oxidative stress imaging has improved our insights into the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders, and is a promising tool for monitoring further antioxidant therapies.
