36018389|a|BACKGROUND: The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) plays a key role in the central nervous system, e.g., for synaptic transmission. While synaptic NMDARs are thought to have protective characteristics, activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs might trigger excitotoxic processes linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Since extrasynaptic NMDARs are typically GluN2B-enriched, the subunit is an interesting target for drug development and treatment monitoring. Recently, the novel GluN2B-specific PET radioligand (R)-[11C]Me-NB1 was investigated in rodents and for the first time successfully translated to humans. To assess whether (R)-[11C]Me-NB1 is a valuable radioligand for (repeated) clinical applications, we evaluated its safety, biodistribution and dosimetry. METHODS: Four healthy subjects (two females, two males) underwent one whole-body PET/MR measurement lasting for more than 120 min. The GluN2B-specific radioligand (R)-[11C]Me-NB1 was administered simultaneously with the PET start. Subjects were measured in nine passes and six bed positions from head to mid-thigh. Regions of interest was anatomically defined for the brain, thyroid, lungs, heart wall, spleen, stomach contents, pancreas, liver, kidneys, bone marrow and urinary bladder contents, using both PET and MR images. Time-integrated activity coefficients were estimated to calculate organ equivalent dose coefficients and the effective dose coefficient. Additionally, standardized uptake values (SUV) were computed to visualize the biodistribution. RESULTS: Administration of the radioligand was safe without adverse events. The organs with the highest uptake were the urinary bladder, spleen and pancreas. Organ equivalent dose coefficients were higher in female in almost all organs, except for the urinary bladder of male. The effective dose coefficient was 6.0 microSv/MBq. CONCLUSION: The GluN2B-specific radioligand (R)-[11C]Me-NB1 was well-tolerated without reported side effects. Effective dose was estimated to 1.8 mSv when using 300 MBq of presented radioligand. The critical organ was the urinary bladder. Due to the low effective dose coefficient of this radioligand, longitudinal studies for drug development and treatment monitoring of neuropsychiatric disorders including neurodegenerative diseases are possible.
