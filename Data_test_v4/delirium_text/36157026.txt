36157026|t|Dengue and Psychiatry: Manifestations, Mechanisms, and Management Options.
36157026|a|Dengue is an arboviral infection endemic in tropical countries. Neurological sequelae to dengue infection are not uncommon, and psychiatric manifestations are increasingly reported. This narrative review aims to present the varied manifestations, postulated mechanisms, and the available treatment options for psychiatric morbidity associated with dengue. The evidence available from eight observational studies is summarized in this review. Depression and anxiety are noted to be prevalent during both the acute and convalescent stages of the infection. The presence of encephalopathy and other neurological conditions is not a prerequisite for developing psychiatric disorders. However, treatment options to manage such psychiatric manifestations were not specified in the observational studies. Anecdotal evidence from case reports is outlined. Special attention is paid to the role of epigenetic modifications following dengue infections and the role of histone deacetylase inhibitors in the management. DNA methylation inhibitors such as valproic acid play a significant role in reversing stress-, viral-, or drug-induced epigenetic modifications.
