31151322|a|Oxidative stress is believed to be one of the main causes of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathogenesis of AD is still not elucidated clearly but oxidative stress is one of the key hypotheses. Here, we found that artemisinin, an anti-malarial Chinese medicine, possesses neuroprotective effects. However, the antioxidative effects of artemisinin remain to be explored. In this study, we found that artemisinin rescued SH-SY5Y and hippocampal neuronal cells from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death at clinically relevant doses in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies showed that artemisinin significantly restored the nuclear morphology, improved the abnormal changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3 activation, thereby attenuating apoptosis. Artemisinin also stimulated the phosphorylation of the adenosine monophosphate -activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in SH-SY5Y cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of the AMPK pathway attenuated the protective effect of artemisinin. These data put together suggested that artemisinin has the potential to protect neuronal cells. Similar results were obtained in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Cumulatively, these results indicated that artemisinin protected neuronal cells from oxidative damage, at least in part through the activation of AMPK. Our findings support the role of artemisinin as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.
