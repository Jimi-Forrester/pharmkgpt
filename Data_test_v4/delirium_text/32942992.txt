Vocal deficits, including soft, monotone speech, result in significant clinical and quality of life issues and are present in 90% of PD patients; yet the underlying pathology mediating these significant voice deficits is unknown. The Pink1-/- rat is a valid model of early-onset PD that presents with analogous vocal communication deficits. Previous work shows abnormal alpha-synuclein protein aggregation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a brain region critical and necessary to the modulation of mammalian vocal behavior. In this study, we used high-throughput RNA sequencing to examine gene expression within the PAG of both male and female Pink1-/- rats as compared to age-matched wildtype controls. We used a bioinformatic approach to (1) test the hypothesis that loss of Pink1 in the PAG will influence the differential expression of genes that interact with Pink1, (2) highlight other key genes that relate to this type of Mendelian PD, and (3) catalog molecular targets that may be important for the production of rat vocalizations. RESULTS: Knockout of the Pink1 gene resulted in differentially expressed genes for both male and female rats that also mapped to human PD datasets. Pathway analysis highlighted several significant metabolic pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify gene nodes and their interactions in (A) males, (B) females, and (C) combined-sexes datasets. For each analysis, within the module containing the Pink1 gene, Pink1 itself was the central node with the highest number of interactions with other genes including solute carriers, glutamate metabotropic receptors, and genes associated with protein localization. Strong connections between Pink1 and Krt2 and Hfe were found in both males and female datasets. In females a number of modules were significantly correlated with vocalization traits. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this work supports the premise that gene expression changes in the PAG may contribute to the vocal deficits observed in this PD rat model. Additionally, this dataset identifies genes that represent new therapeutic targets for PD voice disorders.
