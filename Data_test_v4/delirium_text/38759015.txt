38759015|t|Pharmacologic and Nutritional Interventions for Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
38759015|a|Background: Early intervention is essential for meaningful disease modification in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objective: We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic and nutritional interventions for early AD. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from database inception until 1 September 2023. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of interventions in early AD. Only interventions that demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA). Then we performed frequentist fixed-effects NMA to rank the interventions. GRADE criteria were used to evaluate the level of evidence. Results: Fifty-eight trials including a total of 33,864 participants and 48 interventions were eligible for inclusion. Among the 48 interventions analyzed, only 6 (12.5%) treatments- ranging from low to high certainty- showed significant improvement in cognitive decline compared to placebo. High certainty evidence indicated that donanemab (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.239, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.343 to -0.134) and lecanemab (SMD -0.194, 95% CI -0.279 to -0.108) moderately slowed the clinical progression in patients with amyloid pathology. Additionally, methylphenidate, donepezil, LipiDiDiet, and aducanumab with low certainty showed significant improvement in cognitive decline compared to placebo. However, there was no significant difference in serious adverse events as reported between the six interventions and placebo. Conclusions: Only 12.5% of interventions studied demonstrated efficacy in reducing cognitive impairment in early AD. Donanemab and lecanemab have the potential to moderately slow the clinical progression in patients with amyloid pathology. Further evidence is required for early intervention in AD.
