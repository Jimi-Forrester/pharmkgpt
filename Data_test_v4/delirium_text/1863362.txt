1863362|t|Slow-wave activity in the spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram is associated with cortical dysfunctions in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
1863362|a|Cortical functions and slow-wave activity in the spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been studied in 19 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 18 patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia (PD), and 14 control subjects (C) to determine which functions are explained by their relationship of slow-wave activity. Multiple regression analyses revealed that a variance in visual functions, praxia of the hand, automatic speech, speech understanding, and retrieval from semantic memory were explained by their relationship with slow-wave activity in EEG in the AD group but not in the PD or C groups. The PD and AD groups exhibited equal cortical dysfunctions and mean amplitudes of delta activity in EEG. The cholinergic system, disrupted in AD, has been shown to be important in the regulation of neocortical electrical activity and may be associated with the processing of cortical functions.
