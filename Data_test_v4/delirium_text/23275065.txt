23275065|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the accumulation of brain amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), generated by gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Therefore, gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) may lower brain Abeta and offer a potential new approach to treat AD. As gamma-secretase also cleaves Notch proteins, GSIs can have undesirable effects due to interference with Notch signaling. Avagacestat (BMS-708163) is a GSI developed for selective inhibition of APP over Notch cleavage. Avagacestat inhibition of APP and Notch cleavage was evaluated in cell culture by measuring levels of Abeta and human Notch proteins. In rats, dogs, and humans, selectivity was evaluated by measuring plasma blood concentrations in relation to effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta levels and Notch-related toxicities. Measurements of Notch-related toxicity included goblet cell metaplasia in the gut, marginal-zone depletion in the spleen, reductions in B cells, and changes in expression of the Notch-regulated hairy and enhancer of split homolog-1 from blood cells. In rats and dogs, acute administration of avagacestat robustly reduced CSF Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels similarly. Chronic administration in rats and dogs, and 28-day, single- and multiple-ascending-dose administration in healthy human subjects caused similar exposure-dependent reductions in CSF Abeta40. Consistent with the 137-fold selectivity measured in cell culture, we identified doses of avagacestat that reduce CSF Abeta levels without causing Notch-related toxicities. Our results demonstrate the selectivity of avagacestat for APP over Notch cleavage, supporting further evaluation of avagacestat for AD therapy.
