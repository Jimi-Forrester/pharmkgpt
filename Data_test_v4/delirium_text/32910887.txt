32910887|t|Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease: A Modern Holy Grail.
32910887|a|In this issue of Neuron, through an elegant progression of computational and bio-informatic experiments centered on transcriptomic comparison of vulnerable and resistant neurons across species, Roussarie et al. (2020) predict and provide experimental support for specific genes and molecular pathways driving Alzheimer's disease, including the splicing factor PTBP1.
