24939404|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric behaviours of the elderly is the main issue for caregivers' distress, burn out and high turn-over. This situation will steadily worsen with longer lifetime. AIM OF THE STUDY: Specialised training of medical staff may decrease their distress: we compare both training programs Humanitude  et Formadep  outcomes. METHODS: A comparative open multicentric non randomised study included 459 elderlies of 9 EHPAD of Korian Company into 3 training groups: Humanitude , Formadep  and a group control, with 29 weeks follow-up. We studied the scoring NPI-ES (FG and R), BMS-10, ECPA and GIR, medications, caregivers' burn out/absences/turn-over levels. Statistical significance were done by Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Ancova and linear regression. RESULTS: 320 caregivers and 3 groups of nearly 150 elderlies each, with around 50% dementia. In Formadep  group : lower scoring for a short time of total NPI-R (p<0.05), sustained lower scoring of NPI-FG << agitation/agressivity>> (p=0.035) but transitional for its NPI-R (p<0.05), sustained higher scoring of NPI-FG <<apathy/indifference>> (p=0.002) but transitional for its NPI-R (p=0 .003), sustained lower scoring of NPI-R (p=0.0039) for Motor Aberrant Behaviours (MAB). In Humanitude  group: transitional higher scoring of NPI-R (p=0.025) for MAB et transitional lower scoring NPI-R (p=0.0032) for depression (Alzheimer Disease sub-groupe). No change for other parameters. CONCLUSION: Despite high variability of the neuropsychiatric behaviours in elderly, Formadep  training has shown a positive impact on the global distress and on three main challenging behaviours, compared to Humanitude : this may be depend on their own philosophy. But caregivers' burden in dementia is not a one-factor problem.
