36402501|a|Initial studies suggested that the fluctuations in the quantity, variety, and composition of the gut microbiota can significantly affect disease processes. This change in the gut microbiota causing negative health benefits was coined dysbiosis. Initial research focused on gastrointestinal illnesses. However, the gut microbiome was found to affect more than just gastrointestinal diseases. Numerous studies have proven that the gut microbiome can influence neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
