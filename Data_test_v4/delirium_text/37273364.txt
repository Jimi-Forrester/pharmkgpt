37273364|t|Ketamine Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Systematic Review.
37273364|a|Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, recurrent condition that demonstrates significant heterogeneity in treatment response to first-line agents. Ketamine may have a therapeutic role in substance use disorders; however, research on this topic is limited. The objective of this systematic review is to qualitatively synthesize the current evidence of ketamine treatment for alcohol use disorder and evaluate its efficacy. A systematic review of Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was performed to identify completed human studies in English or Spanish (from inception to July 2022) that assess the effectiveness of ketamine therapy for alcohol use disorder. This review was registered on the Open Science Framework. Data were descriptively summarized and presented in tables and tested via narrative synthesis methodology. The risk of bias was measured with Cochrane Collaboration tools and a case series quality assessment tool. A total of 11 studies with 854 adult patients in three different countries (the USA, the UK, and Russia) were analyzed. Sample sizes ranged from 5 to 211 people. Seven studies included patients with alcohol use disorder, one study focused on heavy drinkers, and three studies elaborated extensively on alcohol withdrawal. The overall proportion of patients achieving abstinence and reduced consumption was most favorable in people receiving combination ketamine and psychotherapy treatment. The results were mixed with respect to relapse, craving, and withdrawal. Ketamine may be an effective therapeutic modality for people with alcohol use disorders who fail to respond to FDA-approved first-line agents. More robust clinical trials are necessary to provide a more accurate assessment of efficacy, safety profile, and dosing strategies for ketamine utilization in alcohol use disorder.
