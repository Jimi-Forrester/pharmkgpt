26376937|a|BACKGROUND: Many patients show deterioration in functioning and increased care needs in the last year of life. End-of-life care needs and health care utilization might differ between groups of acutely hospitalized older patients. AIM: To investigate differences in geriatric conditions, advance care planning, and health care utilization in patients with cancer, organ failure, or frailty, who died within 1 year after acute hospitalization. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted between 2002 and 2008, with 1-year follow-up. SETTING: University teaching hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Aged >=65 years, acutely hospitalized for >=48 h, and died within 1 year after hospitalization. At admission, all patients received a systematic comprehensive geriatric assessment. Hospital records were searched for advance care planning information and health care utilization. Differences between patient groups were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 306 patients died within 1 year after acute admission (35%) and were included; 151 with cancer, 98 with end-stage organ failure, and 57 frail older persons. At hospital admission, 72% of the frail group had delirium and/or severe pre-existing cognitive impairment. The frail and organ failure group had many pre-existing disabilities. Three months post-discharge, 75% of the frail and organ failure group had died, 45% of these patients had an advance care plan in their hospital records. CONCLUSION: Patients with frailty and organ failure had highest rates of geriatric conditions at hospital admission and often had missing information on advance care planning in the hospital records. There is a need to better identify end-of-life needs for these groups.
