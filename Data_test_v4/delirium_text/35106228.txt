35106228|t|Man of Mystery: A Case Report of Dissociative Amnesia in Schizophrenia.
35106228|a|This case report is unique in its rare presentation of dissociative amnesia with schizophrenia and CT presentation of involutionary prefrontal cortex change. In this case, the patient lost all autobiographical information and memories of his past. He mysteriously appeared in the public health system six months ago without a previous public record and with an alias. In addition, he presented with disorganized behavior, dissociative amnesia, and was internally preoccupied. We diagnosed the patient with schizophrenia and started pharmacological intervention. Unfortunately, the patient had no improvement of insight, and his memory problem persisted despite the treatment. Thus, this case brings attention to dissociative amnesia with comorbid schizophrenia. Moreover, the patient had improvement in mood, but his dissociative amnesia persisted despite medication.
