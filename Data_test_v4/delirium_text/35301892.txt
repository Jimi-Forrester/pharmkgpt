35301892|a|The purpose of this review is to create more awareness regarding the epileptic manifestations of non-ketotic hyperglycaemia, which are not widely recognised, and to assist understanding of the pathophysiology involved. Given that type II diabetes is one of the common causes of morbidity worldwide, it is important to appreciate the various neurological manifestations of non-ketotic hyperglycaemia.Here, I present two cases and review the existing literature. Both patients developed irreversible vision loss, which is a novel finding because only transient visual defects have previously been reported. The review includes a detailed discussion of the pathophysiology and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of patients with defects in cerebral lobar regions, which were associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. These manifestations can be ascribed to epileptic phenomena involving various parts of the cerebrum.Hyperglycaemia can lead to the irreversible loss of vision. Early diagnosis and treatment on the basis of the clinical features and characteristic MRI findings are important to avoid an epilepsia partialis continua-like state and irreversible visual impairment.
