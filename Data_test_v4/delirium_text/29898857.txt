29898857|t|Pharmacogenetic studies in Alzheimer disease.
29898857|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is considered one of the main causes of disability and dependence affecting quality of life in elderly people and their families. Current pharmacological treatment includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and memantine; however, only one-third of patients respond to treatment. Genetic factors have been shown to play a role in this inter-individual variability in drug response. DEVELOPMENT: We review pharmacogenetic reports of AD-modifying drugs, the pharmacogenetic biomarkers included, and the phenotypes evaluated. We also discuss relevant methodological considerations for the design of pharmacogenetic studies into AD. A total of 33 pharmacogenetic reports were found; the majority of these focused on the variability in response to and metabolism of donepezil. Most of the patients included were from Caucasian populations, although some studies also include Korean, Indian, and Brazilian patients. CYP2D6 and APOE are the most frequently studied biomarkers. The associations proposed are controversial. CONCLUSIONS: Potential pharmacogenetic biomarkers for AD have been identified; however, it is still necessary to conduct further research into other populations and to identify new biomarkers. This information could assist in predicting patient response to these drugs and contribute to better treatment decision-making in a context as complex as aging.
