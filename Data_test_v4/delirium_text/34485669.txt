34485669|a|Among the elderly, even minor injuries can cause cervical spine fractures. With the increasing number of nonagenarians, the opportunities for treatment of cervical spine injuries in nonagenarians are getting to be more common. Conservative therapy is often chosen in nonagenarians with cervical spine injuries because of high risk associated with surgical treatment; however, we present herein the cases of three patients in nonagenarians who underwent surgical treatment for cervical spine injury. After a fall, three cases of nonagenarians who lived alone and independent were diagnosed with a Jefferson fracture and minor dislocated type II odontoid fracture, a C4 fracture with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, and a fracture-dislocation of C2, respectively. Their past medical history included several diseases, but we decided that spine surgery under general anesthesia was acceptable based on their pre-injury condition. We performed posterior fixation for all cases. As a result, while two patients developed postoperative minor complications, all cases showed favorable postoperative courses. They acquired independent or partially assisted walking and were transferred to the hospital for rehabilitation. If fundamental activity of daily living and general condition permit, posterior fixation seems to be a good choice even in nonagenarians.
