39664289|t|Advances in Wearable Stethoscope Technology: Opportunities for the Early Detection and Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases.
39664289|a|Wearable technology, including devices like Apple and Samsung watches, Fitbits, and smart rings, has become widely popular. However, while these consumer electronics are readily available, they do not yet meet the accuracy and safety standards required for medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred demand for wearable medical devices, particularly those that can support telemedicine and telehealth. Among these, wearable electronic stethoscopes hold significant promise for early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, which remain the leading cause of death globally. This review highlights the potential of wearable electronic stethoscopes to transform cardiovascular health management by enabling early diagnosis and self-monitoring. Additionally, it examines the current challenges and technological advancements needed to overcome them, underscoring the vital role that wearable electronic stethoscopes could play in improving global health outcomes.
