32417773|t|Age Moderates Associations of Hypertension, White Matter Hyperintensities, and Cognition.
32417773|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertension and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are mutually associated risk factors for cognitive impairment. However, age may modify the associations between hypertension and WMH, and their links to cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the interaction between age and hypertension on WMH, and the age-stratified associations of hypertension and WMH with cognition. METHODS: Key measures include systolic blood pressure (SBP), WMH (modified Fazekas visual ratings of cranial MRI), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Participants (N = 488) with prodromal and mild dementia were age-stratified (<=49, 50-59, 60-69,>=70), and considered hypertensive if their SBP>=140 mmHg. The interaction between age strata and hypertension on WMH, and age-stratified associations of hypertension and WMH with cognition, were evaluated using multiple linear regression analyses. Analyses controlled for other risk factors for WMH and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Age moderated the association between SBP and WMH. Hypertension was associated with higher WMH only in those aged 60-69, and WMH trends across age bands differed between those with and without hypertension. Finally, WMH and SBP>=140 were independently associated with lower MoCA scores within the 50-59 age band, while WMH alone was associated with poorer MoCA scores in the>=70 age band. CONCLUSION: In adults with prodromal or mild dementia, hypertension was associated with WMH specifically in the 60-69 age strata. Associations between hypertension and WMH with poorer cognition also differed across age bands. Future studies will be needed to investigate whether blood pressure management to slow cognitive decline by targeting WMH may be age dependent.
