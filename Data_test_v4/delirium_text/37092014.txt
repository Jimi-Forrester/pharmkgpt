37092014|a|Protein homeostasis, the balance between protein synthesis and degradation, requires the clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins and is therefore considered to be an essential aspect of establishing a physiologically effective proteome. Aging alters this balance, termed "proteostasis", resulting in the progressive accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins. Defective proteostasis leads to the functional deterioration of diverse regulatory processes during aging and is implicated in the etiology of multiple pathological conditions underlying a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and in age-dependent cardiovascular disease. Detergent-insoluble protein aggregates have been reported by us in both aged and hypertensive hearts. The protein constituents were found to overlap with protein aggregates seen in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, targeting these protein components of aggregates may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular pathologies associated with aging, ischemia, and/or hypertension.
