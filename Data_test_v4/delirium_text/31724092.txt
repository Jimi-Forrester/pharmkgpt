31724092|t|Delirium Management in the ICU.
31724092|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Delirium occurs frequently in critically ill patients and is associated with adverse outcomes in both the short and long term. In this review, we aim to highlight recent study findings on the prevention and treatment of delirium, provide additional recommendations based on expert guidelines, and indicate knowledge gaps deserving of future study. RECENT FINDINGS: Multicomponent non-pharmacologic interventions have been shown to be efficacious in non-ICU populations, and multicomponent strategies such as the ABCDEF bundle have been adopted in the ICU with several studies showing a potential benefit in delirium outcomes. Meanwhile, two negative randomized clinical trials of antipsychotics in ICU patients (REDUCE and MIND-USA) have provided strong evidence that such medications neither prevent nor shorten the duration of delirium. Other potential pharmacologic treatments with promising results include dexmedetomidine and, to a lesser extent, ramelteon, but more data is needed before they may be more definitively recommended. Effective and proven delirium management strategies are still largely lacking, though there is evidence to support the use of some non-pharmacologic interventions. Future studies of novel non-pharmacologic interventions and pharmacologic agents other than antipsychotics are warranted.
