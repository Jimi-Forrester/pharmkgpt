36610599|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to explore the cognitive functions of a large sample of hospitalised subjects with mild symptomatic Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) who were previously independent at home and without neurological diseases. METHODS: Patients admitted in a COVID-19 Unit for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection between November 2020 and March 2021 were recruited. Inclusion criteria were: being independent at home before the infection, radiologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab and no oxygen supplementation at the time of evaluation. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: cognitive impairment or neurological diseases previous to the infection, delirium episodes, and history of any mechanical ventilation use. They were evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). RESULTS: Out of 522 subjects admitted in the COVID-19 Unit, 90 were enrolled [mean age = 68.32(11.99); 46M/44F]. An impaired MoCA (cut-off < 23) was found in 60 subjects (66.66 %). Pathological scores were obtained by 36.7 % of the subjects with <65 years and 78.3 % of those older than 65 years. A high prevalence of executive function and memory impairment was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results underline a high rate of cognitive impairment in previously independent mild COVID-19 patients. This might represent a potential threat for the everyday independence of these patients due to the consequences on everyday life activities and work following discharge from hospital. These subjects should, therefore, be monitored in order to allow a better understanding of the progression and consequences of the so-called "Long COVID".
