33714561|t|Delirium in Emergency Departments: Is it Recognized?
33714561|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex neurocognitive manifestation of an underlying medical or surgical abnormality such as substance abuse, infection, sepsis, or organ failure. A recognized risk factor for delirium is advanced age (age >65 years). The projected demographic changes over the next 2 decades suggest that the number of aging adults will grow dramatically, and emergency nurses will see an increasing number of older patients manifesting the wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with delirium. METHOD: An examination of 5 commonly used delirium assessment tools was undertaken specific to clinical features, use, scoring, findings, advantages, and disadvantages. FINDINGS: Numerous factors contribute to the lack of effective delirium recognition. However, emergency nurses, with educational support, can successfully use the delirium assessment tools to recognize delirium. CONCLUSION: Emergency nurses face challenges in recognizing delirium. One key challenge for many of these nurses is the appropriate use of assessment tools suitable for the ED setting.
