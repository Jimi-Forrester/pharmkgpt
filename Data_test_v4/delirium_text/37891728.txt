37891728|t|Disrupted Gray Matter Networks Associated with Cognitive Dysfunction in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.
37891728|a|This study aims to investigate the disrupted topological organization of gray matter (GM) structural networks in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) patients with cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Subject-wise structural networks were constructed from GM volumetric features of 49 CSVD patients with CMBs (CSVD-c), 121 CSVD patients without CMBs (CSVD-n), and 74 healthy controls. The study used graph theory to analyze the global and regional properties of the network and their correlation with cognitive performance. We found that both the control and CSVD groups exhibited efficient small-world organization in GM networks. However, compared to controls, CSVD-c and CSVD-n patients exhibited increased global and local efficiency (Eglob/Eloc) and decreased shortest path lengths (Lp), indicating increased global integration and local specialization in structural networks. Although there was no significant global topology change, partially reorganized hub distributions were found between CSVD-c and CSVD-n patients. Importantly, regional topology in nonhub regions was significantly altered between CSVD-c and CSVD-n patients, including the bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and right MTG, which are involved in the default mode network (DMN) and sensorimotor functional modules. Intriguingly, the global metrics (Eglob, Eloc, and Lp) were significantly correlated with MoCA, AVLT, and SCWT scores in the control group but not in the CSVD-c and CSVD-n groups. In contrast, the global metrics were significantly correlated with the SDMT score in the CSVD-s and CSVD-n groups but not in the control group. Patients with CSVD show a disrupted balance between local specialization and global integration in their GM structural networks. The altered regional topology between CSVD-c and CSVD-n patients may be due to different etiological contributions, which may offer a novel understanding of the neurobiological processes involved in CSVD with CMBs.
