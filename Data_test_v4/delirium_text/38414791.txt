38414791|a|The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic therapy for acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis (AOSC) in patients with different underlying conditions. The present study comprised 47 patients diagnosed with AOSC, with a mean age of 70+-14 years. Minimally invasive endoscopic treatments, including endoscopic duodenal papillary sphincterotomy, endoscopic duodenal nasobiliary drainage and/or placement of an endobiliary duct stent drainage tube, were performed. Variations in the levels of the white blood cell count, liver function, procalcitonin (PCT) and carbohydrate antigen-199 (CA199) were examined, compared and evaluated both prior to and following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Among the 47 patients, 45 had a high fever, although their body temperature returned to normal after 7 days of ERCP treatment. The infection was difficult to control completely in two cases, including one case of biliary anastomosis secondary tumor with stenosis and AOSC and another case of an elderly patient with multiple choledocholithiasis complicated with sepsis. Within 7 days following treatment, the abdominal pain was resolved in 27 patients and jaundice subsided in 29 patients. On the 7th day after endoscopic treatment, the blood leukocyte, liver function, PCT and CA-199 parameters of all patients were significantly improved compared with those at admission. A total of 35 bile cultures yielded positive results, with Escherichia coli accounting for 11 cases (31.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae accounting for 7 cases (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounting for 5 cases (14.3%), Enterococcus faecus accounting for 4 cases (11.4%) and other strains making up the remaining 17 cases. No serious complications were encountered with these patients, such as perforation, bleeding, severe pancreatitis or mortality, following ERCP. In conclusion, ERCP has been shown to be a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment method for elderly patients with AOSC, yielding a high rate of success.
