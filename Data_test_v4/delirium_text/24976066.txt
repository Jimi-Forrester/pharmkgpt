24976066|a|Cortico-cortical connections might be disturbed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to investigate the alterations of functional connectivity in AD during auditory change detection processing by measuring the local neuronal activation and functional connectivity between cortical regions. Magnetoencephalographic responses to deviant and standard sounds were recorded in 16 AD patients, 18 young controls and 16 elderly controls. Larger source amplitudes and shorter peak latencies were found in the right temporal magnetic mismatch responses of young controls compared with elderly controls and AD patients. During deviant stimuli, the right theta temporal-frontal phase synchrony was significantly smaller in AD than in young controls and elderly controls. Moreover, the left temporal-frontal synchronization at theta and alpha bands was reduced in AD and elderly controls compared with young controls. In conclusion, the loss in temporo-frontal theta synchronization might be an electrophysiological hallmark of AD.
