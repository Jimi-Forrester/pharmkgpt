32963443|t|Extrapulmonary Features of COVID-19: A Concise Review.
32963443|a|Typical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) involve the upper and lower respiratory tract. But as the pandemic surges, we are encountering numerous case reports and series of extrapulmonary presentations of COVID-19 in the outpatient department. Abundant retrospective data have also cited various extrapulmonary complications in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This knowledge needs to be condensed and disseminated in order to improve COVID-19 surveillance and to reduce the accidental exposure of healthcare workers. Our review suggests that gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, nervous system, renal system, and manifestations due to hematological abnormalities are common masqueraders to watch out for.
