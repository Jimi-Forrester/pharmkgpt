37916634|a|BACKGROUND: Activation of microglia and astrocytes has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is reported to be activated in AD and involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. Moreover, amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation is detected as a characteristic pathology in the AD brain, and is known to be a substrate of TG2. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can modify cell proliferation and differentiation, and is reported to have therapeutic effects on AD pathology. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the effects of ATRA in microglia and astrocytes on TG2 expression and glial functions. METHODS: After treatment with ATRA, TG2 expression and TG activity were assayed in both murine microglia BV-2 cells and cultured rat brain astrocytes. Endocytosis activity in BV-2 cells and Abeta aggregation by astrocytes conditioned medium were also assessed. RESULTS: In both BV-2 cells and cultured astrocytes, ATRA increased TG2 expression and TG activity. The increase was blocked by AGN194310, an RA receptor antagonist. ATRA enhanced the endocytosis activity in BV-2 cells, and the addition of AGN194310 reversed it. The addition of cystamine, a competitive TG inhibitor, also reduced ATRA-enhanced endocytosis activity. On the other hand, Abeta aggregation was potentiated by ATRA-treated astrocytes conditioned medium compared to control astrocytes conditioned medium. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ATRA increased TG2 expression and TG activity via RA receptor in microglia and astrocytes. ATRA-enhanced TGs might be involved in phagocytosis and Abeta aggregation. Adequate control of TGs expression and function in microglia and astrocytes can be an important factor in AD pathology.
