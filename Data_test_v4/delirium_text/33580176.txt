33580176|a|Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) in leukocytes has attracted much attention as an emerging biomarker of aging and aging-related diseases. We evaluated the usefulness of saliva for mLOY analysis and showed that saliva-derived mLOY is significantly associated with aging and increased physical activity, but not with smoking. While these data support the robust association between saliva-derived mLOY and aging, caution is required when comparing data from saliva-derived and blood-derived mLOY.
