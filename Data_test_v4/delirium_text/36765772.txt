36765772|a|Cancer continues to be a significant global health issue. Traditional genetic-based approaches to understanding and treating cancer have had limited success. Researchers are increasingly exploring the impact of the environment, specifically inflammation and metabolism, on cancer development. Examining the role of mitochondria in this context is crucial for understanding the connections between metabolic health, physical activity, and cancer. This study aimed to review the literature on this topic through a comprehensive narrative review of various databases including MedLine (PubMed), Cochrane (Wiley), Embase, PsychINFO, and CinAhl. The review highlighted the importance of mitochondrial function in overall health and in regulating key events in cancer development, such as apoptosis. The concept of "mitochondrial fitness" emphasizes the crucial role of mitochondria in cell metabolism, particularly their oxidative functions, and how proper function can prevent replication errors and regulate apoptosis. Engaging in high-energy-demanding movement, such as exercise, is a powerful intervention for improving mitochondrial function and increasing resistance to environmental stressors. These findings support the significance of considering the role of the environment, specifically inflammation and metabolism, in cancer development and treatment. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which physical activity improves mitochondrial function and potentially reduces the risk of cancer.
