27747617|a|BACKGROUND: People with dementia may be particularly sensitive to cognitive impairment induced by anticholinergic and sedative medicines. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine if utilisation of medicines with anticholinergic and sedative effects changed before and after initiation of anti-dementia therapy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Australian pharmacy claim data (Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme). People with first (index) dispensing for a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 who were aged 65 years or over at the time of initiation were included. The proportion who received sedatives or anticholinergics in the 6 months prior to and post initiation of anti-dementia therapy was determined. RESULTS: The cohort included 24,110 patients, with over half aged 75-84 years. Overall, 30 % received any class of anticholinergic or sedative medicine for at least 1 month in the 6 months prior to initiation of anti-dementia agents, and 36 % post initiation. Some patients (6 %) ceased anticholinergics or sedatives post initiation even though they had them in the months prior. However, 12 % commenced therapy with anticholinergics or sedatives post anti-dementia therapy initiation even though they were naive to them in the 6 months prior to therapy. CONCLUSION: Medicines with anticholinergic or sedative effects were commonly dispensed in one-third of people with dementia. Prescribers need to consider a review of patients on anticholinergic therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors as the effectiveness of the cholinesterase therapy may be compromised.
