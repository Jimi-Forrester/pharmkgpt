29712948|t|G-395A polymorphism in the promoter region of the KLOTHO gene associates with frailty among the oldest-old.
29712948|a|Frailty is characterized by a decline in physiological reserve and increased vulnerability. Previous studies have shown that KLOTHO (KL) plays a protective role in several age-related diseases. We hypothesize a probable protective effect of KL on frailty in the elderly population and included a cohort of Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians for our study. This study is part of a cross-sectional study and secondary analysis of the Project of Longevity and Aging in Dujiangyan (PLAD) study, which was conducted in Southwest China. Community-dwelling Chinese residents aged 90 years or older were included in this study. Frailty was determined using the FRAIL scale as proposed by the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. On the FRAIL scale, frailty was defined by a score of >=3. G-395A (rs1207568) genotyping of the promoter region of the KL gene was performed using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. A total of 632 participants (68.4% females; mean age: 93.5 +- 3.2 years) were included. KL G-395A polymorphism genotype frequencies were 1.7% AA, 25.6% GA, and 72.7% GG in our sample. GG genotype frequencies for the frailty and control groups were 83.6% and 71.2%, respectively. Frailty prevalence was significantly lower in the GA+AA group when compared to the GG genotype group (6.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.026). In addition, subjects with a GA+AA genotype had a significantly lower risk of frailty (odds ratio (OR): 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.97, P = 0.040) compared to the GG genotype after adjusting for age, gender, education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, body mass index (BMI), cognitive impairment, and other potential factors. KL-395A allele carrying genotypes (GA and AA) is associated with a lower risk of frailty relative to GG genotypes in a sample of Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians.
