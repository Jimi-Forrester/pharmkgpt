35055344|t|Can SARS-CoV-2 Infection Exacerbate Alzheimer's Disease? An Overview of Shared Risk Factors and Pathogenetic Mechanisms.
35055344|a|The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, is affecting every aspect of global society, including public healthcare systems, medical care access, and the economy. Although the respiratory tract is primarily affected by SARS-CoV-2, emerging evidence suggests that the virus may also reach the central nervous system (CNS), leading to several neurological issues. In particular, people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a vulnerable group at high risk of contracting COVID-19, and develop more severe forms and worse outcomes, including death. Therefore, understanding shared links between COVID-19 and AD could aid the development of therapeutic strategies against both. Herein, we reviewed common risk factors and potential pathogenetic mechanisms that might contribute to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes in AD patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.
