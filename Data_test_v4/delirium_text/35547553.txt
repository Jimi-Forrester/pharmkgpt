35547553|a|Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, it is still uncertain how PE affects neonate metabolism. We conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of cord blood to explore the metabolic changes in PE neonates. Umbilical cord serum samples from neonates with preeclampsia (n = 29) and non-preeclampsia (non-PE) (n = 32) pregnancies were analyzed using the UHPLC-QE-MS metabolomic platform. Different metabolites were screened, and pathway analysis was conducted. A subgroup analysis was performed among PE neonates to compare the metabolome between appropriate-for-gestational-age infants (n = 21) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (n = 8). A total of 159 different metabolites were detected in PE and non-PE neonates. Creatinine, N4-acetylcytidine, sphingomyelin (D18:1/16:0), pseudouridine, uric acid, and indolelactic acid were the most significant differential metabolites in the cord serum of PE neonates. Differential metabolite levels were elevated in PE neonates and were involved in the following metabolic pathways: glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; sphingolipid, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism; and arginine biosynthesis. In PE neonates, SGA neonates showed increased levels of hexacosanoyl carnitine and decreased abundance of 3-hydroxybutyric acid and 3-sulfinoalanine. Taurine-related metabolism and ketone body-related pathways were mainly affected. Based on the UHPLC-QE-MS metabolomics analysis, we identified the metabolic profiles of PE and SGA neonates. The abundance of metabolites related to certain amino acid, sphingolipid, and energy metabolism increased in the umbilical cord serum of PE neonates.
