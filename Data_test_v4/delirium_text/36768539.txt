36768539|t|Biodrug Delivery Systems: Do mRNA Lipid Nanoparticles Come of Age?
36768539|a|As an appealing alternative to treat and prevent diseases ranging from cancer to COVID-19, mRNA has demonstrated significant clinical effects. Nanotechnology facilitates the successful implementation of the systemic delivery of mRNA for safe human consumption. In this manuscript, we provide an overview of current mRNA therapeutic applications and discuss key biological barriers to delivery and recent advances in the development of nonviral systems. The relevant challenges that LNPs face in achieving cost-effective and widespread clinical implementation when delivering mRNA are likewise discussed.
