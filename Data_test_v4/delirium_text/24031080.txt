24031080|t|Comparison of accuracy among prognostic scores for predicting life expectancy in Korean patients with cancer with weeks of survival.
24031080|a|To compare the accuracy among 4 prognostic scores (Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP), Delirium-PaP (D-PaP), Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI), Objective Prognostic Score (OPS)) for predicting life expectancy in Korean cancer patients with weeks of survival, we conducted a retrospective study by reviewing medical records of 94 patients and compared the accuracy of 3-week and 30-day survival among the 4 prognostic scores. Three-week survival estimates were highest for the PaP and 30-day estimates were similar for the 4 prognostic scores. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for the PaP and lowest for the PPI, but there were no significant differences. The prognostics scores did not differ from each other in a significant manner.
