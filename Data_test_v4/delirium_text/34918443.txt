34918443|a|BACKGROUND: Pediatric emergence delirium is a psychomotor disorder occurring in the early postanesthetic stage. There is no clear consensus regarding its treatment; however, dexmedetomidine and propofol have both been shown to be effective. AIM: In this single-center, randomized, double-blind prospective study, we compared the efficacy of dexmedetomidine against that of propofol in the treatment of established emergence delirium in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS: Patients aged 1-14 years, with ASA I or II and severe emergence delirium (Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium score of >=15) during the postoperative period following general anesthesia, were randomized to receive intravenous bolus injection of 0.5 mug.kg-1 dexmedetomidine or 1 mg.kg-1 propofol. The primary outcome was the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) score after treatment, and the secondary outcome was the recovery time in the postanesthetic care unit. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients who participated in the study, 26 (49%) were treated with dexmedetomidine and 27 (51%) with propofol. In the dexmedetomidine group, a single-dose intervention was effective for all patients (100%); whereas in the propofol group, 19 patients (70.4%) had PAED score of <12 after the first dose (p = .004; relative risk [95% confidence interval] = 0.1422 [0.113-1.815]). No significant difference in recovery time (median [IQR (range)]) was observed between the dexmedetomidine (20[14-30(10-45)]) and propofol groups (25 [20-40 (10-50)]; p = .056; 95% confidence interval = 0.113-1.815). CONCLUSIONS: A single bolus of 0.5 mug.kg-1 of dexmedetomidine was more effective than a single bolus of 1 mg.kg-1 of propofol in treating emergence delirium during the early postanesthetic stage.
