35955938|a|Identifying effective anti-aging compounds is a cornerstone of modern longevity, aging, and skin-health research. There is considerable evidence of the effectiveness of nutrient signaling regulators such as metformin, resveratrol, and rapamycin in longevity and anti-aging studies; however, their potential protective role in skin aging is controversial. In light of the increasing appearance of phytocannabinoids in beauty products without rigorous research on their rejuvenation efficacy, we decided to investigate the potential role of phytocannabinoids in combination with nutrient signaling regulators in skin rejuvenation. Utilizing CCD-1064Sk skin fibroblasts, the effect of metformin, triacetylresveratrol, and rapamycin combined with phytocannabinoids on cellular viability, functional activity, metabolic function, and nuclear architecture was tested. We found triacetylresveratrol combined with cannabidiol increased the viability of skin fibroblasts (p < 0.0001), restored wound-healing functional activity (p < 0.001), reduced metabolic dysfunction, and ameliorated nuclear eccentricity and circularity in senescent fibroblasts (p < 0.01). Conversely, metformin with or without phytocannabinoids did not show any beneficial effects on functional activity, while rapamycin inhibited cell viability (p < 0.01) and the speed of wound healing (p < 0.001). Therefore, triacetylresveratrol and cannabidiol can be a valuable source of biologically active substances used in aging and more studies using animals to confirm the efficacy of cannabidiol combined with triacetylresveratrol should be performed.
