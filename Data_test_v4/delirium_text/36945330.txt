36945330|a|Purpose: The present study was performed to investigate the effects of local complications (LC) on long-term survival and cancer recurrence in patients undergoing curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: We analyzed 2,627 patients after curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2001 and December 2006. Patients were classified into groups no complications (NC), LC, or systemic complications (SC). Results: Among the 2,627 patients, 475 patients developed complications (LC group [n=374, 14.2%] and SC group [n=101, 3.9%]). The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was significantly poorer in the LC group compared to the NC and SC groups (LC, 78.0%; NC, 85.4%; SC, 80.2%; P=0.007). The occurrence of LC was identified as a significant independent prognostic factor for overall and cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-2.97; P=0.001 and HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.81; P=0.015). The tumor recurrence rates were higher in the LC group than the in other two groups (LC, 23.5%; NC, 15.4%; SC, 15.8%; P<0.001). The occurrence of LC was an independent predictor of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11-2.17; P=0.011). Conclusion: LC are associated with adverse long-term outcomes in patients after curative gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer.
