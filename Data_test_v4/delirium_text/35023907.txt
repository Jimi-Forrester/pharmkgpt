35023907|t|The Vulnerability of the Developing Brain: Analysis of Highly Expressed Genes in Infant C57BL/6 Mouse Hippocampus in Relation to Phenotypic Annotation Derived From Mutational Studies.
35023907|a|The hippocampus has been shown to have a major role in learning and memory, but also to participate in the regulation of emotions. However, its specific role(s) in memory is still unclear. Hippocampal damage or dysfunction mainly results in memory issues, especially in the declarative memory but, in animal studies, has also shown to lead to hyperactivity and difficulty in inhibiting responses previously taught. The brain structure is affected in neuropathological disorders, such as Alzheimer's, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, and also by depression and stress. The hippocampus structure is far from mature at birth and undergoes substantial development throughout infant and juvenile life. The aim of this study was to survey genes highly expressed throughout the postnatal period in mouse hippocampus and which have also been linked to an abnormal phenotype through mutational studies to achieve a greater understanding about hippocampal functions during postnatal development. Publicly available gene expression data from C57BL/6 mouse hippocampus was analyzed; from a total of 5 time points (at postnatal day 1, 10, 15, 21, and 30), 547 genes highly expressed in all of these time points were selected for analysis. Highly expressed genes are considered to be of potential biological importance and appear to be multifunctional, and hence any dysfunction in such a gene will most likely have a large impact on the development of abilities during the postnatal and juvenile period. Phenotypic annotation data downloaded from Mouse Genomic Informatics database were analyzed for these genes, and the results showed that many of them are important for proper embryo development and infant survival, proper growth, and increase in body size, as well as for voluntary movement functions, motor coordination, and balance. The results also indicated an association with seizures that have primarily been characterized by uncontrolled motor activity and the development of proper grooming abilities. The complete list of genes and their phenotypic annotation data have been compiled in a file for easy access.
