38720407|a|Our study analyzes the effects of the permanent presence of cats on the health and social network of residents with pathologies in nursing home. Fifty-three residents, thirty-six caregivers, and four cats in three Alzheimer's Disease units ("ADU") and one Disability unit ("DISU") were observed for 180 hours. Social networks were created via instantaneous sampling of physical proximities and social exchanges between residents, caregivers, and the cats. Our results showed that: (1) the four units behave similarly in the presence or absence of a cat (2) cats are placed at the periphery of the network and interact with residents showing a keen interest in them, and (3) caregivers who are in strong contact with the cat show a greater number of social interactions in their unit. This study, using for the first time a social network approach, opens up a new field of understanding of human-animal relationships in a care dimension.
