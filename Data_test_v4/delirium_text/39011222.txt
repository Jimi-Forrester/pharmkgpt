39011222|t|A Single-Center Case Series of Acute Retinal Necrosis at Teikyo University: Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes.
39011222|a|Aim To evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment course, and prognosis of patients with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), which can rapidly progress and cause severe vision loss. Design Single-center retrospective case series. Subjects and methods Six patients and seven eyes diagnosed with ARN at Teikyo University Hospital were included in this study. The clinical presentation and treatment prognosis were investigated based on data obtained from medical records. Results The mean age of the patients at the initial diagnosis was 63.6 years. Although the mean Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) visual acuity tended to decrease from 0.77 at the first visit to 1.29 at the last visit, the difference was not statistically significant. Intraocular manifestations observed during the study period included ocular hypertension (14.3%), anterior uveitis (100.0%), retinal hemorrhage (71.4%), vitreous opacity (100.0%), retinal exudative vasculitis (85.7%), optic nerve atrophy (85.7%), retinal vascular occlusion (85.7%), choroidal atrophy (85.7%), macular edema (100.0%), subretinal fluid in the macula (71.4%), and retinal detachment (85.7%). Treatment modalities included oral and intravitreal antivirals (85.7%), antiplatelet medications (85.7%), steroid eye drops (85.7%), subcapsular (57.1%) and vitreous (42.9%) steroid injections, oral steroids (71.4%), and surgical intervention (85.7%). Vitrectomy led to retinal recovery in all five eyes that underwent the procedure. Conclusions The visual prognosis of patients with ARN is poor, particularly in those with preexisting visual impairment. Early detection coupled with antiviral therapy and prompt surgical intervention have been identified as potential factors that influence visual outcomes. Given the severity of ARN, collecting data from multiple centers could aid in devising future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
