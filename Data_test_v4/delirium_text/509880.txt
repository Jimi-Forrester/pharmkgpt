509880|t|Self-poisoning with over-the-counter hypnotics.
509880|a|Over-the-counter (OTC) hypnotic preparations (such as Sominex, Nytol, and Sleep Eze) were implicated in 21 of the 773 admissions to Massachusetts General Hospital due to psychotropic drug overdosage between 1962 and 1975. Ten of the 21 cases had manifestations of central anticholinergic toxicity ("atropine-like psychosis"), such as hallucinations, delirium, and confusion. However, all patients recovered rapidly and without sequelae. Specific therapy (i.e., physostigmine) was rarely required. Thus OTC hypnotic overdosage commonly produces "toxic psychosis." Fortunately, intoxication is usually of short duration and relatively benign.
