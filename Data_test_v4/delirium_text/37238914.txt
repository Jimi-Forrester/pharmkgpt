37238914|t|Associated Factors of Pneumonia in Individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Apart from the Use of Inhaled Corticosteroids.
37238914|a|Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are widely used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in combination with long-acting beta2 agonists (LABAs) to reduce exacerbations and improve patient lung function and quality of life. However, ICSs have been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in individuals with COPD, although the magnitude of this risk remains unclear. Therefore, it is difficult to make informed clinical decisions that balance the benefits and adverse effects of ICSs in people with COPD. There may be other causes of pneumonia in patients with COPD, and these causes are not always considered in studies on the risks of using ICSs in COPD. We consider it very useful to clarify these aspects in assessing the influence of ICSs on the incidence of pneumonia and their role in the treatment of COPD. This issue has important implications for current practice and the evaluation and management of COPD, since COPD patients may benefit from specific ICS-based treatment strategies. Many of the potential causes of pneumonia in patients with COPD can act synergistically, so they can be included in more than one section.
