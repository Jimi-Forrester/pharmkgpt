30747415|t|The Potential of 'Omics to Link Lipid Metabolism and Genetic and Comorbidity Risk Factors of Alzheimer's Disease in African Americans.
30747415|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) disproportionately affects African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics, who are more likely to have AD than non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and Asian Americans. Racial disparities in AD are multifactorial, with potential contributing factors including genetics, comorbidities, diet and lifestyle, education, healthcare access, and socioeconomic status. Interestingly, comorbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease also impact AAs. It is plausible that a common underlying molecular basis to these higher incidences of AD and comorbidities exists especially among AAs. A likely common molecular pathway that is centrally linked to AD and these noted comorbidities is alterations in lipid metabolism. Several genes associated with AD risk-most notably, the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and several mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) gene-are linked to altered lipid metabolism, especially in AAs. This review explores the role of lipid metabolism in AD broadly, as well as in other comorbidities that are prevalent in AAs. Because there are gaps in our understanding of the molecular basis of higher incidences of AD in AAs, 'omics approaches such as proteomics and lipidomics are presented as potential methods to improve our knowledge in these areas.
