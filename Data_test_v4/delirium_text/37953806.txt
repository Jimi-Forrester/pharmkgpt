37953806|t|Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers profile in scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD).
37953806|a|Background: A small proportion of patients with clinical parkinsonism have normal transporter-single photon emission computed tomography (DaTSPECT) which is commonly defined as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD). A better understanding of SWEDD can improve the current therapeutic options and appropriate disease monitoring. Aim: We aimed to assess CSF biomarkers levels including alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), amyloid betaeta (Abeta1-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in SWEDD and investigate the longitudinal alteration in the CSF profile. Methods: In total, 406 early-stage PD, 58 SWEDD, and 187 healthy controls (HCs) were entered into our study from PPMI. We compared the level of CSF biomarkers at baseline, six months, one year, and two years. Furthermore, the longitudinal alteration of CSF biomarkers was explored in each group using linear mixed models. Results: There was no significant difference in the level of CSF alpha-syn Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau between HCs and SWEDD at different time points. Investigating the level of CSF alpha-syn in PD and SWEDD showed a significant difference at one (p = 0.016) and two years (p = 0.006). Also, we observed a significant difference in the level of CSF Abeta1-42 between SWEDD and PD at one year (p = 0.012). Moreover, there was a significant difference in the level of CSF t-tau between SWEDD and PD subjects at one (p = 0.013) and two years (p = 0.017). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the level of CSF p-tau between SWEDD and PD groups at two years visits (p = 0.030). Longitudinal analysis showed a significant decrease after one (p = 0.029) and two years (p = 0.002) from baseline in the level of CSF alpha-syn only in the PD group. Also, we observed that the level of CSF Abeta1-42 significantly increased after one year in SWEDD (p = 0.031) and decreased after two years from baseline in PD subjects (p = 0.005). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the level of CSF t-tau after two years (p = 0.036) and CSF p-tau after six months from baseline in SWEDD subjects (p = 0.011). Conclusion: This finding suggests a faster neurodegeneration process in PD patients compared to SWEDD at least based on these biomarkers. Future studies with longer follow-up duration and more sample sizes are necessary to validate our results.
