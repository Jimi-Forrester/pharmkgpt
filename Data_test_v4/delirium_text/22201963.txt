22201963|a|Antlers represent an ideal experimental model for bone biology studies, because of their easy accessibility, and their rapid growth. Findings from our previous studies revealed that Mn plays an essential role in incorporating the circulating bone Ca to the growing antlers. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Mn, an essential mineral for Ca fixation (or incorporation) into bones, might be released from bone, during its remodeling, to be available for prioritized function, most likely, brain function; Consequently, Ca incorporation will be dramatically affected, leading to osteoporosis, particularly in elderly people. Therefore, osteoporosis would precede brain malfunctioning diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, and clinical data are available to support some of the predictions derived from this hypothesis.
