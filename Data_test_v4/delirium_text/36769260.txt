36769260|t|Piperidine Derivatives: Recent Advances in Synthesis and Pharmacological Applications.
36769260|a|Piperidines are among the most important synthetic fragments for designing drugs and play a significant role in the pharmaceutical industry. Their derivatives are present in more than twenty classes of pharmaceuticals, as well as alkaloids. The current review summarizes recent scientific literature on intra- and intermolecular reactions leading to the formation of various piperidine derivatives: substituted piperidines, spiropiperidines, condensed piperidines, and piperidinones. Moreover, the pharmaceutical applications of synthetic and natural piperidines were covered, as well as the latest scientific advances in the discovery and biological evaluation of potential drugs containing piperidine moiety. This review is designed to help both novice researchers taking their first steps in this field and experienced scientists looking for suitable substrates for the synthesis of biologically active piperidines.
