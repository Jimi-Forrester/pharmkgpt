30367689|a|Delirium is common in intensive care patients. Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used for sedation in this setting, but its effect on delirium remains unclear. The primary aim of this review was to examine whether dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence of delirium and agitation in intensive care patients. We sought randomised clinical trials in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and CENTRAL from their inception until June 2018. Observational studies, case reports, case series and non-systematic reviews were excluded. Twenty-five trials including 3240 patients were eligible for inclusion in the data synthesis. In the patients who received dexmedetomidine (eight trials, 1425 patients), delirium was reduced, odds ratio (95%CI) 0.36 (0.26-0.51), p < 0.001 and high quality of evidence. The use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a reduced incidence of agitation, OR (95%CI) 0.34 (0.20-0.59), p < 0.001, moderate quality of evidence. Patients who were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine had a significantly higher incidence of bradycardia, OR (95%CI) 2.18 (1.46-3.24), p < 0.001, moderate quality of evidence; and hypotension, OR (95%CI) 1.89 (1.48-2.41), p < 0.001, high quality of evidence. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality, OR (95%CI) 0.86 (0.66-1.10), p = 0.23, moderate quality of evidence. The trial sequential analyses for the incidence of delirium, bradycardia and hypotension was conclusive but not for the incidence of agitation and mortality. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence of delirium and agitation in intensive care patients. The general quality of evidence ranged from moderate to high.
