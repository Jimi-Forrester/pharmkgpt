33862084|t|An alpha-synuclein decoy peptide prevents cytotoxic alpha-synuclein aggregation caused by fatty acid binding protein 3.
33862084|a|alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) is a protein known to form intracellular aggregates during the manifestation of Parkinson's disease. Previously, it was shown that alphaSyn aggregation was strongly suppressed in the midbrain region of mice that did not possess the gene encoding the lipid transport protein fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3). An interaction between these two proteins was detected in vitro, suggesting that FABP3 may play a role in the aggregation and deposition of alphaSyn in neurons. To characterize the molecular mechanisms that underlie the interactions between FABP3 and alphaSyn that modulate the cellular accumulation of the latter, in this report, we used in vitro fluorescence assays combined with fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and quartz crystal microbalance assays to characterize in detail the process and consequences of FABP3-alphaSyn interaction. We demonstrated that binding of FABP3 to alphaSyn results in changes in the aggregation mechanism of the latter; specifically, a suppression of fibrillar forms of alphaSyn and also the production of aggregates with an enhanced cytotoxicity toward mice neuro2A cells. Because this interaction involved the C-terminal sequence region of alphaSyn, we tested a peptide derived from this region of alphaSyn (alphaSynP130-140) as a decoy to prevent the FABP3-alphaSyn interaction. We observed that the peptide competitively inhibited binding of alphaSyn to FABP3 in vitro and in cultured cells. We propose that administration of alphaSynP130-140 might be used to prevent the accumulation of toxic FABP3-alphaSyn oligomers in cells, thereby preventing the progression of Parkinson's disease.
