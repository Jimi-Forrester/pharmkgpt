37223334|a|Introduction: Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether HDP is also associated with later-life dementia has not been fully explored. Methods: Using the Utah Population Database, we performed an 80-year retrospective cohort study of 59,668 parous women. Results: Women with, versus without, HDP, had a 1.37 higher risk of all-cause dementia (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26, 1.50) after adjustment for maternal age at index birth, birth year, and parity. HDP was associated with a 1.64 higher risk of vascular dementia (95% CI: 1.19, 2.26) and 1.49 higher risk of other dementia (95% CI: 1.34, 1.65) but not Alzheimer's disease dementia (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.87, 1.24). Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia/eclampsia showed similar increased dementia risk. Nine mid-life cardiometabolic and mental health conditions explained 61% of HDP's effect on subsequent dementia risk. Discussion: Improved HDP and mid-life care could reduce the risk of dementia.
