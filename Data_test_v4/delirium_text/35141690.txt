35141690|a|BACKGROUND: Interscalene blocks are becoming increasingly common for shoulder surgeries. This study primarily aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and complications and the secondarily to investigate the anesthesia-related time and patient satisfaction of an ultrasound-guided interscalene block performed by an orthopedic surgeon. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1322 consecutive patients (arthroscopic, 1225 cases; open, 97 cases) with a mean age of 64.2 years, who underwent shoulder surgery (arthroscopic or opensurgery) under an ultrasound-guided interscalene block performed by an orthopedic surgeon at a single institution between December 2012 and December 2019. We investigated patient satisfaction, block success rates, and complications and also compared the anesthesia-related time of an interscalene block with that of general anesthesia (428 cases, arthroscopic, 257 cases; open, 171 cases) for shoulder surgery with patients in the beach chair position during the same period. Difference between total anesthesia time and surgical time was defined as anesthesia-related time. RESULTS: Approximately 98.3% of patients were satisfied with an interscalene block, and the block success rate on the first attempt was 99.9%. Total complication incidence was 2.3%, with no recorded life-threatening complications. Anesthesia-related times were significantly shorter in the interscalene block group than those in the general anesthesia group (45 +- 14 min vs. 100 +- 26 min, P < .001). CONCLUSION: An ultrasound-guided interscalene block performed by an orthopedic surgeon for shoulder surgery is effective and safe, requires less time, and has a high patient acceptance rate, making it a feasible and alternative to the block performed by anesthesiologists.
