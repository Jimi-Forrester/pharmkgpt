16504344|a|Tg2576 mice, a transgenic model of amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), develop measurable levels of soluble amyloid beta1-40 and 1-42 by 6 months of age and amyloid plaque deposition in cortex, hippocampus and amygdala by 10 months of age. To investigate whether non-hippocampal learning strategies would predominate coincident with the age-related increase in Abeta load in the hippocampal region, we measured learning strategies in the T-maze and a redundant cued version of the water maze. Each of these tasks can be solved using either hippocampal or non-hippocampal learning strategies and has proved sensitive to hippocampal disruption in other settings. The results revealed subtle differences in T-maze and water maze performance in Tg2576 mice compared to controls. Surprisingly, however, Tg2576 mice were not impaired relative to non-transgenic littermates on any measures of hippocampal dependent behavior assessed in these tasks. These data suggest that the medial temporal lobe retains considerable function in 15-month-old Tg2576 mice despite significant Abeta pathology.
