39511125|t|Wnt/beta-catenin Signaling in Central Nervous System Regeneration.
39511125|a|The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development, maintenance, and repair of the central nervous system (CNS). This chapter explores the diverse functions of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, from its critical involvement in embryonic CNS development to its reparative and plasticity-inducing roles in response to CNS injury. We discuss how Wnt/beta-catenin signaling influences various CNS cell types-astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes-each contributing to repair and plasticity after injury. The chapter also addresses the pathway's involvement in CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, psychiatric disorders, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), highlighting potential Wnt-based therapeutic approaches. Lastly, zebrafish are presented as a promising model organism for studying CNS regeneration and neurodegenerative diseases, offering insights into future research and therapeutic development.
