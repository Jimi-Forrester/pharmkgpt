39723106|a|CSF concentrations of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and have been studied in relation to several neuropathological features both in patients and in cognitively unimpaired individuals. The CSF p-tau/Abeta42 ratio, a biomarker combining information from both pathophysiological processes, has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring disease progression, even at pre-clinical stages. Here, we studied the association between the CSF p-tau/Abeta42 ratio with downstream markers of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease progression including brain structure, glucose metabolism, fibrillary Abeta deposition and cognitive performance in 234 cognitively unimpaired individuals, who underwent cognitive testing, a lumbar puncture, MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-flutemetamol PET scanning. We evaluated both main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's disease risk factors, such as older age, female sex and the apoliporoptein E (APOE)-e4 allele, in a priori defined regions of interest and further examined the associations on the whole-brain using voxel-wise regressions. In addition, as the association between CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and brain structure and function may be non-linear, we tested the interaction between the CSF p-tau/Abeta42 ratio and stages of pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease defined using the amyloid (A) and tau (T) classification. We found significantly positive associations between CSF p-tau/Abeta42 and both cortical Abeta deposition and regional grey matter volume while no effect was observed for brain metabolism. A significant interaction with age indicated that, for the same level of CSF p-tau/Abeta42, older individuals displayed both increased Abeta deposition and lower grey matter volume, in widespread cortical areas. In addition, we found that women compared with men had a greater Abeta fibrillary accumulation in midline cortical areas and inferior temporal regions, for the same level of the CSF biomarker. The impact of CSF p-tau/Abeta42 on grey matter volume was modulated by AT stages, with A+T+ individuals displaying significantly less positive associations in areas of early atrophy in the Alzheimer's continuum. Finally, we found that sex and APOE-e4 modulated the association between the CSF biomarker and episodic memory as well as abstract reasoning, respectively. Our data indicate that the CSF p-tau/Abeta42 ratio is strongly associated with multiple downstream neuropathological events in cognitively unimpaired individuals and may thus serve as a potent biomarker to investigate the earliest changes in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease. Given that its impact on both Abeta deposition and grey matter volume is modulated by specific risk factors, our results highlight the need to take into account such predisposing variables in both clinical practice and prevention trials.
