37297807|t|Effect of Psychosocial Interventions for Individuals Who Underwent Arthroscopy in Femoroacetabular Impingement: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
37297807|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this protocol was to discover the connection between patients with non-surgical pain or other discomfort and their psychosocial status. Cognitive behavior therapy will be used, which we verified will determine the effect and feasibility of postoperative rehabilitation processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study will include 200 patients ranging from 18 to 60 years old who have underwent or will undergo FAI arthroscopy in the West China Hospital Sports Medicine Center from 2023 to 2026. A standardized prospective single-center parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be used for these participants. The participants will be divided into intervention (telephone versus face-to-face versus music versus floatation) and control groups. The follow-up periods will be measured pre-operatively, as well as postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcomes will include the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) and the Visual Analogic Score (VAS), and the secondary outcomes will include the range of motion (ROM), the Huaxi Emotional-distress Index (HEI), and the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21 scale). Furthermore, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and a Short-Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire will also be evaluated. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different types of psychosocial-therapy-based rehabilitation methods designed to improve the quality of life of FAI patients with persistent symptoms.
