27244899|a|A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in population of Caucasian identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17125944 in the FERMT2 gene as a new susceptibility locus for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). In order to validate the association of the rs17125944 polymorphism with LOAD risk in the northern Han Chinese, we recruited a case-control study of 2338 Han Chinese subjects (984 cases and 1354 age- and gender-matched controls). Our results demonstrated that there was no significant association between the rs17125944 polymorphism and LOAD (genotype: P = 0.953; allele: P = 0.975). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in alleles and genotypes distribution after stratification by apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 and multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also performed a meta-analysis in 81908 individuals. The meta-analysis showed that the C allele is the risk factor for LOAD in Caucasian group (OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 1.10-1.20) and combined population (OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.08-1.19). While in Chinese population, the C allele is not associated with increased risk of LOAD (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 0.89-1.28). In conclusion, our study showed that the rs17125944 polymorphism in FERMT2 gene might not be association with LOAD in northern Han Chinese population.
