35070821|a|BACKGROUND: To construct a nursing solution for the prevention and control of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the early stage after kidney transplantation, and to provide systematic and standardized nursing intervention measures for patients in the early stage after kidney transplantation. METHODS: The preliminary draft of intervention plan was formulated based on risk factor analysis research results of early UTI after kidney transplantation, combined with theoretical research, literature review, and research group meeting. The Delphi method was used to consult 15 experts for two rounds, and the entries were modified according to the opinions of the experts. RESULTS: After two rounds of consultation, the expert opinions tended to be consistent, and expert authority coefficient was 0.87. The Kendall harmony coefficient of importance and feasibility indexes of the two rounds of consultation were 0.407, 0.651 and 0.545, 0.686, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P<0.001). The nursing solution consisted of eight first-level indexes and 35 second-level indexes. The eight first-level indexes included admission symptom evaluation, UTI monitoring, health education, sports intervention, nutrition intervention, ward management, risk factor prevention and nursing, and psychosocial intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed a scientific and reliable nursing solution for the prevention and control of early UTI after kidney transplantation, which is hugely important for guiding clinical nursing work.
