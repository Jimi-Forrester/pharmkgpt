34386045|t|Surgical "elephant trunk" arch replacement with a branched arch prosthesis: two alternative operative techniques.
34386045|a|INTRODUCTION: Elephant trunk repair of the aortic arch cannot be performed with a branched prosthesis. AIM: We conceived two different modifications of the original technique to perform an arch replacement with a branched graft, while arranging an adequate landing zone for a subsequent thoracic endovascular aortic repair, without the need of dedicated material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight consecutive patients underwent arch replacement with one of our techniques. Five were emergency patients with acute aortic dissection, and 3 suffered chronic expansive disease. The "modified elephant trunk" includes a separate anastomosis of an endo-luminal prosthetic segment in the descending aorta. Subsequently, the branched arch prosthesis is anastomosed to the distal aortic stump with the attached trunk. In the "prophylactic debranching", a tail is left on the distal end of the arch prosthesis, so that the branches for the supra-aortic vessels will remain displaced proximally, allowing a "zone 1" available for landing. RESULTS: Three patients experienced transient cerebral deficits (1 transient ischemic attack and post-operative delirium in 2 cases), 1 required re-operation for bleeding and 2 needed prolonged intubation. One died of multi-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques proved to be easily reproducible, and allow an adequate landing zone for a subsequent endovascular procedure, while retaining the advantages of using a tetra-furcated prosthesis. They are a viable alternative when a hybrid prosthesis cannot be implanted.
