There are more than 600 diseases of the nervous system, such as brain tumors, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and stroke as well as less familiar ones such as frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias; cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, migraine, and other headache disorders; multiple sclerosis; neuroinfections; brain tumors; traumatic disorders of the nervous system such as brain trauma; and neurological disorders as a result of malnutrition. More than a decade of research worldwide has shown that berries support cognitive health by protecting nerves and help brain cells communicate with each other and improve the flexibility of nerve structures. Berries help nerves tolerate stress, including the stress of toxic exposure. They also support the healthy function of glial cells in the brain, essential for optimum brain function. Polyphenols, namely, anthocyanins, found in berries may slow cognitive decline through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in experimental animals. Based on the previous reports, this review explains the beneficial effects of the phytochemicals present in nine varieties of berries on neurodegenerative diseases.
