25125026|t|Glial Asthenia and Functional Paralysis: A New Perspective on Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease.
25125026|a|Neuroglia are represented by several population of cells heterogeneous in structure and function that provide for the homeostasis of the brain and the spinal cord. Neuroglial cells are also central for neuroprotection and defence of the central nervous system against exo- and endogenous insults. At the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease neuroglial cells become asthenic and lose some of their homeostatic, neuroprotective, and defensive capabilities. Astroglial reactivity, for example, correlates with preservation of cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Here, we overview the experimental data indicating glial paralysis in neurodegeneration and argue that loss of glial function is fundamental for defining the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
