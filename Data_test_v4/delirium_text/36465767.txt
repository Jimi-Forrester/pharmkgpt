36465767|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are prevalent medical conditions affecting millions of people worldwide and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The main precursor of CVDs and the related events, such as hypertension and heart failure, is hyperlipidemia, most commonly an increase in low-density lipoproteins. Lipid-lowering drugs are cardinal in the treatment of CVDs. American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have issued guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy, and statins are first-line medication. In the recent years, a new class of lipid-lowering agents called proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors has been identified as the potential lipid-lowering therapy for the statin-resistant patient. In clinical trials and observational studies, PCSK9 inhibitors and statins are both associated with the development of neurocognitive dysfunction in the older population. This systematic review aims to inquire if there is significant neurocognitive dysfunction associated with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors and compare neurocognitive effects associated with statins with those of PCSK9 inhibitors.
