27133777|a|To identify some apparent biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, we investigated whether there would be a significant difference between the levels of the plasma proteins of AD patients and healthy people. A total of 115 subjects were enrolled, 60 individuals with AD and 55 healthy controls. There was a statistical difference in the mini-mental status exam (MMSE) scores and the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores between the two groups. We used the immunoblotting assay to analyze several plasma proteins in the subjects. Amyloid-beta (Abeta), S100a9, and soluble neuregulin-1 (sNRG-1), including alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) as a detection control were detected in the plasma samples. Unlike Abeta, S100a9 and alpha-Syn, the level of sNRG-1 of the AD patients was significantly higher than that of the healthy control subjects. The AD patients were divided into mild and moderate groups according to their MMSE and CDR scores. We found a significant correlation between the level of sNRG-1 and MMSE scores. The sNRG-1 level was significantly higher in mild AD patients as well as in moderate AD patients compared with that of the control subjects. These new findings indicate that increased plasma sNRG-1 levels might be a novel and reliable biological marker for the early diagnosis of AD.
