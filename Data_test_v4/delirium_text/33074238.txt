33074238|t|Apolipoprotein e4 Affects Multiple Domains of Neuropsychological Functioning in a Sample of Elderly Hispanics.
33074238|a|Apolipoprotein e4 allele (APOEe4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), but inconsistencies have arisen in studies with Hispanics. The objective of this study was to explore APOEe4 expression and cognitive function in a sample of Panamanian older adults, including healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. Participants with at least one copy of APOEe4 had a significantly lower performance in global cognition, verbal memory, executive functions, visuospatial abilities, regardless of diagnosis. The present study contributes to the understanding of the association of APOEe4 and impairment in specific cognitive domains in elderly Hispanics.
