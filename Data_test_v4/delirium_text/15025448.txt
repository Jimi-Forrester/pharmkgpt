15025448|t|Direct detection of homocysteine.
15025448|a|Homocysteine (Hcy) is a biomarker for significant disorders including Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease. The monitoring of Hcy levels in plasma is of current concern. We describe highly selective colorimetric methods for the direct detection of Hcy. Inexpensive, commercially available materials are employed. The results show potential application for the detection of Hcy in human blood plasma.
