37551153|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) remains a frequent complication after cardiac surgery, with pre-operative cognitive status being one of the main predisposing factors. However, performing complete pre-operative neuropsychological testing is challenging. The magnitude of frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha oscillations during general anaesthesia has been related to pre-operative cognition and could constitute a functional marker for brain vulnerability. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesised that features of intra-operative alpha-band activity could predict the occurrence of POD. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective observational study. SETTING: University hospital, from 15 May 2019 to 15 December 2021. PATIENTS: Adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre-operative cognitive status was assessed by neuropsychological tests and scored as a global z score. A 5-min EEG recording was obtained 30 min after induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. Power and peak frequency in the alpha-band were extracted from the frequency spectra. POD was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit, the Confusion Assessment Method and a chart review. RESULTS: Sixty-five (29.5%) of 220 patients developed POD. Delirious patients were significantly older with median [IQR] ages of 74 [64 to 79] years vs. 67 [59 to 74] years; P < 0.001) and had lower pre-operative cognitive z scores (-0.52 +- 1.14 vs. 0.21 +- 0.84; P < 0.001). Mean alpha power (-14.03 +- 4.61 dB vs. -11.59 +- 3.37 dB; P < 0.001) and maximum alpha power (-11.36 +- 5.28 dB vs. -8.85 +- 3.90 dB; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in delirious patients. Intra-operative mean alpha power was significantly associated with the probability of developing POD (adjusted odds ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81 to 0.96; P = 0.007), independently of age and only whenever cognitive status was not considered. CONCLUSION: A lower intra-operative frontal alpha-band power is associated with a higher incidence of POD after cardiac surgery. Intra-operative measures of alpha power could constitute a means of identifying patients at risk of this complication. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03706989.
