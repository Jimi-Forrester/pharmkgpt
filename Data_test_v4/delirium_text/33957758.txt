33957758|a|Significance: Physiological concentrations of nitric oxide (NO ) and related reactive nitrogen species (RNS) mediate multiple signaling pathways in the nervous system. During inflammaging (chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging) and in neurodegenerative diseases, excessive RNS contribute to synaptic and neuronal loss. "NO signaling" in both health and disease is largely mediated through protein S-nitrosylation (SNO), a redox-based posttranslational modification with "NO" (possibly in the form of nitrosonium cation [NO+]) reacting with cysteine thiol (or, more properly, thiolate anion [R-S-]). Recent Advances: Emerging evidence suggests that S-nitrosylation occurs predominantly via transnitros(yl)ation. Mechanistically, the reaction involves thiolate anion, as a nucleophile, performing a reversible nucleophilic attack on a nitroso nitrogen to form an SNO-protein adduct. Prior studies identified transnitrosylation reactions between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-nuclear proteins, thioredoxin-caspase-3, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-caspase-3. Recently, we discovered that enzymes previously thought to act in completely disparate biochemical pathways can transnitrosylate one another during inflammaging in an unexpected manner to mediate neurodegeneration. Accordingly, we reported a concerted tricomponent transnitrosylation network from Uch-L1-to-Cdk5-to-Drp1 that mediates synaptic damage in Alzheimer's disease. Critical Issues: Transnitrosylation represents a critical chemical mechanism for transduction of redox-mediated events to distinct subsets of proteins. Although thousands of thiol-containing proteins undergo S-nitrosylation, how transnitrosylation regulates a myriad of neuronal attributes is just now being uncovered. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the study of the chemical biology of transnitrosylation between proteins as a mechanism of disease. Future Directions: We discuss future areas of study of protein transnitrosylation that link our understanding of aging, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Antioxid.
