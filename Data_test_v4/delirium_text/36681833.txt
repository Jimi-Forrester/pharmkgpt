36681833|a|OBJECTIVES: There are limited data about nosocomial coinfections of COVID-19 cases monitored in the intensive care unit. This study aims to investigate coinfections in COVID-19 patients followed in an intensive care unit of a university hospital. METHODS: This study analyzed retrospectively the data of coinfections of 351 COVID-19 patients in the period 28.02.2020-15.01.2021 in a tertiary care intensive care unit in a university hospital. RESULTS: Bacterial coinfections were present in 216 of the 351 cases. One hundred and thirty of these cases were evaluated as nosocomial infections. On the third day the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score, usage of invasive mechanical ventilation and presence of septic shock were significantly higher in the coinfected group. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, procalcitonin, ferritin, and blood urea nitrogen values were significantly higher in the coinfection group. White blood cells (WBC) (OR: 1.075, 95% CI 1.032-1.121, p = 0.001) and ICU hospitalization day (OR: 1.114, 95% CI 1.063-1.167, p < 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for coinfection in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The rates of hospitalization day on the day of arrival, the 21st day, as well as total mortality (p = 0.004), were significantly higher in the coinfected group. CONCLUSION: Bacterial coinfections of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit remain a problem. Identifying the infectious agent, classifying colonizations and infections, and using the proper treatment of antibiotics are of great importance in the case management of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit.
