38002280|t|Anthocyanins: Molecular Aspects on Their Neuroprotective Activity.
38002280|a|Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoids that give plants and fruits their vibrant colors. They are known for their potent antioxidant properties and have been linked to various health benefits. Upon consumption, anthocyanins are quickly absorbed and can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Research based on population studies suggests that including anthocyanin-rich sources in the diet lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Anthocyanins exhibit neuroprotective effects that could potentially alleviate symptoms associated with such diseases. In this review, we compiled and discussed a large body of evidence supporting the neuroprotective role of anthocyanins. Our examination encompasses human studies, animal models, and cell cultures. We delve into the connection between anthocyanin bioactivities and the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Our findings highlight how anthocyanins' antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties contribute to their neuroprotective effects. These effects are particularly relevant to key signaling pathways implicated in the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In conclusion, the outcome of this review suggests that integrating anthocyanin-rich foods into human diets could potentially serve as a therapeutic approach for neurological conditions, and we identify promising avenues for further exploration in this area.
