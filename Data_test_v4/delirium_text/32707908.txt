32707908|t|The UPR in Neurodegenerative Disease: Not Just an Inside Job.
32707908|a|Neurons are highly specialized cells that continuously and extensively communicate with other neurons, as well as glia cells. During their long lifetime, the post-mitotic neurons encounter many stressful situations that can disrupt protein homeostasis (proteostasis). The importance of tight protein quality control is illustrated by neurodegenerative disorders where disturbed neuronal proteostasis causes neuronal dysfunction and loss. For their unique function, neurons require regulated and long-distance transport of membrane-bound cargo and organelles. This highlights the importance of protein quality control in the neuronal endomembrane system, to which the unfolded protein response (UPR) is instrumental. The UPR is a highly conserved stress response that is present in all eukaryotes. However, recent studies demonstrate the existence of cell-type-specific aspects of the UPR, as well as cell non-autonomous UPR signaling. Here we discuss these novel insights in view of the complex cellular architecture of the brain and the implications for neurodegenerative diseases.
