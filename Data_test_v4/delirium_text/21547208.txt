21547208|t|Mitochondria, Amyloid beta, and Alzheimer's Disease.
21547208|a|Hypometabolism is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and implicates a mitochondrial role in the neuropathology associated with AD. Mitochondrial amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation precedes extracellular Abeta deposition. In addition to increasing oxidative stress, Abeta has been shown to directly inhibit mitochondrial enzymes. Inhibition of mitochondrial enzymes as a result of oxidative damage or Abeta interaction perpetuates oxidative stress and leads to a hypometabolic state. Additionally, Abeta has also been shown to interact with cyclophilin D, a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which may promote cell death. Therefore, ample evidence exists indicating that the mitochondrion plays a vital role in the pathophysiology observed in AD.
