31837307|a|Neuroinflammation is involved in brain aging and neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Butein has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-cancer effects. However, few studies have been done to evaluate whether butein exerts protective effects on neurons, and the potential mechanism for this effect has not been studied. Here, we examined the effect of butein on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells grown with conditioned medium from BV2 microglia cells that had been activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a neuroinflammation model. We found butein pretreatment significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting the apoptosis normally induced by microglia-conditioned medium. SH-SY5Y cells treated with microglia-conditioned medium showed upregulated ERK signaling pathway-related mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation, which was dose-dependently reversed by butein. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot results showed that BV2-LPS conditioned medium-induced Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transactivational activity in SH-SY5Y cells, but this was attenuated by butein treatment of the BV2 cells prior to their exposure to LPS. Collectively, our results indicate that butein effectively mitigates inflammatory injury caused by LPS-conditioned medium from microglia, possibly due to reductions in the transactivational activity of NF-kappaB p65 and ERK signaling pathway activation, and provide evidence for a neuroprotective role of butein through blocking negative consequences of microglial activation.
