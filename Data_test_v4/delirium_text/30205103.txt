30205103|t|Streptocyclinones A and B ameliorate Alzheimer's disease pathological processes in vitro.
30205103|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pathology characterized by the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are also strongly related to this disease. The ability of two new glycosylated angucyclinones, streptocyclinones A and B (1 and 2), isolated from Streptomyces sp to improve AD hallmarks was evaluated. Compounds were able to protect SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from H2O2-induced oxidative injury by activating the nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2). Their capacity to modulate neuroinflammation was tested in lipopolysaccharide-activated BV2 microglial cells. Compounds reduced the release of pro-inflammatory factors, inhibited the activation of NFkappaB and mitogen activated kinases (MAPK), and induced the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus of microglial cells. A trans-well co-culture was established to determine the effect of microglia treated with streptocyclinones on the survival of SH-SY5Y cells. The cell viability of neuroblastoma cells increased when the compounds were added to BV2 cells. SH-SY5Y-TMHT441 cells were used to determine the effect of compounds on tau phosphorylation. Both compounds reduced tau hyperphophorylation by targeting MAPK kinases. Moreover, streptocyclinone B (2) was able to inhibit the activity of beta-secretase 1 and decrease the release of reactive oxygen species in BV2 cells stimulated with Abeta. With the same co-culture trans-well system, the treatment of Abeta-stimulated microglia with compound 2 augmented the viability of SH-SY5Y-TMHT441 cells. The results presented in this work provide evidences of the multitarget activities displayed by these new Streptomyces compounds, making them good candidates for further studies in the treatment of AD.
