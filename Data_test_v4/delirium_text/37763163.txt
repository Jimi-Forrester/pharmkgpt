37763163|a|The expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat (HRE) in the non-coding region of the C9ORF72 gene (C9ORF72-HRE) is the most common genetic cause of familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), FTD, and concurrent ALS and FTD (ALS-FTD), in addition to contributing to the sporadic forms of these diseases. Both syndromes overlap not only genetically, but also sharing similar clinical and neuropathological findings, being considered as a spectrum. In this paper we describe the clinical-genetic findings in a Basque family with different manifestations within the spectrum, our difficulties in reaching the diagnosis, and a narrative review, carried out as a consequence, of the main features associated with C9ORF72-HRE. Family members underwent a detailed clinical assessment, neurological examination, and genetic analysis by repeat-primed PCR. We studied 10 relatives of a symptomatic carrier of the C9ORF72-HRE expansion. Two of them presented the expansion in the pathological range, one of them was symptomatic whereas the other one remained asymptomatic at 72 years. Given the great intrafamilial clinical variability of C9ORF72-HRE, the characterization of patients and family members with particular clinical and genetic subgroups within ALS and FTD becomes a bottleneck for medication development, in particular for genetically focused medicines for ALS and FTD.
