33662757|t|A review on ferulic acid and analogs based scaffolds for the management of Alzheimer's disease.
33662757|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe central cholinergic neuronal loss, gradually contributing to cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor activity, resulting in the brain's cell death at the later stages of AD. Although the etiology of AD is not well understood, however, several factors such as oxidative stress, deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides to form Abeta plaques, intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and low level of acetylcholine are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD. There is practically no drug for AD treatment that can address the basic factors responsible for the neurodegeneration and slow down the disease progression. The currently available therapies for AD in the market focus on providing only symptomatic relief without addressing the aforesaid basic factors responsible for the neurodegeneration. Ferulic acid (FA) is a phenol derivative from natural sources and serves as a potential pharmacophore that exerts multiple pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, neuroprotection, Abeta aggregation modulation, and anti-inflammatory. Several FA based hybrid analogs are under investigation as a multi-target directed ligand (MTDLs) to develop novel hybrid compounds for the treatment of AD. In the present review article, we are focused on the critical pathogenic factors responsible for the onset of AD followed by the developments of FA pharmacophore-based hybrids compounds as a novel multifunctional therapeutic agent to address the limitations associated with available treatment for AD. The rationale behind the development of these compounds and their pharmacological activities in particular to their ChE inhibition (ChEI), neuroprotection, antioxidant property, Abeta aggregation modulation, and metal chelation ability, are discussed in detail. We have also discussed the discovery of caffeic and cinnamic acids based MTDLs for AD. This review paper provides an in-depth insight into the research progress and current status of these novel therapeutics in AD and prospects for developing a druggable molecule with desired pharmacological affinity and reduced toxicity for the management of AD.
