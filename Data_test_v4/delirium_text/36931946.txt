36931946|a|Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent form of dementia, particularly among the elderly population. It is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Despite numerous studies, the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain, and various theories have been proposed, including Abeta amyloid deposition in the brain and tau protein hyper-phosphorylation. This review article explores the potential pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on the effects of derangements in the levels of vitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine, as well as the impact of oral bacteria causing periodontitis and insulin resistance, and their relationship to Alzheimer's. Studies have shown that high levels of homocysteine and low levels of vitamin B12 and folate, are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The article also explores the link between Alzheimer's disease and oral bacteria, specifically dental infections and periodontitis, which contribute to the inflammatory processes in the nervous system of Alzheimer's patients. There could be derangement in the insulin signaling further causing disruption in glucose metabolism within the brain, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease may represent a form of type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with the brain, commonly known as type 3 diabetes. Neuroimaging techniques, including MRI, PET, and tau PET, can identify the predictive characteristics of Alzheimer's disease, with amyloid PET being the most useful in ruling out the disease. The article concludes by stressing the importance of understanding genetic and neuroimaging factors in the diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease.
