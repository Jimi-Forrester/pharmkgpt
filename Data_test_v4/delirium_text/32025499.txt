32025499|a|Zolpidem is an introduced medication for the therapy of sleeping disorders. Its pharmacological effects are consequently characterized by a quick onset and a half-life of 2.4 h. Previous studies revealed the antioxidant and neuroprotectant effects of zolpidem. In this research, we wanted to demonstrate the exact sub-cellular/molecular mechanism of this medication using the primary neuronal cortical culture. For this purpose, firstly, the cortical neurons were isolated from the postnatal Wistar rat pups. Thereafter, different neural toxicity endpoints caused by acrylamide including ROS formation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, lysosomal membrane integrity, and apoptosis were determined. All of these parameters are upstream events of cellular apoptosis which justifies neurodegeneration involved in many diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Our results demonstrated that zolpidem at concentrations of 1 and 2 mM prevented all the acrylamide-induced above referenced neural toxic events leading to neuronal apoptosis. These results revealed that zolpidem has the antioxidant and neuroprotectant properties that make it a promising prophylactic agent for preventing neurodegenerative complications. Considering the important role of oxidative stress in the development or progression of diseases, if the medication used as a treatment of a disease has antioxidant properties at the same time, it will certainly have much greater healing effects.
