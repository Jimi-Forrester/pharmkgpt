39373028|t|Adherence to optimal delirium management practices in intensive care units in Brazil: a nationwide survey.
39373028|a|BACKGROUND: Effective delirium management is crucial, considering its association with adverse outcomes. Adherence to best practices has the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of delirium and improve health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this project were to describe self-assessed adherence to best practices in delirium management by health care professionals in intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil, assess the health care professionals' perception of the importance of adequate delirium prevention and treatment in ICUs, and compare the compliance rates with best practices between public and private ICUs. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Brazil using an online questionnaire consisting of three parts, namely, data about the health care professionals and the ICU in which they worked; statements about the 17 best practices; and questions related to perceptions of delirium prevention and management by ICU physicians and nurses. The survey was sent to email addresses registered with the Brazilian Association of Intensive Care Medicine. RESULTS: The compliance rate exceeded 50% for only eight best practices. These included the identification and management of pressure sores and falls in delirium patients, with compliance rates of 77.8% and 74.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among ICU professionals in Brazil, adherence to best practices in delirium management is low, particularly for practices involving patient education and involvement of their relatives in their care. These results emphasize the importance of enhancing delirium management in Brazilian health care institutions, regardless of hospital classification.
