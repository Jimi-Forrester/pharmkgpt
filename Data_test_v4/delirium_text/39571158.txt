39571158|t|The Expanding Burden of Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Unmet Medical and Social Need.
39571158|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as well as Parkinson's disease, are emerging as profoundly significant challenges and burdens to global health, a trend highlighted by the most recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 studies. This growing impact is closely linked to the demographic shift toward an aging population and the potential long-term repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which have intensified the prevalence and severity of these conditions. In this review, we explore several critical aspects of this complex issue, including the increasing global burden of neurodegenerative diseases, unmet medical and social needs within current care systems, the unique and amplified challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and potential strategies for enhancing healthcare policy and practice. We underscore the urgent need for cohesive, multidisciplinary approaches across medical, research, and policy domains to effectively address the increasing burden of neurodegenerative diseases, thereby improving the quality of life for patients and their caregivers.
