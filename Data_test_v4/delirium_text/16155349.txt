16155349|t|Asynchronous regional brain volume losses in presymptomatic to moderate AD.
16155349|a|To determine if rates and locations of brain volume loss associated with AD are phase-specific, occurring prior to clinical onset and at later stages, we performed longitudinal volumetric MRI analysis on 155 subjects enrolled in a prospective study of aging and dementia. Subjects were divided by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale into stages of Normal (CDR 0 --> 0), Very Mild (CDR 0 --> 0.5 and 0.5 --> 0.5), Mild (CDR 0.5 --> 1.0 and 1.0 --> 1.0) and Moderate (CDR 1.0 --> 2.0 and 2.0 --> 2.0) dementia. Rates of volume change in CSF spaces, lobar and medial temporal lobe regions were analyzed for group differences across stages. Annual rates of ventricular volume change differed between non-demented and very mild group (p<0.01). In later severity stages, ventricular, temporal, basal ganglia-thalamic region and total volumes show change. Rates of volume loss increase as dementia progresses, but not uniformly in all regions. These regional and phase-specific volume changes form targets for monitoring disease-modifying therapies at clinically relevant, defined stages of dementia.
