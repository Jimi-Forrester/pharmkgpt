32377265|t|"Olfactory Three-Needle" Enhances Spatial Learning and Memory Ability in SAMP8 Mice.
32377265|a|As one of the most important therapies in complementary and alternative medicine, acupuncture has been used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Acupuncture of "olfactory three-needle" manipulation can improve the cognitive ability of AD patients. However, the mechanism of "olfactory three-needle" in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we identified that the "olfactory three-needle" therapy and eugenol olfactory stimulation both reduced the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein and increased the expression of synaptophysin (SYP), but only the "olfactory three-needle" enhanced the spatial learning and memory ability of SAMP8. Remarkably, the "olfactory three-needle" inhibited the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and the excessive activation of microglia (MG) in the hippocampus. Our study demonstrates that the "olfactory three-needle" enhances spatial learning and memory ability by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and the excessive activation of MG to reduce the neuroinflammatory response and neurotoxicity of Abeta and promote synaptic regeneration, but it was not completely consistent with the stimulation of the olfactory system.
