36034176|a|Corona virus (COVID-19) is an epidemy of respiratory disease caused by a novel corona virus and it was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health pandemic emergency. Due to the neuropsychiatric manifestation of Covid-19 that have been associated with psychotic disorders, in this paper we choose to present a case from "Elena Doamna" Psychiatric Hospital from Galati, Romania and to correlate it with other cases from literature in a mini review presentation. In our paper, we present the case of a patient of 44-year-old men, with no past psychiatric history whose behavior included psycho-motor agitation, perception and thinking disorders, disorganized behaviour, attempted suicide by stabbing. The last perspectives from the two years of pandemic together with psychiatric disease linked the virus infections with psychosis to the main concern that Covid-19 could determine psychiatric disorders. There were also presented same literature studies of patients with no personal pathological history in the psychiatric field which developed psychiatric disorders after COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 has a psychological impact on the mental health status of the worldwide and, especially when it is associated with psychotic symptoms and can affect the quality-of-life. In some cases, the virus affected the brain and as a result, the psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus. Based on the DSM V and ICD-10 criteria, the diagnosis was of acute psychiatric disorders with symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.1). The case report and review reliefs that there is a causal link between the SARS CoV-2 infection and mental disorders, which is currently being investigated.
