39006715|t|Neuroinflammation: A Critical Factor in Neurodegenerative Disorders.
39006715|a|This review offers a comprehensive review of the signals and the paramount role neuroinflammation plays in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study explores the sophisticated interactions between microglial, astrocytic, and dendritic cells and how neuroinflammation affects long-term neuronal damage and dysfunction. There are specific pathways related to the mentioned inflammatory processes, including Janus kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcriptions, nuclear factor-kappaB, and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways. Neuroinflammation is argued to be a double-edged sword, being not only a protective agent that prevents further neuron damage but also the causative factor in more cell injury development. This concept of contrasting inflammation with neuroprotection advocates for the use of therapeutic techniques that seek to modulate neuroinflammatory responses as part of the neurodegeneration treatment. The recent research findings are integrated with the established knowledge to help present a comprehensive image of neuroinflammation's impact on neurodegenerative diseases and its implications for future therapy.
