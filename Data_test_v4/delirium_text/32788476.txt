32788476|t|Argon reduces microglial activation and inflammatory cytokine expression in retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.
32788476|a|We previously found that argon exerts its neuroprotective effect in part by inhibition of the toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4. The downstream transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) are also affected by argon and may play a role in neuroprotection. It also has been demonstrated that argon treatment could mitigate brain damage, reduce excessive microglial activation, and subsequently attenuate brain inflammation. Despite intensive research, the further exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, human neuroblastoma cells were damaged in vitro with rotenone over a period of 4 hours (to mimic cerebral ischemia and reperfusion damage), followed by a 2-hour post-conditioning with argon (75%). In a separate in vivo experiment, retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced in rats by increasing intraocular pressure for 1 hour. Upon reperfusion, argon was administered by inhalation for 2 hours. Argon reduced the binding of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor kappa B, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, which are involved in regulation of neuronal damage. Flow cytometry analysis showed that argon downregulated the Fas ligand. Some transcription factors were regulated by toll-like receptors; therefore, their effects could be eliminated, at least in part, by the TLR2 and TLR4 inhibitor oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC). Argon treatment reduced microglial activation after retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Our results suggest that argon reduced the extent of inflammation in retinal neurons after ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppression of transcription factors crucial for microglial activation. Argon has no known side effects or narcotic properties; therefore, therapeutic use of this noble gas appears ideal for treatment of patients with neuronal damage in retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury. The animal experiments were approved by the Commission for Animal Care of the University of Freiburg (approval No. 35-9185.81/G14-122) on October 19, 2012.
