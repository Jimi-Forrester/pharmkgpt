28054669|t|Comparison of the Pharmacological Profiles of Selective PDE4B and PDE4D Inhibitors in the Central Nervous System.
28054669|a|Inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) has been proposed as a potential treatment for a series of neuropsychological conditions such as depression, anxiety and memory loss. However, the specific involvement of each of the PDE4 subtypes (PDE4A, 4B and 4C) in different categories of behavior has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we compared the possible pharmacological effects of PDE4B and PDE4D selective inhibitors, A-33 and D159687, in mediating neurological function in mice. Both compounds were equally potent in stimulating cAMP signaling in the mouse hippocampal cell line HT-22 leading to an increase in CREB phosphorylation. In contrast, A-33 and D159687 displayed distinct neuropharmacological effects in mouse behavioral tests. A-33 has an antidepressant-like profile as indicated by reduced immobility time in the forced swim and tail suspension tasks, as well as reduced latency to feed in the novelty suppressed feeding test. D159687, on the other hand, had a procognitive profile as it improved memory in the novel object recognition test but had no antidepressant or anxiolytic benefit. The present data suggests that inhibitors targeting specific subtypes of PDE4 may exhibit differential pharmacological effects and aid a more efficient pharmacotherapy towards neuropsychological conditions.
