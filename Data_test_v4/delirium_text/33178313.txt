33178313|t|Revealing the Pharmacological Mechanism of Acorus tatarinowii in the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke Based on Network Pharmacology.
33178313|a|AIM: Stroke is the second significant cause for death, with ischemic stroke (IS) being the main type threatening human being's health. Acorus tatarinowii (AT) is widely used in the treatment of Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, depression, and stroke, which leads to disorders of consciousness disease. However, the systemic mechanism of AT treating IS is unexplicit. This article is supposed to explain why AT has an effect on the treatment of IS in a comprehensive and systematic way by network pharmacology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ADME (absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) is an important property for screening-related compounds in AT, which were screening out of TCMSP, TCMID, Chemistry Database, and literature from CNKI. Then, these targets related to screened compounds were predicted via Swiss Targets, when AT-related targets database was established. The gene targets related to IS were collected from DisGeNET and GeneCards. IS-AT is a common protein interactive network established by STRING Database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were analysed by IS-AT common target genes. Cytoscape software was used to establish a visualized network for active compounds-core targets and core target proteins-proteins interactive network. Furthermore, we drew a signal pathway picture about its effect to reveal the basic mechanism of AT against IS systematically. RESULTS: There were 53 active compounds screened from AT, inferring the main therapeutic substances as follows: bisasaricin, 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol-alpha,alpha,4-trimethyl,acetate, cis,cis,cis-7,10,13-hexadecatrienal, hydroxyacoronene, nerolidol, galgravin, veraguensin, 2'-o-methyl isoliquiritigenin, gamma-asarone, and alpha-asarone. We obtained 398 related targets, 63 of which were the same as the IS-related genes from targets prediction. Except for GRM2, remaining 62 target genes have an interactive relation, respectively. The top 10 degree core target genes were IL6, TNF, IL1B, TLR4, NOS3, MAPK1, PTGS2, VEGFA, JUN, and MMP9. There were more than 20 terms of biological process, 7 terms of cellular components, and 14 terms of molecular function through GO enrichment analysis and 13 terms of signal pathway from KEGG enrichment analysis based on P < 0.05. CONCLUSION: AT had a therapeutic effect for ischemic via multicomponent, multitarget, and multisignal pathway, which provided a novel research aspect for AT against IS.
