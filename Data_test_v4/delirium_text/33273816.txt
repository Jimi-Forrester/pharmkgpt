33273816|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences in neuropsychological and personality characteristics between male patients with lacunar infarction with hazardous drinking and non-hazardous drinking. METHODS: From May to October 2016, a total of 124 male outpatients and inpatients with lacunar infarction were selected in the Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, and they were divided into a hazardous drinking group (HD group, n=52) and a non-hazardous drinking group (NHD group, n=72) according to alcohol consumption habits. General information, MoCA score, EPQ score and SCL-90 score were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Incidence of cognitive disorder in the HD group and NHD group was 59.6% and 56.9% respectively, showing no significant difference (P>0.05). Scores of visuospatial and executive function, memory, attention and total MoCA score in the HD group were significantly lower than those in the NHD group (P<0.05), while no significant difference in naming, language, abstract thinking or orientation was found between the two groups (P>0.05). Scores of extroversion and introversion, neuroticism and psychoticism in the HD group were significantly higher than those in the NHD group (P<0.05), while no significant difference in lie or feint score was found between the two groups (P>0.05). Scores of somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, bigotry and psychoticism factors, and total SCL-90 score in the HD group were significantly higher than those in the NHD group (P<0.05), while no significant difference in scores of obsessive-compulsive, depression and terror factors were found between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with male patients with lacunar infarction with non-hazardous drinking, male lacunar infarction patients with hazardous drinking showed worse visuospatial and executive function, memory, attentiveness, cognitive function and mental health status, with more obvious change of personality, thus extra attention is needed for male lacunar infarction patients with hazardous drinking.
