39643767|t|Neurodegeneration in the cortical sulcus is a feature of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and associated with repetitive head impacts.
39643767|a|Neurodegeneration is a seminal feature of many neurological disorders. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive head impacts (RHI) and is characterized by sulcal tau pathology. However, quantitative assessments of regional neurodegeneration in CTE have not been described. In this study, we quantified three key neurodegenerative measures, including cortical thickness, neuronal density, and synaptic proteins, in contact sport athletes (n = 185) and non-athlete controls (n = 52) within the sulcal depth, middle, and gyral crest of the dorsolateral frontal cortex. Cortical thickness and neuronal density were decreased within the sulcus in CTE compared to controls (p's < 0.05). Measurements of synaptic proteins within the gyral crest showed a reduction of alpha-synuclein with CTE stage (p = 0.002) and variable changes in PSD-95 density. After adjusting for age, multiple linear regression models demonstrated a strong association between the duration of contact sports play and cortical thinning (p = 0.001) and neuronal loss (p = 0.032) within the sulcus. Additional regression models, adjusted for tau pathology, suggest that within the sulcus, the duration of play was associated with neuronal loss predominantly through tau pathology. In contrast, the association of duration of play with cortical thinning was minimally impacted by tau pathology. Overall, CTE is associated with cortical atrophy and a predominant sulcal neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the duration of contact sports play is associated with measures of neurodegeneration that are more severe in the cortical sulcus and may occur through tau-dependent and independent mechanisms.
