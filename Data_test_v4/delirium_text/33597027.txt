33597027|t|Cerebral fat embolization with paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity syndrome and septic shock at high altitude: a case report and literature review.
33597027|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral fat embolism (CFE) syndrome at high altitude was rare complicated with paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) syndrome and septic shock. It is a challenge to differential diagnosis and treatment at high altitude. CASE PRESENTATION: This case presents a CFE with PSH and septic shock of a 23-year-old man occurred at high altitude of 3800 m above sea level, transferred by airplane successfully and cured in the department of neurosurgery, Xi'an Tangdu Hospital. CONCLUSIONS: It is key that CFE with PSH can be rapid diagnosed and treatment bundles of septic shock should be initiated as soon as possible. Early neurological rehabilitation played an important role for good outcome.
