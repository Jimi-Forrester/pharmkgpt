37828603|t|Surviving the nonsurvivable combination of a mycotic aneurysm progressing into a concomitant aorto-bronchial- and aorto-esophageal fistula, a case report.
37828603|a|BACKGROUND: Aortic mycotic aneurysms are a rare but life-threatening condition and may be associated with aorto-bronchial- and aorto-esophageal fistulas. Although both very rare, they carry a high mortality and require (urgent) surgical intervention. Surviving all three conditions concomitantly is extraordinary. We describe a patient who underwent staged repair of such combined defects.
