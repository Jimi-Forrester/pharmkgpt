35883272|t|The potential therapeutic benefits of low frequency haemodynamic oscillations.
35883272|a|Haemodynamic oscillations occurring at frequencies below the rate of respiration have been observed experimentally for more than a century. Much of the research regarding these oscillations, observed in arterial pressure and blood flow, has focused on mechanisms of generation and methods of quantification. However, examination of the physiological role of these oscillations has been limited. Multiple studies have demonstrated that oscillations in arterial pressure and blood flow are associated with the protection in tissue oxygenation or functional capillary density during conditions of reduced tissue perfusion. There is also evidence that oscillatory blood flow can improve clearance of interstitial fluid, with a growing number of studies demonstrating a role for oscillatory blood flow to aid in clearance of debris from the brain. The therapeutic potential of these haemodynamic oscillations is an important new area of research which may have beneficial impact in treating conditions such as stroke, cardiac arrest, blood loss injuries, sepsis, or even Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
