36164450|t|Postoperative Cognitive Behavioral Intervention in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease Based on the Effect of Nursing Process Reengineering.
36164450|a|With the development of society and economy, patients with coronary heart disease increasingly hope to receive more humanized services after surgery, and the reengineering of the nursing process is precisely based on humanized management. In order to create a nursing intervention that helps in boosting total nursing gains and lowering disasters, the primary element of the nursing business process reengineering is to reintegrate or condense the creative work flow that was fragmented by specialization into a whole job. The "patient" is positioned in the center of nursing process reengineering, with service quality as the main guiding principle. It follows the management principles of continuous regulation and innovation, and cultivates and promotes the development of the nursing field from the perspective of "sublation." In the method part, this article introduces and supplements related information on nursing process reengineering, coronary heart disease, and postoperative cognitive behavioral intervention. Algorithmically, this paper proposes 3D RPN structure, loss function, capsule network, and improved activation function algorithm for coronary heart disease region extraction. In the part of experiment and results, this article collects general data of patients and compares memory ability, grades of self-management behaviors of patients treated with coronary heart disease, scores of quality control standards before and after nursing process reengineering, scores of patients' mental state, and comparison of postoperative physical indicators. According to the test results, the test group's diastolic and systolic blood pressure declined by more than 20, their total cholesterol dropped from 6.23 to 5.28, and their triglyceride levels dropped from 1.82 to 1.39 after the stent was implanted. Triglycerides reduced from 1.82 to 1.39, and total cholesterol dropped from 6.15 to 5.98. It indicates postoperative memory in patients with coronary heart disease. Abilities, including recognition, number, touch memory, and associative memory, decline significantly, but it can be improved after receiving the nursing process reengineering. It can be seen that nursing process reengineering can play a positive role in the postoperative cognitive behavior of patients with coronary heart disease.
