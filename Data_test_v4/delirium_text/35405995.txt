35405995|t|Dysmetabolism and Sleep Fragmentation in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients Run Independently of High Caffeine Consumption.
35405995|a|Daytime hypersomnolence, the prime feature of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), frequently leads to high coffee consumption. Nevertheless, some clinicians ask for patients' caffeine avoidance. Caffeinated drinks are sometimes associated with more severe OSA. However, these effects are not consensual. Here we investigated the effect of caffeine consumption on sleep architecture and apnea/hypopnea index in OSA. Also, the impact of caffeine on variables related with dysmetabolism, dyslipidemia, and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) dysfunction were investigated. A total of 65 patients diagnosed with OSA and 32 without OSA were included after given written informed consent. Polysomnographic studies were performed. Blood was collected to quantify caffeine and its metabolites in plasma and biochemical parameters. 24 h urine samples were collected for catecholamines measurement. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS: (1) non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to compare variables between controls and OSA; (2) multivariate logistic regression testing the effect of caffeine on sets of variables in the 2 groups; and (3) Spearmans' correlation between caffeine levels and comorbidities in patients with OSA. As expected OSA development is associated with dyslipidemia, dysmetabolism, SNS dysfunction, and sleep fragmentation. There was also a significant increase in plasma caffeine levels in the OSA group. However, the higher consumption of caffeine by OSA patients do not alter any of these associations. These results showed that there is no apparent rationale for caffeine avoidance in chronic consumers with OSA.
