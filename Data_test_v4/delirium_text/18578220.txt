18578220|t|Delirium prevention for cognitive, sensory, and mobility impairments.
18578220|a|The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a protocol designed to prevent delirium in hospitalized elders with the risk factors of dementia and/or vision, hearing, and/or mobility impairments. A group of 80 patients with risk factors hospitalized before the protocol was implemented was matched with a group of 80 patients admitted after the implementation of the protocol. Records of patients in both groups were reviewed to identify patients with delirium. A significant reduction in delirium, from 37.5% to 13.8%, occurred in the elders receiving the protocol.
