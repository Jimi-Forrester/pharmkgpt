39463965|a|The protein glycome of individual cell types in the brain is unexplored, despite the critical function of these modifications in development and disease. In aggregate, the most abundant asparagine (N-) linked glycans in the adult brain are high mannose structures, and specifically Man5GlcNAc2 (Man-5), which normally exits the ER for further processing in the Golgi. Mannose structures are uncommon in other organs and often overlooked or excluded in most studies. To understand cell-specific contributions to the unique brain N-glycome and its abundance of Man-5, we performed RNAseq and MALDI-MS TOF protein N-glycomics at several timepoints during differentiation of multiple cell types. To this end, homogeneous cultures of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and brain-specific endothelial cells were generated from monoclonal human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) through cellular reprogramming. Small molecule induction of stably integrated synthetic transcription units driving morphogen expression generated differentiated cells with distinct patterns mirroring intact tissue. Comparing uninduced hiPSCs for each cell type revealed identical transcriptomic and glycomic profiles before differentiation, with low quantities of Man-5. In differentiated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the most abundant N-glycans became Man-5 and its immediate precursor Man-6, despite the presence of transcripts encoding enzymes for their subsequent modification. Differentiation to brain-specific endothelial cells showed an opposite effect, with the N-glycome displaying an abundance of complex N-glycans and terminal modifications of the late secretory pathway. These results confirm that the restricted N-glycome profile of brain is programmed into neuronal differentiation, with regulation independent of the transcriptome and under tight evolutionary constraint.
