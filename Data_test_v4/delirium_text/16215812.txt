16215812|t|Symptomatic management and imaging of brain metastases.
16215812|a|Brain metastasis is the most common malignancy of the nervous system. Survival is short and the majority of patients die within 5 months after diagnosis. In this review, clinical and pathophysiological aspects of brain metastases are described, including novel radiological methods as triple-dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Recursive partitioning analysis is a powerful tool to analyse prognosis, and recent studies contribute to subgroup division. Subsequently, treatment choices can be made, based on prognostic characteristics of the individual patient. Commonly, symptomatic therapy starts with the administration of corticosteroids, often resulting in improvement of neurological deficit. Anticonvulsants are administered in patients with symptomatic epilepsy. The risk on vascular complications in patients with brain metastases is increased and needs special attention. Treatment of psychiatric complications e.g. delirium or depression may also improve quality of life.
