36432514|t|Association of 100% Fruit Juice Consumption with Cognitive Measures, Anxiety, and Depression in US Adults.
36432514|a|Cognitive decline, anxiety, and depression are significant contributors to human ill health and decreased quality of life. Intake of fruits including 100% juice is associated with beneficial effects on several health outcomes. The current study explored the potential associations between consumption of 100% fruit juice and neurocognitive markers in adults. Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994, 1999-2018 for adults 20+ years (N = 62,606) were used to assess 100% fruit juice intake, and NHANES questionnaire data were used for the assessment of neurocognition. Association of usual intake of 100% fruit juice with neurocognitive outcomes were assessed by regression analysis after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, dietary, and health-related covariates. About 21% of adults were fruit juice consumers and the intake was a little over 2 oz per day. Consumers of 100% fruit juice had 16.3% fewer days per month of feeling anxious compared to non-consumers. There were no significant associations of 100% fruit juice usual intake with other neurocognitive measures. A large number of potential confounding variables have been identified to be associated with one or more neurocognitive measures suggesting that these may be important parameters to include in future studies.
