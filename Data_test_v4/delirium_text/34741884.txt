34741884|t|Plasma neurofilament L to amyloid beta42 ratio in differentiating Alzheimer's type from non-Alzheimer's dementia: A cross-sectional pilot study from India.
34741884|a|Based on the reduction of amyloid beta plaques, US FDA has recently approved Aducanumab as a disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With high pricing and the potential risks likely with this treatment, certainty of AD diagnosis becomes crucial. The current pilot study evaluated plasma levels of neurofilament L, an axonal injury marker and amyloid beta42, a major component of amyloid plaques for discriminating AD from non-AD dementia (NAD). Results with Simoa assays indicate that a combination of neurofilament L and amyloid beta42 can be considered as a screening tool in identifying eligible subjects for AD treatment/ clinical trials.
