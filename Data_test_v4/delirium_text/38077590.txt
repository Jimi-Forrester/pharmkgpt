38077590|t|AMSF: attention-based multi-view slice fusion for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
38077590|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease with a high prevalence in the elderly population over 65 years of age. Intervention in the early stages of AD is of great significance to alleviate the symptoms. Recent advances in deep learning have shown extreme advantages in computer-aided diagnosis of AD. However, most studies only focus on extracting features from slices in specific directions or whole brain images, ignoring the complementarity between features from different angles. To overcome the above problem, attention-based multi-view slice fusion (AMSF) is proposed for accurate early diagnosis of AD. It adopts the fusion of three-dimensional (3D) global features with multi-view 2D slice features by using an attention mechanism to guide the fusion of slice features for each view, to generate a comprehensive representation of the MRI images for classification. The experiments on the public dataset demonstrate that AMSF achieves 94.3% accuracy with 1.6-7.1% higher than other previous promising methods. It indicates that the better solution for AD early diagnosis depends not only on the large scale of the dataset but also on the organic combination of feature construction strategy and deep neural networks.
