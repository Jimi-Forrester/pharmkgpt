32443889|t|Lipids and Lipid Mediators Associated with the Risk and Pathology of Ischemic Stroke.
32443889|a|Stroke is a severe neurological disorder in humans that results from an interruption of the blood supply to the brain. Worldwide, stoke affects over 100 million people each year and is the second largest contributor to disability. Dyslipidemia is a modifiable risk factor for stroke that is associated with an increased risk of the disease. Traditional and non-traditional lipid measures are proposed as biomarkers for the better detection of subclinical disease. In the central nervous system, lipids and lipid mediators are essential to sustain the normal brain tissue structure and function. Pathways leading to post-stroke brain deterioration include the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. A variety of lipid mediators are generated from fatty acids and these molecules may have either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects on the post-stroke brain tissue; therefore, they largely contribute to the outcome and recovery from stroke. In this review, we provide an overview of serum lipids associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. We also discuss the role of lipid mediators, with particular emphasis on eicosanoids, in the pathology of ischemic stroke. Finally, we summarize the latest research on potential targets in lipid metabolic pathways for ischemic stroke treatment and on the development of new stroke risk biomarkers for use in clinical practice.
