39125419|t|The Risk of Malnutrition and Sarcopenia in Elderly People Living with HIV during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
39125419|a|Malnutrition is a risk factor of sarcopenia in the elderly. During the COVID-19 pandemic, limited transportation and supply chain disruptions restricted access to nutritious foods. We assessed the nutritional status and sarcopenia risk in older people living with HIV (PLWH) on combination antiretroviral therapy in Thailand. This study was a hospital-based cohort among virally suppressed older PLWH who came for routine HIV clinic visits. The mini nutritional assessment (MNA), body composition analysis and 5-time chair stand test (CST) were performed to assess the nutritional status, muscle mass and physical performance, respectively. A total of 177 PLWH were enrolled (57.60% male). The median age was 58 years (IQR 55-62 years). Thirty-five participants (19.8%) were at risk of developing sarcopenia, and 28.2% had abnormal nutritional status. Muscle mass correlated positively with nutritional scores (r = 0.355, p < 0.001) but negatively with 5-time CST duration (r = -0.173, p = 0.021). In the multivariate model, muscle mass was associated with age, sex, mid-arm circumference, calf circumference and 5-time CST duration. In a well-viral-suppressed older Asian PLWH cohort, given the positive correlation between nutritional status and muscle mass, the nutritional status of older PLWH should be routinely evaluated and monitored.
