36120016|t|High-Glucose Diet Attenuates the Dopaminergic Neuronal Function in C. elegans, Leading to the Acceleration of the Aging Process.
36120016|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective degeneration of neurons, primarily in the substantia nigra. Environmental or exogenous factors that cause Parkinson's disease have not been sufficiently elucidated. Our study aims to investigate the causative effect of a high-glucose diet on Parkinson's disease-relevant dopaminergic neuronal system in Caenorhabditis elegans. Aging parameters were first observed by measuring the lifespan, body movement, and body sizes with and without the background of high glucose. The toxic effect of a high-glucose diet was further explored by observing the dopaminergic neurons using transgenic Pdat-1::gfp strains, BZ555, under a Zeiss microscope, and the experiments were extended by assessing dopamine-related behavioral analysis including basal slowing response and alcohol avoidance. The aggregation of the alpha-synucleins was also assessed by observing the NL5901 mutants. Worms fed with 250 mM glucose showed daf-2-independent regulation of aging, displaying a short lifespan (<=15 days), long body size (max. 140%), and slow movement (min. 30%, 10 bends/min). Anterior dopaminergic neurons were rapidly inactivated (70%) by a glucose-rich diet from 12 h of exposure, suggesting specific degeneration in ADE neurons. The dysregulation of neurons led to deteriorations in dopaminergic behaviors including basal slowing response (BSR). A high-glucose diet decreased dopamine synthesis (40 pg/mg vs 15 pg/mg protein) and induced alpha-synuclein aggregation in the muscles. Results demonstrate the potential of a high-glucose diet as a trigger of dopaminergic neuronal dysregulation conjugating aging acceleration.
