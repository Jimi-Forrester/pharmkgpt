24806347|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of Muslim parents from Saudi Arabia with a deaf child towards prenatal diagnosis (PND) and termination of pregnancy (TOP) for deafness and 29 other genetic and medical conditions. METHODS: A questionnaire mainly focused on parent's attitude toward PND and TOP for 30 different hypothetical scenarios for a series of genetic, non-genetic and non-medical conditions was completed by 70 Saudi parents with a deaf child. The results were compared and scored, and parents' comments were noted. RESULTS: The attitude for PND was favorable (81.4%) and was influenced by the severity of the condition among men. Among women, it was influenced by cultural considerations. For TOP, average acceptance rate (25.2%) was lower than for PND. Attitudes toward TOP were fairly similar for men and women, as both groups would consider TOP for Alzheimer disease, cleft lip and palate, and cystic fibrosis. In addition, women also ranked high deafness and thalassemia for consideration of TOP. Acceptance for TOP was not influenced by gender, income, education level, number of children, or partner attending clinic. CONCLUSION: In the Saudi society, cultural consideration influences attitudes towards PND and TOP rather than the severity of the condition.
