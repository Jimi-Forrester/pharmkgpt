39311588|a|Circadian rhythm disruptions have been implicated in numerous health issues, including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer disease (AD). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vital for neuronal plasticity and cognitive function, is regulated by the circadian clock and exerts protective effects against AD. Thus, we investigated the impact of circadian rhythm disorders (CRDs) on cognitive impairment and explored the underlying neurobiological mechanisms by assessing BDNF and amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels. We divided male C57BL/6 mice into three groups (n = 30): a control group (normal 12/12 hour light-dark cycle) and two CRD model groups (3/3 and 22/22 hour cycles, respectively). After 12 weeks, we assessed cognitive functions using the Morris water maze. Following behavioral tests, hippocampal levels of BDNF and Abeta were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. CRDs significantly impaired learning and memory, as evidenced by longer times to reach and find the platform in the CRD groups (p < 0.01). Furthermore, BDNF levels were notably decreased and Abeta levels increased in the CRD groups compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Thus, CRDs elicit cognitive impairment by reducing BDNF levels and increasing Abeta deposition in the hippocampus.
