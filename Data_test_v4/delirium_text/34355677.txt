34355677|a|OBJECTIVE: To measure the effects of a quality improvement intervention on length of stay and benzodiazepine use among patients admitted for alcohol use disorder. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at the Salt Lake City Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Patients 18 years and older admitted to a general medical ward with a diagnosis of alcohol related disorders who were treated for alcohol withdrawal were included. The baseline cohort included patients admitted over 12 months. The post-intervention cohort included patients admitted over 12 months. Primary outcomes were total benzodiazepine dose and length of stay. Secondary outcomes included episodes of delirium tremens and seizures. RESULTS: Total benzodiazepine dose decreased significantly over the intervention period. Length of stay also decreased. No episodes of delirium tremens or seizures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A quality improvement intervention directed at general medicine inpatients admitted for alcohol withdrawal was associated with reductions in total benzodiazepine administration and length of stay.
