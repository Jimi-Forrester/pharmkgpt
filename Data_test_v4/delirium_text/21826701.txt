21826701|a|Alterations in glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) have been proposed to be involved in the abnormal tau phosphorylation and aggregation linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interconnections between GSK3beta and PP2A signaling pathways are well established. Targeting tau kinases was proposed to represent a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, which tau kinases should be blocked and to what extent, keeping in mind that kinases have physiological roles? Because most kinase inhibitors are relatively specific and many of them interfere with the cell cycle, it is necessary to develop more specific tau kinase inhibitors devoid of cell toxicity. Here, we used the PP2A inhibition by okadaic acid (OKA) in primary cultured cortical neurons as an in vitro model of increased tau phosphorylation and apoptosis. We tested the effects of two newly characterized indirubin derivative inhibitors of GSK3, 6-BIDECO (6-bromoindirubin-3'-[O-(N,N-diethylcarbamyl)-oxime] and 6-BIMYEO (6-bromoindirubin-3'-[O-(2-morpholin-1-ylethyl)-oxime] hydrochloride) on OKA-induced tau phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis. Both compounds exhibit higher selectivity toward GSK3 compared with other tau kinases (for 6-BIDECO, IC50 is 0.03 muM for GSK3, >10 muM for CDK1, and 10 muM for CDK5; for 6-BIMYEO, IC50 is 0.11 muM for GSK3, 1.8 muM for CDK1, and 0.9 muM for CDK5). We show that 6-BIDECO and 6-BIMYEO used at micromolar concentrations are not neurotoxic and potently reversed tau phosphorylation and apoptosis induced by OKA. The neuroprotection by these compounds should be further validated in animal models of AD.
