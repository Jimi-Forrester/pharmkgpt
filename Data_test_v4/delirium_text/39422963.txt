39422963|t|The Therapeutic Potential of Yoga for Alzheimer's Disease: A Critical Review.
39422963|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioral changes, significantly impacting the quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers. While pharmacological treatments offer limited relief, nonpharmacological interventions, like yoga, have gained attention for their potential therapeutic benefits. This critical review synthesizes findings from various studies on the feasibility, adherence, physical function, cognitive improvements, inflammatory markers, neuroprotection, and mood and behavioral changes associated with yoga interventions for older adults with AD. Despite these promising results, further research with randomized controlled trials, larger sample sizes, control groups, longitudinal follow-ups, standardized protocols, and diverse populations is necessary to confirm these benefits and understand the long-term effects of yoga on AD progression. This critical review highlights yoga's potential as a valuable nonpharmacological intervention in the holistic management of AD.
