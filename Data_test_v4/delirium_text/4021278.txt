4021278|t|[Central hemodynamics in chronic alcoholics].
4021278|a|Central hemodynamics were assessed in 86 chronic alcoholic patients in relation to the stage of the disease and the kind of alcoholic dependence. The values of major hemodynamic parameters were shown to depend on both the stage of the disease, and clinical manifestations of abstinence. The abstinence syndrome developing after a 3-5-day abstinence is associated with a gradual transition from eukinetic- to hypokinetic-type circulation, as the disease progresses. Hemodynamic shifts following recovery from acute delirium tremens are not related to the stage of the disease, and tend to hypokinetic-type circulation. During remission, hemodynamic parameters approach those of normal subjects.
