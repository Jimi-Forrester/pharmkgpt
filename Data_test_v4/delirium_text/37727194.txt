37727194|t|Extremely Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen in Acute Prostatitis: A Case Report.
37727194|a|Elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are mostly suggestive of prostate cancer, but they are elevated in non-cancerous prostatic conditions as well. However, extreme levels of PSA as reported here have not been observed in cases other than prostatic cancer so far. Our patient had a significantly elevated PSA of 1,398 ng/mL in acute prostatitis. The purpose of this case report is to review the patient's atypical and rare presentation of extremely high PSA in acute prostatitis in the background of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and chronic prostatitis.
