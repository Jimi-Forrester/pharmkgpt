This study investigated how age and gender influence the brain network roles and topological properties underlying the ageing process. Ten RSNs were constructed based on 998 participants from the REST-meta-MDD cohort. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine the independent and interactive influences of age and gender on large-scale RSNs and their topological properties. A support vector regression model integrating whole-brain network features was used to predict brain age across the lifespan and cognitive decline in an Alzheimer's disease spectrum (ADS) sample. Differential effects of age and gender on brain network roles were demonstrated across the lifespan. Specifically, cingulo-opercular, auditory, and visual (VIS) networks showed more incohesive features reflected by decreased intra-network connectivity with ageing. Further, females displayed distinctive brain network trajectory patterns in middle-early age, showing enhanced network connectivity within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and salience network (SAN) and weakened network connectivity between the FPN-somatomotor, FPN-VIS, and SAN-VIS networks. Age - but not gender - induced widespread decrease in topological properties of brain networks. Importantly, these differential network features predicted brain age and cognitive impairment in the ADS sample. By showing that age and gender exert specific dispersion of dynamic network roles and trajectories across the lifespan, this study has expanded our understanding of age- and gender-related brain changes with ageing. Moreover, the findings may be useful for detecting early-stage dementia.
