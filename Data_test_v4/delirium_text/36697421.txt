36697421|a|Patients with Parkinson's disease often complain of excessive daytime sleepiness which negatively impacts their quality of life. The pedunculopontine nucleus, proposed as a target for deep brain stimulation to improve freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease, is also known to play a key role in the arousal system. Thus, the putative control of excessive daytime sleepiness by pedunculopontine nucleus area stimulation merits exploration for treating Parkinson's disease patients. To this end, two adult nonhuman primates (macaca fascicularis) received a deep brain stimulation electrode implanted into the pedunculopontine nucleus area along with a polysomnographic equipment. Stimulation at low frequencies and high frequencies was studied, in healthy and then MPTP-treated nonhuman primates. Here, we observed that MPTP-treated nonhuman primates suffered from excessive daytime sleepiness and that low-frequency stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus area was effective in reducing daytime sleepiness. Indeed, low-frequency stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus area induced a significant increase in sleep onset latency, longer continuous periods of wakefulness and thus, a partially restored daytime wake architecture. These findings may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies in patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness.
