9458995|a|The purpose of this 3-year study was to test the efficacy of using a theoretical model based on Piaget's cognitive developmental stages for consistent behavioral and environmental interventions for persons at all stages of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) in nursing home and special care units. The specific aims were to reduce problematic behavioral symptoms and the number, amount and frequency of use of psychotropic medications. After 18 months, problem behaviors and some types of psychotropic medications significantly decreased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Results of the study indicate that using behavioral and environmental interventions based on Piaget levels of cognitive development may be an effective method of managing problematic behavioral symptoms and decreasing the use of psychotropic medications in institutionalized ADRD patients.
