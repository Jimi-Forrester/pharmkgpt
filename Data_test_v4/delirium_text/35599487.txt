35599487|t|COVID-19 and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Prion-Like Spread and Long-Term Consequences.
35599487|a|COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic starting from Wuhan in China and spread at a lightning speed to the rest of the world. One of the potential long-term outcomes that we speculate is the development of neurodegenerative diseases as a long-term consequence of SARS-CoV-2 especially in people that have developed severe neurological symptoms. Severe inflammatory reactions and aging are two very strong common links between neurodegenerative diseases and COVID-19. Thus, patients that have very high viral load may be at high risk of developing long-term adverse neurological consequences such as dementia. We hypothesize that people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and aged people are at higher risk of getting the COVID-19 than normal adults. The basis of this hypothesis is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses as a receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to enter the host cell and that this interaction is calcium-dependent. This could then suggest a direct relationship between neurodegenerative diseases, ACE-2 expression, and the susceptibility to COVID-19. The analysis of the available literature showed that COVID-19 virus is neurotropic and was found in the brains of patients infected with this virus. Furthermore, that the risk of having the infection increases with dementia and that infected people with severe symptoms could develop dementia as a long-term consequence. Dementia could be developed following the acceleration of the spread of prion-like proteins. In the present review we discuss current reports concerning the prevalence of COVID-19 in dementia patients, the individuals that are at high risk of suffering from dementia and the potential acceleration of prion-like proteins spread following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
