38357988|a|The intensive study and investigation of neuroprotective therapy for central nervous system (CNS) diseases is ongoing. Due to shared mechanisms of neurodegeneration, a neuroprotective approach might offer benefits across multiple neurological disorders, despite variations in symptoms or injuries. C-Jun N-terminal Kinase 3 (JNK3) is found primarily in the CNS and is involved in physiological processes such as brain development, synapse formation, and memory formation. The potential of JNK3 as a target for pharmacological development holds promise for advancing neuroprotective therapies. Developing small molecule JNK3 inhibitors into drugs with neuroprotective qualities could facilitate neuronal restoration and self-repair. This review focuses on elucidating key neuroprotective mechanisms, exploring the interplay between neurodegenerative diseases and neuroprotection, and discussing advancements in JNK3 inhibitor drug development.
