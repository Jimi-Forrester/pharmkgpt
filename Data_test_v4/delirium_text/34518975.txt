34518975|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Currently, more than 50 million people live with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to increase. Some of the typical pathological changes of AD include amyloid plaque, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, secretion of inflammatory mediators, and neuronal apoptosis. Apelin is a neuroprotective peptide that is widely expressed in the body. Among members of apelin family, apelin-13 is the most abundant with a high neuroprotective function. Apelin-13/angiotensin domain type 1 receptor-associated proteins (APJ) system regulates several physiological and pathophysiological cell activities, such as apoptosis, autophagy, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation. It has also been shown to prevent AD development. This article reviews the research progress on the relationship between apelin-13 and AD to provide new ideas for prevention and treatment of AD.
