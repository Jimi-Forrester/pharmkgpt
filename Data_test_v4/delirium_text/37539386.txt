37539386|t|Brain but not serum BDNF levels are associated with structural alterations in the hippocampal regions in patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.
37539386|a|Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of focal epilepsy, imposing a significant burden on the health care system worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients with this disease who do not adequately respond to pharmacotherapy are considered drug-resistant subjects. Despite having some clues of how such epileptic activity and resistance to therapy emerge, coming mainly from preclinical models, we still witness a scarcity of human data. To narrow this gap, in this study, we aimed to estimate the relationship between hippocampal and serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the main and most widely studied neurotrophins, and hippocampal subfield volumes in patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal epilepsy undergoing neurosurgical treatment. We found that hippocampal (but not serum) BDNF levels were negatively correlated with the contralateral volumes of the CA1 and CA4 subfields, presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, and molecular layer of the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings are generally in accordance with existing data, arguing for a proepileptic nature of BDNF effects in the hippocampus and related brain structures.
