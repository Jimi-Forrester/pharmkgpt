29530454|a|BACKGROUND: Shankhpushpi is an Ayurvedic drug, widely used for its actions on the central nervous system, especially to improve intellect and boost memory. Four botanicals viz. Canscora decussata Schult. (CD), Clitorea ternatea Linn. (CT), Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy. (CP) and Evolvulus alsinoides Linn. (EA) are considered as sources of Shankhpushpi by Indian practitioners on the basis of their morphological descriptions given in ancient texts. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the neuropharmacological effect of four herbs commonly identified as source of Shankhpushpi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extracts of all four varieties were tested and evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their neuropharmacological effects. Experiments such as protection against beta-amyloid induced neurotoxicity on brain cell line (Neuro 2A), antioxidant potential, AchE (acetylcholinesterase enzyme) inhibition, and 5-LOX (lipoxygenase) enzyme inhibition were conducted for in vitro evaluation. For in vivo evaluation, scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.) induced memory retrieval using pole climbing apparatus and Morris water maze were performed in rat models. RESULTS: It was found that protective effects of EA and CD against beta-amyloid induced neurotoxicity in Neuro 2A cells were significantly higher than CT and CP. EA proved to be superior than other varieties on the basis of antioxidant activity, AchE inhibitory and LOX inhibitory activities. The preventive activity of EA on scopolamine induced memory retrieval in pole climbing and Morris water maze task in rats was found to be higher than that of CD, CT and CP. CONCLUSION: EA has remarkable neuropharmacological effect as compared to other three varieties of Shankhpushpi. This effect may be attributed due to the presence of steroids (stigmasterol and betulinic acid), coumarins (scopoletin) and flavonoids (beta-carotene and chlorogenic acid). Hence it can be used as a promising lead in development and management of neuronal disorders including Alzheimer's disease.
