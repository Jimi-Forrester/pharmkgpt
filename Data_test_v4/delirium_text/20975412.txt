20975412|t|A complex elder care simulation using improvisational actors.
20975412|a|Complex simulations can facilitate students' synthesis of knowledge. Simulations of cognitively impaired elders provide nursing students the opportunity to use critical thinking and clinical decision-making skills in complex patient care situations. The authors report their experiences in designing, implementing, and evaluating a simulation on cognitive problems in elders using actors. This simulation required third-year baccalaureate nursing students to differentiate delirium from dementia, identify symptoms of heart failure, and address a family member's concerns.
