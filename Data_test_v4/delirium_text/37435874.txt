37435874|t|An Exciting Performance of Established and Novel Biomarkers in Diagnosing Periprosthetic Joint Infections: A Single-center Retrospective Cohort Study.
37435874|a|OBJECTIVE: Significant progress has been made in recent years in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI). However, the lack of a gold standard test for the diagnosis of PJI remains a challenge.The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic values of the albumin/fibrinogen ratio (AFR), the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), and the levels of fibrinogen (FIB) and albumin (ALB) in the diagnosis of PJI. METHODS: The medical records of 158 patients who had undergone hip or knee revisions from January 2018 to May 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Of these patients, 79 were diagnosed with PJI, while 79 were diagnosed with aseptic loosening (AL). PJI was defined using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. The plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ALB, and FIB; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); and the AFR and CAR in the two groups were recorded and analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each indicator; the diagnostic value for each indicator was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: The ESR, CRP, FIB, and CAR values in the PJI group were significantly higher than those in the AL group, and the ALB and AFR values were significantly lower than those in the AL group (p < 0.001). The AUC values of AFR and fibrinogen were 0.851 and 0.848, respectively, which were slightly higher than those of CRP (0.826) and ESR (0.846). The AUC of CAR was 0.831 which was slightly lower than that of CRP (0.846). ALB had an AUC of 0.727. The optimal threshold, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively, were 10.05, 84.81%, and 82.28% for AFR; 4.03 mug/mL, 77.22%, and 86.08% for FIB; 0.23, 72.15%, and 82.28% for CAR; and 37.30 g/L, 65.82%, and 73.42% for ALB. CONCLUSIONS: AFR, CAR, and FIB are good new auxiliary diagnostic indicators of PJI, while ALB is of fair value for the diagnosis of PJI.
