36364370|a|Vascular metabolic dysfunction presents in various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Due to the high prevalence of these diseases, it is important to explore treatment strategies to protect vascular function. Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenolic phytochemical, is regarded as an agent to regulate metabolic pathways. Many studies have proven that RSV has beneficial effects on improving metabolism in endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which provide new directions to treat vascular metabolic diseases. Herein, we overviewed that RSV could regulate cell metabolism activity by inhibiting glucose uptake, suppressing glycolysis, preventing cells from fatty acid-related damages, reducing lipogenesis, increasing fatty acid oxidation, enhancing lipolysis, elevating uptake and synthesis of glutamine, and increasing NO release. Furthermore, in clinical trials, although the results from different studies remain controversial, we proposed that RSV had better therapeutic effects at high concentrations and for patients with metabolic disorders.
