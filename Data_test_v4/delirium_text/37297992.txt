37297992|a|Acute encephalopathy is a critical medical condition that typically affects previously healthy children and young adults and often results in death or severe neurological sequelae. Inherited metabolic diseases that can cause acute encephalopathy include urea cycle disorders, amino acid metabolism disorders, organic acid metabolism disorders, fatty acid metabolism disorders, mutations in the thiamine-transporter gene, and mitochondrial diseases. Although each inherited metabolic disease is rare, its overall incidence is reported as 1 in 800-2500 patients. This narrative review presents the common inherited metabolic diseases that cause acute encephalopathy. Since diagnosing inherited metabolic diseases requires specific testing, early metabolic/metanolic screening tests are required when an inherited metabolic disease is suspected. We also describe the symptoms and history associated with suspected inherited metabolic diseases, the various tests that should be conducted in case of suspicion, and treatment according to the disease group. Recent advancements made in the understanding of some of the inherited metabolic diseases that cause acute encephalopathy are also highlighted. Acute encephalopathy due to inherited metabolic diseases can have numerous different causes, and recognition of the possibility of an inherited metabolic disease as early as possible, obtaining appropriate specimens, and proceeding with testing and treatment in parallel are crucial in the management of these diseases.
