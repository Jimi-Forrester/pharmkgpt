38584341|a|BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is composed of various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, and constitutes an important part of the human gut. Its composition is closely related to human health and disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease whose underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Recent research has shown that there are significant differences in the gut microbiota between AD patients and healthy individuals. Changes in the composition of gut microbiota may lead to the development of harmful factors associated with AD. In addition, the gut microbiota may play a role in the development and progression of AD through the gut-brain axis. However, the exact nature of this relationship has not been fully understood. AIMS: This review will elucidate the types and functions of gut microbiota and their relationship with AD and explore in depth the potential mechanisms of gut microbiota in the occurrence of AD and the prospects for treatment strategies. METHODS: Reviewed literature from PubMed and Web of Science using key terminologies related to AD and the gut microbiome. RESULTS: Research indicates that the gut microbiota can directly or indirectly influence the occurrence and progression of AD through metabolites, endotoxins, and the vagus nerve. DISCUSSION: This review discusses the future challenges and research directions regarding the gut microbiota in AD. CONCLUSION: While many unresolved issues remain regarding the gut microbiota and AD, the feasibility and immense potential of treating AD by modulating the gut microbiota are evident.
