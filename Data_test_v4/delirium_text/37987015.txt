37987015|a|Preventative treatment for Alzheimer's Disease is of dire importance, and yet, cellular mechanisms underlying early regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease remain unknown. In human patients with Alzheimer's Disease, one of the earliest observed pathophysiological correlates to cognitive decline is hyperexcitability1. In mouse models, early hyperexcitability has been shown in the entorhinal cortex, the first cortical region impacted by Alzheimer's Disease2-4. The origin of hyperexcitability in early-stage disease and why it preferentially emerges in specific regions is unclear. Using cortical-region and cell-type- specific proteomics and patch-clamp electrophysiology, we uncovered differential susceptibility to human-specific amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) in a model of sporadic Alzheimer's. Unexpectedly, our findings reveal that early entorhinal hyperexcitability may result from intrinsic vulnerability of parvalbumin interneurons, rather than the suspected layer II excitatory neurons. This vulnerability of entorhinal PV interneurons is specific to hAPP, as it could not be recapitulated with increased murine APP expression. Furthermore, the Somatosensory Cortex showed no such vulnerability to adult-onset hAPP expression, likely resulting from PV-interneuron variability between the two regions based on physiological and proteomic evaluations. Interestingly, entorhinal hAPP-induced hyperexcitability was quelled by co-expression of human Tau at the expense of increased pathological tau species. This study suggests early disease interventions targeting non-excitatory cell types may protect regions with early vulnerability to pathological symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease and downstream cognitive decline.
