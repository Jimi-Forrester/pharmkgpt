30587972|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, the most common causes of dementia is a multifactorial pathology categorized by a complex etiology. Numerous nutraceuticals have been clinically evaluated, but some of the trials failed. However, natural compounds have some limitations due to their poor bioavailability, ineffective capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, or less therapeutic effects on AD. To overcome these disadvantages, nanoparticle-conjugated natural products could promote the bioavailability and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of AD when compared with a naked drug. This application generates and implements new prospect for drug discovery in neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, we confer AD pathology, review natural products in clinical trials, and ascertain the importance of nanomedicine coupled with natural compounds for AD.
