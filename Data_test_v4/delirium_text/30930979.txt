30930979|a|Application of propofol in preventing emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children was evaluated. Clinical data of 200 children who received sevoflurane anesthesia in Children's Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 120 patients who received inhaled sevoflurane for pediatric anesthesia and intravenous infusion of propofol (2 mg/kg) were included in observation group. The remaining 80 cases who were directly anesthetized by sevoflurane alone were the control group. T PAED scores, modified Aldrete scores, extubation time, PACU time and adverse reactions (gastrointestinal tract and respiratory response) were analyzed and compared between the control and observation group. PAED scores, extubation time, PACU time and incidence of adverse reactions were significantly lower in observation than in control group, and the modified Aldrete scores were higher in observation than in control group (P<0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the PAED scores were negatively correlated with modified Aldrete scores and positively correlated with extubation time. There was positive correlation between the PACU time and incidence of adverse reactions and between the PAED scores and extubation time. There was negative correlation between PACU time and incidence of adverse reactions and between Aldrete scores and extubation time (P<0.05). Therefore, we conclude that propofol can be used to prevent agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children.
