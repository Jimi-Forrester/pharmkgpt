32330589|t|Alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia: Current review.
32330589|a|Thrombocytopenia is a decrease in the platelet count below 150,000 in a microliter of blood, i.e., below the lower limit of the reference range, which is 150,000-400,000/muL. The phenomenon of thrombocytopenia related to heavy drinking began to arouse interest in the 1960s and 1970s. It was initially described in case reports and clinical studies on small groups. In the following years, the phenomenon itself and the significance of alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia was studied. Many methodological difficulties inhibiting objective conclusions from research were encountered. Model pathological mechanisms of alcohol thrombocytopenia and the effects of alcohol on the structure and function of platelets were described. Furthermore, the phenomenon of rapid normalization of the number of platelets in people who stopped drinking was described. Relationships between alcohol use, its intensity and occurrence, and intensity of thrombocytopenia have been demonstrated. Predictive platelet counts for alcohol withdrawal syndrome complications have been proven and calculated. The risk of occurrence of withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens in alcohol withdrawal syndrome increases significantly when the platelet count is less than 119,000/muL. The knowledge of the nature of the phenomenon of alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia in a clinical environment allows decisions that are more rational. The attention of clinicians should be drawn to the importance of results of blood tests routinely collected on admission.
