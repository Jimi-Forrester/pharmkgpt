34260548|t|Cystatin C predicts the risk of incident cerebrovascular disease in the elderly: A meta-analysis on survival date studies.
34260548|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is the third leading cause of global year of life lost in all-age and second-ranked cause of disability adjusted life years in middle-aged and elder population. Therefore, it is critical to study the relationship between vascular-related risk factors and cerebrovascular diseases. Several cross-sectional studies have shown that Cystatin C (Cys C) is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases and levels of Cys C are significantly higher in stroke patients than in healthy individuals. In this meta-analysis, we introduce a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the causality between Cys C and the risk of cerebrovascular accident in the elderly. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 1985 to 2019 for studies on the relationship between serum Cys C and incidence stroke with Cox proportional hazards models. We conducted a subgroup analysis of the selected studies to determine a connection between atherosclerosis and stroke. Finally, 7 research studies, including 26,768 patients without a history of cerebrovascular, were studied. RESULTS: After comparing the maximum and minimum Cys C levels, the hazard ratio for all types of stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, was 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.31) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43.0%; P = .119) in a fixed-effect model after pooled adjustment for other potential risk factors. In the subgroup analysis, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for Cys C stratified by atherosclerosis was 1.85 (0.97-2.72). As shown in Egger linear regression test, there was no distinct publication bias (P = .153). CONCLUSION: Increased serum Cys C is significantly associated with future stroke events in the elderly, especially in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Thus, serum levels of Cys C could serve as a predicted biomarker for stroke attack.
