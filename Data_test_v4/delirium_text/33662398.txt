33662398|t|Is gamma-secretase a beneficial inactivating enzyme of the toxic APP C-terminal fragment C99?
33662398|a|Genetic, biochemical, and anatomical grounds led to the proposal of the amyloid cascade hypothesis centered on the accumulation of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) to explain Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. In this context, a bulk of efforts have aimed at developing therapeutic strategies seeking to reduce Abeta levels, either by blocking its production (gamma- and beta-secretase inhibitors) or by neutralizing it once formed (Abeta-directed immunotherapies). However, so far the vast majority of, if not all, clinical trials based on these strategies have failed, since they have not been able to restore cognitive function in AD patients, and even in many cases, they have worsened the clinical picture. We here propose that AD could be more complex than a simple Abeta-linked pathology and discuss the possibility that a way to reconcile undoubted genetic evidences linking processing of APP to AD and a consistent failure of Abeta-based clinical trials could be to envision the pathological contribution of the direct precursor of Abeta, the beta-secretase-derived C-terminal fragment of APP, betaCTF, also referred to as C99. In this review, we summarize scientific evidences pointing to C99 as an early contributor to AD and postulate that gamma-secretase should be considered as not only an Abeta-generating protease, but also a beneficial C99-inactivating enzyme. In that sense, we discuss the limitations of molecules targeting gamma-secretase and propose alternative strategies seeking to reduce C99 levels by other means and notably by enhancing its lysosomal degradation.
