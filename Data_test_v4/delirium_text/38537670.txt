38537670|t|Muscarinic Receptor Activators as Novel Treatments for Schizophrenia.
38537670|a|Achieving optimal treatment outcomes for individuals living with schizophrenia remains challenging, despite 70 years of drug development efforts. Many chemically distinct antipsychotics have been developed over the past seven decades with improved safety and tolerability but with only slight variation in efficacy. All currently prescribed antipsychotics act as antagonists or partial agonists at the dopamine D2 receptor. With only a few possible exceptions, antipsychotic drugs have similar and modest efficacy for treating positive symptoms and are relatively ineffective in addressing the negative and cognitive symptoms of the disease. The development of novel treatments focused on targeting muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) has been of interest for more than 25 years following reports that treatment with a dual M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist resulted in antipsychotic-like effects and procognitive properties in individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia; more recent clinical trials have confirmed these findings. In addition, advances in our understanding of the receptor binding and activation properties of xanomeline at specific mAChRs have the potential to inform future drug design targeting mAChRs.
