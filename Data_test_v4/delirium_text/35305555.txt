35305555|t|Prevention Admission into Nursing homes (PAN): study protocol for an explorative, prospective longitudinal pilot study.
35305555|a|BACKGROUND: In Switzerland, there is a lack of adequate rehabilitation services, and effective coordination, that take into account the multifactorial health risks of older people. The literature shows that the hospitalisation rate in rehabilitation facilities has increased in recent years and that a gender bias exists. Additionally, there is little or no evidence available on the effect that a post-acute care programme might have over an extended period on functioning, quality of life and the informal network of older people. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the sustainability of post-acute care within three nursing homes in Zurich, Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. METHODS: The Prevention Admission into Nursing homes (PAN) study is a explorative, prospective, longitudinal pilot trial based on a convenience sample of three long-term care facilities in the Swiss Canton of Zurich. The proposed pilot study will examine the effects of a post-acute care programme on people aged >=65 years with a post-acute care potential >= three admitted to any of the three post-acute care units (n = 260). Older people of all sexes admitted to one of the post-acute care units and likely to be discharged to home within 8 weeks will be eligible for participation in the study. The primary endpoint is functionality based on the Barthel Index. The secondary endpoints are independency based on delirium, cognition, mobility, falling concerns, frailty, weight/height/body mass index, post-acute care capability, quality of life, and lastly, the informal network. As part of process evaluation, a qualitative evaluation will be conducted based on constructive grounded theory to specifically analyse how the experience of informal caregivers (n = 30) can contribute to a successful daily life 6 months after discharge. DISCUSSION: We expect to observe improved functional status and independence after the post-acute care programme. The qualitative evaluation conducted with caregivers will complement our description of the transition of older people towards living at home. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered in the German Clinical Trials Register under DRKS00016647 (registered on 23.05.2019).
