26991863|a|A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of toxic aggregates of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Given that Abeta peptides are known to localise within mitochondria and interact with 17beta-HSD10, a mitochondrial protein expressed at high levels in AD brains, we investigated the inhibitory potential of 17beta-HSD10 against Abeta aggregation under a range of physiological conditions. Fluorescence self-quenching (FSQ) of Abeta(1-42) labelled with HiLyte Fluor 555 was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect under conditions established to grow distinct Abeta morphologies. 17beta-HSD10 preferentially inhibits the formation of globular and fibrillar-like structures but has no effect on the growth of amorphous plaque-like aggregates at endosomal pH 6. This work provides insights into the dependence of the Abeta-17beta-HSD10 interaction with the morphology of Abeta aggregates and how this impacts enzymatic function.
