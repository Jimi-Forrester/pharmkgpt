36463442|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major form of dementia. Abnormal amyloidogenic event-mediated degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the cognitive centers of the brain has been attributed to neuropathological sequelae and behavioral deficits in AD. Besides, impaired adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has experimentally been realized as an underlying cause of dementia regardless of neurodegeneration. Therefore, nourishing the neurogenic process in the hippocampus has been considered an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate memory loss. In the physiological state, the Wnt pathway has been identified as a potent mitogenic generator in the hippocampal stem cell niche. However, downstream components of Wnt signaling have been noticed to be downregulated in AD brains. Resveratrol (RSV) is a potent Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) enhancer that facilitates neuroprotection and promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain. While SIRT1 is an important positive regulator of Wnt signaling, ample reports indicate that RSV treatment strongly mediates the fate determination of stem cells through Wnt signaling. However, the possible therapeutic roles of RSV-mediated SIRT1 enhancement on the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and reversal of memory loss through the Wnt signaling pathway have not been addressed yet. Taken together, this review describes RSV-mediated effects on the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis via the activation of SIRT1 in synergy with the Wnt signaling. Further, the article emphasizes a hypothesis that RSV treatment can provoke the activation of quiescent neural stem cells and prime their neurogenic capacity in the hippocampus via Wnt signaling in AD.
