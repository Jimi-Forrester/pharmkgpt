34552754|t|A crawling case of benign acute childhood myositis.
34552754|a|Benign acute childhood myositis is a relatively uncommon complication of viral illness, particularly influenza A and B infections. In this abstract, we present a case report of benign acute childhood myositis secondary to influenza. On presentation, he was ill-appearing, febrile and had significant calf pain that limited mobility. Examination revealed mildly erythematous throat and bilateral calf tenderness with pain on dorsiflexion bilaterally. A respiratory virus panel was positive for influenza A subtype H3 and he was found to have an elevated creatine phosphokinase. He was diagnosed with benign acute childhood myositis secondary to influenza type A infection and symptoms gradually resolved following supportive management. Management involves oral hydration, pain management, and follow-up to ensure resolution. Extensive laboratory evaluation and hospitalization are often unnecessary. Benign acute childhood myositis is self-limiting with an excellent prognosis and should be included in the differential for a child who develops difficulty walking, particularly when presentation follows a respiratory infection.
