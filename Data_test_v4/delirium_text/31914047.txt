31914047|a|RATIONALE: Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVT) associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is infrequent, but clinically nonnegligible due to its high disability and fatality rates. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 12-year-old child with newly developed ulcerative colitis (UC) suffered from a sudden left-sided hemiparesis and numbness. DIAGNOSES: Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis due to ulcerative colitis was diagnosed in this girl. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with blood transfusion and anticoagulation therapy. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and urokinase thrombolysis were implemented followed. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved a complete recovery of limb functions and did not present any other stroke recurrences at follow-up a year later. LESSONS: CVT in UC is a serious condition and can occur in the children and adolescents. Rapidly diagnosis of this complication of IBD and apply anticoagulant therapy early can contribute to avoiding a potentially fatal outcome.
