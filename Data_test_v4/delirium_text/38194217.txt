Excessive action of these hormones is known to contribute to psychiatric disorders, including depression. MATERIALS: The study was performed in a rat model of depression based on prenatal administration of dexamethasone (DEX) in late pregnancy (0.1 mg/kg, days 14-21). We evaluated the effects of prenatal DEX treatment on the cognition and bioenergetic signaling pathways in the brain of adult male rats, in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and in response to stress in adulthood, using behavioral and biochemical test batteries. RESULTS: We revealed cognitive deficits in rats prenatally treated with DEX. At the molecular level, a decrease in the orexin A and orexin B levels and downregulation of the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1alpha transduction pathway in the frontal cortex of these animals were observed. In the hippocampus, a decreased expression of orexin B was found and changes in the MR/GR ratio were demonstrated. Furthermore, an increase in HDAC5 level triggered by the prenatal DEX treatment in both brain structures and a decrease in MeCP2 level in the hippocampus were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that prenatal DEX treatment is associated with cognitive dysfunction and alterations in various proteins leading to metabolic changes in the frontal cortex, while in the hippocampus adaptation mechanisms were activated. The presented results imply that different pathophysiological metabolic processes may be involved in depression development, which may be useful in the search for novel therapies.
