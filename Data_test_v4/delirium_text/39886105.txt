39886105|t|Hip fracture surgery in resource-limited environments: a systematic literature review.
39886105|a|Purpose: With life expectancies increasing worldwide, there is a concomitant rise in the incidence of fragility fractures. As such, low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs) will be faced with increased incidences of hip fractures. The care of these fractures is adversely affected by various factors that include under-resourced healthcare systems and large socioeconomic disparities, which disproportionately affect patient care in these regions relative to high-income countries. The purpose of this study was to determine treatment trends and outcomes of hip fracture care in lesser resourced regions as reported in primary literature sources through a systematic review. Data Sources: The article search was conducted on December 16, 2020, and April 14, 2022, in 3 databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. A search strategy unique to each database was developed with a research librarian using English search terms. Study Selection: Studies were selected using DistillerSR systematic review software. Two rounds of screening were performed for inclusion: 1) title and abstract screening and 2) full-text screening. Two researchers independently reviewed all articles. No articles were excluded based on language. Data Extraction: The extracted information included country, study demographics and design, hip fracture location, treatment, and outcomes. Data Synthesis: Of the 2533 initially identified abstracts, a total of 24 articles met the criteria for inclusion and were selected for final data extraction after full-text screening. Conclusion: This systematic review demonstrates a paucity of research evaluating geriatric hip fractures in LICs and LMICs. Additional research is needed to better characterize the preferred treatment by fracture type and associated complications in resource-limited environments.
