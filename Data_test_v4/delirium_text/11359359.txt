11359359|t|Medical utility of apoe allele determination in assessing the need for antioxidant therapy.
11359359|a|The APOE varepsilon4 allele is associated with a variety of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, coronary artery disease, stroke and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The common pathophysiological feature that appears to explain these positive clinical associations with APOE varepsilon4 allele may relate to the decreased endogenous anti-oxidant capability of an individual. A significant body of existing clinical data supports the assumption that diseases associated with the varepsilon4 allele can be alleviated by antioxidant therapies, such as vitamin E. Therefore, we hypothesize that determination of an individual's APOE allele status has medical utility as an efficient method to identify patient subgroups susceptible to oxidative damage. We suggest that prospective studies are needed to determine if individuals at high risk for diseases characterized by oxidative damage and/or who have an APOE varepsilon4 allele might benefit significantly from available antioxidant intervention at a relatively early and asymptomatic age.
