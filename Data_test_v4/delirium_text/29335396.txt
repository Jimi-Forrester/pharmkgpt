29335396|t|Barogenic rupture of esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome) as diagnostic and therapeutic challenge requiring rapid and effective interdisciplinary cooperation - case report.
29335396|a|We describe a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our centre from a local emergency unit with septic shock due to suspected Boerhaave syndrome. After the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient underwent emergency surgery. Postoperatively, the patient had symptoms of acute alcoholic delirium, and developed an oesophagomediastinal fistula as the most serious local complication. Successful conservative treatment enabled complete healing of the fistula, leading to patient recovery. No late complications like oesophageal stenosis were found at 6 months from discharge.
