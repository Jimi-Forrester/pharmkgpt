32102757|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate quetiapine-associated pulmonary complications (PC) in critically injured trauma patients. METHODS: Injured adults admitted during 2016 to the ICU at a Level I trauma center were analyzed. Outcomes were evaluated by competing risks survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 254 admissions, 40 (15.7%) had PC and 214 (84.3%) were non-events. PC patients were more severely injured, had longer hospital stays and were more likely to die. Patients administered quetiapine were more likely to develop PC and acquire PC earlier than those without quetiapine. Quetiapine was a positive risk factor for PC (sHR 2.24, p = 0.013). Stratification by ventilator use revealed non-ventilated patients administered quetiapine had the highest risk for PC (sHR 4.66, p = 0.099). CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine exposure in critically injured trauma patients was associated with increased risk of PC. Guidelines for treatment of delirium with quetiapine in critically injured trauma patients should account for this risk.
