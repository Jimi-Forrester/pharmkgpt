22387154|a|Enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a major component of amyloid plaques, is considered to have a causal role in the development and progress of AD by being the initiator of a pathological cascade leading to oxidative stress. The present study investigated the effect of N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NTF) purified from Polyalthia suberosa, an alkaloid shown to protect against oxidative stress and cell death. Pre-treatment of rat primary cortical cell cultures with 25-250muM NTF significantly attenuated 10muM Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptotic cell death was demonstrated morphologically as well as by detection of the presence of activated caspase-3 and Bax, levels of which could be reduced by NTF pre-treatment. NTF also reduced production of reactive oxygen species induced by Abeta(1-42). These findings suggest that the protective effect of NTF against Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal death might be due to its antioxidative property.
