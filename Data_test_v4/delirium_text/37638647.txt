37638647|t|Synergistic Screening of Peptide-Based Biotechnological Drug Candidates for Neurodegenerative Diseases Using Yeast Display and Phage Display.
37638647|a|Peptide therapeutics are robust and promising molecules for treating diverse disease conditions. These molecules can be developed from naturally occurring or mimicking native peptides, through rational design and peptide libraries. We developed a new platform for the rapid screening of the peptide therapeutics for disease targets. In the course of the study, we aimed to employ our platform to screen a new generation of peptide therapeutic candidates against aggregation-prone protein targets. Two peptide drug candidates were screened for protein aggregation-prone diseases, namely, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Currently, there are several therapeutic applications that are only effective in masking or slowing down symptom development. Nonetheless, different approaches are being developed for inhibiting amyloid aggregation in the secondary nucleation phase, which is critical for amyloid fibril formation. Instead of targeting secondary nucleated protein structures, we tried to inhibit the aggregation of monomeric amyloid units as a novel approach for halting the disease condition. To achieve this, we combined yeast surface display and phage display library platforms. We expressed alpha-synuclein, amyloid beta40, and amyloid beta42 on the yeast surface, and we selected peptides by using phage display library. After iterative biopanning cycles optimized for yeast cells, several peptides were selected for interaction studies. All of the peptides have been used for in vitro characterization methods, which are quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation (QCM-D) measurement, atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, dot-blotting, and ThT assay, and some of them have yielded promising results in blocking fibrillization. The rest of the peptides, although, interacted with amyloid units which made them usable as a sensor molecule candidate. Therefore, peptides selected by yeast surface display and phage display library combination are good choice for diverse disease-prone molecule inhibition, particularly those inhibiting fibrillization. Additionally, these selected peptides can be used as drugs and sensors to detect diseases quickly and halt disease progression.
