16701975|t|Cholinergic neurons degenerate when exposed to conditioned medium of primary rat brain capillary endothelial cells: counteraction by NGF, MK-801 and inflammation.
16701975|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid plaques, intraneuronal Tau-inclusions and cell death of cholinergic neurons. Recent evidence indicates that the vascular system may play an important role in the development of this progressive neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this study was to observe, if brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) may produce and secrete factors which induce cell death of cholinergic neurons, and if this effect is counteracted by (1) NGF, MK-801 or vitamin C, (2) modulated by experimentally-induced inflammation with interleukin-1beta and lipopolysaccharide (IL-1beta and LPS) or (3) by blocking of different intracellular signalling pathways. Cholinergic neurons were cultivated in organotypic brain slices of the nucleus basalis of Meynert and treated with conditioned medium derived from BCEC, supplemented with different protective factors. BCEC were stimulated with IL-1beta and LPS or different intracellular pathway inhibitors before collection of conditioned medium. Cholinergic neurons were detected by immunohistochemistry for choline-acetyltransferase. Possible effects on BCEC viability and proliferation were determined by nuclear staining, BrdU incorporation and release of nitrite and lactate-dehydrogenase. BCEC released factors that can kill cholinergic neurons. This neurotoxic effect was blocked by NGF and MK-801 (a NMDA-antagonist), but not by vitamin C. Pretreatment of BCEC with intracellular pathway inhibitors did not change the neurotoxicity, but pretreatment with IL-1beta and LPS abolished the neurotoxic effect. In summary, BCEC produce and secrete molecules which induce excitotoxic cell death of cholinergic neurons. It is concluded that excitotoxic factors secreted by vascular cells may contribute to the development of cholinergic neurodegeneration as it occurs in Alzheimer's disease.
