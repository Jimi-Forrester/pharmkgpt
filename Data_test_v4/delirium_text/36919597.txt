36919597|t|Telecaregiving for dementia: A mapping review of technological and non-technological interventions.
36919597|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Informal (or family) caregivers to older adults with Alzheimer's disease or other related dementias (ADRD) could greatly benefit from innovative telecaregiving systems that support caregiving from a distance. The objective of this review is to better understand: 1) who is involved in telecaregiving and their experiences; 2) the interventions currently available to support ADRD telecaregiving; and 3) the outcomes measured to assess the effects of ADRD telecaregiving interventions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A mapping review was conducted by systematically searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO for all works published in English from 2002-2022. References of included publications were searched to identify additional empirical publications for inclusion. RESULTS: 61 publications (describing 48 studies and five non-study sources) were included in the review. Currently available information on the demographics, experiences, challenges, and benefits of ADRD telecaregivers is summarized. We found that interventions to support telecaregiving could be classified into seven categories of technological interventions and three categories of non-technological interventions. Empirical studies on ADRD telecaregiving interventions investigated a variety of outcomes, the most prevalent being user experience. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that: 1) The paucity of literature on telecaregiving does not allow for a comprehensive understanding of the needs and day-to-day activities of ADRD telecaregivers; 2) interventions developed to support ADRD telecaregiving may not fully meet the needs of caregivers or care recipients; and 3) there is insufficient rigorous research establishing the effects of telecaregiving interventions on key ADRD-related outcomes.
