36969810|a|Introduction: Cognition decline is associated with aging and certain diseases, such as neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Inflammation/neuroinflammation is considered an important causal factor, and experimental evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory natural compounds may effectively prevent cognitive decline. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of two natural bioactive agents, oligo-lactic acid (LAP) and fermented soy extract (ImmunBalance, IMB), on cognition in an adenine-induced cognitive impairment mouse model and to investigate the modulation of related biomarkers. Methods: Male C57 black mice were randomly assigned into the following experimental groups and received the corresponding treatments for 2 weeks before the use of adenine for model development: (1) negative control; (2) model control: injection of adenine at 50 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks; (3, 4) IMB groups: adenine injection and IMB oral gavage at 250 and 1,000 mg/kg BW, respectively; and (5) LAP group: adenine injection and LAP oral gavage at 1,000 mg/kg BW. One week after the model was developed, mice were evaluated for cognitive performances by using Y maze test, novel object recognition test, open field test, and Barnes maze tests. At the end of the experiment, brain tissues and cecum fecal samples were collected for analysis of gene expression and gut microbiota. Results: Mice treated with LAP or IMB had significantly improved spatial working memory, spatial recognition memory (LAP only), novel object recognition, and spatial learning and memory, compared with those in the model group. Gene expression analysis showed that, among a panel of cognition related genes, six of them (ELOVL2, GLUT4, Nestein, SNCA, TGFB1, and TGFB2) were significantly altered in the model group. LAP treatment significantly reversed expression levels of inflammatory/neuroinflammatory genes (SNCA, TGFB1), and IMB significantly reversed expression levels of genes related to inflammation/neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and energy metabolism (ELOVL2, GLUT4, Nestin, TGFB1, and TGFB2). The altered microbiome was attenuated only by IMB. Discussion: In conclusion, our data showed that LAP improved cognition associated with regulating biomarkers related to neuroinflammation and energy metabolism, whereas IMB improved cognition associated with regulating biomarkers related to neuroinflammation, energy metabolism, and neurogenesis, and modulating gut microbiota. Our results suggest that LAP and IMB may improve cognitive performance in mice via distinct mechanisms of action.
