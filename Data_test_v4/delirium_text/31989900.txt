31989900|t|Recent Trends in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease: Current Therapeutic Options and Drug Repurposing Approaches.
31989900|a|Alzheimer's disease is one of the most progressive forms of dementia, ultimately leading to death in aged populations. The major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include deposition of extracellular amyloid senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in brain neuronal cells. Although there are classical therapeutic options available for the treatment of the diseases, however, they provide only a symptomatic relief and do not modify the molecular pathophysiological course of the disease. Recent research advances in Alzheimer's disease have highlighted the potential role of anti-amyloid, anti-tau, and anti-inflammatory therapies. However, these therapies are still in different phases of pre-clinical/clinical development. In addition, drug repositioning/repurposing is another interesting and promising approach to explore rationalized options for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This review discusses the different aspects of the pathophysiological mechanism involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease along with the limitations of current therapies. Furthermore, this review also highlights emerging investigational drugs along with recent drug repurposing approaches for Alzheimer's disease.
