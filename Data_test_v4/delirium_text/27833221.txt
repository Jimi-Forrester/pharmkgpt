27833221|a|BACKGROUND: Proportion of elderly is increasing among the total population of Kerala, and mental health problems of this group are unique. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and sociodemographic profile of patients attending Psychogeriatric Clinic in a tertiary care center and to study the correlation of sociodemographic and clinical variables with psychiatric diagnoses in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients, who attended the Psychogeriatric Clinic of a tertiary care center over a period of 1 year, was done. The Institutional Ethics Committee discussed and waived clearance for the review. RESULTS: There were 85 cases with a mean age of 69.5 years (standard deviation-7.36). Majority of them were females (56.5%) and belonged to low socioeconomic status (52.9%). Comorbid physical illnesses were seen in 76.5% cases. Diagnoses were made by Junior Residents in Psychiatry and confirmed by a qualified psychiatrist, as per International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria. The most common psychiatric diagnosis was organic mental disorders (24.7%), which included dementias, delirium, and organic mood disorders. This was followed by bipolar affective disorders (22.4%), schizophrenia and related disorders (20.0%), depressive and anxiety disorders (17.6%) and mental and behavioral disorders due to substance use (2.4%). Occurrence of organic psychiatric disorders showed positive correlation with age (Spearman's rho =0.253, P = 0.02) and occurrence of hypertension (rho =0.222, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Organic psychiatric disorders are more common in elderly patients attending a tertiary care center. Comorbid physical illnesses are seen in more than three-fourths of this population. Organic psychiatric disorders are seen more commonly with increasing age and occurrence of hypertension.
