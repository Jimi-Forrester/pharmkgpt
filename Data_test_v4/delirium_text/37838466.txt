37838466|t|Optimization of Care for the Elderly Surgical Emergency Patient.
37838466|a|Geriatric patients undergoing emergency surgery are at significantly higher risk for complications and death when compared with younger patients. Optimizing care for these patients requires a multidisciplinary team, special attention to physiologic changes and medication use, as well as targeted intervention to mitigate complications such as delirium, which can worsen overall outcomes. Frailty can be assessed preoperatively to identify patients at the highest risk for complications. Shared decision-making with both the family and patient during the consent process is integral to defining patient's goals of care in these high-risk situations.
