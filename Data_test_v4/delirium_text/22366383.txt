22366383|a|Highly concentrated metals such as Cu, Zn, and Fe are found in amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques within the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that metal binding to Abeta could facilitate Abeta aggregation and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could contribute to the neuropathogenesis of AD. The connection between metal-Abeta interaction/reactivity and AD development, however, has not been clearly revealed owing to the complexity of the disease. In this review, metal-Abeta interaction/reactivity and its relation to neurotoxicity are briefly discussed. Additionally, our review illustrates the recent progress of small molecules, capable of targeting metal-Abeta species and modulating their interaction/reactivity, which could offer a promising approach to interrogate their role in AD.
