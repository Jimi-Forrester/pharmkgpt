38009146|a|Present communication aimed to record the clinical signs, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and haemato-biochemical variations in buffalo calves with the cerebral form of babesiosis. The study was carried out on eight buffalo calves presented to the hospital with nervous signs suffering from babesiosis. Confirmation of babesiosis was done by demonstration of pear-shaped intra-erythrocytic piroplasms of Babesia. The appreciable clinical signs were the absence of rumination, anorexia, wobbling gait, hyperthermia, scleral congestion, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, delirium, achezia and grinding of teeth. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis exhibited the presence of high protein, nucleated cells and red blood cells. The haemato-biochemical study showed mild anaemia, leucopenia, lymphocytosis and neutropenia; elevated serum globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The present study concludes that the changes in the cerebrospinal fluid during the cerebral form of babesiosis in buffalo calves might be a reason for the development of neurological signs which was not documented in previous literature and babesiosis can consider as differential diagnosis in young calves with nervous signs.
