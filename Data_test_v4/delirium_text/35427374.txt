35427374|a|Congenital heart disease (CHD) has been associated with structural brain growth and long-term developmental impairments, including deficits in learning, memory, and executive functions. Altered functional connectivity has been shown to be altered in neonates born with CHD; however, it is unclear if these early life alterations are also present during adulthood. Therefore, this study aimed to compare resting state functional connectivity networks associated with executive function deficits between youth (16 to 24 years old) with complex CHD (mean age = 20.13; SD = 2.35) who underwent open-heart surgery during infancy and age- and sex-matched controls (mean age = 20.41; SD = 2.05). Using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version questionnaire, we found that participants with CHD presented with poorer performance on the inhibit, initiate, emotional control, working memory, self-monitor, and organization of materials clinical scales than healthy controls. We then compared the resting state networks theoretically corresponding to these impaired functions, namely the default mode, dorsal attention, fronto-parietal, fronto-orbital, and amygdalar networks, between the two groups. Participants with CHD presented with decreased functional connectivity between the fronto-orbital cortex and the hippocampal regions and between the amygdala and the frontal pole. Increased functional connectivity was observed within the default mode network, the dorsal attention network, and the fronto-parietal network. Overall, our results suggest that youth with CHD present with disrupted resting state functional connectivity in widespread networks and regions associated with altered executive functioning.
