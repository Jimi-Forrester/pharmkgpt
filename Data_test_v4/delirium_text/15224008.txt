15224008|a|Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Disturbance in the prooxidant/antioxidant balance increases during aging moreover the production of free radicals is alleged to play a significant role in this neurodegenerative process. Because Alzheimer's disease applies to elderly people, the aim of this publication was to explore the connection between oxidative stress and its influence on the aging process. This study refers to recent studies and publications on Alzheimer's disease and particularly the oxidative stress processes connected with this illness. These processes suggest that oxidative damage is one of the factors in the neuronal death underlying the loss of cognition. Researchers involved in these studies describe oxidative damage as increases or decreases in antioxidant enzyme activity, the role of antioxidant vitamin supplementation, and alternative medications targeting other specific areas of activity in Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment.
