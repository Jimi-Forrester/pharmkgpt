23339288|t|Review: microglia in protein aggregation disorders: friend or foe?
23339288|a|Microglia cells have been implicated, to some extent, in the pathogenesis of all of the common neurodegenerative disorders involving protein aggregation such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. However, the precise role they play in the development of the pathologies remains unclear and it seems that they contribute to the pathological process in different ways depending on the specific disorder. A better understanding of their varied roles is essential if they are to be the target for novel therapeutic strategies.
