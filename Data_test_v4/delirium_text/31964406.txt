31964406|a|BACKGROUND: The vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) is a major component of the retromer complex system, an ubiquitous multiprotein assembly responsible for sorting and trafficking protein cargos out of the endosomes. VPS35 can regulate APP metabolism and Abeta formation, and its levels are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. We and others demonstrated that VPS35 genetic manipulation modulates the phenotype of mouse models of AD. However, the translational value of this observation remains to be investigated. METHODS: Triple transgenic mice were randomized to receive a pharmacological chaperone, which stabilizes the retromer complex, and the effect on their AD-like phenotype assessed. RESULTS: Compared with controls, treated mice had a significant improvement in learning and memory, an elevation of VPS35 levels, and improved synaptic integrity. Additionally, the same animals had a significant decrease in Abeta levels and deposition, reduced tau phosphorylation and less astrocytes activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the enhancement of retromer function by pharmacological chaperones is a potentially novel and viable therapy against AD.
