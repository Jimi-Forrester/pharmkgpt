29793495|t|Casein kinase 1alpha: biological mechanisms and theranostic potential.
29793495|a|Casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) is a multifunctional protein belonging to the CK1 protein family that is conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to humans. It regulates signaling pathways related to membrane trafficking, cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, apoptosis, autophagy, cell metabolism, and differentiation in development, circadian rhythm, and the immune response as well as neurodegeneration and cancer. Given its involvement in diverse cellular, physiological, and pathological processes, CK1alpha is a promising therapeutic target. In this review, we summarize what is known of the biological functions of CK1alpha, and provide an overview of existing challenges and potential opportunities for advancing theranostics.
