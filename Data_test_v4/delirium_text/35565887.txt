35565887|t|Role of Chrononutrition in the Antihypertensive Effects of Natural Bioactive Compounds.
35565887|a|Hypertension (HTN) is one of the main cardiovascular risk factors and is considered a major public health problem. Numerous approaches have been developed to lower blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, most of them involving pharmacological treatments. Within this context, natural bioactive compounds have emerged as a promising alternative to drugs in HTN prevention. This work reviews not only the mechanisms of BP regulation by these antihypertensive compounds, but also their efficacy depending on consumption time. Although a plethora of studies has investigated food-derived compounds, such as phenolic compounds or peptides and their impact on BP, only a few addressed the relevance of time consumption. However, it is known that BP and its main regulatory mechanisms show a 24-h oscillation. Moreover, evidence shows that phenolic compounds can interact with clock genes, which regulate the biological rhythm followed by many physiological processes. Therefore, further research might be carried out to completely elucidate the interactions along the time-nutrition-hypertension axis within the framework of chrononutrition.
