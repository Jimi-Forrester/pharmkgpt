30852930|t|Biomarker Predictors of Delirium in Acutely Ill Patients: A Systematic Review.
30852930|a|Delirium is a serious and common disorder that affects up to 80% of acutely ill patients, mainly the aged. In recent years, several studies pointed out possible biomarkers that could be used alone or in combination with other resources in the diagnosis and follow-up of critically ill patients who develop delirium. In this context, a systematic review was conducted to determine the predictive value of several biomarkers in acutely (critically and noncritically) ill adult patients with delirium. Studies that used the confusion assessment method (CAM) and CAM-intensive care unit as the diagnostic method were considered. The most recent search was performed in November 2017. There was no language restriction. Initially, 626 articles were screened and 39 were included in the study. A comprehensive evaluation of the abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 202 studies, leaving 39 articles as potentially relevant. Inflammatory markers, S100beta and cortisol, could predict delirium occurrence in a specific subgroup population of critically ill patients.
