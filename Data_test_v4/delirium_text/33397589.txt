33397589|a|Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that can modulated cellular processes involved in the development, homeostasis, cell proliferation, metabolism, and reproduction through the control of the specific genetic and molecular program. In the central nervous system, they are key regulators of neural stem cell fate decisions and can modulate the physiology of different brain cells. Over the past decades, a large body of evidence has supported that nuclear receptors are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, the most common dementia worldwide, and the main cause of disability in later life. This disease is characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau protein that can explain alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity; loss of dendritic spines; increased in reactive microglia and inflammation; reduction of neuronal stem cells number; myelin and vascular alterations that finally leads to increased neuronal death. Here, we present a review of type II no steroidal nuclear receptors that form obligatory heterodimers with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) and its potential in the therapeutic of AD. Activation of type II nuclear receptor by synthetic agonist leads to transcriptional regulation of specific genes that acts counteracting against the detrimental effects of amyloid-beta peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau in neuronal cells recovering the functionality of the synapses. But also, activation of type II nuclear receptor leads to modifications in APP metabolism, repression of inflammatory cascade and inductors of the generation of neuronal stem cells and progenitor cells supporting its potential therapeutics role for Alzheimer's disease.
