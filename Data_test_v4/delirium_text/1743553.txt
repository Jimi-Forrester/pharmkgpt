1743553|a|Twenty-four evaluable patients with recurrent or advanced squamous carcinoma of the cervix were treated with ifosfamide (IFX) and mesna every 3 weeks. The initial dose of IFX was 1.5 g/m2 q.d. Days 1-5. Mesna was given by continuous infusion (1.5 g/m2/day Days 1-6). Seventy-four courses of treatment were given to 24 patients. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. The median survival was 26 weeks from initiation of chemotherapy. There were 4 complete responders (CR); there was 1 partial responder. The response rate was 20.8% (CI, 4-38%). One CR patient remains in clinical remission 30 months after initiation of therapy. The other 3 responders recurred after a disease-free interval of 8, 12, and 18 weeks. WBC below 3000/mm3 occurred in 19 patients and was life threatening (below 1000/mm3) in 5 patients. One patient had life-threatening hemorrhagic cystitis. Eleven patients developed CNS symptoms during treatment including somnolence, coma, and acute delirium.
