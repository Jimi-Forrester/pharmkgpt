15338159|a|Frontotemporal dementia is a relatively rare neurodegenerative disease. In the majority of cases the onset is at a presenile age, and changes of behavior as well as alterations of personality and social conduct are predominant symptoms whereas cognitive deficits are mild. Therefore interventions for caregivers including self-help groups and educational programs which are usually tailored to Alzheimer's disease often do not meet the needs of caregivers of patients with FTD. The present paper reviews the clinical features of FTD, outlines the specific problems and burdens that caregivers are faced with, and describes novel interventions for this group of family caregivers.
