34992841|t|Review: immunosuppression for the lung transplant patient.
34992841|a|Lung transplantation (LTx) has evolved significantly since its inception and the improvement in LTx outcomes over the last three decades has predominantly been driven by advances in immunosuppression management. Despite the lack of new classes of immunosuppression medications, immunosuppressive strategies have evolved significantly from a universal method to a more targeted approach, reflecting a greater understanding of the need for individualized therapy and careful consideration of all factors that are influenced by immunosuppression choice. This has become increasingly important as the demographics of lung transplant recipients have changed over time, with older and more medically complex candidates being accepted and undergoing LTx. Furthermore, improved survival post lung transplant has translated into more immunosuppression related comorbidities long-term, predominantly chronic kidney disease (CKD) and malignancy, which has required further nuanced management approaches. This review provides an update on current traditional lung transplant immunosuppression strategies, with modifications based on pre-existing recipient factors and comorbidities, peri-operative challenges and long term complications, balanced against the perpetual challenge of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). As we continue to explore and understand the complexity of LTx immunology and the interplay of different factors, immunosuppression strategies will require ongoing critical evaluation and personalization in order to continue to improve lung transplant outcomes.
