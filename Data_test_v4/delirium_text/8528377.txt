8528377|t|A case of Alzheimer's disease with extensive focal white matter changes.
8528377|a|The case of a patient is reported who suffered from disturbed concentration and memory and constructive apraxia. She had only mild neuropsychological deficits at the first examination. T2-weighted MRI presented extensive focal white matter changes. A brain biopsy showed changes typical for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The extent of the white matter lesions was surprising compared to the mild clinical signs she had. This case confirms that AD may result in prominent white matter disease caused by incomplete infarction or demyelination.
