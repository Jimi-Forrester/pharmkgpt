38913976|t|Duo-Chol: A Photoconvertible Live Cell Imaging Tool for Tracking Cholesterol.
38913976|a|Investigating cholesterol trafficking pathways continues to be of significant scientific interest owing to its homeostasis being associated with several debilitating cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases including atherosclerosis, Niemann-Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. To further our understanding of cholesterol trafficking, it is imperative to develop new fluorescent probes that possess improved photostability, low efflux, and high spatial and temporal resolution for live-cell imaging. In this study, we developed a photoconvertible fluorescent cholesterol analog, Duo-Chol, enabling the improved spatiotemporal fluorescence imaging of the dynamic localization of cholesterol in live cells. This tool provides a unique and powerful approach to interrogating cholesterol dynamics, addressing the limitations of existing methods, and expanding our ability to probe the biological role of sterols in living cells.
