28759544|a|OBJECTIVE: Median sternotomy is still the standard approach for aortic arch surgery. Minimally invasive techniques promise faster recovery with shorter hospital stay due to thoracic stability, reduced pain, and superior cosmetic results. However, safety is a concern in complex aortic surgery. The aim of our study was to demonstrate that aortic arch surgery via partial upper sternotomy is viable, safe, and equivalent to standard procedure both in terms of its safety and the risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. METHODS: We interrogated our prospectively collected database and identified a total of 21 nonemergent patients operated on at our center between October 2008 and February 2015. Indication for operation was aneurysmatic disease in 18 and aortic dissection in 3 patients. Data were analyzed for in-hospital mortality, stroke, bleeding complications, and acute kidney injury. RESULTS: Mean +- standard deviation age of patients was 69.3 +- 14.4 years, 57.1% were female, and mean +- standard deviation logistic EuroSCORE was 17.0 +- 7.2%. Surgery on the aortic arch comprised proximal arch in 9, hemiarch in 9, and total arch replacement plus frozen elephant trunk in 3 patients. Concomitant procedures included aortic root repair in 10, aortic root replacement in 2, and aortic valve replacement in 3 patients. We lost one patient because of septic shock, no stroke occurred, but a transient neurologic deficit in three and a postoperative delirium in four patients. Re-exploration for bleeding was necessary in two patients, and one patient had acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive aortic arch surgery via partial upper sternotomy does not increase the risk of morbidity or mortality. Thus, in experienced hands, it is viable, safe, and therefore favorable and as a result should be offered to more patients.
