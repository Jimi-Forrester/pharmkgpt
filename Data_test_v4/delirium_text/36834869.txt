36834869|t|Notch Signaling in Acute Inflammation and Sepsis.
36834869|a|Notch signaling, a highly conserved pathway in mammals, is crucial for differentiation and homeostasis of immune cells. Besides, this pathway is also directly involved in the transmission of immune signals. Notch signaling per se does not have a clear pro- or anti-inflammatory effect, but rather its impact is highly dependent on the immune cell type and the cellular environment, modulating several inflammatory conditions including sepsis, and therefore significantly impacts the course of disease. In this review, we will discuss the contribution of Notch signaling on the clinical picture of systemic inflammatory diseases, especially sepsis. Specifically, we will review its role during immune cell development and its contribution to the modulation of organ-specific immune responses. Finally, we will evaluate to what extent manipulation of the Notch signaling pathway could be a future therapeutic strategy.
