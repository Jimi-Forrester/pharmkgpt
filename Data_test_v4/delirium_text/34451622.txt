34451622|t|Oxypeucedanin: Chemotaxonomy, Isolation, and Bioactivities.
34451622|a|The present review comprehensively gathered phytochemical, bioactivity, and pharmacokinetic reports on a linear furanocoumarin, namely oxypeucedanin. Oxypeucedanin (OP), which structurally contains an epoxide ring, has been majorly isolated from ethyl acetate-soluble partitions of several genera, particularly Angelica, Ferulago, and Prangos of the Apiaceae family; and Citrus, belonging to the Rutaceae family. The methanolic extract of Angelica dahurica roots has been analytically characterized as the richest natural OP source. This naturally occurring secondary metabolite has been described to possess potent antiproliferative, cytotoxic, anti-influenza, and antiallergic activities, as assessed in preclinical studies. In order to explore potential drug candidates, oxypeucedanin, its derivatives, and semi-synthetically optimized analogues can be considered for the complementary assessments of biological assays.
