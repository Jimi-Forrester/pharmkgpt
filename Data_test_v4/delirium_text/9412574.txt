9412574|t|Community-acquired pneumonia in the elderly. Clinical and nutritional aspects.
9412574|a|Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the elderly has a different clinical presentation than CAP in other age groups. Confusion, alteration of functional physical capacity, and decompensation of underlying illnesses may appear as unique manifestations. Malnutrition is also an associated feature of CAP in this population. We undertook a study to assess the clinical and nutritional aspects of CAP requiring hospitalization in elderly patients (over 65 yr of age). One hundred and one patients with pneumonia, consecutively admitted to a 1,000-bed teaching hospital over an 8-mo period, were studied (age: 78 +/- 8 yr, mean +/- SD). Nutritional aspects and the mental status of patients with pneumonia were compared with those of a control population (n = 101) matched for gender, age, and date of hospitalization. The main symptoms were dyspnea (n = 71), cough (n = 67), and fever (n = 64). The association of these symptoms with CAP was observed in only 32 patients. The most common associated conditions were cardiac disease (n = 38) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 30). Seventy-seven (76%) episodes of pneumonia were clinically classified as typical and 24 as atypical. There was no association between the type of isolated microorganism and the clinical presentation of CAP, except for pleuritic chest pain, which was more common in pneumonia episodes caused by classical microorganisms (p = 0.02). This was confirmed by a multivariate analysis (relative risk [RR] = 11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7 to 65; p = 0.0099). The prevalence of chronic dementia was similar in the pneumonia cohort (n = 25) and control group (n = 18) (p = 0.22). However, delirium or acute confusion were significantly more frequent in the pneumonia cohort than in controls (45 versus 29 episodes; p = 0.019). Only 16 patients with pneumonia were considered to be well nourished, as compared with 47 control patients (p = 0.001). Kwashiorkor-like malnutrition was the predominant type of malnutrition (n = 65; 70%) in the pneumonia patients as compared with the control patients (n = 31; 31%) (p = 0.001). The observed mortality was 26% (n = 26). Pleuritic chest pain is the only clinical symptom that can guide an empiric therapeutic strategy in CAP (typical versus atypical pneumonia). Both delirium and malnutrition were very common clinical manifestations of CAP in our study population.
