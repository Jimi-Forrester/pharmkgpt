37654833|t|GC-MS profiling and bioactivity prediction of compounds from Momordica charantia L. extract.
37654833|a|Momordica species are vegetable crops, belonging to the family of Cucurbitaceae. For the present study plant samples of Momordica charantia were collected from different parts of Barak Valley of Assam, India. Hyphenated technique Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) of the chromatographically separated components of the plant extract was performed to identify some of the principles. All the isolated compounds exhibited notable interaction with the enzyme Bone morphogenic protein upon in silico screening. All the compounds were screened in silico for toxicity and then docked with the target enzyme individually. It was found that these compounds are interacting with the target enzyme and is able to inhibit the enzyme activity more efficiently as compared to the reference ligand.
