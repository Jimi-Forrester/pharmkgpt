21054172|a|Palliative care improves the quality and cost-effectiveness of adult and pediatric patient care, and it decreases unwanted hospitalizations and aggressive care at the end of life. National palliative care quality standards and preferred practices can be used for benchmarking by institutions, health care systems, and accrediting bodies. Pain and symptom management and the management of delirium for patients is now possible for the vast majority of patients, even those with advanced disease. However, because of shortages of specialists providing "tertiary" palliative care, significant improvements are needed in generalist-level palliative care among oncologists, intensivists, and specialists caring for patients with advanced cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic diseases. POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) forms are a major advance in end-of-life care. They enable patients' advance directives to be valid wherever they are cared for (home, hospital, or nursing facility).
