36269183|a|Purpose: To determine the feasibility of a custom frame generation approach for nonsurgical management of severe blepharoptosis with the magnetic levator prosthesis (MLP). Methods: Participants (n = 8) with severe blepharoptosis (obscuring the visual axis) in one or both eyes who had previously been using a non-custom MLP had a craniofacial scan with a smartphone app to generate a custom MLP frame. A magnetic adhesive was attached to the affected eyelid. The custom MLP frame held a cylindrical magnet near the eyebrow above the affected eyelid, suspending it in the magnetic field while still allowing blinking. The spectacle magnet could be rotated manually, providing adjustable force via angular translation of the magnetic field. Fitting success and comfort were recorded, and interpalpebral fissure (IPF) was measured from video frames after 20 minutes in-office and one-week at-home use. Preference was documented, custom versus non-custom. Results: Overall, 88% of patients (7/8) were successfully fitted with a median 9/10 comfort (interquartile 7-10) and median ptosis improvement of 2.3 mm (1.3-5.0); P = 0.01). Exact binomial testing suggested, with 80% power, that the true population success rate was significantly greater than 45% (P = 0.05). Five participants took the custom MLP home for one week, with only one case of mild conjunctival redness which resolved without treatment. Highest to lowest force modulation resulted in a marginally significant median IPF adjustment of 1.5 mm (0.8 to 2.7; P = 0.06). All preferred the custom frame. Conclusions: The three-dimensional custom MLP frame generation approach using a smartphone app-based craniofacial scan is a feasible approach for clinical deployment of the MLP. Translational Relevance: First demonstration of customized frame generation for the MLP.
