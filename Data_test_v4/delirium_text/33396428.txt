33396428|t|Inactivation of Prions by Low-Temperature Sterilization Technology Using Vaporized Gas Derived from a Hydrogen Peroxide-Peracetic Acid Mixture.
33396428|a|Prion diseases are proteopathies that cause neurodegenerative disorders in humans and animals. Prion is highly resistant to both chemical and physical inactivation. Here, vaporized gas derived from a hydrogen peroxide-peracetic acid mixture (VHPPA) was evaluated for its ability to inactivate prion using a STERIACE 100 instrument (Saraya Co., Ltd.). Brain homogenates of scrapie (Chandler strain) prion-infected mice were placed on a cover glass, air-dried, sealed in a Tyvek package, and subjected to VHPPA treatment at 50-55  C using 8% hydrogen peroxide and <10% peracetic acid for 47 min (standard mode, SD) or 30 min (quick mode, QC). Untreated control samples were prepared in the same way but without VHPPA. The resulting samples were treated with proteinase K (PK) to separate PK-resistant prion protein (PrPres), as a marker of the abnormal isoform (PrPSc). Immunoblotting showed that PrPres was reduced by both SD and QC VHPPA treatments. PrPres bands were detected after protein misfolding cyclic amplification of control but not VHPPA-treated samples. In mice injected with prion samples, VHPPA treatment of prion significantly prolonged survival relative to untreated samples, suggesting that it decreases prion infectivity. Taken together, the results show that VHPPA inactivates prions and might be applied to the sterilization of contaminated heat-sensitive medical devices.
