8624079|a|Inheritance of the apolipoprotein E (apo E) epsilon 4 allele has recently been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease. We have studied the clinical and neuropathological correlates of apolipoprotein E genotype in a large group of Alzheimer's patients. The primary influence on clinical presentation is a shift towards earlier age of onset in individuals who have the apo E epsilon 4 gene: no change in clinical course was observed. In neuropathological studies, we find that the major influence of apo E epsilon 4 is on increased A beta deposition. These results led to a model of the biological interaction between the apo E protein and Alzheimer's disease.
