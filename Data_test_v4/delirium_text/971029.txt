971029|a|Several authors have attempted to establish a correlation between glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency and chronic schizophrenia, and the results were contradictory. We propose that the correlation between G-6-PD deficiency and schizophrenia is to be found in the form of an acute delirium.
