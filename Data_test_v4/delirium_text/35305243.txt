35305243|t|CaMKIIalpha Signaling Is Required for the Neuroprotective Effects of Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide in Alzheimer's Disease.
35305243|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and most anti-AD drugs have failed in clinical trials; hence, it is urgent to find potentially effective drugs against AD. DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is a compound extracted from celery seed and is a multiple-target drug. Several studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of NBP on cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms of NBP remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we found that NBP could alleviated the increase of intracellular Ca2+ and reversed down-regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase alpha (CaMKIIalpha) signaling and rescued neuronal apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells treated by Abeta oligomers. However, these neuroprotective effects of NBP on neuronal damage and CaMKIIalpha signaling were abolished when CaMKIIalpha expression was knocked down or its activity was inhibited. Thus, our findings suggested that CaMKIIalpha signaling was required for the neuroprotective effects of NBP in AD and provided an improved basis for elucidating the mechanism and treatment of NBP in AD.
