26026495|t|Rehabilitation during mechanical ventilation: Review of the recent literature.
26026495|a|Mechanically ventilated patients are at increased risk of developing physical and psychological complications that are associated with prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation, increased morbidity and mortality. These complications include intensive care unit acquired weakness, delirium and a loss of physical function that may persist well beyond ICU and hospital discharge. Factors such as the requirement for intubation and mechanical ventilation, sedation, systemic inflammation and immobility are associated with the development of these physical and psychological complications. Implementation of rehabilitation in mechanically ventilated patients has been demonstrated to be both safe and feasible and provide benefits in terms of physical and psychological function and assist with weaning from mechanical ventilation. The recent relevant literature on the role of rehabilitation interventions in the mechanically ventilated patient will be discussed.
