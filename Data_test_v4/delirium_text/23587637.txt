23587637|a|The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the relationship between apolipoprotein (APOE) genotype and electroencephalographic oscillatory brain dynamics in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and control subjects and its regional distribution. We obtained resting-state electroencephalographs of 320 AD patients and 246 control subjects, categorized into APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. Peak frequency and relative power in 4 different frequency bands were calculated. We tested the associations between APOE genotype and relative power in 4 brain regions. Peak frequency was comparable in APOE epsilon4 carrying and noncarrying control subjects, but lower in APOE epsilon4 noncarrying AD patients. In control subjects, APOE epsilon4 carriers had a different regional distribution of alpha power than noncarriers. We found no APOE effect in beta, delta, and theta bands. In AD, APOE epsilon4 noncarriers had lower alpha and higher delta power than carriers. This difference was most pronounced in the parieto-occipital region. In the theta band, APOE epsilon4 noncarriers had a different regional distribution of power compared with carriers. In conclusion, the most pronounced effect of genotype was seen in AD patients, and APOE epsilon4 noncarriers showed slower activity, especially in parieto-occipital regions.
