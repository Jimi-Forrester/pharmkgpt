34979943|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is characterized by acute brain dysfunction, especially in elderly patients. Postoperative pain is an important factor in the development of delirium, and effective pain management can reduce the risk of POD. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) can effectively relieve postoperative pain and inhibit the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. We investigated whether the combination of TPVB with general anesthesia reduced the occurrence of POD following thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS: A total of 338 elderly patients, aged 65-80 years, who underwent elective surgery for video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS) were randomly assigned to either a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia group (PIA) or a patient-controlled paravertebral-block analgesia group (PBA). POD was evaluated using the 3-min diagnostic confusion assessment method (3D-CAM). The postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) was assessed with Chinese version of QoR-40 scale. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) score. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and neurofilament light (NFL) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. RESULTS: Delirium occurred in 47 (28%) of 168 cases in the PIA group and 28 (16.5%) of 170 cases in the PBA group (RR 1.7, p = 0.03). PBA was also associated with a higher rate of overall recovery quality at day 7 after surgery (27.1% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.013) compared with PIA. The incremental change in surgery-induced TNF-alpha and NFL was greater in the PIA group than PBA group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Thoracic paravertebral block analgesia is associated with lower incidence of postoperative delirium, probably due to its anti-neuroinflammatory effects. Furthermore, as a component of multimodal analgesia, TPVB provides not only superior analgesic but also opioid-sparing effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center ( www.chictr.org.cn ; registration number: ChiCTR 2,000,033,238 ) on 25/05/2018.
