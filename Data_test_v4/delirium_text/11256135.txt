11256135|t|[A day care center for management of early stage Alzheimer's disease].
11256135|a|Alzheimer's disease represents an important problem for our societies, both in social and economical dimensions. Built in July 1997, the day care center of Liege aims at practicing strategic cognitive interventions in early Alzheimer patients or when pathological memory impairments occur. By means of an interdisciplinary work (by neuropsychologists and occupational therapists), the ultimate goal of the interventions is to facilitate the patient's autonomy in activities of daily living. Because of the variability of clinical symptoms of the disease, the goal of these cognitive interventions is to optimize the performance of each patient by making the most of its preserved abilities. Moreover, another goal of the day care center is also to support the caregivers, by giving them advices in order to adequately face with difficulties presented by the patient.
