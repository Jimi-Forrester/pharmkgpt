38823198|a|BACKGROUND: There are currently many imaging indicators for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). However, their diagnostic performance has not been well compared, especially in differentiating iNPH from Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these imaging indicators in differentiating iNPH from AD. METHODS: We retrospectively collected patients with iNPH from the West China Hospital between June 2016 and December 2023. Age-sex-matched patients with AD and healthy controls (HCs) are included as controls (ChiCTR2300070078, March 2023). Twelve imaging indicators were evaluated on MRI, including disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH), Evans' index (EI), callosal angle, z-EI, temporal horn, dilated Sylvian fissure, focal sulcal dilation, tight high convexity, deep white matter hyperintensities, periventricular hyperintensities, DESH scale, and Simplified Radscale. We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curves and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients with iNPH (mean age: 73.1 +- 6.5; 35 males), 46 patients with AD (mean age: 73.0 +- 6.6; 35 males), and 46 HCs (mean age: 73.0 +- 5.9; 35 males) were included. The largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was found in EI (0.93; 95 % CI: 0.89-0.98) and z-EI (0.93; 95 % CI: 0.87-0.98). DESH scale >= 6 had the highest specificity (93 %, 43/46). CONCLUSION: EI and z-EI had the best diagnostic performance in differentiating iNPH from AD. The DESH scale could assist in diagnosing iNPH due to its high specificity.
