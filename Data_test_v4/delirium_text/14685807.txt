14685807|a|While the molecular basis underlying the non-classical actions of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is presently unknown, a candidate peptide sequence located at the C-terminus of AChE (AChE-peptide) has recently been identified. This study explored the bioactivity of synthetic AChE-peptide using in vitro organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus. Neurotrophic effects, detected as increased neurite outgrowth from MAP-immunopositive neurones, were apparent using 1 h exposure to 1-10 nM AChE-peptide. As exposure time increased, cell death occurred as indicated by TdT-mediated dUTP biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL). This process was accelerated at higher AChE-peptide concentrations, with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux observed following prolonged exposure to 1-10 microM AChE-peptide. Apoptotic cells were detected by Hoechst 33342 staining following 24 h application of 10 nM AChE-peptide. However, propidium iodide reactivity revealed a simultaneous loss of membrane integrity indicative of necrosis, suggesting that AChE-peptide induces cell death via a continuum of apoptotic and necrotic processes. Prolonged exposure to AChE-peptide also resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in neurite outgrowth from MAP2-positive neurons, although immunohistochemical studies provided some evidence of differential responsiveness in GABAergic, cholinergic and somatostatin neurones. In addition, bioactivity was sequence specific since a scrambled AChE-peptide analogue, as well as the corresponding BuChE-peptide, was ineffective. In conclusion, the bioactivity associated with the AChE-peptide sequence may account for the non-cholinergic actions of AChE, whilst its neurotrophic-apoptotic-necrotic spectrum of action may be involved in the aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
