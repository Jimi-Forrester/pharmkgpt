21840361|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in United States afflicting >5 million Americans. This number is estimated to triple by the middle of the century if effective treatments are not discovered. Current therapy for AD is mainly symptomatic. Effective disease-modifying treatments are needed that would eliminate the cause rather than the symptoms of the disease. Polymerization of monomeric beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) into dimers, soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils is considered the prime causative factor in triggering AD pathogenesis. Based on these facts, removal/reduction of Abeta has gained importance as a primary therapeutic target in treating the cause of the disease. In that regard, passive immunotherapy with direct delivery of anti-Abeta antibodies to the brain has shown great promise, but awaits the challenge of overcoming greater influx of anti-Abeta antibody into the brain. This investigation was undertaken to maximize direct delivery of immunotherapeutics to the brain by using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as a novel axonal transporter-carrier to be conjugated with anti-Abeta antibody (6E10) raised against EFRHDS 3-8 amino acid (aa) epitopes of Abeta known to react with 1-16 aa residues of mono-/di-/oligomeric Abeta. This is the first report showing the use of WGA as an efficient axonal transporter carrier that not only enhanced the influx of anti-Abeta antibody directly into the brain but also resulted in greater reduction of cerebral Abeta compared to the unconjugated anti-Abeta antibody delivered intranasally in Alzheimer's 5XFAD model.
