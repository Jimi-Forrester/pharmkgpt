38382892|t|Characterization, multivariate analysis and bioactivity evaluation of coumarins in the bark of Fraxinus mandshurica.
38382892|a|The bark of Fraxinus mandshurica is a traditional folk herb used to clear heat and dry dampness. To investigate the differences in coumarins content in the bark of F. mandshurica, 24 batches of samples from four origins were collected and analyzed. Eight coumarins were obtained by traditional natural product extraction, isolation and identification techniques and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC-DAD). The quantitative results showed that the overall content of compound 30 (Fraxinol) was higher at 100.23 mg/g, while the overall content of compound 23 (Cichoriin) was lower, which may be related to environmental factors in different regions. The method validation showed that the linear range of the eight standards was between 10 and 2500 mug/mL with correlation coefficient (R2) values >0.9991; the relative standard deviation (RSD, %) values of intra-day precision were between 0.35 and 1.38, while the RSD values of inter-day precision were between 0. 29-1.78; the RSD (%) values for the reproducibility experiments ranged from 0.29 to 1.87, while the RSD (%) values for the stability experiments ranged from 0.22 to 2.33; the spiked recovery of the samples ranged from 98.65 to 101.34%, and the RSD (%) values ranged from 0.22 to 1.96. The method validation results showed that the instrument used for the analysis had good precision, the reproducibility and stability of the samples were good, and the accuracy of the experimental method was high. In addition, a total of 54 chemical components were identified from F. mandshurica bark by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS). Based on this, fingerprinting, heatmap and multivariate analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were established for 24 batches of samples, and four marker compounds that could be used to distinguish different origins of F. mandshurica were screened. To further investigate the bioactivities of the eight coumarins, in vitro enzyme activity inhibition studies were performed, and the results showed that they all exhibited different degrees of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, tyrosinase and alpha-glucosidase, thus having potential applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, blemish whitening and anti-diabetes, and becoming a new source of natural enzyme activity inhibitors. This study established an identification and evaluation method applicable to plants of different origins, which provides a strong reference for quality control, origin evaluation and clinical application of traditional medicinal plants.
