37856216|t|GPR84-mediated signal transduction effects metabolic function by promoting brown adipocyte activity.
37856216|a|The G protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a medium-chain fatty acid receptor, has garnered attention because of its potential involvement in a range of metabolic conditions. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Our study has shed light on the pivotal role of GPR84, revealing its robust expression and functional significance within the brown adipose tissue (BAT). Mice lacking GPR84 exhibited increased lipid accumulation in BAT, rendering them more susceptible to cold exposure, and displaying reduced BAT activity compared to their wild-type counterparts. Our in vitro experiments with primary brown adipocytes from GPR84 knockout mice revealed diminished expression of thermogenic genes and reduced O2 consumption. Furthermore, the application of the GPR84 agonist 6-OAU counteracted these effects, effectively reinstating the brown adipocyte activity. These compelling in vivo and in vitro findings converge to highlight mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary cause of BAT anomalies in GPR84 knockout mice. The activation of GPR84 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, which intricately influences mitochondrial respiration. By modulating mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and respiration, GPR84 has emerged as a potent molecule involved in BAT activity. These findings suggested that GPR84 is a potential therapeutic target for invigorating BAT and ameliorating metabolic disorders.
