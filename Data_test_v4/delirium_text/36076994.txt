36076994|a|(1) The neurotrophic protein S100B is a marker of brain injury and has been associated with neuroregeneration. In S100Btg mice rendering 12 copies of the murine S100B gene we evaluated whether S100B may serve as a treatment option. (2) In juvenile, adult, and one-year-old S100Btg mice (female and male; n = 8 per group), progenitor cell proliferation was quantified in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and the granular cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus with the proliferative marker Ki67 and BrdU (50 mg/kg). Concomitant signaling was quantified utilizing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) immunohistochemistry. (3) Progenitor cell proliferation in the SGZ and migration to the GCL was enhanced. Hippocampal GFAP was reduced in one-year-old S100Btg mice. ApoE in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of male and BDNF in the frontal cortex of female S100Btg mice was reduced. RAGE was not affected. (4) Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in S100Btg mice was not accompanied by reactive astrogliosis. Sex- and brain region-specific variations of ApoE and BDNF require further elucidations. Our data reinforce the importance of this S100Btg model in evaluating the role of S100B in neuroregenerative medicine.
