35664932|t|Views of Care at End of Life: A Secondary Analysis of Online Feedback Using Care Opinion.
35664932|a|Although there are studies on the use of social media and palliative and end-of-life care (PEOLC), there are no studies specifically investigating the content of online public feedback about PEOLC services. This study sought to understand experiences of end-of-life care provided in hospitals in the West of Scotland by exploring the main themes within the content of stories posted on a nationally endorsed nonprofit feedback online platform, Care Opinion, within a 2-year period. We used "Appreciative Inquiry" as a theoretical framework for this study to determine what works well in end-of-life care, while also identifying areas for further improvement. Of the 1428 stories published on "Care Opinion" from March 2019 to 2021 regarding hospitals in the West of Scotland, 48 (3.36%) were related to end-of-life care, of which all were included in data analysis. Using the software package NVivo and thematic analysis, we identified 4 key themes. We found that people overwhelmingly posted positive feedback about their experiences with end-of-life care. People reported positively about staff professionalism in providing compassionate and person-centered care to meet their loved ones needs at end of life. Other experiences of care related to challenges facing healthcare services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quality appraisal of staff responses highlighted areas for improving feedback. This study can add to the aim of improving staff response to people's concerns about end-of-life care. This study has provided a novel perspective of patients' experiences of end-of-life care in hospitals in the West of Scotland. Novel insights were the appreciation of quality of care, staff professionalism, effective communication, and meeting patient's needs at end-of-life particularly by nursing staff.
