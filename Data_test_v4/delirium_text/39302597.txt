39302597|a|Population aging is a global reality driven by increased life expectancy. This demographic phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the epidemic of cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, posing challenges for elderly and their families. In this context, the search for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize cognitive impairments becomes urgent, as these deficits are primarily associated with oxidative damage and increased neuroinflammation. Ferulic acid (FA), a natural and potent antioxidant compound, is proposed to be nanoencapsulated to target the central nervous system effectively with lower doses and an extended duration of action. Here, we evaluated the effects of the nanoencapsulated FA on d-galactose (d-Gal)- induced memory impairments. Male Wistar adult rats were treated with ferulic acid-loaded nanocapsules (FA-Nc) or non-encapsulated ferulic acid (D-FA) for 8 weeks concurrently with d-Gal (150 mg/kg s.c.) injection. As expected, our findings showed that d-Gal injection impaired memory processes and increased anxiety behavior, whereas FA-Nc treatment ameliorated these behavioral impairments associated with the aging process induced by d-Gal. At the molecular level, nanoencapsulated ferulic acid (FA-Nc) ameliorated the decrease in ACh and glutamate induced by d-galactose (d-Gal), and also increased GABA levels in the dorsal hippocampus, indicating its therapeutic superiority. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying our current promising outcomes. Nanoscience applied to pharmacology can reduce drug dosage, thereby minimizing adverse effects while enhancing therapeutic response, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. Therefore, the strategy of brain-targeted drug delivery through nanoencapsulation can be effective in mitigating aging-related factors that may lead to cognitive deficits.
