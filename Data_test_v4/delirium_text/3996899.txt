3996899|t|Delirium and other organic mental disorders in a general hospital.
3996899|a|The authors analyze 133 cases of organic mental disorders (OMDs) from a total of 771 patients who were referred for psychiatric consultation from a general hospital. The cases represent a 2-year referral period which began July 1, 1980, when DSM-III criteria were instituted. Delirium and dementia are most commonly diagnosed and features of these, particularly in the geriatric population, are described. Delirium was more frequent in patients with multiple medical problems, was an indicator of poor prognosis having the highest mortality rate, and was usually undiagnosed by the referring physician.
