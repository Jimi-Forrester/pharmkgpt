12536572|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of serum apolipoprotein (apo) A I, B100 and E levels and apo E polymorphism to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple infarction dementia (MID) in Chinese population. METHODS: The apoE phenotypes were assayed by isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting, and apolipoproteins were determined by radial immunodiffusion assay in 75 patients with AD, 36 patients with MID and 60 control subjects. RESULTS: The frequency of apo E4 allele (epsilon 4) was significantly higher and the frequency of epsilon 2 allele was lower in AD group, compared with those in the control group (0.2333 vs 0.0666, 0.0467 vs 0.0833, P < 0.05). The frequency of epsilon 4 allele in MID group was also higher than that in the control group (0.2083 vs 0.0666, P < 0.05). The fasting serum apoA 1 and E levels in AD and MID groups were remarkably lower than those in the control group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Apo E4 allele epsilon 4 was associated with AD and MID. ApoE4 might be a risk factor for AD and MID, and apo E2 might be a protective factor for AD. The serum apo A I and apoE levels were significantly decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple infarction dementia.
