39103771|a|BACKGROUND: Status epilepticus is a common and potentially life-threatening neurological emergency with a high risk for cognitive and neurobiological impairment. Our aim was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of centrally administered irisin and acute exhausting exercise against oxidative brain injury and memory dysfunction due to a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced single seizure. Male Sprague Dawley rats with intracerebroventricular (icv) cannulas were randomly divided into intraperitoneally (ip) saline-injected control and PTZ-injected (45 mg/kg) seizure groups. Both the control and PTZ groups were then treated with irisin (7.5 microg/kg, 2 microl, icv), saline (2 microl, icv) or were forced to an acute bout of strenuous exercise before the ip injection of saline (control) or PTZ. Seizures were evaluated using the Racine score. To evaluate memory performance, a passive avoidance test was performed before and after PTZ injection. Following euthanasia at the 24th hour of seizure induction, brain tissues were removed for histopathological examination and for evaluating oxidative damage, antioxidant capacity, and neurotransmitter levels. RESULTS: Glutamate/GABA imbalance observed in PTZ rats was corrected by irisin administration (p < 0.001/p < 0.01), while irisin prevented the generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation (p < 0.05 - 0.001) and replenished the antioxidant catalase and glutathione levels (p < 0.01-0.01) in the cerebral tissue, and reduced the histologically evident neuronal injury due to a single seizure (p < 0.05 - 0.01). Irisin also delayed the onset of seizures (p < 0.05) and improved memory dysfunction (p < 0.05), but did not affect the severity of seizures. The acute exhaustive swimming exercise completed before PTZ-seizure depressed glutamate level (p < 0.001), maintained the oxidant/antioxidant balance, alleviated neuronal injury (p < 0.05 - 0.01) and upregulated cerebral BDNF expression (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, acute high-intensity exercise or exogenously administered irisin provides neuroprotection by maintaining the balance of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters and oxidant/antioxidant systems.
