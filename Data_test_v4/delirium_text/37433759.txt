37433759|a|The naturally inspired multitarget-directed ligands (PC01-PC10 and PD01-PD26) were synthesized from piperine for the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The compound PD07 showed significant inhibitory activity on ChEs, BACE1, and Abeta1-42 aggregation in in vitro studies. Further, compound PD07 effectively displaced the propidium iodide at the AChE PAS site. The compound PD07 exhibited significant lipophilicity in PAMPA studies. Additionally, PD07 demonstrated neuroprotective properties in the Abeta1-42 induced SH-SY5Y cell line. Furthermore, DFT calculations were performed using B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) basis sets to explore the PD07 physical and chemical properties. The compound PD07 showed a similar binding interaction profile at active sites of AChE, BuChE, and BACE1 proteins as compared to reference ligands (donepezil, tacrine, and BSD) in molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies. In acute oral toxicity studies, compound PD07 exhibited no toxicity symptoms up to 300 mg/kg, po. The compound PD07 (10 mg/kg, po) improved memory and cognition in scopolamine-induced amnesia rats. Further, PD07 increased ACh levels in the brain by inhibiting the AChE activity. The results from in vitro, in silico, and in vivo studies suggested that compound PD07 is a potent multitarget-directed lead from piperine to overcome Alzheimer's disease.
