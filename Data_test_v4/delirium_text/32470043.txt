32470043|a|Morroniside is a biologically active polyphenol found in Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc (CO) that exhibits a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, such as protecting nerves, and preventing diabetic liver damage and renal damage. However, little data are available regarding the mechanism of its intestinal absorption. Here, an in vitro human intestinal epithelial cell model of cultured Caco-2 cells was applied to study the absorption and transport of morroniside. The effects of donor concentration, pH and inhibitors were investigated. The bidirectional permeability of morroniside from the apical (AP) to the basolateral (BL) side and in the reverse direction was studied. When administered at three tested concentrations (5, 25 and 100 muM), the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values in the AP-to-BL direction ranged from 1.59 x 10-6 to 2.66 x 10-6 cm/s. In the reverse direction, BL-to-AP, the value was ranged from 2.67 x 10-6 to 4.10 x 10-6 cm/s. The data indicated that morroniside transport was pH-dependent. The permeability of morroniside was affected by treatment with various inhibitors, such as multidrug resistance protein inhibitors MK571 and indomethacin, as well as the breast cancer resistance protein inhibitor apigenin. The mechanisms of the intestinal absorption of morroniside may involve multiple transport pathways, such as the passive diffusion and efflux protein-mediated active transport especially involving multidrug resistance protein 2 and breast cancer resistance protein. After the addition of CO, the Papp values in the AP-to-BL direction increased significantly, therefore, it can be assumed that some ingredients in the CO promote morroniside absorption in the small intestine.
