33650764|t|Changes in local brain function in mild cognitive impairment due to semantic dementia.
33650764|a|AIMS: Mild cognitive impairment due to semantic dementia represents the preclinical stage, involving cognitive decline dominated by semantic impairment below the semantic dementia standard. Therefore, studying mild cognitive impairment due to semantic dementia may identify changes in patients before progression to dementia. However, whether changes in local functional activity occur in preclinical stages of semantic dementia remains unknown. Here, we explored local functional changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to semantic dementia using resting-state functional MRI. METHODS: We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to twenty-two patients with mild cognitive impairment due to semantic dementia (MCI-SD group) and nineteen healthy controls (HC group). We performed structural MRI to compare gray matter volumes, and resting-state functional MRI with multiple sub-bands and indicators to evaluate functional activity. RESULTS: Neuropsychological tests revealed a significant decline in semantic performance in the MCI-SD group, but no decline in other cognitive domains. Resting-state functional MRI revealed local functional changes in multiple brain regions in the MCI-SD group, distributed in different sub-bands and indicators. In the normal band, local functional changes were only in the gray matter atrophic area. In the other sub-bands, more regions with local functional changes outside atrophic areas were found across various indicators. Among these, the degree centrality of the left precuneus in the MCI-SD group was positively correlated with general semantic tasks (oral sound naming, word-picture verification). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed local functional changes in mild cognitive impairment due to semantic dementia, some of which were located outside the atrophic gray matter. Driven by functional connectivity changes, the left precuneus might play a role in preclinical semantic dementia. The study proved the value of frequency-dependent sub-bands, especially the slow-2 and slow-3 sub-bands.
