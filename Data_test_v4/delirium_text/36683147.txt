36683147|a|Peripheral beta-amyloid (Abeta), including those contained in the gut, may contribute to the formation of Abeta plaques in the brain, and gut microbiota appears to exert an impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) via the gut-brain axis, although detailed mechanisms are not clearly defined. The current study focused on uncovering the potential interactions among gut-derived Abeta in aging, gut microbiota, and AD pathogenesis. To achieve this goal, the expression levels of Abeta and several key proteins involved in Abeta metabolism were initially assessed in mouse gut, with key results confirmed in human tissue. The results demonstrated that a high level of Abeta was detected throughout the gut in both mice and human, and gut Abeta42 increased with age in wild type and mutant amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice. Next, the gut microbiome of mice was characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing, and we found the gut microbiome altered significantly in aged APP/PS1 mice and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of aged APP/PS1 mice increased gut BACE1 and Abeta42 levels. Intra-intestinal injection of isotope or fluorescence labeled Abeta combined with vagotomy was also performed to investigate the transmission of Abeta from gut to brain. The data showed that, in aged mice, the gut Abeta42 was transported to the brain mainly via blood rather than the vagal nerve. Furthermore, FMT of APP/PS1 mice induced neuroinflammation, a phenotype that mimics early AD pathology. Taken together, this study suggests that the gut is likely a critical source of Abeta in the brain, and gut microbiota can further upregulate gut Abeta production, thereby potentially contributing to AD pathogenesis.
