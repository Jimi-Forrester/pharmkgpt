34150574|t|Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion Versus Morphine Infusion During Abdominoplasty to Change the Postoperative Pain Profile.
34150574|a|BACKGROUND: With the increased number of abdominoplasty all over the world, and the need to manage postoperative pain, it is a must to find proper and effective drugs to decrease opioid consumption in the postoperative period. OBJECTIVES: In this double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, we assumed that low-dose ketamine infusion will reduce the postoperative pain profile than the conventional method of morphine. METHODS: The scheduled patients for abdominoplasty under general anesthesia were recruited in two groups: group (K) with low-dose ketamine infusion intra-operatively (80 patients) and group (M) with morphine infusion intra-operatively (80 patients). Both groups were monitored intraoperatively and postoperatively for rescue doses of fentanyl, visual analogue scale (VAS), and side effects. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between both groups regarding the fentanyl rescue doses intra- and postoperative with no remarkable side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine has a useful analgesic effect in abdominoplasty similar to morphine without remarkable side effects, such as sedation or hallucinations.
