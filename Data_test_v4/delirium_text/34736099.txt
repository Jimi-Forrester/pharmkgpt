34736099|t|Acoustofluidic multimodal diagnostic system for Alzheimer's disease.
34736099|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder that affects tens of millions of older adults worldwide and has significant economic and societal impacts. Despite its prevalence and severity, early diagnosis of AD remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an integrated acoustofluidics-based diagnostic system (ADx), which combines triple functions of acoustics, microfluidics, and orthogonal biosensors for clinically accurate, sensitive, and rapid detection of AD biomarkers from human plasma. We design and fabricate a surface acoustic wave-based acoustofluidic separation device to isolate and purify AD biomarkers to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Multimodal biosensors within the integrated ADx are fabricated by in-situ patterning of the ZnO nanorod array and deposition of Ag nanoparticles onto the ZnO nanorods for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and electrochemical immunosensors. We obtain the label-free detections of SERS and electrochemical immunoassay of clinical plasma samples from AD patients and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. We believe that this efficient integration provides promising solutions for the early diagnosis of AD.
