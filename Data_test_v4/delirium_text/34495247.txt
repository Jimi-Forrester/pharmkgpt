34495247|t|Efficacy and safety of tolperisone versus baclofen among Chinese patients with spasticity associated with spinal cord injury: a non-randomized retrospective study.
34495247|a|There are many medications available to treat spasticity, but the tolerability of medications is the main issue for choosing the best treatment. The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of tolperisone compared to baclofen among patients with spasticity associated with spinal cord injury. Patients received baclofen plus physical therapy (BAF+PT, n=135) or tolperisone plus physical therapy (TOL+PT, n=116), or physical therapy alone (PT, n=180). The modified Ashworth scale score, the modified Medical Research Council score, the Barthel Index score, and the Disability Assessment scale score were improved (P<0.05 for all) in all the patients at the end of 6 weeks compared to before interventions. After 6 weeks, the overall coefficient of efficacy of the intervention(s) in the BAF+PT, TOL+PT, and PT groups were 1.15, 0.45, and 0.05, respectively. The patients of the BAF+PT group reported asthenia, drowsiness, and sleepiness and those of the TOL+PT group reported dyspepsia and epigastric pain as adverse effects. When comparing drug interventions to physical therapy alone, both baclofen plus physical therapy and tolperisone plus physical therapy played a significant role in the improvement of daily activities of patients. Nonetheless, baclofen plus physical therapy was tentatively effective. Tolperisone plus physical therapy was slightly effective. In addition, baclofen caused adverse effects related to the sedative manifestation (Level of Evidence: III; Technical Efficacy Stage: 4).
