33249783|a|We examined if plasma phosphorylated tau is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated 372 cognitively unimpaired participants, 554 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 141 Alzheimer's disease dementia patients. Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, regional cortical thickness (using magnetic resonance imaging) and hypometabolism (using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) were measured longitudinally. High plasma tau was associated with hypometabolism and cortical atrophy at baseline and over time, and longitudinally increased tau was associated with accelerated atrophy, but these associations were only observed in Abeta-positive participants. Plasma phosphorylated tau may identify and track processes linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
