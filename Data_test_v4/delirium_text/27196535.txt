27196535|t|Optimizing Effect Sizes With Imaging Enrichment and Outcome Choices for Mild Alzheimer Disease Clinical Trials.
27196535|a|Recent clinical trials in mild Alzheimer disease (AD) have enriched for amyloid-specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and used extended versions of the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) in an effort to increase the sensitivity to detect treatment effects. We used data from mild AD participants in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative to model trial effect sizes for 12- and 24-month trials using 3 versions of the ADAS-Cog and increased standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) cutoffs for amyloid imaging inclusion criteria. For 12-month trials, extended ADAS-Cog versions improved effect sizes. The ADAS-Cog11 elicited larger effect sizes when enriching for SUVR 1.1 only, whereas the ADAS-Cog12 and ADAS-Cog13 were associated with larger effect sizes with higher SUVR thresholds. For 24-month trials, extended ADAS-Cog versions increased effect sizes for trials not enriched for amyloid and trials enriched for SUVR 1.1. Only enriching for higher SUVR thresholds (1.3 and 1.4, not 1.1) increased trial power. We conclude that extended versions of the ADAS-Cog improve mild AD trial effect sizes for both 12- and 24-month long studies, whereas amyloid imaging criteria may be most valuable for 12-month trials.
