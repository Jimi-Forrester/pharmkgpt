35288619|a|Cutaneous angiosarcomas is a rare cancer with poor prognoses. The common radiotherapy techniques that have been reported so far are two pairs of lateral X-ray and electron fields. However, it is quite difficult to irradiate scalp angiosarcomas (SAs) homogeneously with this technique. In this study, safety, effectiveness, and risk factors were assessed for localized SAs >= 5 cm treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with boluses. Sixty-eight angiosarcoma patients who had received radiotherapy in our institution between January 2007 and November 2020 were retrieved from our radiotherapy database. Of these patients, 27 localized SA patients were included in the retrospective analysis. The 2-year overall survival, local progression-free rate, and distant metastases-free survival were 41.8%, 48.4%, and 33.1%. All the patients experienced acute radiation dermatitis >= grade 2, with18 (66.7%) >= grade 3. No nodule lesion was a significant unfavorable predictive factor of acute radiation dermatitis >= grade 3. Tumor bleeding at the initiation of radiotherapy and tumor invasion to the face were significant predictive factors of overall survival, and tumor bleeding at the initiation of radiotherapy was also a significant predictive factor of local progression-free rate.
