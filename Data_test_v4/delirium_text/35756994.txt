35756994|t|VAP Proteins - From Organelle Tethers to Pathogenic Host Interactors and Their Role in Neuronal Disease.
35756994|a|Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated proteins (VAPs) are ubiquitous ER-resident tail-anchored membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. Their N-terminal major sperm protein (MSP) domain faces the cytosol and allows them to interact with a wide variety of cellular proteins. Therefore, VAP proteins are vital to many cellular processes, including organelle membrane tethering, lipid transfer, autophagy, ion homeostasis and viral defence. Here, we provide a timely overview of the increasing number of VAPA/B binding partners and discuss the role of VAPA/B in maintaining organelle-ER interactions and cooperation. Furthermore, we address how viruses and intracellular bacteria hijack VAPs and their binding partners to induce interactions between the host ER and pathogen-containing compartments and support pathogen replication. Finally, we focus on the role of VAP in human disease and discuss how mutated VAPB leads to the disruption of cellular homeostasis and causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
