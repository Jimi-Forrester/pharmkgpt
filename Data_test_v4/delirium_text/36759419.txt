36759419|t|One-Year Survival of Ischemic Stroke Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation.
36759419|a|BACKGROUND: The outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke who require mechanical ventilation has been poor. Intubation due to a reversible condition could be associated with better 1-year survival. METHODS: All adult patients treated in Helsinki University Hospital in 2016-2020 who were admitted because of an ischemic stroke (either stroke or thrombosis seen on imaging) and needed mechanical ventilation were included in this retrospective cohort study. Data on demographics, medical history, index stroke, and indication for intubation were collected. The primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months and living arrangements at 1 year. RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort (N = 121) was 66 +- 11 (mean +- SD) years, and the mean admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17 +- 10. Forty-four (36%) patients were male. The most common indication for intubation was unconsciousness (51%), followed by respiratory failure or airway compromise (28%). One-year mortality was 55%. Three-month mRS scores were available for 114 (94%) patients, with the following distribution: 0-2, 18%; 3-5, 28%; and 6 (dead), 54%. Of the 1-year survivors, 72% were living at home. In the multivariate analysis, only age over 75 years and intubation due to unconsciousness, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest remained significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The indication for intubation seems to significantly affect outcome. Functional outcome at 3 months is often poor, but a great majority of 1-year survivors are able to live at home.
