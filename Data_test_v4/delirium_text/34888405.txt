34888405|t|Factors Associated for Mortality of Older People With COVID 19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
34888405|a|BACKGROUND: Whilst people of all ages are affected in some way by COVID-19 virus, older people are at a high mortality risk. This study aimed to systematically review the numerous factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 infected older people. METHOD: PubMed and Science Direct were searched from inception to the April 15, 2021. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement and Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Of the 4957 studies identified, 20 were included in the qualitative analysis, while 10 were included in the quantitative analysis. Male sex (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.23-3.99), age (over 75 years old) (OR = 3.36, 95% CI = 2.30-4.90), Dementia (OR = 3.69, 95% CI = 1.99-6.83) and Dyspnoea (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 2.61-3.82), were found to be significantly associated with mortality. There is no significant association between Diabetes, or Hypertension. CONCLUSION: Older age, male gender, dyspnoea and dementia were associated with a greater risk of death of older people from COVID-19 infection. These findings may help health care professionals to identify high-risk groups, facilitate appropriate remedial measures, and control mortality among older people.
