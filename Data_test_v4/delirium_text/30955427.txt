30955427|t|Subacute Encephalopathy With Seizures in Alcoholics Syndrome: A Subtype of Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus.
30955427|a|A recent assessment of the classification of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) has incorporated the specific electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns on a syndromic basis. Such a clinical EEG syndromic approach may enable more accurate and expedited diagnosis of particular subtypes of NCSE so as to improve therapy. Herein, we review the characteristics of subacute encephalopathy with seizures in alcoholics syndrome, a subtype of focal NCSE occurring in chronic alcoholism with specific features, including encephalopathy, lateralized periodic discharges on the EEG, chronic microvascular ischemia on neuroimaging studies, and possible recurrence when chronic antiseizure treatment is stopped.
