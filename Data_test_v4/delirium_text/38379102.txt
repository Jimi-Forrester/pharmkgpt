38379102|a|Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusion is a classic driver mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, ALK double-fusion variants in NSCLC have rarely been reported. In this study, we reported a case with extremely uncommon ALK double-fusion variants. A 32-year-old female diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, who had developed multiple intrapulmonary and brain metastases, experienced worsening of her condition despite undergoing prior chemotherapy. Subsequent testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected the presence of PLEKHA7-ALK and INPP5D-ALK double-fusion. The prescription of alectinib revealed potent efficacy and resulted in an increase in the survival rate. This case presented two uncommon and concomitant ALK fusion partners in NSCLC; more importantly, the INPP5D-ALK subtype has not been reported, therefore this study broadens the spectrum of ALK double-fusion variants and provides insight into the use of ALK inhibitors for the treatment of NSCLC in patients with double ALK fusions.
