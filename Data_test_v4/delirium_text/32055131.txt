32055131|t|Sjogren's Syndrome with Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: A Case Report and Literature Review.
32055131|a|Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a cerebrovascular disease that is caused by a number of factors, including hypercoagulability and vessel wall damage. Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocyte infiltration of the exocrine glands. CVST could be caused by autoimmune diseases. According to previous reports, the most frequently reported autoimmune diseases which could cause CVST are systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. Reports of SS leading to CVST are scarce. Here, we present a case of a 51-year-old woman who was diagnosed with SS-induced CVST. We tease out knowledge about the pathogenesis, feature of clinic symptom, treatment, and prognosis of SS-associated CVST, and illustrates how a detailed patient history can contribute to an accurate diagnosis.
