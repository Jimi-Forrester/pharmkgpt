29710700|a|Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angioneurin involved in the regulation of vascular and neural functions relevant for the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the influence of AD severity and ApoE4 status on circulating VEGF and its relationship with cognition has not been investigated. We assessed serum VEGF levels and cognitive performance in AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and control subjects. VEGF levels were higher in AD patients than in MCI cases and controls (p < 0.05) and showed a progressive increase with clinical severity in the whole study population (p < 0.01). Among AD patients, severity-related VEGF elevations were significant in ApoE4 carriers (p < 0.05), but not in non-carriers. Increased VEGF levels were associated with disease severity and showed mild correlations with cognitive impairment that were only consistent for the ADAS-cog+ items remembering test instructions (memory) and maze task (executive functions) in the group of AD patients (p < 0.05). On the other hand, higher VEGF values were related to better memory and language performance in ApoE4 carriers with moderately-severe AD. According to these results showing severity- and ApoE4-related differences in serum VEGF and its cognitive correlates, it is suggested that increases in VEGF levels might represent an endogenous response driven by pathological factors and could entail cognitive benefits in AD patients, particularly in ApoE4 carriers. Our findings support the notion that VEGF constitutes a relevant molecular target to be further explored in AD pathology and therapy.
