34233323|t|Fever as a Side Effect after Electroconvulsive Therapy.
34233323|a|BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most important and safe nonpharmacological treatment for psychiatric disorders. Some patients experience unexplained fever after ECT, but only a few studies have reported on this. METHOD: We investigated fever after ECT by retrospectively reviewing the medical records of patients. Patients treated at the ECT unit of the Department of Psychiatry at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea, between 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2019, were included. Differences in variables were compared between groups with or without fever after ECT sessions. RESULT: There were 28 patients (8.8%) in the fever group. Forty-three ECT sessions (1.5%) resulted in fever after treatment. The female-to-male ratio was higher in the fever group than in the control group, and the mean number of total ECT sessions was also higher in the fever group than in the control group, but there were no other differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Comparing fever and control sessions, fever sessions relatively preceded control sessions and had a longer seizure duration. Postictal delirium occurred more often in the fever sessions than in control sessions. Fever sessions had a higher white blood cell count and lower concomitant quetiapine dosage than control sessions. Because 8.8% of patients who received ECT experienced fever after treatment more than once, fever after ECT is considered to be a common side effect.
