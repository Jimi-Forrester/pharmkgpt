35315078|a|PURPOSE: The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the Alzheimer's blanket activity program (ABAP) on the behavioral symptoms, activities of daily living, and quality of life of people with Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN AND METHOD: The study was conducted between November 2019 and February 2020 in the homes of the participants with Alzheimer's disease with a single group pre- post-test design. As part of the ABAP, the researchers made two home visits, conducted telephone interviews, and provided counseling services during the 3-month follow-up process. FINDINGS: It was found that after the program, the people with Alzheimer's disease had improved daily life activity, quality of life, and neuropsychiatric symptom scores; however, the change was not statistically significant. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future studies involving longer intervention and follow-up using the ABAP may help assess the long-term effects of the program.
