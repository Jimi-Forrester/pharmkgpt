39497271|t|New horizons in hospital-associated deconditioning: a global condition of body and mind.
39497271|a|Hospital-associated deconditioning is a broad term, which refers non-specifically to declines in any function of the body secondary to hospitalisation. Older people, particularly those living with frailty, are known to be at greatest risk. It has historically been most commonly used as a term to describe declines in muscle mass and function (i.e. acute sarcopenia). However, declines in physical function do not occur in isolation, and it is recognised that cognitive deconditioning (defined by delayed mental processing as part of a spectrum with fulminant delirium at one end) is commonly encountered by patients in hospital. Whilst the term 'deconditioning' is descriptive, it perhaps leads to under-emphasis on the inherent organ dysfunction that is associated, and also implies some ease of reversibility. Whilst deconditioning may be reversible with early intervention strategies, the long-term effects can be devastating. In this article, we summarise the most recent research on this topic including new promising interventions and describe our recommendations for implementation of tools such as the Frailty Care Bundle.
