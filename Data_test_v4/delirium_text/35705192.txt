35705192|a|BACKGROUND: As a type 1 transmembrane protein, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is responsible for the cleavage of a variety of cell surface molecules and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. It has been suggested that systemic ADAM10 concentration may potentially be used as a prognostic biomarker. Since high glucose can upregulate ADAM10 expression in vitro, we investigated whether serum levels of ADAM10 and its substrate, the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1), can be influenced by type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 1091 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 358 age-matched healthy control subjects were recruited. Serum concentrations of ADAM10 and the soluble form of LOX-1 (sLOX-1) released by cleavage of LOX-1 by ADAM were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (ELISA). RESULTS: Serum ADAM10 was increased in subjects with diabetes compared with control (40.5 ng/mL [22.3-65.7] vs 10.3 ng/mL [7.0-17.9], respectively; P < .01); the highest levels were seen in insulin-treated subjects. On multiple linear regression analysis, glycosylated hemoglobin, age, body mass index, and insulin use were independent determinants of ADAM10 level. The increase in serum ADAM10 levels in diabetes was accompanied by changes in serum sLOX-1. Subjects with diabetes had higher serum sLOX-1 than the control (110 pg/mL [89-153] vs 104 pg/mL [85-138], respectively; P < .01), and there was a significant correlation between serum ADAM10 and sLOX-1 (r = 0.26, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentration of ADAM10 is increased in type 2 diabetes and is associated with glycemia and insulin therapy, which may potentially affect the specificity of systemic ADAM10 level as a biomarker.
