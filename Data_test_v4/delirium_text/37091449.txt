37091449|a|Background and Aims: Acute pain management in drug addicts is a critical yet understudied topic. Drug addicts have a decreased pain threshold, impairing anaesthetic pain control. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative quality of recovery in addicts and non-addicts after receiving erector spinae plane block (ESPB) with general anaesthesia. Methods: Sixty males, aged 18-60 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I/II, scheduled for elective lumbar decompression surgery, were divided into two equal groups. Group A included 30 addicts and group N included 30 non-addicts. Both groups received bilateral ultrasound-guided ESPB with 20 mL bupivacaine (0.25%) before induction of general anaesthesia. The primary outcome was comparison of the 24-hour postoperative quality of recovery (QoR-15) score. The secondary outcomes were time to first analgesic requirement, postoperative pain scores, morphine consumption, and adverse events. Results: The QoR-15 score was higher in group N (median = 128.5, interquartile range = 107-136) than in group A (118 [99-130]), indicating a better recovery in group N. The visual analogue scale pain score was lower in group N than in group A, especially in the first 12 hours postoperatively. Time to first analgesic request was significantly longer in group N than in group A (mean +- standard deviation: 8.67 +- 2.74 and 5.53 +- 1.64 hours, respectively, P =0.001), Morphine consumption was significantly higher in group A than in group N (9.62 +- 3.2 and 7.08 +- 2.57 mg, respectively, P =0.041). Conclusion: Drug addicts experienced decreased analgesic efficacy of ESPB compared to non-addicts, with comparable postoperative QoR-15 score following lumbar decompression surgery.
