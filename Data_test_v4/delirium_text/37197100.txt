37197100|t|A Rare Case of Postoperative Encephalopathy in Twin.
37197100|a|The clinical picture of encephalopathy invites a broad differential with multiple etiologies. It is with judicious history, hospital course, lab testing, and imaging that the ultimate cause is identified. We present a unique case of identical twins who share a similar clinical presentation of postoperative encephalopathy. The striking similarities in both twins suggest a genetic component requiring further research to identify patients who are genetically predisposed.
