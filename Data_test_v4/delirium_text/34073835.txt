34073835|t|Texture-Modified Diets, Nutritional Status and Mealtime Satisfaction: A Systematic Review.
34073835|a|While the association between dysphagia and malnutrition is well established, there is a lack of clarity regarding the nutritional status and mealtime satisfaction of those consuming texture-modified diets (TMDs). This systematic review summarises and critically appraises the nutritional status and mealtime satisfaction of adults consuming TMDs. A systematic database search following PICO criteria was conducted using Cochrane Central (via Ovid), MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and Scopus. Nutritional status, mealtime satisfaction and costs were identified as primary outcomes. Eligible studies were grouped according to outcome measurement. In total, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty studies evaluated the nutritional status by weight change or using malnutrition screening tools and found the consumption of TMDs correlated with weight loss or malnutrition. Nine studies evaluated mealtime satisfaction, with two reporting poor satisfaction for people on thickened fluids (TFs). Nutrition intervention through adjusting texture and consistency and nutrition enrichment showed positive effects on weight and mealtime satisfaction. The majority of the studies were rated as 'neutral' quality due to the limited number of experiments. TMD consumers had compromised nutritional status and poor mealtime satisfaction. More research input is required to identify promising strategies for improving the nutritional status and mealtime satisfaction of this population. Food services need to consider texture, consistency and fortification in designing menus for people on TMDs to avoid weight loss and malnutrition, and to enhance mealtime enjoyment.
