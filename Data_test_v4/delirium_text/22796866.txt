22796866|t|Gold nanoparticle based dot-blot immunoassay for sensitively detecting Alzheimer's disease related beta-amyloid peptide.
22796866|a|A simple, sensitive gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based dot-blot immunoassay has been developed for detecting Alzheimer's disease related beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) down to a 50 pg mL(-1) level in aqueous solution. Practical samples (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cell culturing mediums and cell lysates) have been used to demonstrate the ability of the assay.
