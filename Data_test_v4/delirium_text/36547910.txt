36547910|t|Polypharmacological Cell-Penetrating Peptides from Venomous Marine Animals Based on Immunomodulating, Antimicrobial, and Anticancer Properties.
36547910|a|Complex pathological diseases, such as cancer, infection, and Alzheimer's, need to be targeted by multipronged curative. Various omics technologies, with a high rate of data generation, demand artificial intelligence to translate these data into druggable targets. In this study, 82 marine venomous animal species were retrieved, and 3505 cryptic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) were identified in their toxins. A total of 279 safe peptides were further analyzed for antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory characteristics. Protease-resistant CPPs with endosomal-escape ability in Hydrophis hardwickii, nuclear-localizing peptides in Scorpaena plumieri, and mitochondrial-targeting peptides from Synanceia horrida were suitable for compartmental drug delivery. A broad-spectrum S. horrida-derived antimicrobial peptide with a high binding-affinity to bacterial membranes was an antigen-presenting cell (APC) stimulator that primes cytokine release and naive T-cell maturation simultaneously. While antibiofilm and wound-healing peptides were detected in Synanceia verrucosa, APC epitopes as universal adjuvants for antiviral vaccination were in Pterois volitans and Conus monile. Conus pennaceus-derived anticancer peptides showed antiangiogenic and IL-2-inducing properties with moderate BBB-permeation and were defined to be a tumor-homing peptide (THP) with the ability to inhibit programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1). Isoforms of RGD-containing peptides with innate antiangiogenic characteristics were in Conus tessulatus for tumor targeting. Inhibitors of neuropilin-1 in C. pennaceus are proposed for imaging probes or therapeutic delivery. A Conus betulinus cryptic peptide, with BBB-permeation, mitochondrial-targeting, and antioxidant capacity, was a stimulator of anti-inflammatory cytokines and non-inducer of proinflammation proposed for Alzheimer's. Conclusively, we have considered the dynamic interaction of cells, their microenvironment, and proportional-orchestrating-host- immune pathways by multi-target-directed CPPs resembling single-molecule polypharmacology. This strategy might fill the therapeutic gap in complex resistant disorders and increase the candidates' clinical-translation chance.
