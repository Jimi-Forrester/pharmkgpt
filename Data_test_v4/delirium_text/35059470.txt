35059470|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe perceptions and beliefs about daytime sleepiness and napping along with subjective and objective daytime sleep characteristics in nursing-home eligible community dwelling older adults. METHODS: A mixed methods study; we conducted semi-structured interviews and measured sleep variables via Actigraphy, sleep diary, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Napping was defined as >10 minutes; anything less was considered dozing. RESULTS: Final sample (n = 40) was primarily female (85%), Black (100%), with a mean age of 72 +- 9.5 years. Few (25%) reported daytime sleepiness (ESS >10). However, average duration of napping per day was 33.1 +- 11.5 minutes with a nap frequency of 2.5 +- 1.5 naps. CONCLUSION: Our sample napped frequently throughout the day, yet the majority reported no daytime sleepiness. These older adults did not always recognize napping or how much they napped.
