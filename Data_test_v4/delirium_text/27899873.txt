27899873|a|IN BRIEF Cognitive impairment and cognitive decline are common in adults with type 1 diabetes. Although several diabetes-related variables have been associated with cognitive functioning in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, inconsistencies remain. This is particularly true in older adults. Cognitive impairment appears to be both a consequence of and a risk factor for poor diabetes self-management and associated glycemic outcomes. Interventions such as cognitive compensatory strategies, assistive technology, and simplified treatment regimens may limit the impact of cognitive impairment on self-management in adults and older adults with type 1 diabetes.
