17949987|a|A recent study reported significant association of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in SORL1, a neuronal sortilin-related receptor protein known to be involved in the trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein. Here we attempted to validate this finding in three large, well characterized case-control series. Approximately 2000 samples from the three series were individually genotyped for 12 SNPs, including the 10 reported significant SNPs and 2 that constitute the reported significant haplotypes. A total of 25 allelic and haplotypic association tests were performed. One SNP rs2070045 was marginally replicated in the three sample sets combined (nominal P=0.035); however, this result does not remain significant when accounting for multiple comparisons. Further validation in other sample sets will be required to assess the true effects of SORL1 variants in LOAD.
