31011015|a|Increasing emphasis on patient privacy and satisfaction has seen more 100% single-room hospitals opened across the UK. Few studies have addressed the impact of these new hospital designs (single rooms) on clinical outcomes specifically for acutely unwell frail patients with dementia. The objective of this study was to profile and compare the clinical outcomes of acutely unwell patients with dementia admitted to two different hospital environments. This prospective observation study was conducted for 100 dementia patients admitted at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr (hospital with 100% single rooms) and Royal Gwent Hospital (traditional multi-bed wards) under the same University Health Board. The length of stay (LoS) was significantly longer for patients admitted to single rooms. The clinical profile of the patients was similar in both hospitals and has no association with LoS. There was no significant difference in terms of incidence of inpatient falls, fall-related injury, discharge to a new care home, 30-day readmission, or mortality. The single room environment appears to influence LoS, as previously reported; however, following the introduction of quality improvement initiatives to prevent inpatient falls, single rooms do not appear to be associated with higher inpatient fall incidence. We propose more research to understand the relationship between single rooms and LoS.
