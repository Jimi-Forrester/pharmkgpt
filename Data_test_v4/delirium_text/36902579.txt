36902579|t|Predictive Value of Prognostic Nutritional Index for Early Postoperative Mobility in Elderly Patients with Pertrochanteric Fracture Treated with Intramedullary Nail Osteosynthesis.
36902579|a|BACKGROUND: Early postoperative mobilization is essential for orthogeriatric patients. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is widely used to evaluate nutritional status. This study sought to investigate the predictive value of PNI for early postoperative mobility in patients with pertrochanteric femur fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 156 geriatric patients with pertrochanteric femur fractures treated with TFN-Advance  (DePuy Synthes, Raynham, MA, USA). Mobility was evaluated on the third postoperative day and by discharge. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association significance of PNI with postoperative mobility together with comorbidities. The optimal PNI cut-off value for mobility was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Three days postoperatively, PNI was an independent predictor of mobility (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.23, p < 0.01). By discharge, it was found that PNI (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.30, p < 0.01) and dementia (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.07-0.40, p < 0.001) were significant predictors. PNI correlated weakly with age (r = -0.27, p < 0.001). The PNI cut-off value for mobility on the third postoperative day was 38.1 (specificity = 78.5%, sensitivity = 63.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that PNI is an independent predictor of early postoperative mobility in geriatric patients with pertrochanteric femur fractures treated with TFNA .
