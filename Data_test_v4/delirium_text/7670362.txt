7670362|t|Inactivation of protease nexin-1 by xanthine oxidase-derived free radicals.
7670362|a|Neuronal viability is affected by reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation is often defined as a major reason for cellular breakdown. Additionally, certain indispensable proteins are possible targets for excessively formed reactive oxygen species. Evidence is given here that protease nexin-1 (PN-1), an endogenous thrombin inhibitor and neurite outgrowth promoter, is inactivated by xanthine oxidase-derived free radicals. Varying protection by superoxide dismutase and catalase was observed, depending on the reaction conditions. The water-soluble alpha-tocopherol analogues MDL 74,406 (R(+)-3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-N,N,N-2,5,7,8-heptamethyl-2H-1-benzopy ran-2- ethanaminium 4-methylbenzenesulfonate), MDL 74,180DA (2,3-dihydro-2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyl-3-(4-methyl-piperazino)-1-benzo furan-5-ol dihydro-chloride) and trolox also protected PN-1. Neurodegeneration may be triggered by oxidative inactivation of protease inhibitors such as PN-1. Protection of PN-1 in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, could be a possible target for a therapeutic function of antioxidants in these diseases.
