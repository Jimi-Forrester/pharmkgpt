33265933|t|Extra-Gastric Manifestations of Helicobacter pylori Infection.
33265933|a|Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram-negative flagellated microorganism that has been extensively studied since its first isolation due to its widespread diffusion and association with numerous diseases. While the bacterium is proved to be a causative factor for a number of gastric diseases such as gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and MALT-lymphoma, its role at other gastrointestinal levels and in other systems is being thoroughly studied. In this article, we reviewed the latest published clinical and laboratory studies that investigated associations of H. pylori with hematologic diseases such as Vitamin B12- and iron-deficiency anemia, primary immune thrombocytopenia, and with a number of dermatologic and ophthalmic diseases. In addition, the putative role of the bacterium in inflammatory bowel diseases, esophageal disorders, metabolic, diseases, neurologic diseases and allergy were outlined.
