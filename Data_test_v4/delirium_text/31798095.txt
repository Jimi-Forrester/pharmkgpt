31798095|t|Gene Variability and Vulnerability to Alcoholism.
31798095|a|Variability within genes may explain why so many differences in alcoholism exist between individuals and among populations. Researchers studying this phenomenon have focused on genes that may affect both the way the body metabolizes alcohol and the way the brain responds to alcohol, thereby increasing or decreasing the likelihood of addiction. Gene variants may ultimately be used as markers of alcoholism vulnerability and as guides to help match patients to the most appropriate alcoholism therapies.
