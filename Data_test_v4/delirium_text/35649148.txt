35649148|a|The recent COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has sparked a new spectrum of investigations, research and studies in multifarious directions. Efforts are being made around the world for discovery of effective vaccines/drugs against COVID-19. In this context, Ayurveda, an alternative traditional system of medicine in India may work as an adjuvant therapy in compromised patients. We selected 40 herbal leads on the basis of their traditional applications. The phytomolecules from these leads were further screened through in-silico molecular docking against two main targets of SARS-CoV-2 i.e. the spike protein (S; structural protein) and the main protease (MPRO; non-structural protein). Out of the selected 40, 12 phytomolecules were able to block or stabilize the major functional sites of the main protease and spike protein. Among these, Ginsenoside, Glycyrrhizic acid, Hespiridin and Tribulosin exhibited high binding energy with both main protease and spike protein. Etoposide showed good binding energy only with Spike protein and Teniposide had high binding energy only with main protease. The above phytocompounds showed promising binding efficiency with target proteins indicating their possible applications against SARS-CoV-2. However, these findings need to be validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments with above mentioned potential molecules as candidate drugs for the management of COVID-19. In addition, there is an opportunity for the development of formulations through different permutations and combinations of these phytomolecules to harness their synergistic potential.
