33988731|a|Death from stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD 5) in childhood or adolescence is rare, but something that all paediatric renal physicians and most paediatricians will encounter. In this paper, we present the literature on three key areas of palliative care practice essential to good clinical management: shared decision-making, advance care planning, and symptom management, with particular reference to CKD 5 where kidney transplant is not an option and where a decision has been made to withdraw or withhold dialysis. Some areas of care, particularly with regard to symptom management, have not been well-studied in children and young people (CYP) with CKD 5 and recommendations with regard to drug choice and dose modification are based on adult literature, known pharmacokinetics, and clinical experience.
