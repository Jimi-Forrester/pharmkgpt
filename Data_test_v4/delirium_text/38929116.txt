38929116|t|The Coming Age of Antisense Oligos for the Treatment of Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion (IRI) and Other Liver Disorders: Role of Oxidative Stress and Potential Antioxidant Effect.
38929116|a|Imbalances in the redox state of the liver arise during metabolic processes, inflammatory injuries, and proliferative liver disorders. Acute exposure to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) results from high levels of oxidative stress (OxS) that occur in response to hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and metabolic diseases of the liver. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are an emerging class of gene expression modulators that target RNA molecules by Watson-Crick binding specificity, leading to RNA degradation, splicing modulation, and/or translation interference. Here, we review ASO inhibitor/activator strategies to modulate transcription and translation that control the expression of enzymes, transcription factors, and intracellular sensors of DNA damage. Several small-interfering RNA (siRNA) drugs with N-acetyl galactosamine moieties for the liver have recently been approved. Preclinical studies using short-activating RNAs (saRNAs), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), and locked nucleic acids (LNAs) are at the forefront of proof-in-concept therapeutics. Future research targeting intracellular OxS-related pathways in the liver may help realize the promise of precision medicine, revolutionizing the customary approach to caring for and treating individuals afflicted with liver-specific conditions.
