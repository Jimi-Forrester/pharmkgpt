38001847|a|Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) impairs the quality of life in elderly persons. ARHL is associated with comorbidities, such as depression, falls, or frailty. Frailty syndrome is related to poor health outcomes in old age. ARHL is a potentially modifiable risk factor for frailty. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a key factor underlying the onset and/or development of ARHL and frailty. Cocoa has high levels of polyphenols and provides many health benefits due to its antioxidant properties. Male and female C57Bl/6J mice were randomly assigned to two study groups: animals receiving a cocoa-supplemented diet and the other receiving a standard diet. Then, at the ages of 6, 14, and 22 months, hearing and frailty were measured in all mice. Auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) threshold shifts were measured to different frequencies. The frailty score was based on the "Valencia Score" adapted to the experimental animals. The total antioxidant capacity and total polyphenols in urine samples were also measured. Significant improvements in hearing ability are observed in the cocoa groups at 6, 14, and 22 months compared to the no cocoa group. The cocoa diet significantly retards the development of frailty in mice. Cocoa increases the concentration of polyphenols excreted in the urine, which increases the total antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, cocoa, due to its antioxidant properties, leads to significant protection against ARHL and frailty.
