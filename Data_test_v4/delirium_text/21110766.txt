21110766|a|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The 37/67 kDa laminin receptor precursor/laminin receptor (LRP/LR) represents a multifunctional protein located on the cell surface, in the cytosol and the nucleus. The receptor acts as a mediator for cell adhesion, cell proliferation and cell differentiation. It is a key player in invasion and adhesion, major functions of several important metastatic cancer types. The receptor hampers apoptosis thereby favoring cancer progression. LRP/LR plays a major role as a cell surface receptor in prion disorders and may be of considerable importance for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. A series of viruses including Sindbis virus, Dengue virus and Adeno-associated virus use LRP/LR as attachment receptors. Bacteria and Candida albicans use the receptor for pathogenesis. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Background and patented biological approaches for therapeutic modulation of LRP/LR in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, viral disorders, bacterial and yeast infections. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: A comprehensive review of the role of LRP/LR in infectious and non-infectious diseases and an insightful assessment of published or patented biological approaches for the therapeutic modulation of LRP/LR. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Molecular tools such as antibodies directed against LRP/LR have the potential to act as promising alternative therapeutics for the treatment of various diseases.
