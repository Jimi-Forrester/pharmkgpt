36593389|a|Postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring is an established option to ensure patient safety after resection of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In contrast, secondary unplanned ICU readmission following complicating events during the initial postoperative course might be associated with severe morbidity and impair initially intended surgical benefit. In the present study, we assessed the prognostic impact of secondary ICU readmission and aimed to identify preoperatively ascertainable risk factors for the development of such adverse events in patients treated surgically for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Between 2013 and 2018, 240 patients were surgically treated for newly diagnosed glioblastoma at the authors' neuro-oncological center. Secondary ICU readmission was defined as any unplanned admission to the ICU during initial hospital stay. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify preoperatively measurable risk factors for unplanned ICU readmission. Nineteen of 240 glioblastoma patients (8%) were readmitted to the ICU. Median overall survival of patients with unplanned ICU readmission was 9 months compared to 17 months for patients without secondary ICU readmission (p=0.008). Multivariable analysis identified "preoperative administration of dexamethasone > 7 days" (p=0.002) as a significant and independent predictor of secondary unplanned ICU admission. Secondary ICU readmission following surgery for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is significantly associated with poor survival and thus may negate surgically achieved prerequisites for further treatment. This underlines the indispensability of precise patient selection as well as the importance of further scientific debate on these highly relevant aspects for patient safety.
