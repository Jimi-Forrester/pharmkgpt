37954297|t|An optimized method for PCR-based genotyping to detect human APOE polymorphisms.
37954297|a|Background: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is one of the most polymorphic genes at two single nucleotides (rs429358 and rs7412). The various isoforms of APOE have been associated with a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative, type 2 diabetes, etc. Hence, predicting the APOE genotyping is critical for disease risk evaluation. The purpose of this study was to optimize the tetra amplification refractory mutation system (Tetra-ARMS) PCR method for the detection of APOE mutations. Material and methods: Here, in our optimized Tetra-ARMS PCR method, different factors like cycle conditions, using HiFidelity enzyme instead of Taq polymerase and setting its best concentration, and the lack of using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for amplifying the GC-regions were set up for all primer pairs. The sensitivity and accuracy were tested. For validation of the assay, the results were compared with known genotypes for the APOE gene that were previously obtained by two independent methods, RFLP and Chip-typing. Results: Successful Tetra-ARMS PCR and genotyping are influenced by multiple factors. Our developed method enabled us to amplify the DNA fragment by 25 cycles without adding any hazardous reagent, like DMSO. Our findings showed 100 % accuracy and sensitivity of the optimized Tetra-ARMS PCR while both criteria were 95 % for RFLP and 100 % for the chip-typing method. In addition, our results showed 91 % and 100 % consistency with RFLP and chip typing methods, respectively. Conclusions: Our current method is a simple and accurate approach for detecting APOE polymorphisms within a large sample size in a short time and can be performed even in low-tech laboratories.
