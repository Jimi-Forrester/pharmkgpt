30639852|t|Srv2 Is a Pro-fission Factor that Modulates Yeast Mitochondrial Morphology and Respiration by Regulating Actin Assembly.
30639852|a|Dynamic processes such as fusion, fission, and trafficking are important in the regulation of cellular organelles, with an abundant literature focused on mitochondria. Mitochondrial dynamics not only help shape its network within cells but also are involved in the modulation of respiration and integrity. Disruptions of mitochondrial dynamics are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Although proteins that directly bind mitochondria to promote membrane fusion/fission have been studied intensively, machineries that regulate dynamic mitochondrial processes remain to be explored. We have identified an interaction between the mitochondrial fission GTPase Dnm1/DRP1 and the actin-regulatory protein Srv2/CAP at mitochondria. Deletion of Srv2 causes elongated-hyperfused mitochondria and reduces the reserved respiration capacity in yeast cells. Our results further demonstrate that the irregular network morphology in Deltasrv2 cells derives from disrupted actin assembly at mitochondria. We suggest that Srv2 functions as a pro-fission factor in shaping mitochondrial dynamics and regulating activity through its actin-regulatory effects.
