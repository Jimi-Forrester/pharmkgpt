15755412|t|Cognitive function, aging, and ethical decisions: recognizing change.
15755412|a|As the population ages, dental and other health care providers will be working with more older adults (and their family members) with changing cognitive status than ever before in history. The intent of this article is to review common cognitive changes in older adults that will undoubtedly be seen in dental practices. Knowledge of the common signs and symptoms of age-related cognitive changes provides a basis on which to identify individuals with undiagnosed cognitive,changes. This article reviews the relationship between cognitive function, aging, and dementia (specifically, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease), the role of the dental team in recognizing these conditions, and issues related to obtaining in-formed consent from cognitively impaired patients.
