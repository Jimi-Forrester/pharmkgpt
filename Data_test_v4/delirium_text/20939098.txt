20939098|a|Although it is clear that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides play a pivotal role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the precise molecular model of action remains unclear. Abeta peptide forms assemble both in aqueous solution and in lipid membranes. It has been proposed that deleterious effects occur when the peptides interact with membranes, possibly by forming Ca(2+) permeant ion channels. In the accompanying manuscript, we propose models in which the C-terminus third of six Abeta42 peptides forms a six-stranded beta-barrel in highly toxic soluble oligomers. Here we extend this hypothesis to membrane-bound assemblies. In these Abeta models, the hydrophobic beta-barrel of a hexamer may either reside on the surface of the bilayer, or span the bilayer. Transmembrane pores are proposed to form between several hexamers. Once the beta-barrels of six hexamers have spanned the bilayer, they may merge to form a more stable 36-stranded beta-barrel. We favor models in which parallel beta-barrels formed by N-terminus segments comprise the lining of the pores. These types of models explain why the channels are selective for cations and how metal ions, such as Zn(2+) , synthetic peptides that contain histidines, and some small organic cations may block channels or inhibit formation of channels. Our models were developed to be consistent with microscopy studies of Abeta assemblies in membranes, one of which is presented here for the first time.
