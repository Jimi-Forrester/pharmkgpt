39125612|t|Molecular Morbidity Score-Can MicroRNAs Assess the Burden of Disease?
39125612|a|Multimorbidity refers to the presence of two or more chronic diseases and is associated with adverse outcomes for patients. Factors such as an ageing population have contributed to a rise in prevalence of multimorbidity globally; however, multimorbidity is often neglected in clinical guidelines. This is largely because patients with multimorbidity are systematically excluded from clinical trials. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop novel biomarkers and methods of prognostication for this cohort of patients. The hallmarks of ageing are now thought to potentiate the pathogenesis of multimorbidity. MicroRNAs are small, regulatory, noncoding RNAs which have been implicated in the pathogenesis and prognostication of numerous chronic diseases; there is a substantial body of evidence now implicating microRNA dysregulation with the different hallmarks of ageing in the aetiology of chronic diseases. This article proposes using the hallmarks of ageing as a framework to develop a panel of microRNAs to assess the prognostic burden of multimorbidity. This putative molecular morbidity score would have many potential applications, including assessing the efficacy of clinical interventions, informing clinical decision making and facilitating wider inclusion of patients with multimorbidity in clinical trials.
