38301889|a|Cardiolipin (CL), the signature lipid of the mitochondrial inner membrane, is critical for maintaining optimal mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. Disruption of CL metabolism, caused by mutations in the CL remodeling enzyme TAFAZZIN, results in the life-threatening disorder Barth syndrome (BTHS). While the clinical manifestations of BTHS, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy, point to defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics, the disorder is also characterized by broad metabolic dysregulation, including abnormal levels of metabolites associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Recent studies have identified the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the gatekeeper enzyme for TCA cycle carbon influx, as a key deficiency in various BTHS model systems. However, the molecular mechanisms linking aberrant CL remodeling, particularly the primary, direct consequence of reduced tetralinoleoyl-CL (TLCL) levels, to PDH activity deficiency are not yet understood. In the current study, we found that remodeled TLCL promotes PDH function by directly binding to and enhancing the activity of PDH phosphatase 1 (PDP1). This is supported by our findings that TLCL uniquely activates PDH in a dose-dependent manner, TLCL binds to PDP1 in vitro, TLCL-mediated PDH activation is attenuated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor, and PDP1 activity is decreased in Tafazzin-knockout (TAZ-KO) C2C12 myoblasts. Additionally, we observed decreased mitochondrial calcium levels in TAZ-KO cells and treating TAZ-KO cells with calcium lactate (CaLac) increases mitochondrial calcium and restores PDH activity and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. Based on our findings, we conclude that reduced mitochondrial calcium levels and decreased binding of PDP1 to TLCL contribute to decreased PDP1 activity in TAZ-KO cells.
