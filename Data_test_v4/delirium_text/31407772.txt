31407772|a|To understand the pathogenesis of specific neuronal circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we investigated the fate of three subclasses of "modulatory interneurons" in hippocampal CA1 using the AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in mouse model of AD. Cholecystokinin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons were aberrantly hyperactive preceding the presence of the typical AD hallmarks: neuroinflammation and amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation. These interneurons showed an age-dependent vulnerability to Abeta penetration and a reduction in density and coexpression of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA synthesis enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), suggesting a loss in their inhibitory function. However, calretinin (CR) interneurons-specialized to govern only inhibition, showed resilience to Abeta accumulation, preservation of structure, and displayed synaptic hyperinhibition, despite the lack of inhibitory control of CA1 excitatory pyramidal cells from midstages of the disease. This aberrant inhibitory homeostasis observed in CA1 CR cells and pyramidal cells was "normalized" by blocking P2Y1 purinoreceptors, which were "upregulated" and strongly expressed in CR cells and astrocytes in AppNL-F/NL-F mice in the later stages of AD. In summary, AD-associated cell-type selective destruction of inhibitory interneurons and disrupted inhibitory homeostasis rectified by modulation of the upregulated purinoreceptor system may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to normalize selective dysfunctional synaptic homeostasis during pathogenesis of AD.
