34115018|t|Effectiveness and safety of moxibustion for Parkinson disease: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
34115018|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease among middle-aged and elderly people. Clinically, it is a movement disorder characterized mainly by static tremors, kinesia, myotonia, and postural balance disorder. In recent years, an increasing number of clinical reports on moxibustion therapy for PD have been published. Despite this, no systematic review of moxibustion therapy for PD has been undertaken. METHODS: Two reviewers will search the following 7 English and Chinese databases online: the Cochrane Library; PubMed; EMBASE; the China National Knowledge Infrastructure; the Wan Fang databases; the China Science and Technology Journal Database; and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Reviewers will search each electronic database for studies published from journal inception to May 2021. Two reviewers will independently conduct clinical study inclusion, data extraction, and risk bias assessment. Any differences in the above process will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. If the data are sufficient, RevMan software 5.3 (Cochrane Community, London, UK) will be used for the meta-analysis of the extracted data. RESULTS: In this systematic review, the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion therapy in PD treatment will be evaluated. CONCLUSION: This systematic review may provide further evidence to encourage clinicians to use moxibustion in the treatment of PD. INPLASY REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY202140097.
