22142563|a|The senescence accelerated mouse (SAMP8) is a spontaneous animal model of overproduction of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and oxidative damage. It develops early memory disturbances and changes in the blood-brain barrier resulting in decreased efflux of amyloid-beta protein from the brain. It has a marked increase in oxidative stress in the brain. Pharmacological treatments that reduce oxidative stress improve memory. Treatments that reduce amyloid-beta (antisense to APP and antibodies to amyloid-beta) not only improve memory but reduce oxidative stress. Early changes in lipid peroxidative damage favor mitochondrial dysfunction as being a trigger for amyloid-beta overproduction in this genetically susceptible mouse strain. This sets in motion a cycle where the increased amyloid-beta further damages mitochondria. We suggest that this should be termed the Inflammatory-Amyloid Cycle and may well be similar to the mechanisms responsible for the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
