37043150|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common form of dementia associated with loss of memory and disruption of synaptic plasticity. There is a strong correlation between the pathophysiological features of AD and diabetes, including induction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and abnormality in blood vessels. Considering the brain's limited capacity to repair damage and the potential of stem cell-derived neural cells in the repair of neurodegenerative disease, we investigated the effects of artemisinin and TSP-1-human endometrial-derived-derived stem cells (TSP-1-hEDSCs) on the cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in AD-diabetes rats. The authors previously showed that artemisinin and TSP-1-hEDSCs suppressed oxidative stress and inflammation in AD-diabetes rats. Thrombospondins-1 (TSPs-1) is a glycoprotein that inhibits angiogenesis. AD and diabetes were induced using streptozotocin. Synaptic plasticity and learning and memory function were studied using the Morris water maze and electrophysiological test, respectively. Streptozotocin increased traveled swimming distance and escape latency in the morris water maze test, decreased the percent time spent in the target quadrant, inhibited the long-term potentiation (LTP), and increased the blood glucose levels. Simultaneous or separate administration of artemisinin and TSP-1-hEDSCs decreased the blood levels of glucose and improved cognitive tasks and synaptic plasticity by considerably reducing traveled swimming distance and escape latency, increasing the percent time spent in the target quadrant, and retrieval of the LTP; therefore, they could be utilized as an adjunct treatment for AD treatment. These results may be due to a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation.
