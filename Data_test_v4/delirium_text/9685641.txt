9685641|a|Degeneration of the cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) and changes in cortical neuropeptide levels have been reported in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we sought to determine if a selective cholinergic lesion of nucleus basalis magnocellularis (Nbm) could affect the number and distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin (SS) immunoreactive neurons in the frontoparietal and occipital cortices of rats. Brain sections were evaluated at survival times of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 78 and 100 weeks after intraventricular injection of 192-saporin, an immunotoxin directed at the low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NGFr), that selectively destroys the CBF. Following the immunotoxin lesion of the Nbm, the number of NPY-labeled neurons decreased 33% in the frontoparietal cortex and 60% in the occipital cortex compared to age-matched normal controls at most survival time points. A significant loss of SS-labeled neurons in both cortical regions was seen 12 weeks after 192-saporin injection with no further change up to 100-week survival time. The effect of age on neuropeptidergic populations was evaluated in normal control rats. The number of NPY and SS immunoreactive neurons in aged rats (21-26 months) decreased by 42% in the frontoparietal cortex and 27% in the occipital cortex when compared with young (3-6 months) and middle-age (9-14 months) rats. When both non-lesioned and lesioned animals with different ages were pooled for linear regression, a significant correlation was found between the number of cortical NPY- and SS-labeled neurons and cortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemical staining intensity. These findings indicate that: (1) cholinergic denervation of the Nbm is associated with an irreversible loss of neocortical NPY and SS immunoreactive neurons analogous to that observed in Alzheimer's disease and aging; (2) the degree of the loss of cortical NPY and SS immunoreactive neurons seems to be related to the extent of the reduction of cortical AChE intensity in both toxin-injected and normal aged rats. These findings may reflect a trophic dependence of NPY and SS neurons on cortical cholinergic input.
