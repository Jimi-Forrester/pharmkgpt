32165917|t|"Phantom akathisia" in an amputated leg of a sarcoma patient: a case report.
32165917|a|BACKGROUND: Akathisia is a rather common extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic drugs and antidepressants, often resulting in severe discomfort for patients. However, due to the diversity of symptoms, it is often overlooked. We hereby report a case with akathisia that mainly appeared in an amputated leg. CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 60-year-old woman, who had undergone external hemipelvectomy for a recurrent soft tissue sarcoma, was referred to the Department of Psycho-Oncology due to worsening anxiety and restlessness. She was not unconscious or disoriented. Her chief complains included restlessness, an itching sensation in the area corresponding to the amputated left leg, and a feeling as if the lost left leg were raising itself. Detailed examination revealed that she had been administered 10 mg per day of oral prochlorperazine maleate for nausea induced by the oxycodone that had been prescribed to control post-operative pain. Akathisia was suspected and prochlorperazine maleate treatment was discontinued. All the symptoms were alleviated on the next day, and disappeared in 3 days. Eventually, she was diagnosed with akathisia. CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that the symptoms associated with akathisia can occur in an amputated extremity. Considering two previous reports of "phantom dyskinesia", extrapyramidal syndromes may result in unusual presentations if occurring in an amputated extremity. Not only should the use of antipsychotic drugs and antidepressants be carefully considered, but also closer observation of psychological symptoms is required after prescription of these drugs because the clinical presentation of akathisia can be various and confusing due to modifications caused by other factors as in this case.
