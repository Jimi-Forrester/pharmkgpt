36002958|a|The underlying mechanisms of the association between cardiovascular risk factors and a higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden are unknown. We investigated the association between cardiovascular risk factors and advanced WMH markers in 155 non-demented older adults (mean age: 71 +- 5 years). The association between cardiovascular risk factors and quantitative MRI-based WMH shape and volume markers were examined using linear regression analysis. Presence of hypertension was associated with a more irregular shape of periventricular/confluent WMH (convexity (B (95 % CI)): -0.12 (-0.22--0.03); concavity index: 0.06 (0.02-0.11)), but not with total WMH volume (0.22 (-0.15-0.59)). Presence of diabetes was associated with deep WMH volume (0.89 (0.15-1.63)). Body mass index or hyperlipidemia showed no association with WMH markers. In conclusion, different cardiovascular risk factors seem to be related to a distinct pattern of WMH shape markers in non-demented older adults. These findings may suggest that different underlying cardiovascular pathological mechanisms lead to different WMH MRI phenotypes, which may be valuable for early detection of individuals at risk for stroke and dementia.
