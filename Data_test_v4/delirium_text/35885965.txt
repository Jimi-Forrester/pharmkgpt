35885965|t|A Systematic Review of the Impact of Mitochondrial Variations on Male Infertility.
35885965|a|According to current estimates, infertility affects one in four couples trying to conceive. Primary or secondary infertility can be due either to both partners or only to the man or the woman. Up to 15% of infertility cases in men can be attributed to genetic factors that can lead to irreversible partial or complete spermatogenic arrest. The increased use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has provided not only insights into the causes of male infertility but also afforded a diagnostic tool to detect and manage this condition among couples. Genes control a variety of physiological attributes, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, development, and germ cell differentiation. In the era of ART, it is important to understand the genetic basis of infertility so as to provide the most tailored therapy and counseling to couples. Genetic factors involved in male infertility can be chromosome abnormalities or single-gene disorders, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, Y-chromosome deletions, multifactorial disorders, imprinting disorders, or endocrine disorders of genetic origin. In this review, we discuss the role of mitochondria and the mitochondrial genome as an indicator of sperm quality and fertility.
