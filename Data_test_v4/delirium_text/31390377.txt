31390377|a|Damage to the retina and optic nerve is found in some neurodegenerative disorders, but it is unclear whether the optic pathway and central nervous system (CNS) are affected by the same injurious agent, or whether optic pathway damage is due to retrograde degeneration following the CNS damage. Finding an environmental agent that could be responsible for the optic pathway damage would support the hypothesis that this environmental toxicant also triggers the CNS lesions. Toxic metals have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, and mercury has been found in the retina and optic nerve of experimentally-exposed animals. Therefore, to see if mercury exposure in the prenatal period could be one link between optic pathway damage and human CNS disorders of later life, we examined the retina and optic nerve of neonatal mice that had been exposed prenatally to mercury vapor, using a technique, autometallography, that detects the presence of mercury within cells. Pregnant mice were exposed to a non-toxic dose of mercury vapor for four hours a day for five days in late gestation, when the mouse placenta most closely resembles the human placenta. The neonatal offspring were sacrificed one day after birth and gapless serial sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks containing the eyes were stained with silver nitrate autometallography to detect inorganic mercury. Mercury was seen in the nuclear membranes of retinal ganglion cells and endothelial cells. A smaller amount of mercury was present in the retinal inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers. Mercury was conspicuous in the peripapillary retinal pigment epithelium. In the optic nerve, mercury was seen in the nuclear membranes and processes of glia and in endothelial cells. Optic pathway and CNS endothelial cells contained mercury. In conclusion, mercury is taken up preferentially by fetal retinal ganglion cells, optic nerve glial cells, the retinal pigment epithelium, and endothelial cells. Mercury induces free radical formation, autoimmunity, and genetic and epigenetic changes, so these findings raise the possibility that mercury plays a part in the pathogenesis of degenerative CNS disorders that also affect the retina and optic nerve.
