36352352|a|BACKGROUND: Descriptions of the patterns of acute/subacute cerebral infarction (ASCI) in HIV-negative patients with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) are scarce, and the predictors of ischemic stroke and outcomes following ASCI remain unclear. AIM: To study the clinical characteristics and evaluate the predictors of ASCI in HIV-negative patients with CM and assess the impact of ischemic stroke on the outcomes of the patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 61 HIV-negative patients with CM treated between January, 2016 and February, 2022, and among them, 53 patients with complete neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data were enrolled in this study. The cohort was stratified by the occurrence of ASCI diagnosed based on MRI evidences for comparison of the clinical characteristics (consciousness disturbance, GCS score, duration of symptoms, and treatment), CSF parameters, imaging findings (meningeal inflammation, hydrocephalus, posterior fossa exudates) and outcomes of the patients. A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score <= 2 and a poor outcome as a mRS score > 2. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors of ASCI in the HIV-negative patients with CM. RESULTS: Of the 53 HIV-negative patients with CM, 14 (26.4%) had ASCI. The incidences of fever, headache, neck stiffness, duration of symptoms, CSF parameters, meningeal enhancement in brain MRI and the treatment regimens were similar between the patients with and those without ASCI. Most of the infarcts (92.9%) were of the lacunar type, involving both the anterior and posterior territories. Basal ganglia-corona radiata and the brainstem-cerebellum were the most frequently involved sites. Univariate logistic regression analysis suggested that consciousness disturbance (P = 0.002), MRI evidence of hydrocephalus (P = 0.042) and posterior fossa exudates (P = 0.028) were predictors of ASCI in these HIV-negative patients with CM. Multivariate analysis identified consciousness disturbance as a significant predictor of ASCI (P = 0.020). Compared with the patients without ASCI, the HIV-negative patients with CM and ASCI had poorer outcomes (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: ASCI can occur in HIV-negative patients with CM, presented commonly as multiple lacunar infarctions involving all the cerebrovascular territories. The presence of consciousness disturbance, hydrocephalus and posterior fossa exudates may increase the risk of ASCI in patients with CM. ASCI is associated with a poor outcome of the HIV-negative patients with CM.
