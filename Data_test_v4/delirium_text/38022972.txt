38022972|a|Introduction: Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with encoding episodic memories. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel and viable tool to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, but the treatment effect in SCD has not been studied. We aim to investigate the efficacy of rTMS on episodic memory in individuals with SCD, and to explore the potential mechanisms of neural plasticity. Methods: In our randomized, sham-controlled trial, patients (n = 60) with SCD will receive 20 sessions (5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks) of real rTMS (n = 30) or sham rTMS (n = 30) over the left DLPFC. The primary outcome is the Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H). Other neuropsychological examinations and the long-term potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity evaluation serve as the secondary outcomes. These outcomes will be assessed before and at the end of the intervention. Discussion: If the episodic memory of SCD improve after the intervention, the study will confirm that rTMS is a promising intervention for cognitive function improvement on the early stage of dementia. This study will also provide important clinical evidence for early intervention in AD and emphasizes the significance that impaired LTP-like cortical plasticity may be a potential biomarker of AD prognosis by demonstrating the predictive role of LTP on cognitive improvement in SCD. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the hospital (No. 2023-002-01). The results will be published in peer-review publications.
