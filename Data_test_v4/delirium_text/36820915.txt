36820915|a|BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection which can affect the central nervous system. In this study, we sought to investigate associations between neuroimaging findings with clinical, demographic, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, pre-existing conditions and the severity of acute COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective multicenter data retrieval from 10 university medical centers in Germany, Switzerland and Austria between February 2020 and September 2021. We included patients with COVID-19, acute neurological symptoms and cranial imaging. We collected demographics, neurological symptoms, COVID-19 severity, results of cranial imaging, blood and CSF parameters during the hospital stay. RESULTS: 442 patients could be included. COVID-19 severity was mild in 124 (28.1%) patients (moderate n = 134/30.3%, severe n = 43/9.7%, critical n = 141/31.9%). 220 patients (49.8%) presented with respiratory symptoms, 167 (37.8%) presented with neurological symptoms first. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was detected in 70 (15.8%), intracranial hemorrhage (IH) in 48 (10.9%) patients. Typical risk factors were associated with AIS; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and invasive ventilation with IH. No association was found between the severity of COVID-19 or blood/CSF parameters and the occurrence of AIS or IH. DISCUSSION: AIS was the most common finding on cranial imaging. IH was more prevalent than expected but a less common finding than AIS. Patients with IH had a distinct clinical profile compared to patients with AIS. There was no association between AIS or IH and the severity of COVID-19. A considerable proportion of patients presented with neurological symptoms first. Laboratory parameters have limited value as a screening tool.
