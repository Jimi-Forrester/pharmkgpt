34101795|t|Major Cost Drivers in Assessing the Economic Burden of Alzheimer's Disease: A Structured, Rapid Review.
34101795|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms eventually grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. AD is predicted to increase healthcare spending and costs associated with formal and informal caregiving. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the contribution of the different cost components associated with AD. METHODS: A structured literature review was conducted to identify studies reporting the economic burden of Alzheimer`s Disease beyond the healthcare setting. The search was conducted in Medline, Embase and EconLit and limited to studies published in the last 10 years. For each identified cost component, frequency weighted mean costs were calculated across countries to estimate the percentage contribution of each component by care setting and disease severity. Results obtained by each costing approach were also compared. RESULTS: For community-dwelling adults, the percentage of healthcare, social care and indirect costs to total costs were 13.9%, 17.4% and 68.7%, respectively. The percentage of costs varied by disease severity with 26.0% and 10.4% of costs spent on healthcare for mild and severe disease, respectively. The proportion of total spending on indirect costs changed from 60.7% to 72.5% as disease progressed. For those in residential care, the contribution of each cost component was similar between moderate and severe disease. Social care accounted on average for 85.9% of total costs. CONCLUSION: The contribution of healthcare costs to the overall burden was not negligible; but was generally exceeded by social and informal care costs.
