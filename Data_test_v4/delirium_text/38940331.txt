38940331|a|Increasing evidence shows that neuroinflammation is a possible modulator of tau spread effects on cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. In this context, plasma levels of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have been suggested to have a robust association with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. This study aims to assess the correlation between plasma GFAP and Alzheimer's disease pathology, and their synergistic effect on cognitive performance and decline. A cohort of 122 memory clinic subjects with amyloid and tau positron emission tomography, MRI scans, plasma GFAP, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was included in the study. A subsample of 94 subjects had a follow-up MMSE score at least one year after baseline. Regional and voxel-based correlations between Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and plasma GFAP were assessed. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of plasma GFAP on the association between amyloid and tau PET, and tau PET and cognitive impairment and decline. GFAP was associated with increased tau PET ligand uptake in the lateral temporal and inferior temporal lobes in a strong left-sided pattern independently of age, gender, education, amyloid, and APOE status (beta=0.001, p < 0.01). The annual rate of MMSE change was significantly and independently correlated with both GFAP (beta=0.006, p < 0.01) and global tau SUVR (beta=4.33, p < 0.01), but not with amyloid burden. Partial mediation effects of GFAP were found on the association between amyloid and tau pathology (13.7%), and between tau pathology and cognitive decline (17.4%), but not on global cognition at baseline. Neuroinflammation measured by circulating GFAP is independently associated with tau Alzheimer's disease pathology and with cognitive decline, suggesting neuroinflammation as a potential target for future disease-modifying trials targeting tau pathology. Peretti et al. show that a circulatory marker of neuroinflammation-glial fibrillary acidic protein-is associated with tau pathology in lateral temporal and frontal regions in patients with Alzheimer's disease, independent of amyloid load. Neuroinflammation appears to modulate the association between amyloid and tau biomarkers.
