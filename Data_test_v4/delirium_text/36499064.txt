36499064|t|Targeting Mitochondrial Dynamics Proteins for the Development of Therapies for Cardiovascular Diseases.
36499064|a|Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The identification of new pathogenetic targets contributes to more efficient development of new types of drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights the problem of mitochondrial dynamics disorders, in the context of cardiovascular diseases. A change in the normal function of mitochondrial dynamics proteins is one of the reasons for the development of the pathological state of cardiomyocytes. Based on this, therapeutic targeting of these proteins may be a promising strategy in the development of cardiac drugs. Here we will consider changes for each process of mitochondrial dynamics in cardiovascular diseases: fission and fusion of mitochondria, mitophagy, mitochondrial transport and biogenesis, and also analyze the prospects of the considered protein targets based on existing drug developments.
