Non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) activating afferent branches of the vagus nerve may prevent hyperglycemia in diabetes models. We examined the effects of 14-min taVNS vs sham stimulation by Cerbomed Nemos  on glucose metabolism, lipids, and hepatic energy homeostasis in fasted healthy humans (n = 10, age 51 +- 6 yrs, BMI 25.5 +- 2.7 kg/m2). METHODS: Heart rate variability (HRV), reflecting sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activity, was measured before, during and after taVNS or sham stimulation. Endogenous glucose production was determined using [6,6-2H2]glucose, and hepatic concentrations of triglycerides (HCL), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) were quantified from 1H/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and for 180 min following stimulation. RESULTS: taVNS did not affect circulating glucose, free fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, or pancreatic polypeptide. Rates of endogenous glucose production (P = 0.79), hepatic HCL, ATP, and Pi were also not different (P = 0.91, P = 0.48 and P = 0.24) between taVNS or sham stimulation. Hepatic HCL, ATP, and Pi remained constant during prolonged fasting for 3 h. No changes in heart rate or shift in cardiac autonomic function from HRV towards sympathetic or parasympathetic predominance were detected. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive vagus stimulation by Cerbomed Nemos  does not acutely modulate the autonomic tone to the visceral organs and thereby does not affect hepatic glucose and energy metabolism. This technique is therefore unable to mimic brain insulin-mediated effects on peripheral homeostasis in humans.
