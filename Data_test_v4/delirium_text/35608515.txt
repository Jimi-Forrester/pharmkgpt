35608515|t|Bone Mineral Density T-Score is an Independent Predictor of Major Blood Loss in Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery.
35608515|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort Study. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of low bone mineral density (BMD), as assessed by preoperative Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans, on intraoperative blood loss following adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. METHODS: Patients who received spinal fusion for ASD (>5 levels fused) at a single academic center from 2010-2018 were included in this study. The lowest preoperative T-score was recorded for patients who had preoperative DEXA scans within a year of surgery. Patients with liver/kidney disease or on prescription anticoagulant medication were excluded. Major blood loss was a binary variable defined as above or below the 90th percentile of our cohort. Binomial regression was performed controlling for age, number of vertebrae fused, 3-column osteotomy, primary vs. revision surgery, preoperative platelet count, and if the patient was taking medication for osteoporosis. RESULTS: 91 patients were identified in the cohort. Mean age was 63 +- 11.6 years, 81% female. 56 (62%) of cases included revision of previous instrumentation. Patients had a mean SVA of 9.6 +- 8.6 cm and median of 9 vertebrae fused (range 5-22). The average T-score was -1.2 +- 1.0. Each point lower T-score was associated with significantly higher odds of major blood loss (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0 - 5.9) when controlling for age, number of vertebrae fused, 3-column osteotomy, preoperative platelet count and primary vs. revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative T-score is independently associated with increased odds of major blood loss in ASD surgery.
