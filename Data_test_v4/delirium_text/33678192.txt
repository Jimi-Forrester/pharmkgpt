33678192|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication of hip surgery patients. It is necessary to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and related risk factors of delirium after hip fracture surgery, to provide evidence supports for the prevention and management of delirium. METHODS: Hip fracture patients admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment from March 2018 to March 2020 were identified as participants. The characteristics and laboratory examinations in patients with and without postoperative delirium were compared and analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to ascertain the independent risk factors, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to analyze the predictive value. RESULTS: A total of 568 postoperative patients with hip fracture were included, the incidence of delirium in postoperative patients with hip fracture was 14.44 %. The preoperative albumin (OR 4.382, 2.501 ~ 5.538), history of delirium (OR 2.197, 1.094 ~ 3.253), TSH (OR1.245, 1.077 ~ 1.638), the resting score on the first postoperative day (OR1.235, 0.944 ~ 1.506) and age(OR1.185, 0.065 ~ 1.814) were the independent risk factors for the postoperative delirium in patients with hip fracture(all p < 0.05). The AUC of albumin, history of delirium, TSH, the resting score on the first postoperative day and age were 0.794, 0.754, 0.746, 0.721 and 0.689 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of delirium in postoperative patients with hip fracture is rather high, especially for patients with old age and history of delirium. Monitoring albumin, TSH and resting score may be beneficial to the management of postoperative delirium.
