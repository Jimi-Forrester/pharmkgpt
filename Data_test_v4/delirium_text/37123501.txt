37123501|a|Background: Differences in susceptibility and response to infection between males and females are well established. Despite this, sex-specific analyses are under-reported in the medical literature, and there is a paucity of literature looking at differences between male and female patients with periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Whether there are sex-specific differences in presentation, treatment tolerability, and outcomes in PJI has not been widely evaluated. Methods: We undertook a retrospective case-matched analysis of patients with staphylococcal PJI managed with two-stage exchange arthroplasty. To control for differences other than sex which may influence outcome or presentation, males and females were matched for age group, causative organism category (coagulase-negative staphylococci vs. Staphylococcus aureus), and joint involved (hip vs. knee). Results: We identified 156 patients in 78 pairs of males and females who were successfully matched. There were no significant baseline differences by sex, except for greater use of chronic immunosuppression among females (16.4 % vs. 4.1 %; p = 0.012  ). We did not detect any statistically significant differences in outcomes between the two groups. Among the 156 matched patients, 16 recurrent infections occurred during a median follow-up time of 2.9 (IQR 1.5-5.3) years. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.1 % for females, compared with 8.8 % for males ( p = 0.434  ). Conclusions: Success rates for PJI treated with two-stage exchange arthroplasty are high, consistent with previously reported literature. This retrospective case-matched study did not detect a significant difference in outcome between males and females with staphylococcal PJI who underwent two-stage exchange arthroplasty.
