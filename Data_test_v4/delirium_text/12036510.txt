12036510|t|Brain perfusion in Alzheimer's disease with and without apathy: a SPECT study with statistical parametric mapping analysis.
12036510|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by cognitive symptoms that, in combination with behavioral disturbances, significantly interfere with activities of daily living. These behavioral disorders contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of the disease and probably express different pathophysiological processes. Apathy is one of the most frequent behavioral disorders in AD. The aim of this study was to evaluate brain perfusion of AD patients with and without apathy (as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory) compared with that in healthy elderly subjects. A total of 15 AD patients without apathy (AD/NA; mean age 76.6) and 15 AD patients with apathy (AD/A; mean age 77.6) were studied. Brain perfusion was measured by 99mTc-labeled bicisate (ECD) single-photon emission tomography (ECD SPECT). The images of the two AD subgroups were compared by means of statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99) to corresponding images of 11 healthy elderly control subjects (obtained from the Society of Nuclear Medicine database). Compared with the healthy elderly subjects, the apathy-free AD subgroup had significantly lower perfusion of inferior temporal regions (left fusiform gyrus, left parahippocampal area) and occipital regions (left gyrus lingualis). The apathy subgroup had significantly decreased perfusion of the left anterior cingulate, the right inferior and medial gyrus frontalis, the left orbitofrontal gyrus and the right gyrus lingualis. The differences in the brain areas with reduced perfusion between the apathy-free subjects (mainly the posterior regions) and the apathetic subjects (mainly the anterior regions) indicate that behavioral disorders such as apathy participate in the heterogeneity of brain perfusion in AD.
