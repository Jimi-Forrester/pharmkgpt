33024430|t|Catecholamines in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
33024430|a|Background and Purpose: Previous studies found inconsistent results regarding the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and catecholamines, such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the results of previous studies on this relationship. Method: Literature retrieval of eligible studies was performed in four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and PsycARTICLES). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess differences in catecholamine concentrations between the AD groups and controls. Results: Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Compared with the controls, significant lower concentrations of NE (SMD = -1.10, 95% CI: -2.01 to -0.18, p = 0.019) and DA (SMD = -1.12, 95% CI: -1.88 to -0.37, p = 0.003) were observed in patients with AD. No difference was found in the concentrations of EPI between the two groups (SMD = -0.74, 95% CI: -1.85 to 0.37, p = 0.189). Conclusion: Overall, these findings are in line with the hypothesis that reduced NE and DA may be an important indicator for AD (Registration number CRD42018112816).
