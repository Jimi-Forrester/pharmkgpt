8316599|t|The treatment of cocaine abuse.
8316599|a|Cocaine abuse surged in the 1980s, forcing reevaluation of its previously benign image. Snorted, smoked, and injected, the drug is more widely abused than ever and, the consequences are devastating. Medical complications are frequent and range from mild (eg, cough, itching, headache) to life-threatening (eg. stroke, seizure, cardiovascular failure). Behavioral disturbances constitute the most dramatic and widespread effects of intoxication and withdrawal. Psychopathologic responses may include perceptual disturbances (eg. hallucinations) agitation, aggression, delirium, confusion, and profound delusional ideation. The goals of treatment are abstinence, rehabilitation, and relapse prevention. Hospital care may be necessary in certain circumstances. Regardless of where treatment takes place, a comprehensive program of supportive care, behavioral therapy, urine monitoring, and often psychopharmacologic intervention is required.
