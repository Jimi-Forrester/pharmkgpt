31957510|t|Alzheimer's disease: review of current nanotechnological therapeutic strategies.
31957510|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative pathology characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The most important markers in AD pathology include excessive accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta42) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) proteins. One of the possible therapeutic strategies entails the elimination of such deposits by inhibiting Abeta aggregation. For years, one of the major problems in the treatment of AD has been the limited ability to deliver drugs to the brain for reasons related to poor solubility, low bioavailability, and the impact of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).Areas covered: In recent years, the authors have observed an increasing scientific interest in nanotechnological solutions as the factors potentially capable of facilitating the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The authors discuss recent reports regarding the use of nanotechnology in the therapy and treatment of AD.Expert opinion: The current advances in nanotechnology promise a chance to overcome the obstacles posed by said limitations. The size and diversity of nanoparticles in terms of both composition and shape create new possibilities for a variety of therapeutic applications, also in the context of the treatment and diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases, for instance in combination with magnetic resonance imaging.
