36824709|t|The taxonomy of subjective cognitive decline: proposal and first clinical evidence from the Geneva memory clinic cohort.
36824709|a|Background: Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is characterized by subjective cognitive complaints without objective cognitive impairment and is considered a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. However, most SCD patients will not develop neurodegenerative disorders, yet they may suffer from minor psychiatric, neurological, or somatic comorbidities. The aim of the present study is to provide a taxonomy of the heterogeneous SCD entity by isolating homogenous SCD subgroups with specific clinical features and cognitive trajectories. Methods: Participants were fifty-five SCD individuals consecutively recruited at the Geneva Memory Center. Based on clinical reports, they were classified into three clinically pre-defined subgroups: (i) those with psychological or psychiatric comorbidities (Psy), (ii) those with somatic comorbidities (SomCom), (iii) and those with no apparent cause (NAC). Baseline demographics, clinical, cognitive, and biomarker differences among the SCD subgroups were assessed. Longitudinal cognitive changes (average 3 years follow-up) were modeled using a linear mixed model. Results: Out of the 55 SCD cases, 16 were SomCom, 18 Psy, and 21 NAC. 47% were female, mean age was 71 years. We observed higher frequency of APOE epsilon4 carriers in NAC (53%) compared to SomCom (14%) and Psy (0%, P=0.023) and lower level of plasma Abeta 42 in NAC (6.8+-1.0) compared to SomCom (8.4+-1.1; P=0.031). SomCom subjects were older (74 years) than Psy (67 years, P=0.011), and had greater medial temporal lobe atrophy (1.0+-1.0) than Psy (0.2+-0.6) and NAC (0.4+-0.5, P=0.005). SomCom have worse episodic memory performances (14.5+-3.5) than Psy (15.8+-0.4) and SomCom (15.1+-0.7, P=0.032). We observed a slightly steeper, yet not statistically significant, cognitive decline in NAC (beta=-0.48) compared to Psy (beta=-0.28) and SomCom (beta=-0.24). Conclusions: NAC feature higher proportion of APOE epsilon4 carriers, lower plasma Abeta42, worse memory performance, and a trend towards steeper cognitive decline than SomCom and Psy. Taken together, these findings suggest that NAC are at higher risk of cognitive decline due to AD. The proposed clinical taxonomy might be implemented in clinical practice to identify SCD at higher risk. However, such taxonomy should be tested on an independent cohort with larger sample size. .
