30023867|t|6-(Ar)Alkylamino-Substituted Uracil Derivatives: Lipid Mimetics with Potent Activity at the Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor 84 (GPR84).
30023867|a|GPR84, a Gi protein-coupled receptor that is activated by medium-chain (hydroxy)fatty acids, appears to play an important role in inflammation, immunity, and cancer. Recently, 6-octylaminouracil (4) has been reported to act as an agonist at GPR84. Here, we describe the synthesis of 69 derivatives and analogs of 4, 66 of which represent new compounds. They were evaluated in (a) cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation and (b) beta-arrestin assays in human GPR84-expressing cells. Potent nonbiased as well as G protein-biased agonists were developed, e.g., 6-hexylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (20, PSB-1584, EC50 5.0 nM (a), 3.2 nM (b), bias factor: 0) and 6-((p-chloro- and p-bromo-phenylethyl)amino)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (47, PSB-16434, EC50 7.1 nM (a), 520 nM (b), bias factor: 1.9 = 79-fold Gi pathway-selective; 48, PSB-17365, EC50 2.5 nM (a), 100 nM (b), bias factor 1.3 = 20-fold selective), which were selective versus other free fatty acid-activated receptors. Compounds 20 and 48 were found to be metabolically stable upon incubation with human liver microsomes. A pharmacophore model was created on the basis of structurally diverse lipidlike GPR84 agonists.
