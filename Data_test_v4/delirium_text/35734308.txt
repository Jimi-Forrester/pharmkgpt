35734308|a|Objective: Several lines of evidence demonstrated the role of anesthetic drugs in cognitive functions. Some anesthetic agents have been confirmed to be associated with long-term spatial memory and learning in aged animal models. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were divided into four different groups based on different concentrations of remimazolam treatments. Behavioral phenotype was observed by open field, rota rod, Morris water maze, and elevated plus maze test. Western blot was performed to see the expression pattern of different proteins. Confocal microscopy images were taken for neuronal and glial cells to see the effect of remimazolam on CNS cells. Results: We showed that remimazolam, a new anesthetic drug, impaired cognitive behavior. Repetitive doses of remimazolam have been found to induce neuronal loss with a significant change in morphology. Here, we showed that a higher concentration of remimazolam had a significant effect on CNS cell activation. We showed that remimazolam caused memory dysfunction by inducing neuronal apoptosis via glutamate excitotoxicity. It also exhibited amyloid beta plaque in the brain via abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein. Remimazolam-mediated regulation of glial cells in mouse cortex was observed and robust activation of astrocytes and microglial cells was found. Finally, we assessed the behavioral phenotype of mice and found that treatment with remimazolam induced significant behavioral changes and memory dysfunction. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the mechanism of anesthetic drug-induced memory deficits and may help improve the therapeutic effects of anesthesia agents in clinical applications.
