36899767|a|The present study aimed to determine the content of health-promoting compounds, and fatty acids, with particular emphasis on the content of cis9trans11 C18:2 (CLA) acid, selected minerals, folates in organic and commercial goat's milk and fermented goat's milk drinks. The analyzed milk and yoghurts had various contents of particular groups of fatty acids, CLA, minerals, and folates. Raw organic goat's milk had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher content of CLA (3.26 mg/g fat) compared to commercial milk (2.88 mg/g fat and 2.54 mg/g fat). Among the analyzed fermented goat's milk drinks, the highest CLA content (4.39 mg/g fat) was determined in commercial natural yoghurts, while the lowest one was in organic natural yoghurts (3.28 mg/g fat). The highest levels of calcium (1322.9-2324.4 microg/g), phosphorus (8148.1-11,309.9 microg/g), and copper (0.072-0.104 microg/g) were found in all commercial products and those of manganese (0.067-0.209 microg/g) in organic products. The contents of the other assayed elements (magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, and zinc) did not depend on the production method, but only on the product type, i.e., the degree of goat's milk processing. The highest folate content in the analyzed milks was found in the organic sample (3.16 microg/100 g). Organic Greek yoghurts had a several times higher content of folates, reaching 9.18 microg/100 g, compared to the other analyzed fermented products.
