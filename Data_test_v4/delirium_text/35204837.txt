35204837|t|The Complement System in the Central Nervous System: From Neurodevelopment to Neurodegeneration.
35204837|a|The functions of the complement system to both innate and adaptive immunity through opsonization, cell lysis, and inflammatory activities are well known. In contrast, the role of complement in the central nervous system (CNS) which extends beyond immunity, is only beginning to be recognized as important to neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. In addition to protecting the brain against invasive pathogens, appropriate activation of the complement system is pivotal to the maintenance of normal brain function. Moreover, overactivation or dysregulation may cause synaptic dysfunction and promote excessive pro-inflammatory responses. Recent studies have provided insights into the various responses of complement components in different neurological diseases and the regulatory mechanisms involved in their pathophysiology, as well as a glimpse into targeting complement factors as a potential therapeutic modality. However, there remain significant knowledge gaps in the relationship between the complement system and different brain disorders. This review summarizes recent key findings regarding the role of different components of the complement system in health and pathology of the CNS and discusses the therapeutic potential of anti-complement strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.
