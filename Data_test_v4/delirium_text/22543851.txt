22543851|t|Gintonin, a ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic acid receptor ligand, attenuates Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathies: involvement of non-amyloidogenic processing.
22543851|a|Ginseng extracts show cognition-enhancing effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, little is known about the active components and molecular mechanisms of how ginseng exerts its effects. Recently, we isolated a novel lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor-activating ligand from ginseng, gintonin. AD is caused by amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) accumulation. Abeta is derived from amyloid-beta protein precursors (AbetaPPs) through the amyloidogenic pathway. In contrast, non-amyloidogenic pathways produce beneficial, soluble AbetaPPalpha (sAbetaPPalpha). Here, we describe our investigations of the effect of gintonin on sAbetaPPalpha release, Abeta formation, Swedish-AbetaPP transfection-mediated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and Abeta-induced neuropathy in mice. Gintonin promoted sAbetaPPalpha release in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Gintonin action was also blocked by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, alpha-secretase inhibitor TAPI-2, and protein-trafficking inhibitor brefeldin. Gintonin decreased Abeta1-42 release and attenuated Abeta1-40-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Gintonin also rescued Abeta1-40-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice. Moreover, in a transgenic mouse AD model, long-term oral administration of gintonin attenuated amyloid plaque deposition as well as short- and long-term memory impairment. In the present study, we demonstrated that gintonin mediated the promotion of non-amyloidogenic processing to stimulate sAbetaPPalpha release to restore brain function in mice with AD. Gintonin could be a useful agent for AD prevention or therapy.
