34679586|t|Utilizing 3D Arterial Spin Labeling to Identify Cerebrovascular Leak and Glymphatic Obstruction in Neurodegenerative Disease.
34679586|a|New approaches are required to successfully intervene therapeutically in neurodegenerative diseases. Addressing the earliest phases of disease, blood brain barrier (BBB) leak before the accumulation of misfolded proteins has significant potential for success. To do so, however, a reliable, noninvasive and economical test is required. There are two potential methods of identifying the BBB fluid leak that results in the accumulation of normally excluded substances which alter neuropil metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation with buildup of misfolded toxic proteins. The pros and cons of dynamic contrast imaging (DCI or DCE) and 3D TGSE PASL are discussed as potential early identifying methods. The results of prior publications of the 3D ASL technique and an overview of the associated physiologic challenges are discussed. Either method may serve well as reliable physiologic markers as novel therapeutic interventions directed at the vasculopathy of early neurodegenerative disease are developed. They may serve well in addressing other neurologic diseases associated with either vascular leak and/or reduced glymphatic flow.
