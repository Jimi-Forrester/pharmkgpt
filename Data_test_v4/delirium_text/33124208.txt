33124208|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate severe periodontitis with tooth loss as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer dementia (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed dementia (MD) using the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Retrospective Cohort database with long-term follow-up over 14 years. METHODS: Multivariate Cox hazards regression analysis was applied to a longitudinal retrospective database, which was updated in 2018, to evaluate the association between severe periodontitis with few remaining teeth and dementia after adjusting for potential risk factors, including sociodemographic factors and comorbid diseases. RESULTS: Among 514,866 individuals in South Korea, 237,940 (46.2%) participants satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected. A total of 10,115 age- and sex-matched participants with severe periodontitis and 10,115 periodontally healthy participants were randomly selected and evenly assigned. The results showed that the risks of AD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08), VaD (HR, 1.24), and MD (HR, 1.16) were significantly higher in patients with severe periodontitis with 1-9 remaining teeth after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, anthropomorphic measurements, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Severe periodontitis with few remaining teeth (1-9) may be considered a modifiable risk factor for the development of AD, VaD, and MD in Korean adults.
