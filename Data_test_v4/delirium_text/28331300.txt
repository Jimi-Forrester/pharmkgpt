28331300|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in hip fractured patients is a frequent complication. Dementia is an important risk factor for delirium and is common in frail elderly. This study aimed to extend the previous knowledge on risk factors for delirium and the consequences. Special attention was given to patients with dementia and delirium. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study performed in the Amphia Hospital, Breda, the Netherlands. A full electronic patient file system (Hyperspace Version IU4: Epic, Inc., Verona, WI, USA) was used to assess data between January 2014 and September 2015. All patients presented were aged >=70 years with a hip fracture, who underwent surgery with osteosynthesis or arthroplasty. Patients were excluded in case of a pathological or a periprosthetic hip fracture, multiple traumatic injuries, and high-energy trauma. Patient and surgical characteristics were documented. Postoperative outcomes were noted. Delirium was screened using Delirium Observation Screening Scale and dementia was assessed from medical notes. RESULTS: Of a total of 566 included patients, 75% were females. The median age was 84 years (interquartile range: 9). Delirium was observed in 35%. Significant risk factors for delirium were a high American Society of Anesthesiology score, delirium in medical history, functional dependency, preoperative institutionalization, low hemoglobin level, and high amount of blood transfusion. Delirium was correlated with a longer hospital stay (P=0.001), increased association with complications (P<0.001), institutionalization (P<0.001), and 6-month mortality (P<0.001). Patients with dementia (N=168) had a higher delirium rate (57.7%, P<0.001) but a shorter hospital stay (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the 6-month mortality between delirious patients with (34.0%) and without dementia (26.3%). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with a hip fracture are vulnerable for delirium, especially when the patient has dementia. Patients who underwent an episode of delirium were at increased risk for adverse outcomes.
