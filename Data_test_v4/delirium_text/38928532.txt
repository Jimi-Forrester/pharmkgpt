38928532|t|Predicted Brain Age in First-Episode Psychosis: Association with Inexpressivity.
38928532|a|Accelerated brain aging is a possible mechanism of pathology in schizophrenia. Advances in MRI-based brain development algorithms allow for the calculation of predicted brain age (PBA) for individuals. Here, we assessed PBA in 70 first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum individuals (FESz) and 76 matched healthy neurotypical comparison individuals (HC) to determine if FESz showed advanced aging proximal to psychosis onset and whether PBA was associated with neurocognitive, social functioning, or symptom severity measures. PBA was calculated with BrainAgeR (v2.1) from T1-weighted MR scans. There were no differences in the PBAs between groups. After controlling for actual age, a "younger" PBA was associated with higher vocabulary scores among all individuals, while an "older" PBA was associated with more severe negative symptom "Inexpressivity" component scores among FESz. Female participants in both groups had an elevated PBA relative to male participants. These results suggest that a relatively younger brain age is associated with a better semantic memory performance. There is no evidence for accelerated aging in FESz with a late adolescent/early adult onset. Despite a normative PBA, FESz with a greater residual PBA showed impairments in a cluster of negative symptoms, which may indicate some underlying age-related pathology proximal to psychosis onset. Although a period of accelerated aging cannot be ruled out with disease course, it does not occur at the time of the first episode.
