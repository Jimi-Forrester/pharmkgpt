22504060|t|Brain water channel proteins in health and disease.
22504060|a|The aim of this article is to describe the roles of water channel proteins (WCPs) in brain functionality. The fluid compartments of the brain, which include the brain parenchyma (with intracellular and extracellular spaces), the intravascular and the cerebrospinal fluid compartments are presented. Then the localization and functional roles of WCPs found in the brain are described: AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9 and AQP11. In subsequent chapters the involvement of brain WCPs in pathologies are discussed: brain edema, brain trauma, brain tumors, stroke, dementia (Alzheimer's disease, human immunodeficiency virus--HIV-dementia), autism, pain signal transduction and migraine, hydrocephalus and other pathologies with neurological implications: eclampsia, uremia. New WCP ligands for brain imaging are also discussed.
