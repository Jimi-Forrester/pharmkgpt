39651698|a|The rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the associated economic impacts has prompted a global focus in the field. In recent years, there has been a growing understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD, including the aggregation of beta-amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuroinflammation. These processes collectively lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, which ultimately results in the loss of autonomy in patients. Currently, there are three main types of AD treatments: clinical tools, pharmacological treatment, and material interventions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the underlying etiology and pathogenesis of AD, as well as an overview of the current prevalence of AD treatments. We believe this article can help deepen our understanding of the AD mechanism, and facilitate the clinical translation of scientific research or therapies, to address this global problem of AD.
