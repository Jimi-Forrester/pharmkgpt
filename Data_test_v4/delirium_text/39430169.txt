39430169|a|Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. This cognitive impairment is associated with an increased permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rodents with CKD, linked to activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by indoxyl sulphate (IS). The objective of the BREIN study was to confirm the increased BBB permeability in humans with CKD. Method: The BREIN comparative study (NCT04328415) prospectively included patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and controls healthy volunteers matched in age, sex, and level of education to a patient. In all participants, BBB permeability was quantified by brain 99mTc-DTPA SPECT/CT as a percentage of injected activity (% IA). A battery of neurocognitive tests was performed, and serum uremic toxins accumulation and AhR activation were assessed. Results: Fifteen patients with ESKD and 14 healthy volunteers were analyzed. Patients with ESKD had higher BBB permeability compared to controls: 0.29 +- 0.07 versus 0.14 +- 0.06 %IA, P = 0.002. Patients with ESKD displayed lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) score: 22.0 +- 5.0 versus 27.3 +- 2.8, P = 0.008; impaired short-term memory (doors test): 12.5 +- 3.4 versus 16.5 +- 3.4, P = 0.005; higher Beck depression score 8.1 +- 9.1 versus 2.7 +- 3.4, P = 0.046; and slightly more daily cognitive complaints: 42.5 +- 29.3 versus 29.8 +- 14.0 P = 0.060. Patients with ESKD displayed higher IS levels (86.1 +- 48.4 vs. 3.2 +- 1.7 mumol/l, P = 0.001) and AhR activating potential (37.7 +- 17.8% vs. 24.7 +- 10.4%, P = 0.027). BBB permeability was inversely correlated with MoCA score (r = -0.60, 95% confidence interval [-0.772 to -0.339], P = 0.001) in the overall population. Conclusion: Patients with ESKD display an increased BBB permeability compared to matched healthy volunteers. Association with uremic toxins and cognitive impairment needs to be assessed in larger cohorts of patients.
