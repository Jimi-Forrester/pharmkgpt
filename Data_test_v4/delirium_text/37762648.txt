37762648|t|Emerging Immunotherapy Approaches for Treating Prostate Cancer.
37762648|a|Immunotherapy has emerged as an important approach for cancer treatment, but its clinical efficacy has been limited in prostate cancer compared to other malignancies. This review summarizes key immunotherapy strategies under evaluation for prostate cancer, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific T cell-engaging antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, therapeutic vaccines, and cytokines. For each modality, the rationale stemming from preclinical studies is discussed along with outcomes from completed clinical trials and strategies to improve clinical efficacy that are being tested in ongoing clinical trials. Imperative endeavors include biomarker discovery for patient selection, deciphering resistance mechanisms, refining cellular therapies such as CAR T cells, and early-stage intervention were reviewed. These ongoing efforts instill optimism that immunotherapy may eventually deliver significant clinical benefits and expand treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer.
