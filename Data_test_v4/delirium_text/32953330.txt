32953330|t|The Emerging Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Focused Ultrasound in Functional Neurosurgery.
32953330|a|Functional disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) are diverse in terms of their etiology and symptoms, however, they can be quite debilitating. Many functional neurological disorders can progress to a level where pharmaceuticals and other early lines of treatment can no longer optimally treat the condition, therefore requiring surgical intervention. A variety of stereotactic and functional neurosurgical approaches exist, including deep brain stimulation, implantation, stereotaxic lesions, and radiosurgery, among others. Most techniques are invasive or minimally invasive forms of surgical intervention and require immense precision to effectively modulate CNS circuitry. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a relatively new, safe, non-invasive neurosurgical approach that has demonstrated efficacy in treating a range of functional neurological diseases. It can function reversibly, through mechanical stimulation causing circuitry changes, or irreversibly, through thermal ablation at low and high frequencies respectively. In preliminary studies, magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) has been shown to have long-lasting treatment effects in several disease types. The technology has been approved by the FDA and internationally for a number of treatment-resistant neurological disorders and currently clinical trials are underway for several other neurological conditions. In this review, the authors discuss the potential applications and emerging role of MRgHIFU in functional neurosurgery in the coming years.
