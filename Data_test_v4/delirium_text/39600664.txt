39600664|a|Background: E-learning has emerged as a crucial technique that educators embrace and apply. Two effective e-learning materials are video-based learning (VBL) and e-book-based remote learning (EBRL). While several studies have proven their effectiveness, none have compared these e-learning materials, especially regarding caregivers' knowledge of delirium, dementia, and depression (3Ds). Based on the extant literature, many caregivers are untrained and often lack the knowledge and skills to lessen the burden on delirious, demented, and depressed older adults. Hence, there is a growing need to explore how e-learning materials will address caregivers' lack of knowledge about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry. Objectives: This study ascertained the effects of e-learning materials on caregivers' knowledge about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry and determined significant differences within and between groups. Methods: A three-arm, quasi-experimental study, which included 63 informal caregivers in Baguio City who met the inclusion criteria and were chosen through purposive sampling, was conducted. Data were gathered using the Delirium-related knowledge tool, the Bangladesh version of the Depression Literacy Questionnaire, and the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Tool version 2. Data collection was done face-to-face and was conducted from March to April 2023. Data were treated with descriptive and inferential statistics using means, paired t-test, one-way omnibus ANOVA, and the post hoc Scheffe's test. Ethics approval was provided by the Saint Louis University Research Ethics Committee (SLU-REC-UG 2023-004). Results: All the pretest mean scores of respondents in the VBL, EBRL, and control groups increased in the posttest. Additionally, the paired t-test revealed that the VBL and EBRL materials significantly affected the caregivers' knowledge about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry, evidenced by a t-statistic of -5.80 (p=0.00001) and -4.48 (p= 0.00023), respectively. Lastly, one-way ANOVA revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in mean scores between at least two groups (F(2,60) = [7.060], p=0.002). Post hoc analysis using Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons found that the mean values significantly differed between the VBL and the waitlist control group (Scheffe=10.589), and between the EBRL and the waitlist control group (Scheffe=10.589). There was no statistically significant difference between the VBL and the EBRL groups (Scheffe=0). Conclusions: This study suggests that informal caregivers in Baguio City are moderately knowledgeable about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry. Moreover, both VBL and EBRL materials showed effectiveness in improving caregivers' knowledge about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry, highlighting the substantial equivalence of both materials. Lastly, caregivers' knowledge about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry increases as they engage in e-learning materials. Thus, it is acknowledged that VBL and EBRL materials are valuable, cost-effective, and practical interventions in improving caregivers' knowledge about the 3Ds of geriatric psychiatry.
