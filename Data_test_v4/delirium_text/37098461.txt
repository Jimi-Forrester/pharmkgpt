The objective of this study was to determine the frequencies, patterns, and risk factors for cognitive impairment in a cross-sectional study of consecutive stroke patients cared for at Uganda's Mulago Hospital, located in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: 131 patients were enrolled a minimum of 3-months after hospital admission for stroke. A questionnaire, clinical examination findings, and laboratory test results were used to collect demographic information and data on vascular risk factors and clinical characteristics. Independent predictor variables associated with cognitive impairment were ascertained. Stroke impairments, disability, and handicap were assessed using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), and modified Rankin scale (mRS), respectively. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess participants' cognitive function. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables independently associated with cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The overall mean MoCA score was 11.7-points (range 0.0-28.0-points) for 128 patients with available data of whom 66.4% were categorized as cognitively impaired (MoCA < 19-points). Increasing age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07; p = 0.026), low level of education (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.25-8.33; p = 0.016), functional handicap (mRS 3-5; OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.28-2.63; p < 0.001) and high LDL cholesterol (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.14-6.56; p = 0.024) were independently associated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the high burden and need for awareness of cognitive impairment in post stroke populations in the sub-Saharan region and serve to emphasize the importance of detailed cognitive assessment as part of routine clinical evaluation of patients who have had a stroke.
