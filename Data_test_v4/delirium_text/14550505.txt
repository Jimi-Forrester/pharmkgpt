14550505|t|cDNA microarray and proteomic approaches in the study of brain diseases: focus on schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
14550505|a|Recent advances in experimental genomics and proteomics, coupled with the wealth of sequence information available for a variety of organisms, have tremendous implications for how biomedical research is performed. Genomic techniques, such as complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays, currently allow researchers to quickly and accurately quantify vast numbers of potential gene expression changes simultaneously. Modern proteomic techniques allow for the detection and elucidation of protein-protein interactions on a scale and at a speed never before possible. Although hurdles remain, together, these tools open the possibility of enormous change in our ability to analyze and interpret complex biological processes. The field of neuroscience is particularly well suited to analysis with these new techniques, given the complexity of neuronal signaling and the diversity of cellular responses. This review summarizes the major cDNA microarray and proteomic findings of relevance to schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as 2 representative areas of neuroscience research. The potential for these techniques to help unravel the underlying pathology of complex neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions is considerable and warrants continued investigation.
