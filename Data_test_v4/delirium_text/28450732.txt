28450732|a|In recent years, excessive oxidative metabolism has been reported as a critical determinant of pathogenicity in many diseases. The advent of a simple tool that can provide a physiological readout of oxidative stress would be a major step towards monitoring this dynamic process in biological systems, while also improving our understanding of this process. Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) has been proposed as a potential tool for measuring oxidative processes due to the association between UPE and reactive oxygen species. Here, we used HL-60 cells as an in vitro model to test the potential of using UPE as readout for dynamically monitoring oxidative stress after inducing respiratory burst. In addition, to probe for possible changes in oxidative metabolism, we performed targeted metabolomics on cell extracts and culture medium. Lastly, we tested the effects of treating cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). Our results show that UPE can be used as readout for measuring oxidative stress metabolism and related processes.
