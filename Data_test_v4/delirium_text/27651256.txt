27651256|t|Role of Quercetin Benefits in Neurodegeneration.
27651256|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are often life threatening and hired as an economic burden to the health-care system. Nutritional interventions principally involving polyphenols were practiced to arrest or reverse the age-related health disorders. Flavonoids, a class of dietary polyphenols, are rising to superstardom in preventing brain disorders with their potent antioxidant defense mechanism. Quercetin is a ubiquitous flavonoid reported to have all-natural myriad of health benefits. Citrus fruits, apple, onion, parsley, berries, green tea, and red wine comprise the major dietary supplements of quercetin apart from some herbal remedies like Ginkgo biloba. Appositeness of quercetin in reducing risks of neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergic disorders, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and arrhythmia, to name a few, is attributed to its highly pronounced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Neurodegeneration, characterized by progressive deterioration of the structure and function of neurons, is crucially accompanied by severe cognitive deficits. Aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) being coequal high hands. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are the key players in triggering neurodegeneration. The upsurge of neurodegenerative disorders is always appalling since there exists a paucity in effective treatment practices. Past few years' studies have underpinned the mechanisms through which quercetin boons the brain health in many aspects including betterment in cognitive output. Undoubtedly, quercetin will be escalating as an arable field, both in scientific research and in pharmacological and clinical applications.
