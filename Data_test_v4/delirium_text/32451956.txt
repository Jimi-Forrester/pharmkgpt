32451956|t|A Review of the Cholinergic System and Therapeutic Approaches to Treat Brain Disorders.
32451956|a|Since its identification over a hundred years ago, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) has proven to play an essential role in supporting many diverse functions. Some well-characterized functions include: chemical transmission at the neuromuscular junction; autonomic function in the peripheral nervous system; and, sustained attention, sleep/wake regulation, and learning and memory within the central nervous system. Within the brain, major cholinergic projection pathways from the basal forebrain and the brainstem support these centrally mediated processes, and dysregulation of the cholinergic system is implicated in cognitive decline associated with aging and dementias including Alzheimer's disease. ACh exerts its effects by binding to two different membrane-bound receptor classes: (1) G-protein coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), and (2) ligand-gated nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). These receptor systems are described in detail within this chapter along with discussion on the successes and failures of synthetic ligands designed to selectively target receptor subtypes for treating brain disorders. New molecular approaches and advances in our understanding of the target biology combined with opportunities to re-purpose existing cholinergic drugs for new indications continue to highlight the exciting opportunities for modulating this system for therapeutic purposes.
