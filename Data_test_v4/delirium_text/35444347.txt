35444347|t|Identification of Brain Regions Activated by Sevoflurane and Propofol and Regional Changes in Gene Expression.
35444347|a|General anesthetics have different efficacies and side effect incidences based on their mechanism of action. However, detailed comparative studies of anesthetics are incomplete. In this study, target brain regions and gene expression changes in these brain regions were determined for sevoflurane and propofol to understand the mechanisms that cause differences among anesthetics. Rats were anesthetized with sevoflurane or propofol for 1 hr, and brain regions with anesthesia-induced changes in neuronal activity were examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for c-Fos. Among the identified target brain regions, gene expression analysis was performed in the habenula, the solitary nucleus and the medial vestibular nucleus from laser microdissected samples. Genes altered by sevoflurane and propofol were different and included genes involved in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and emergence agitation, such as Egr1 and Gad2. GO enrichment analysis showed that the altered genes tended to be evenly distributed in all functional category. The detailed profiles of target brain regions and induced gene expression changes of sevoflurane and propofol in this study will provide a basis for analyzing the effects of each anesthetic agent and the risk of adverse events.
