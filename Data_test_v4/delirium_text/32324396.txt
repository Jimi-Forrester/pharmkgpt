32324396|t|p62/SQSTM1, a Central but Unexploited Target: Advances in Its Physiological/Pathogenic Functions and Small Molecular Modulators.
32324396|a|p62/SQSTM1, encoded by gene SQSTM1, is widely known as an adaptor protein of selective autophagy to promote aggregate-prone proteins for degradation. It is also a stress-induced scaffold protein involved in Nrf2 activation to resist oxidative stress. Multiple domains of p62 interact with several essential pathways implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation, placing p62 at a significant position to mediate cell survival and apoptosis. The p62 protein has been suggested as a potential target in recent years, since its abnormal expression or SQSTM1 gene mutation is tightly associated with various diseases including cancer such as hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and Paget's disease of bone. In this review, we will discuss the relationship between p62 and these diseases, and we attempt to put forward novel methods for current diagnosis or therapy by regulating the p62 expression level.
