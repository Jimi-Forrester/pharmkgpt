35457278|t|Psoriasis and Systemic Inflammatory Disorders.
35457278|a|Psoriasis is a representative inflammatory skin disease occupied by large surface involvement. As inflammatory cells and cytokines can systemically circulate in various organs, it has been speculated that psoriatic skin inflammation influences the systemic dysfunction of various organs. Recent updates of clinical studies and experimental studies showed the important interaction of psoriasis to systemic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the importance of systemic therapy in severe psoriasis is also highlighted to prevent the development of systemic inflammatory diseases. In this review, we introduced representative systemic inflammatory diseases associated with psoriasis and the detailed molecular mechanisms.
