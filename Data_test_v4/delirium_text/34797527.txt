34797527|t|Posttreatment Strategy Against Hypoxia and Ischemia Based on Selective Targeting of Nonnuclear Estrogen Receptors with PaPE-1.
34797527|a|Newly synthesized Pathway Preferential Estrogen-1 (PaPE-1) selectively activates membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), namely, mERalpha and mERbeta, and has been shown to evoke neuroprotection; however, its effectiveness in protecting brain tissue against hypoxia and ischemia has not been verified in a posttreatment paradigm. This is the first study showing that a 6-h delayed posttreatment with PaPE-1 inhibited hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal death, as indicated by neutral red uptake in mouse primary cell cultures in vitro. The effect was accompanied by substantial decreases in neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in terms of LDH release and Fluoro-Jade C staining of damaged cells, respectively. The mechanisms of the neuroprotective action of PaPE-1 also involved apoptosis inhibition demonstrated by normalization of both mitochondrial membrane potential and expression levels of apoptosis-related genes and proteins such as Fas, Fasl, Bcl2, FAS, FASL, BCL2, BAX, and GSK3beta. Furthermore, PaPE-1-evoked neuroprotection was mediated through a reduction in ROS formation and restoration of cellular metabolic activity that had become dysregulated due to hypoxia and ischemia. These data provide evidence that targeting membrane non-GPER estrogen receptors with PaPE-1 is an effective therapy that protects brain neurons from hypoxic/ischemic damage, even when applied with a 6-h delay from injury onset.
