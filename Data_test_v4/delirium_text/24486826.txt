24486826|t|Memory training for individuals with Alzheimer's disease improves name recall.
24486826|a|Alzheimer's disease is clinically characterized by a variety of progressive cognitive deficits, most notably an impaired ability to acquire new information, such as name recall. Eleven demented patients and 11 controls participated in a 4 week memory program that included training in name-face recall. Individuals were taught strategies for name-face rehearsal, and administered task specific and standardized tests to assess the intervention efficacy. During the memory training patients improved recall of names and faces (p < 0.05), while controls remained stable. Patients also improved on the weekly standardized measures, including the Kendrick Digit Copy and Geriatric Depression Scale (p < 0.05). Thus, the memory training can be beneficial for improving name recall and some aspects of behavior. This can provide a framework for development of programs to enhance cognitive function in patients with dementia and may tap biological mechanisms that promote neural plasticity to compensate for the degenerative condition.
