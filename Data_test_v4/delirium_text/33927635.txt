33927635|t|MicroRNA-29c Acting on FOS Plays a Significant Role in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Through the Interleukin-17 Signaling Pathway.
33927635|a|Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common hepatic disease in western countries and is even more ubiquitous in Asian countries. Our study determined that TH17/Treg cells were imbalanced in animal models. Based on our interest in the mechanism underlying TH17/Treg cell imbalance in nonalcoholic fatty liver mice, we conducted a joint bioinformatics analysis to further investigate this process. Common gene sequencing analysis was based on one trial from one sequencing platform, where gene expression analysis and enrichment analysis were the only analyses performed. We compared different sequencing results from different trials performed using different sequencing platforms, and we utilized the intersection of these analytical results to perform joint analysis. We used a bioinformatics analysis method to perform enrichment analysis and map interaction network analysis and predict potential microRNA sites. Animal experiments were also designed to validate the results of the data analysis based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting. Our results revealed 8 coexisting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 7 hinge genes. The identified DEGs may influence nonalcoholic steatosis hepatitis through the interleukin-17 pathway. We found that microRNA-29c interacts with FOS and IGFBP1. Polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed both FOS and microRNA-29c expression in NASH mice, and western blot analyses indicated the same trend with regard to FOS protein levels. Based on these results, we suggest that microRNA-29c acts on FOS via the interleukin-17 signaling pathway to regulate TH17/Treg cells in NASH patients.
