39051174|a|Cognitive complaints are common in elderly subjects and are a frequent reason for referral to memory clinics. If the complaints are not associated with objective cognitive impairment, the condition is labelled subjective cognitive decline (SCD). SCD is often considered as a stage antedating objective impairment, and an at-risk condition for subsequent dementia. Recent large-scale studies indicate that a significantly increased risk of clinical progression in subjects with SCD is associated with positivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, a finding supporting the notion that SCD can be due to different mechanisms not associated with neurodegeneration, including functional cognitive disorders. In this paper we present a selective review of research on the relations among SCD, cognitive awareness, and metacognitive abilities. We propose that longitudinal studies of metacognitive efficiency in SCD may provide useful cues about the risk of progression to dementia and the possible presence of a functional cognitive disorder, with different implications for the management of this prevalent aging-related condition. HIGHLIGHTS: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a common cause of referral to memory clinics, can be due to multiple conditions. The predictive value of SCD for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is high in association with AD biomarker positivity. The awareness of cognitive decline is the mechanism responsible for the emergence of SCD and metacognition is the underlying neuropsychological function. The awareness of cognitive decline in clinical patients is usually assessed comparing an informant rating to the patient self-assessment, a method that can be affected by informant bias. While there is strong evidence that awareness starts to decline with the onset of objective cognitive impairment, progressively leading to the anosognosia of AD, the status of metacognitive efficiency in SCD needs to be further investigated. Quantitative, performance-based indexes of metacognitive efficiency may contribute both to the assessment of progression risk and to the management of subjects with functional cognitive disorders.
