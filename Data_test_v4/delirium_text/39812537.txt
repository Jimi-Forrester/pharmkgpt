39812537|t|TBC1D15 Inhibits Autophagy of Microglia through Maintaining the Damaged Swelling Lysosome in Alzheimer's Disease.
39812537|a|Autophagy in microglia is essential for the clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. However, reports regarding the levels of autophagy in microglia have been inconsistent; some studies indicate an early enhancement followed by a subsequent reduction, while others describe a persistently weakened state. Notably, there is a lack of systematic studies documenting the temporal changes in microglial autophagy. TBC1D15, a Rab GTPase, plays a crucial role in lysosomal membrane repair, yet its function in regulating microglial autophagy in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. Current research suggests that microglial autophagy is activated in 3-month-old AD mice but gradually decreases by 12 months of age. Furthermore, TBC1D15 levels are significantly elevated in the lysosomes of microglia in Alzheimer's disease. Silencing TBC1D15 markedly inhibits swelling and Abeta phagocytosis in BV2 cells following Abeta treatment while simultaneously promoting autophagy and lysophagy. LIMP II/ATG8-TBC1D15-Dynamin2/RAB7 might participate in lysosome swelling of microglia in AD. These findings indicate that TBC1D15 in microglia is critical for the decline of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease. It is suggested that targeting microglial TBC1D15 may be an important strategy for enhancing autophagy, which facilitates the clearance of amyloid plaques as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.
