34286263|a|Advances in critical care medicine have led to reduced mortality but increased morbidity. Post-intensive care unit syndrome (PICS) develops after critical illness and presents as cognitive, physical and/or psychosocial impairments. PICS is prevalent in 10 - 36% of patients after discharge from paediatric intensive care unit. Multiple risk factors are associated with PICS, but there is no single causal factor. Factors range from clinical illnesses to intensive care intervention. The care plan should be aimed at prevention, early identification and post-ICU management of PICS by a multidisciplinary team.
