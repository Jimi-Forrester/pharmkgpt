34695572|a|Innate immune responses to emerging RNA viruses are increasingly recognized as having significant contributions to neurologic sequelae, especially memory disorders. Using a recovery model of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, we show that, while macrophages deliver the antiviral and anti-neurogenic cytokine IL-1beta during acute infection; viral recovery is associated with continued astrocyte inflammasome-mediated production of inflammatory levels of IL-1beta, which is maintained by hippocampal astrogenesis via IL-1R1 signaling in neural stem cells (NSC). Accordingly, aberrant astrogenesis is prevented in the absence of IL-1 signaling in NSC, indicating that only newly generated astrocytes exert neurotoxic effects, preventing synapse repair and promoting spatial learning deficits. Ex vivo evaluation of IL-1beta-treated adult hippocampal NSC revealed the upregulation of developmental differentiation pathways that derail adult neurogenesis in favor of astrogenesis, following viral infection. We conclude that NSC-specific IL-1 signaling within the hippocampus during viral encephalitis prevents synapse recovery and promotes spatial learning defects via altered fates of NSC progeny that maintain inflammation.
