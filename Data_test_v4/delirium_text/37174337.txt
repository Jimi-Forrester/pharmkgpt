37174337|a|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is highly enriched in the brain, and is essential for normal brain development and function. However, evidence suggests that currently used supplements, such as fish oil, do not significantly increase brain DHA levels. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether combined fish oil and choline supplementation could affect the type and enrich the content of DHA in the brain. The results revealed that the combined intake of fish oil and choline upregulated the expression of key transporters and receptors, including MFSD2A, FATP1, and FABP5, which increased the uptake of DHA in the brain. Additionally, this supplementation improved the synthesis and release of acetylcholine in the brain, which, in turn, enhanced the learning and memory abilities of mice. These findings suggest that the combined intake of fish oil and choline improves the bioavailability of DHA in the brain.
