31818900|a|A 50-year-old Indigenous woman, on home haemodialysis, was found to have a large mycotic aneurysm of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery at the site of a previous drug-eluting stent. Blood cultures grew methicillin-sensitive S taphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. She underwent a complex operation involving resection of the mycotic aneurysm, removal of the stent and a coronary artery bypass graft to the distal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery using the left internal mammary artery. She had a complicated intensive care unit admission with pericardial tamponade on day 1 postoperatively requiring reopening and removal of clot and type 1 respiratory failure requiring reintubation on day 10 postoperatively. Once extubated, she developed prolonged hyperactive delirium and a significant decline in mobility. Over the course of a 6-week hospital admission, she received extensive multidisciplinary care and was discharged for rehabilitation to a peripheral hospital. She was discharged home after rehabilitation with ongoing follow-up with infectious diseases.
