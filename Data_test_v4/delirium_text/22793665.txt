22793665|t|Discovery of 3-(5-chloro-2-furoyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane (TC-6683, AZD1446), a novel highly selective alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist for the treatment of cognitive disorders.
22793665|a|Diversification of essential nicotinic cholinergic pharmacophoric elements, i.e., cationic center and hydrogen bond acceptor, resulted in the discovery of novel potent alpha4beta2 nAChR selective agonists comprising a series of N-acyldiazabicycles. Core characteristics of the series are an exocyclic carbonyl moiety as a hydrogen bond acceptor and endocyclic secondary amino group. These features are positioned at optimal distance and with optimal relative spatial orientation to provide near optimal interactions with the receptor. A novel potent and highly selective alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist 3-(5-chloro-2-furoyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane (56, TC-6683, AZD1446) with favorable pharmaceutical properties and in vivo efficacy in animal models has been identified as a potential treatment for cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric or neurological conditions and is currently being progressed to phase 2 clinical trials as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
