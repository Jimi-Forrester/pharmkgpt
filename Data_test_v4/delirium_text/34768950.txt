34768950|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia in older adults and is fast becoming a major societal and economic burden due to an increase in life expectancy. Age seems to be the major factor driving AD, and currently, only symptomatic treatments are available. AD has a complex etiology, although mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic abnormalities have been widely and deeply investigated as plausible mechanisms for its neuropathology. Abeta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, along with cognitive deficits and behavioral problems, are the hallmarks of the disease. Restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics, prevention of oxidative stress, and diet and exercise seem to be effective in reducing Abeta and in ameliorating learning and memory problems. Many mitochondria-targeted antioxidants have been tested in AD and are currently in development. However, larger streamlined clinical studies are needed to provide hard evidence of benefits in AD. This review discusses the causative factors, as well as potential therapeutics employed in the treatment of AD.
