39655696|a|Neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) control synaptic responses by modulating the concentration of neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and needs to be finely tuned in time and space to maintain a healthy brain and precise neurotransmission. The glutamate transporter EAAT2 (SLC1A2) is primarily responsible for glutamate clearance. EAAT2 impairment has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to both monogenic and sporadic forms of PD, of which the common substitution Gly2019Ser is associated with a significant deficit in EAAT2 expression. The role of pathological mutants of the LRRK2 is intensively studied and reviewed. Here we have focused the attention on the physiological role of LRRK2 on EAAT2, comparing the activity of NTTs with or without the LRRK2 kinase. By heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp, the current amplitudes of the selected NTTs and kinetic parameters have been collected in the presence and absence of LRRK2. The results show that EAAT2 expression and function are impaired in the absence of the kinase and also under its pharmacological inhibition via MLi-2 treatment. LRRK2 stabilizes EAAT2 expression increasing the amount of transporter at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the LRRK2 action is EAAT2-specific, as we observed no significant changes in the transport current amplitude and kinetic parameters obtained for the other excitatory and inhibitory NTTs studied. This study, for the first time, demonstrates the physiological importance of LRRK2 in EAAT2 function, highlighting the specificity of LRRK2-mediated modulation of EAAT2 and suggesting a potential role for the kinase as a checkpoint for preserving neurons from excitotoxicity. In brain conditions associated with impaired glutamate clearance, targeting LRRK2 for EAAT2 regulation may offer novel therapeutic opportunities.
