36142166|t|Recent Advances in Prion Inactivation by Plasma Sterilizer.
36142166|a|Prions, which cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a notorious group of infectious agents with possibly the highest resistance to complete inactivation. Although various gas plasma instruments have been developed, studies on prion inactivation using gas plasma instruments are limited. Among them, the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma instrument, STERRAD  (Advanced Sterilization Products; ASP, Johnson & Johnson, Irvine, CA, USA), is recommended for prion inactivation of heat-sensitive medical devices. However, STERRAD  is not a plasma sterilizer but a hydrogen peroxide gas sterilizer. In STERRAD , plasma generated by radio frequency (RF) discharge removes excess hydrogen peroxide gas and does not contribute to sterilization. This is also supported by evidence that the instrument was not affected by the presence or absence of RF gas plasma. However, recent studies have shown that other gas plasma instruments derived from air, nitrogen, oxygen, Ar, and a mixture of gases using corona, dielectric barrier, microwave, and pulse discharges can inactivate scrapie prions. As inactivation studies on prions other than scrapie are limited, further accumulation of evidence on the effectiveness of gas plasma using human-derived prion samples is warranted for practical purposes.
