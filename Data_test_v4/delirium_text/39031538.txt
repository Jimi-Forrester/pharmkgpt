39031538|t|A Biocompatible Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) as Sonosensitizer and Artificial Enzyme for In-Depth Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
39031538|a|Current phototherapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit restricted clinical outcomes due to the limited physical penetration and comprised brain microenvironment of noninvasive nanomedicine. Herein, a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) based sonosensitizer is designed and synthesized. Mn-TCPP, a planar molecule where Mn2+ ion is chelated in the core with a large p-conjugated system and 4 carboxylate acid groups, has been successfully used as building blocks to construct an ultrasound-sensitive HOF (USI-MHOF), which can go deep in the brain of AD animal models. The both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that USI-MHOF can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) and oxidize beta-amyloid (Abeta) to inhibit aggregation, consequently attenuating Abeta neurotoxicity. More intriguingly, USI-MHOF exhibits catalase (CAT)- and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activities, mitigating neuron oxidative stress and reprograming the brain microenvironment. For better crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the peptide KLVFFAED (KD8) has been covalently grafted to USI-MHOF for improving BBB permeability and Abeta selectivity. Further, in vivo experiments demonstrate a significant reduction of the craniocerebral Abeta plaques and improvement of the cognition deficits in triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice models following deep-penetration ultrasound treatment. The work provides the first example of an ultrasound-responsive biocompatible HOF as non-invasive nanomedicine for in-depth treatment of AD.
