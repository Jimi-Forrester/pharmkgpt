38953089|t|Turn Up the Heat: A Case Report of Malignant Hyperthermia During Ambulatory Surgery.
38953089|a|Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of general anesthesia involving the uncontrolled release of calcium when exposed to triggers such as depolarizing muscle relaxants or volatile anesthetics. It presents as a hypercatabolic skeletal muscle syndrome that results in tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperkalemia. This report presents the case of a 67-year-old female without a personal or family history of complications with anesthesia who experienced malignant hyperthermia during an elective hysterectomy. The patient was given multiple doses of dantrolene, with the ultimate resolution of her symptoms several days after surgery. She was discharged one week after surgery.
