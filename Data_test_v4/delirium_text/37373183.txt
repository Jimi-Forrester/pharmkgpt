37373183|t|Mitochondrial Regulation of Ferroptosis in Cancer Therapy.
37373183|a|Ferroptosis, characterized by glutamate overload, glutathione depletion, and cysteine/cystine deprivation during iron- and oxidative-damage-dependent cell death, is a particular mode of regulated cell death. It is expected to effectively treat cancer through its tumor-suppressor function, as mitochondria are the intracellular energy factory and a binding site of reactive oxygen species production, closely related to ferroptosis. This review summarizes relevant research on the mechanisms of ferroptosis, highlights mitochondria's role in it, and collects and classifies the inducers of ferroptosis. A deeper understanding of the relationship between ferroptosis and mitochondrial function may provide new strategies for tumor treatment and drug development based on ferroptosis.
