26045033|t|Covalent modifier-type aggregation inhibitor of amyloid-beta based on a cyclo-KLVFF motif.
26045033|a|Inhibition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation could be a drug development target for treating Alzheimer disease. Insufficient activity to inhibit aggregation, however, remains a key issue. Here, we report a covalent modifier-type aggregation inhibitor of Abeta, diazirine-equipped cyclo-KLVF(beta-Ph)F (2). Due to the affinity of the cyclo-KLVFF motif for Abeta, 2 selectively reacted with Abeta1-42 under UV-light irradiation to form an irreversible covalent bond. The Tyr-10 residue of Abeta1-42 was identified as the covalent modification site with 2. The extent of cross-beta-sheet structure, characteristics of amyloid aggregation, and toxicity of Abeta1-42 were strongly attenuated by this chemical modification.
