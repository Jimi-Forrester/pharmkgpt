39744263|t|Sepsis in Aging Populations: A Review of Risk Factors, Diagnosis, and Management.
39744263|a|Sepsis remains a significant global health concern, particularly among aging populations. This comprehensive review examines the complex interplay between aging and sepsis, focusing on risk factors, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies specific to older adults. The study explores the physiological changes associated with aging that contribute to increased sepsis susceptibility, including immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. It delves into the unique pathophysiology of sepsis in the elderly, highlighting the role of comorbidities and age-related immune dysfunction. The review emphasizes the importance of early recognition and tailored interventions for sepsis in older patients, addressing the often atypical presentation of symptoms in this population. By synthesizing current research and clinical guidelines, this study aims to enhance understanding of sepsis in aging populations and improve outcomes through targeted prevention, prompt diagnosis, and effective management strategies. The findings underscore the need for age-specific approaches in sepsis care and highlight areas for future research to address the growing burden of sepsis in an aging global population.
