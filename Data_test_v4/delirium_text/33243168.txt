33243168|a|BACKGROUND: We compared outcomes and toxicities between concurrent retrograde super-selective intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy (IACRT) and concurrent systemic chemoradiotherapy (SCRT) for gingival carcinoma (GC). METHODS: We included 84 consecutive patients who were treated for non-metastatic GC >= stage III, from 2006 to 2018, in this retrospective analysis (IACRT group: n = 66; SCRT group: n = 18). RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 24 (range: 1-124) months. The median prescribed dose was 60 (6-70.2) Gy (IACRT: 60 Gy; SCRT: 69 Gy). There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of 3-year overall survival (OS; IACRT: 78.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 66.0-87.6; SCRT: 50.4, 95% CI: 27.6-73.0; P = 0.039), progression-free survival (PFS; IACRT: 75.6, 95% CI: 62.7-85.2; SCRT: 42.0, 95% CI: 17.7-70.9; P = 0.028) and local control rates (LC; IACRT: 77.2, 95% CI: 64.2-86.4; SCRT: 42.0, 95% CI: 17.7-70.9; P = 0.015). In univariate analysis, age >= 65 years, decreased performance status (PS) and SCRT were significantly associated with worse outcomes (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, age >= 65 years, clinical stage IV, and SCRT were significantly correlated with a poor OS rate (P < 0.05). Patients with poorer PS had a significantly worse PFS rate. Regarding acute toxicity, 22 IACRT patients had grade 4 lymphopenia, and osteoradionecrosis was the most common late toxicity in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to compare outcomes from IACRT and SCRT among patients with GC. ALL therapy related toxicities were manageable. IACRT is an effective and safe treatment for GC.
