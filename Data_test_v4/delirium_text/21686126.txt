21686126|t|An assessment of CETP sequence variation in relation to cognitive decline and dementia risk.
21686126|a|The gene encoding the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays an integral role in lipid metabolism. We evaluated common genetic variation spanning CETP for association with cognitive decline as well as incident and prevalent dementia and Alzheimer disease risk. Data from four population-based twin studies and a case-control sample were included, encompassing an analysis sample of 1513 dementia cases and 2137 controls with available CETP genotypes and covariates. Memory and perceptual speed performance was assessed over 16 years in up to 1540 participants. Only sporadic associations were observed across 26 markers and were largely consistent with statistical noise. Polymorphism in CETP is unlikely to contribute to cognitive change or dementia risk.
