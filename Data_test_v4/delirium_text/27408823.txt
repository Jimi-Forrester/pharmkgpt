27408823|t|Polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E and aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: A meta-analysis.
27408823|a|Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is characterised by bleeding in the subarachnoid space in the brain. There are various polymorphisms in genes which are associated with this disease. We performed a systematic meta- analysis to investigate the relationship of APOE polymorphism on aSAH. A comprehensive literature search was done in the Pubmed database, Science Direct, Cochrane library and Google Scholar. The OR and 95% CI were evaluated for the gene and aSAH association using fixed and random effect models. Publication bias was assessed using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test. All statistical evaluations were done using the software Review Manager 5.0 and Comprehensive Meta Analysis v2.2.023. A total of 9 studies were assessed on APOE polymorphism (1100 Cases, 2732 Control). Meta analysis results showed significant association in epsilon2/ epsilon2 versus epsilon3/epsilon3, epsilon2 versus epsilon3 genetic models and epsilon2 allele frequency. In subgroup analysis statistically significant association was observed in Asians in the genetic models epsilon2/ epsilon2 versus epsilon3/epsilon3, epsilon2/epsilon3 versus epsilon3/epsilon3, epsilon2 versus epsilon3 and also in epsilon2 allele frequency. However, in Caucasian population only epsilon2/epsilon2 versus epsilon3/epsilon3 genetic model showed significant association between APOE and risk of aSAH. In this meta-analysis study, the epsilon2/epsilon2 genotype is associated with increased risk of aSAH.
