36435797|a|BACKGROUND: Despite limited efficiency, modulation of microglia/macrophages has shown to attenuate neuroinflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this context, we evaluated the efficacy of modified exosomal signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) variants (SIRPalpha-v Exos) in microglia/macrophages and neuroinflammation-associated white matter injury after ICH. METHODS: SIRPalpha-v Exos were engineered to block CD47-SIRPalpha interactions. After obtaining SIRPalpha-v Exos from lentivirus-infected mesenchymal stem cells, C57BL/6 mice suffering from ICH underwent consecutive intravenous injections of SIRPalpha-v Exos (6 mg/kg) for 14 days. Afterwards, the volume of hematoma and neurological dysfunctions were assessed in mice continuously until 35 days after ICH. In addition, demyelination, electrophysiology and neuroinflammation were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanisms of microglial regulation by SIRPalpha-v Exos were investigated in vitro under coculture conditions. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the clearance of hematoma in mice suffering from ICH was accelerated after SIRPalpha-v Exo treatment. SIRPalpha-v Exos improved long-term neurological dysfunction by ameliorating white matter injury. In addition, SIRPalpha-v Exos recruited regulatory T cells (Tregs) to promote M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages in the peri-hematoma tissue. In vitro experiments further showed that SIRPalpha-v Exos regulated primary microglia in a direct and indirect manner in synergy with Tregs. CONCLUSION: Our studies revealed that SIRPalpha-v Exos could accelerate the clearance of hematoma and ameliorate secondary white matter injury after ICH through regulation of microglia/macrophages. SIRPalpha-v Exos may become a promising treatment for ICH in clinical practice.
