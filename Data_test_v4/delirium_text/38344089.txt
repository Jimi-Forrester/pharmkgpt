38344089|t|Neuroprotection: Surgical approaches in traumatic brain injury.
38344089|a|Background: This review is centered on the pivotal role of surgical interventions within the comprehensive management of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Surgical strategies are indispensable components of TBI care, encompassing primary injury management and the alleviation of secondary injury processes, including the handling of intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs), contusions, and mass lesions. Methods: A systematic review was carried out by searching databases including PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. The inclusion criteria involved studies discussing surgical strategies for TBI, with a focus on primary injury management, ICHs, contusions, and mass lesions. More recent articles were prioritized, and data were synthesized to assess the impact of surgical interventions on TBI outcomes. Results: The evolution of surgical technologies has heralded a transformation in TBI management. These advancements encompass minimally invasive procedures, neuroimaging-guided surgeries, and robotic-assisted techniques, all geared toward optimizing patient outcomes. Conclusion: Surgical interventions within TBI care present unique challenges, such as timing considerations, patient selection criteria, and postoperative care. This review underscores the critical significance of multidisciplinary collaboration among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and critical care specialists. Such collaboration is essential to tailor surgical strategies to the individualized needs of patients. Moreover, the review highlights emerging trends in TBI surgery and underscores the ongoing imperative of research endeavors aimed at refining surgical protocols and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
