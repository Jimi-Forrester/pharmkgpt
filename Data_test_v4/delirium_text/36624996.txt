METHODS: This prospective, single-center, observational study was conducted from June 2019 to December 2021. ICP and albumin quotient values were measured on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 of hospitalization. Malignant BBB disruption was defined as the sum of scores for the degree of BBB disruption >=9 on days 1 to 4. RESULTS: ICP in OHCA patients without malignant BBB disruption on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 of hospitalization was 9.58+-0.53, 12.32+-0.65, 14.39+-0.76, and 13.88+-0.87 mmHg, respectively, and in OHCA patients with malignant BBB disruption 13.65+-0.74, 15.72+-0.67, 16.10+-0.92, and 15.22+-0.87 mmHg, respectively (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.150, and P=0.280, respectively). The P-values of changes in ICP between days 1 and 2, days 2 and 3, and days 3 and 4 of hospitalization in OHCA patients without malignant BBB disruption were P<0.001, P=0.001, and P=0.540, respectively, and in OHCA patients with malignant BBB disruption were P=0.002, P=0.550, and P=0.100, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among OHCA patients treated with target temperature management, ICP was higher on days 1 and 2 of hospitalization and an increase in ICP occurred earlier with malignant BBB disruption than without malignant BBB disruption.
