21719151|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common and serious complication in older patients, associated with increased, potentially preventable, morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated costs of delirium during hospitalization in a university affiliated hospital in Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of consecutive patients 65 years and older, admitted to a medical ward. A psychogeriatric team assessed patients during the first and every 48h until discharge using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-S), length of hospital stay, pharmacy and total hospitalization costs were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using bivariate and multivariate analysis according to delirium diagnosis. RESULTS: Data from 454 patients was analyzed, 160 of them in a delirium cohort (35.2%) and 294 in a non-delirium cohort (64.8%). The delirium cohort had a longer hospital stay (DATA) and higher mortality (7.0% versus 1.7%). The median of total costs of delirium during hospital stay was 38.7% higher than the non-delirium cohort (P<.001). Total costs were significantly higher in the delirium cohort after adjustment of covariables (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that delirium is associated with significantly greater costs. Considering that effective delirium prevention is possible, the knowledge of associated costs can help health care providers to justify prevention strategies and finally give better care for older patients.
