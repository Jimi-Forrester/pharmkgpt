38491918|a|Dysregulation of the peripheral immune system is be involved in the neuroinflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD) and accelerate the disease progression. The contribution of immune cells, particularly B cells, to AD pathogenesis has gained attention in recent research. In this study, we investigated the role of Peripheral Blood Memory B cells (PBMBs) and their secreted Migration Inhibition Factor (MIF) in driving macrophage behavior in AD based on the scRNA-seq technique, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We discovered that MIF binds to the CD74-CD44 receptor complex on macrophages, influencing their behavior. The dysregulated macrophage response hampers the clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, exacerbating AD pathology. Targeting the MIF-CD74-CD44 signal pathway may hold therapeutic potential in modulating macrophage activity and mitigating neuroinflammation in AD. This study provides a further understanding of peripheral immune cells dysregulated in AD.
