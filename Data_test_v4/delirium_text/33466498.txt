33466498|t|The Association between Hepatic Encephalopathy and Diabetic Encephalopathy: The Brain-Liver Axis.
33466498|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is one of the main consequences of liver disease and is observed in severe liver failure and cirrhosis. Recent studies have provided significant evidence that HE shows several neurological symptoms including depressive mood, cognitive dysfunction, impaired circadian rhythm, and attention deficits as well as motor disturbance. Liver disease is also a risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is characterized by cognitive dysfunction and motor impairment. Recent research investigated the relationship between metabolic changes and the pathogenesis of neurological disease, indicating the importance between metabolic organs and the brain. Given that a diverse number of metabolites and changes in the brain contribute to neurologic dysfunction, HE and DE are emerging types of neurologic disease. Here, we review significant evidence of the association between HE and DE, and summarise the common risk factors. This review may provide promising therapeutic information and help to design a future metabolic organ-related study in relation to HE and DE.
