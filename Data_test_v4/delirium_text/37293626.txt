37293626|t|Tackling the glial scar in spinal cord regeneration: new discoveries and future directions.
37293626|a|Axonal regeneration and functional recovery are poor after spinal cord injury (SCI), typified by the formation of an injury scar. While this scar was traditionally believed to be primarily responsible for axonal regeneration failure, current knowledge takes a more holistic approach that considers the intrinsic growth capacity of axons. Targeting the SCI scar has also not reproducibly yielded nearly the same efficacy in animal models compared to these neuron-directed approaches. These results suggest that the major reason behind central nervous system (CNS) regeneration failure is not the injury scar but a failure to stimulate axon growth adequately. These findings raise questions about whether targeting neuroinflammation and glial scarring still constitute viable translational avenues. We provide a comprehensive review of the dual role of neuroinflammation and scarring after SCI and how future research can produce therapeutic strategies targeting the hurdles to axonal regeneration posed by these processes without compromising neuroprotection.
