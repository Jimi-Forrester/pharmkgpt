38999082|t|Zinc Toxicity: Understanding the Limits.
38999082|a|Zinc, a vital trace element, holds significant importance in numerous physiological processes within the body. It participates in over 300 enzymatic reactions, metabolic functions, regulation of gene expression, apoptosis and immune modulation, thereby demonstrating its essential role in maintaining overall health and well-being. While zinc deficiency is associated with significant health risks, an excess of this trace element can also lead to harmful effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 6.7 to 15 mg per day are referred to be the dietary reference value. An excess of the recommended daily intake may result in symptoms such as anemia, neutropenia and zinc-induced copper deficiency. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) defines the tolerable upper intake level (UL) as 25 mg per day, whereas the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows 40 mg per day. This review will summarize the current knowledge regarding the calculation of UL and other health risks associated with zinc. For example, zinc intake is not limited to oral consumption; other routes, such as inhalation or topical application, may also pose risks of zinc intoxication.
