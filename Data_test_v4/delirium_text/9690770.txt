9690770|a|Researchers have recently reported a possible inverse relationship between taking steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or both, and the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this article it is hypothesized that the reduction in the human body of the amount of available arachidonic acid, the precursor of inflammatory eicosanoids, by dietary methods might offer a path to prevention of Alzheimer's disease without resorting to drugs having potentially harmful side effects, and without inhibiting the production of highly important, non-inflammatory eicosanoids.
