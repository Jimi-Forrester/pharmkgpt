31728362|t|Sedation strategies in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS).
31728362|a|In this review, we discuss the changing landscape of sedation in mechanically ventilated children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). While previous approaches advocated for early and deep sedation with benzodiazepines, emerging literature has highlighted the benefits of light sedation and use of non-benzodiazepine sedating agents, such as dexmedetomidine. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of monitoring multiple factors including, but not limited to, sedation depth, analgesia efficacy, opiate withdrawal, and development of delirium. Through this approach, we hope to improve PARDS outcomes. Overall, more research is needed to further our understanding of the best sedation strategies in children with PARDS.
