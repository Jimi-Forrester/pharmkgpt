37550432|a|Pancreatic cancer(PC) is less common than other cancers; however, it has a poor prognosis. Therefore, studying novel target signaling and anticancer agents is necessary. Momordicae Semen (MS), the seed of Momordica sochinensis Spreng, mainly found in South-East Asia, including China and Bangladesh, is used to treat various diseases because of its anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. However, the effect of the MS extract on pancreatic cancer cells remains unknown. In this study investigated whether the MS extract exerted an anti-cancer effect by regulating c-Myc through CNOT2. Cytotoxicity and proliferation were investigated using MTT and colony formation assays. The levels of apoptotic, oncogenic, and migration-associated factors were confirmed using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Wound closure was analyzed using a wound healing assay. The chemical composition of the MS methanol extracts was analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We confirmed that the MS extract regulated apoptotic factors and attenuated the stability of c-Myc and its sensitivity to fetal bovine serum. Furthermore, the MS extract increased apoptosis by regulating c-Myc and CNOT2 expression and enhanced the sensitivity of 5-FU in pancreatic cancer. This study showed that the MS extract is a promising new drug for PC.
