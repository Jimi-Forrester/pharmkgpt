18549115|t|Alzheimer's disease: the psychological and physical effects of the caregiver's role. Part 2.
18549115|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the physical and psychological effects on informal caregivers of looking after a person with Alzheimer's disease. A descriptive survey was conducted in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon in Ireland using a simple random sample of caregivers registered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Galway, or the Western Alzheimer's Foundation. The findings from the study show that a significant proportion of caregivers reported poor self-rated health and depression. Restless sleep and a decreased tolerance for pain were also common.
