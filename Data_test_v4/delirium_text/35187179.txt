35187179|a|Chronic wounds (e.g. diabetic wounds, pressure wounds, vascular ulcers, etc.) do not usually heal in a timely and orderly manner but rather last for years and may lead to irreversible adverse events, resulting in a substantial financial burden for patients and society. Recently, a large amount of evidence has proven that cellular senescence has a crucial influence on chronic nonhealing wounds. As a defensive mechanism, cell senescence is a manner of cell-cycle arrest with increased secretory phenotype to resist death, preventing cells from stress-induced damage in cancer and noncancer diseases. A growing amount of research has advanced the perception of cell senescence in various chronic wounds and focuses on pathological and physiological processes and therapies targeting senescent cells. However, previous reviews have failed to sum up novel understandings of senescence in chronic wounds and emerging strategies targeting senescence. Herein, we discuss the characteristics and mechanisms of cellular senescence and the link between senescence and chronic wounds as well as some novel antisenescence strategies targeting other diseases that may be applied for chronic wounds.
