36901863|t|Disorder of Golgi Apparatus Precedes Anoxia-Induced Pathology of Mitochondria.
36901863|a|Mitochondrial malfunction and morphologic disorganization have been observed in brain cells as part of complex pathological changes. However, it is unclear what may be the role of mitochondria in the initiation of pathologic processes or if mitochondrial disorders are consequences of earlier events. We analyzed the morphologic reorganization of organelles in an embryonic mouse brain during acute anoxia using an immunohistochemical identification of the disordered mitochondria, followed by electron microscopic three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. We found swelling of the mitochondrial matrix after 3 h anoxia and probable dissociation of mitochondrial stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2)-containing complexes after 4.5 h anoxia in the neocortex, hippocampus, and lateral ganglionic eminence. Surprisingly, deformation of the Golgi apparatus (GA) was detected already after 1 h of anoxia, when the mitochondria and other organelles still had a normal ultrastructure. The disordered GA showed concentrical swirling of the cisternae and formed spherical onion-like structures with the trans-cisterna in the center of the sphere. Such disturbance of the Golgi architecture likely interferes with its function for post-translational protein modification and secretory trafficking. Thus, the GA in embryonic mouse brain cells may be more vulnerable to anoxic conditions than the other organelles, including mitochondria.
