36961809|a|BACKGROUND: An enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol is a multimodal and multi-professional strategy aiming to accelerate postoperative convalescence. Pre-, intra- and postoperative measures might furthermore reduce postoperative complications and hospital length of stay (LOS) in a cost-effective way. We hypothesized that our unique ERAS protocol leads to shorter stays on the intensive care unit (ICU) and a quicker discharge without compromising patient safety. METHODS: This retrospective single center cohort study compares data of n = 101 patients undergoing minimally invasive heart valve surgery receiving a comprehensive ERAS protocol and n = 111 patients receiving routine care. Hierarchically ordered primary endpoints are postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS), postoperative complications and ICU LOS. RESULTS: Patients risk profiles and disease characteristics were comparably similar. Age was relevantly different between the groups (56 (17) vs. 57.5 (13) years, p = 0.015) and therefore adjusted. Postoperative LOS was significantly lower in ERAS group (6 (2) days vs. 7 (1) days, p<0.01). No significant differences, neither in intra- or postoperative complications, nor in the number of readmissions (15.8% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.196) were shown. In hospital LOS (7 (3) days vs. 8 (4) days, p<0.01) and ICU LOS (18.5 (6) hours vs. 26.5 (29) hours, p<0.01) a considerable difference was shown. CONCLUSION: The ERAS protocol for minimally invasive heart valve surgery is safe and feasible in an elective setting and leads to a quicker hospital discharge without compromising patient safety. However, further investigation in a randomized setting is needed.
