30275760|a|A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family proteins are type-I transmembrane glycoproteins with multiple functions in cell adhesion, migration, proteolysis and signaling. ADAM10 is a member of the ADAM family reportedly involved in cancer progression and has been shown to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and significantly associated with tumor progression and shortened survival. This study investigated ADAM10's single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association to HCC development and regulation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze five SNPs of ADAM10 in 333 patients with HCC and 1196 controls without cancer. The results indicated that of the 333 patients with HCC, those who carried ADAM10 rs514049 (AC + CC) variants had a higher risk of developing lymph node metastasis (odds ratio [OR] = 5.087, p = 0.027), and those who carried ADAM10 rs653765 (GA + AA) variants had a higher risk of developing distant metastasis (OR = 3.346, p = 0.020) and higher levels of alpha-fetoprotein. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the SNPs of ADAM10 are involved in HCC progression. ADAM10 SNPs may be used as therapeutic targets to evaluate poor prognoses for HCC.
