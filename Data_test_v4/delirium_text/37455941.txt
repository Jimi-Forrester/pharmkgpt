37455941|t|Incidence of delirium after non-cardiac surgery in the Chinese elderly population: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37455941|a|Background: POD places a heavy burden on the healthcare system as the number of elderly people undergoing surgery is increasing annually because of the aging population. As a large country with a severely aging population, China's elderly population has reached 267 million. There has been no summary analysis of the pooled incidence of POD in the elderly Chinese population. Methods: Systematic search databases included PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library Databases, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), WanFang Database, and Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals (VIP). The retrieval time ranged from the database's establishment to February 8, 2023. The pooled incidence of delirium after non-cardiac surgery was calculated using a random effects model. Meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Results: A total of 52 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 18,410 participants. The pooled incidence of delirium after non-cardiac surgery in the elderly Chinese population was 18.6% (95% CI: 16.4-20.8%). The meta-regression results revealed anesthesia method and year of publication as a source of heterogeneity. In the subgroup analysis, the gender subgroup revealed a POD incidence of 19.6% (95% CI: 16.9-22.3%) in males and 18.3% (95% CI: 15.7-20.9%) in females. The year of publication subgroup analysis revealed a POD incidence of 20.3% (95% CI: 17.4-23.3%) after 2018 and 14.6 (95% CI: 11.6-17.6%) in 2018 and before. In the subgroup of surgical types, the incidence of hip fracture surgery POD was 20.7% (95% CI: 17.6-24.3%), the incidence of non-cardiac surgery POD was 18.4% (95% CI: 11.8-25.1%), the incidence of orthopedic surgery POD was 16.6% (95% CI: 11.8-21.5%), the incidence of abdominal neoplasms surgery POD was 14.3% (95% CI: 7.6-21.1%); the incidence of abdominal surgery POD was 13.9% (95% CI: 6.4-21.4%). The anesthesia methods subgroup revealed a POD incidence of 21.5% (95% CI: 17.9-25.1%) for general anesthesia, 15.0% (95% CI: 10.6-19.3%) for intraspinal anesthesia, and 8.3% (95% CI: 10.6-19.3%) for regional anesthesia. The measurement tool subgroup revealed a POD incidence of 19.3% (95% CI: 16.7-21.9%) with CAM and 16.8% (95% CI: 12.6-21.0%) with DSM. The sample size subgroup revealed a POD incidence of 19.4% (95% CI: 16.8-22.1%) for patients <= 500 and 15.3% (95% CI: 11.0-19.7%) for patients > 500. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the pooled incidence of postoperative delirium in this study was stable. Conclusion: Our systematic review of the incidence of delirium after non-cardiac surgery in elderly Chinese patients revealed a high incidence of postoperative delirium. Except for cardiac surgery, the incidence of postoperative delirium was higher for hip fracture surgery than for other types of surgery. However, this finding must be further explored in future large-sample studies. Systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: PROSPERO CRD42023397883.
