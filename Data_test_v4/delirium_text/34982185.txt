34982185|t|Targeting neuroinflammation by intranasal delivery of nanoparticles in neurological diseases: a comprehensive review.
34982185|a|Neuroinflammation (NIF) plays an essential role in the pathology of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Despite progress in the drug discovery and development of new drugs, drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) still represents the challenge due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Targeting NIF may require an adequate amount of drug to cross the BBB. Recently, the intranasal (IN) drug administration has attracted increasing attention as a reliable method to cross the BBB and treat neurological disorders. On the other hand, using optimized nanoparticles may improve the IN delivery limitations, increase the mucoadhesive properties, and prevent drug degradation. NPs can carry and deliver drugs to the CNS by bypassing the BBB. In this review, we described briefly the NIF as a pathologic feature of CNS diseases. The potential treatment possibilities with IN transfer of NP-loaded drugs will enhance the establishment of more efficient nanoformulations and delivery systems.
