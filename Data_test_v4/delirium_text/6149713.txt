6149713|a|During the last years, there have been more and more observations of physical dependence on the benzodiazepines. This paper emphasizes the seriousness of this syndrome, its similarity with delirium tremens and its optimal treatment by high doses of benzodiazepines. This article shows also the misuse of drugs lowering the epileptogenic threshold and suggests in replacement the peranaesthesic administration of benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Finally the treatment should be started with a gradual and slow withdrawal so as to avoid undesirable neurological signs.
