34884606|t|Neurotoxicity and Underlying Mechanisms of Endogenous Neurotoxins.
34884606|a|Endogenous and exogenous neurotoxins are important factors leading to neurodegenerative diseases. In the 1980s, the discovery that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms led to new research investigations on neurotoxins. An abnormal metabolism of endogenous substances, such as condensation of bioamines with endogenous aldehydes, dopamine (DA) oxidation, and kynurenine pathway, can produce endogenous neurotoxins. Neurotoxins may damage the nervous system by inhibiting mitochondrial activity, increasing oxidative stress, increasing neuroinflammation, and up-regulating proteins related to cell death. This paper reviews the biological synthesis of various known endogenous neurotoxins and their toxic mechanisms.
