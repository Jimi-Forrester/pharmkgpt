37968352|a|Methylmercury (MeHg) is converted to inorganic mercury (iHg) in several organs; however, its impact on tissues and cells remains poorly understood. Previously, we established a bacterial organomercury lyase (MerB)-expressing mammalian cell line to overcome the low cell permeability of iHg and investigate its effects. Here, we elucidated the cytotoxic effects of the resultant iHg on autophagy and deciphered their relationship. Treatment of MerB-expressing cells with MeHg significantly increases the mRNA and protein levels of LC3B and p62, which are involved in autophagosome formation and substrate recognition, respectively. Autophagic flux assays using the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) revealed that MeHg treatment activates autophagy in MerB-expressing cells but not in wild-type cells. Additionally, MeHg treatment induces the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and p62, specifically in MerB-expressing cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that large ubiquitinated protein aggregates (aggresomes) associated with p62 are formed transiently in the perinuclear region of MerB-expressing cells upon MeHg exposure. Meanwhile, inhibition of autophagic flux decreases the MeHg-induced cell viability of MerB-expressing cells. Overall, our results imply that cells regulate aggresome formation and autophagy activation by activating LC3B and p62 to prevent cytotoxicity caused by iHg. These findings provide insights into the role of autophagy against iHg-mediated toxicity.
