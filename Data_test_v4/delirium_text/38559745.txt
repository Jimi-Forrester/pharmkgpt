38559745|t|The continued financial effect of COVID: Increasing costs for non-elective major lower extremity amputations.
38559745|a|Background: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in processes of care, which significantly impacted surgical care. This study evaluated the impact of these changes on patient outcomes and costs for non-elective major lower extremity amputations (LEA). Methods: The 2019-2021 Florida Agency for Health Care Administration database was queried for adult patients who underwent non-elective major LEA. Per-patient inflation-adjusted costs were collected. Patient cohorts were established based on Florida COVID-19 mortality rates: COVID-heavy (CH) included nine months with the highest mortality, COVID-light (CL) included nine months with the lowest mortality, and pre-COVID (PC) included nine months before COVID (2019). Outcomes included in-hospital patient outcomes and hospitalization cost. Results: 6132 patients were included (1957 PC, 2104 CH, and 2071 CL). Compared to PC, there was increased patient acuity at presentation, but morbidity (31%), mortality (4%), and length of stay (median 12 [8-17] days) were unchanged during CH and CL. Additionally, costs significantly increased during the pandemic; median total cost rose 9%, room costs increased by 16%, ICU costs rose by 15%, and operating room costs rose by 15%. When COVID-positive patients were excluded, cost of care was still significantly higher during CH and CL. Conclusions: Despite maintaining pre-pandemic standards, as evidenced by unchanged outcomes, the pandemic led to increased costs for patients undergoing non-elective major LEA. This was likely due to increased patient acuity, resource strain, and supply chain shortages during the pandemic. Key message: While patient outcomes for non-elective major lower extremity amputations remained consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare costs significantly increased, likely due to increased patient acuity and heightened pressures on resources and supply chains. These findings underscore the need for informed policy changes to mitigate the financial impact on patients and healthcare systems for future public health emergencies.
