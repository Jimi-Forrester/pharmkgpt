37334600|t|Detection of Tau-PET Positivity in Clinically Diagnosed Mild Cognitive Impairment with Multidimensional Features.
37334600|a|BACKGROUND: The way to evaluate brain tau pathology in vivo is tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. In the clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a significant proportion of tau-PET are negative. Interest in less expensive and convenient ways to detect tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease has increased due to the high cost of tau-PET and the invasiveness of lumbar puncture, which typically slows down the cost and enrollment of clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate one simple and effective method in predicting tau-PET status in MCI individuals. METHODS: The sample included 154 individuals which were dichotomized into tau-PET (+) and tau-PET (-) using a cut-off of >1.33. We used stepwise regression to select the unitary or combination of variables that best predicted tau-PET. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the accuracy of single and multiple clinical markers. RESULTS: The combined performance of three variables [Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), ADNI-Memory summary score (ADNI-MEM)] in neurocognitive measures demonstrated good predictive accuracy of tau-PET status [accuracy = 85.7%, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.879]. The combination of clinical markers model (APOEe4, neurocognitive measures and structural MRI imaging of middle temporal) had the best discriminative power (AUC = 0.946). CONCLUSION: As a noninvasive test, the combination of APOEe4, neurocognitive measures and structural MRI imaging of middle temporal accurately predicts tau-PET status. The finding may provide a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for clinical application in predicting tau pathology among MCI individuals.
