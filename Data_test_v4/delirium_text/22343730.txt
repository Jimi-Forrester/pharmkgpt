22343730|t|Alzheimer's disease in the retina: imaging retinal abeta plaques for early diagnosis and therapy assessment.
22343730|a|BACKGROUND: Definite Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis at early stages is vital for targeting intervention, yet currently unavailable. Noninvasive detection of the pathological hallmark, amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) plaques, is limited in the brain. However, the existence of Abeta plaques in the retina, possibly at presymptomatic stages, may improve early detection of AD. OBJECTIVE: To summarize clinical and preclinical evidence showing that the retina, an accessible part of the central nervous system, displays abnormalities in AD, especially Abeta plaque pathology. The ability to monitor in vivo retinal plaque dynamics in response to immunotherapy is also assessed. METHODS: Literature analysis of retinal AD pathology and imaging is provided. In our studies, systemic curcumin is administered to enable monitoring of retinal Abeta plaques in live APP(SWE)/PS1(Delta)(E9) transgenic mice by optical imaging. RESULTS: Visual and retinal abnormalities, including early manifestation of retinal Abeta plaque pathology, have been documented in AD patients and animal models. In mouse models, retinal Abeta plaques accumulate with age and decrease in response to immunotherapy, consistent with brain pathology. Here, we demonstrate that retinal plaques can be individually monitored in real time following glatiramer acetate immunization. CONCLUSION: Translation of noninvasive retinal-plaque imaging to humans could eventually facilitate early and accurate AD diagnosis and therapy assessment.
