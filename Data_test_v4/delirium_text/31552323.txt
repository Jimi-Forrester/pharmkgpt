31552323|t|Novel Diarylethene-Based Fluorescent Switching for the Detection of Al3+ and Construction of Logic Circuit.
31552323|a|A novel photochromic diarylethene was synthesized successfully containing a phthalazine unit. Its multistate fluorescence switching properties were investigated by stimulating with UV/vis lights and Al3+/EDTA. The synthesized diarylethene displayed excellent selectivity to Al3+ with a distinct fluorescence change, revealing that it could be used as a sensor for fluorescence identification of Al3+, and a logic circuit was constructed by utilizing this diarylethene molecular platform. Moreover, it also exhibited a high accuracy for the determination of Al3+ in practical water samples.
