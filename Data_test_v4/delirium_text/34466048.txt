34466048|t|Assessing and Management of Neurotoxicity After CAR-T Therapy in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
34466048|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy represents the most important advances in cancer immunotherapy, especially in hematological malignancies such as B-cell lymphomas. CAR-T cell therapy has significant activity in poor risk B-cell lymphomas. CAR-T cell therapy is associated with potentially life-threatening toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (NT). While CRS pathophysiology and management are well established, the understanding and treatment of NT continues to develop. All current CAR-T products approved for DLBCL have been associated with NT with some differences in their severity. As cell therapies continue to advance and its access broadening, it will be imperative for clinicians to be aware of the signs and symptoms of NT, its stratification and basic management.
