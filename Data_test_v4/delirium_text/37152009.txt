37152009|a|Background: Although dexmedetomidine (DEX) is widely used during the perioperative period in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its clinical effects on liver function and postoperative inflammation are unclear. This study aimed to explore effects of DEX on postoperative liver function and inflammation in patients with HCC after hepatectomy. Methods: A retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching was performed. A total of 494 patients who underwent hepatectomy from June 2019 to July 2020 and fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in this study. Baseline data, liver function indexes and inflammation-related biomarkers were collected and compared between the two groups. Survival analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of DEX on the overall survival (OS) of patients. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize bias between the two groups. Results: The study cohort comprised 189 patients in the DEX-free group and 305 patients in the DEX group. Patients in the DEX group had lower levels of alanine transaminase (ALT, P = 0.018) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, P = 0.046) and higher level of serum albumin (ALB, P < 0.001) than patients in the DEX-free group before discharge. A total of 107 pairs of patients were successfully matched by PSM. Results consistently suggested that ALT and LDH levels were significantly lower (P = 0.044 and P = 0.046, respectively) and ALB levels were significantly higher (P = 0.002) in the DEX group than in the DEX-free group in the early postoperative period. No significant differences of inflammation-related biomarkers were observed between two groups after PSM. Neither the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis nor the multiple Cox regression survival analysis identified DEX as a contributing factor that would affect the OS of patients after PSM. Conclusion: DEX exerts protective effects on liver function while has little effects on inflammation-related biomarkers in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing hepatectomy due to HCC.
