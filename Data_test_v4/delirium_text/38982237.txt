38982237|a|Hearing difficulty (HD) may be associated with an increased frequency of emergency department (ED) visits among older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the health of older adults. However, less is known about the characteristics of ED visits by older adults with HD during the pandemic. This study examines the association between self-reported HD severity and ED visits during the pandemic. This population-based cross-sectional study used self-reported data on HD and the characteristics of respondents aged 65 years or older from three cycles of the National Health Interview Survey from 2020 to 2022. Data were analysed from February 23, 2023, to March 22, 2023. The primary outcome was self-reported ED visits in the past 12 months. This study employed generalised linear models to examine the relationship between ED visits (dependent variable) and HD in older adults, and the effect sizes were expressed as rate ratios. Key independent variables included the reasons for ED visit. Covariates such as demographic characteristics and socio-economic status were controlled for to account for potential confounding effects. During the pandemic, older adults with HD commonly visited the ED because of chronic pain (82.8%), frailty (77.9%), trouble falling/staying asleep (73.2%), hypertension (67.4%), and arthritis (60.1%), all of which were 1.5-times more likely in these adults than in those with normal hearing (chronic pain: adjusted rate ratio [ARR], 1.64 [95% CI 1.44-1.93]; frailty: ARR, 1.57 [95% CI 1.16-1.87]; trouble falling/staying asleep: ARR, 1.51 [95% CI 1.21-1.82]; hypertension: ARR, 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.23]; arthritis: ARR, 1.39 [95% CI 1.31-1.57]. Older adults with HD were more likely to visit the ED for chronic pain, frailty, trouble falling/staying asleep, hypertension, and arthritis than those with normal hearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings will be help for healthcare providers to be aware of these potential barriers and to implement strategies to ensure that patients with hearing difficulties can access necessary emergency care effectively.
