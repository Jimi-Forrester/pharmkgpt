32545179|t|Expanding the Role of Sub-Exploited DOE-High Energy Extraction and Metabolomic Profiling towards Agro-Byproduct Valorization: The Case of Carotenoid-Rich Apricot Pulp.
32545179|a|Traditional extraction remains the method-of-choice for phytochemical analyses. However, the absence of an integrated analytical platform, focusing on customized, validated extraction steps, generates tendentious and non-reproducible data regarding the phytochemical profile. Such a platform would also support the exploration and exploitation of plant byproducts, which are a valuable source of bioactive metabolites. This study deals with the incorporation of (a) the currently sub-exploited high energy extraction methods (ultrasound (UAE)- and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE)), (b) experimental design (DOE), and (c) metabolomics, in an integrated analytical platform for the extensive study of plant metabolomics and phytochemical profiling. The recovery of carotenoids from apricot by-products (pulp) is examined as a case study. MAE, using ethanol as solvent, achieved higher carotenoid yields compared to UAE, where 1:1 chloroform-methanol was employed, and classic extraction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic profiling classified extracts according to the variations in co-extractives in relation to the extraction conditions. Extracts with a lower carotenoid content contained branched-chain amino acids as co-extractives. Medium carotenoid content extracts contained choline, unsaturated fatty acids, and sugar alcohols, while the highest carotenoid extracts were also rich in sugars. Overall, the proposed pipeline can provide different the phytochemical fractions of bioactive compounds according to the needs of different industrial sectors (cosmetics, nutraceuticals, etc.).
