15533627|a|Several lines of evidence show that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Given their role in the neuronal apoptosis, the inhibition of CDKs by specific drugs such as flavopiridol may be a valid therapeutic approach. Expression of CDKs was observed in rodent models of excitotoxicity and stroke, and CDK inhibitors showed neuroprotective effects. Flavopiridol may provide significant improvement in neurodegenerative diseases in humans.
