10093481|a|In the article we discuss the role of serotonin in maintaining homeostasis paying special attention to the endocrinological aspect of the matter. It has been proved that it contributes to hypothalamus and hypophysis secretion regulation and interferes with paracrine activity in digestive and reproductive system. It is also an important constituent of platelets and takes part in aggregation and coagulation. It is known to be an atherogenic factor and to act as a growth stimulator for blood cells. It can be produced in exceed amounts by neoplasm or be released by activated thrombocytes during stress or coagulation. The influence of this hormone on the most of regulation mechanisms seems obvious. Presence of many different receptors as well as their number in all the structures of mammalian body makes it possible to use a range of agonists and antagonists in research concerning psychiatric diseases (e.g. bulimia, anorexia, depression), Alzheimer disease, migraine, hypertension, carcinoid related syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasms and pre-menstrual syndrome. The promising results enable to use some of the modifiers in their clinical treatment though more research is needed for fully satisfactory effects.
