32435504|t|Using a cognitive orthosis to support older adults during meal preparation: Clinicians' perspective on COOK technology.
32435504|a|INTRODUCTION: Occupational therapists promote safety and autonomy of older adults with cognitive impairments. A technology, named COOK, offers support on a touch screen installed next to the stove to support task performance while correcting risky behaviors. We aimed to document (1) the functional profiles according the diagnosis (2) the types of interventions used to increase autonomy in the kitchen (3) the facilitators and obstacles to the implementation of COOK with this clientele. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with occupational therapists (n = 24) and were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis, including coding and matrix building. RESULTS: Occupational therapists identified different (1) functional profiles and (2) interventions for both diagnoses. The use of COOK (3) could be more beneficial in mild cognitive impairment, as many barriers occur for the use in Alzheimer's disease. Some parameters, such as digital control of the stove and complex information management, need to be simplified. DISCUSSION: According to occupational therapists, this technology is particularly applicable to people with mild cognitive impairment, because this population has better learning abilities. CONCLUSION: This study documented the specific needs of older adults with cognitive impairments as well as interventions used by occupational therapists. The perspectives of caregivers should be captured in future research.
