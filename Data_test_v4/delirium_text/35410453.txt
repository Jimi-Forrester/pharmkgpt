35410453|a|Schizophrenia affects >3.2 million people in the USA. However, its comorbidity patterns have not been systematically characterized in real-world populations. To address this gap, we conducted an observational study using a cohort of 86 million patients in a nationwide health insurance dataset. We identified participants with schizophrenia and those without schizophrenia matched by age, sex, and the first three digits of zip code. For each phenotype encoded in phecodes, we compared their prevalence in schizophrenia patients and the matched non-schizophrenic participants, and we performed subgroup analyses stratified by age and sex. Results show that anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse commonly occur in adolescents and young adults prior to schizophrenia diagnoses. Patients aged 60 and above are at higher risks of developing delirium, alcoholism, dementia, pelvic fracture, and osteomyelitis than their matched controls. Type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and eating disorders were more prevalent in women prior to schizophrenia diagnosis, whereas acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and developmental delays were found at higher rates in men. Anxiety and obesity are more commonly seen in patients with schizoaffective disorders compared to patients with other types of schizophrenia. Leveraging a large-scale insurance claims dataset, this study identified less-known comorbidity patterns of schizophrenia and confirmed known ones. These comorbidity profiles can guide clinicians and researchers to take heed of early signs of co-occurring diseases.
