37038273|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by decreased memory and cognition, which are linked to degenerative changes in the brain. To assess whether white matter (WM) integrity is compromised in MCI, we collected diffusion-weighted images from 60 healthy older adults (OA) (69.16 +- 0.7) and 20 older adults with amnestic MCI (72.45 +- 1.9). WM integrity differences were examined using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). We hypothesized that those with MCI would have diminished WM integrity relative to OA. In a whole-brain comparison, those with MCI showed higher axial diffusivity in the splenium (SCC) and body of the corpus callosum (BCC), superior corona radiata (SCR), and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule (RLIC) (p's < .05 TFCE-corrected). Additionally, significant between-group connectivity differences were observed using probabilistic tractography between the SCC, chosen from the TBSS results, and forceps major and minor (p-value's < .05). To further relate a physical health indicator to WM alterations, linear regression showed significant interactions between cognitive status and body mass index (BMI) on diffusivity outcome measures from probabilistic tractography (p-value-'s < .05). Additionally, we examined the association between relational memory, BMI, and WM integrity. WM integrity was positively associated with relational memory performance. These findings suggest that these regions may be more sensitive to early markers of neurodegenerative disease and health behaviors, suggesting that modifiable lifestyle factors may affect white matter integrity.
