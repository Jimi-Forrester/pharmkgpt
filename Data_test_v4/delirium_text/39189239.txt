39189239|t|Novel Monoclonal Antibody Specific toward Amyloid-beta Binds to a Unique Epitope within the N-Terminal Region.
39189239|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition throughout the neuroaxis is a classical hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta peptides of varied length and diverse structural conformations are deposited within the parenchyma and vasculature in the brains of individuals with AD. Neuropathologically, Abeta pathology can be assessed using antibodies to label and characterize their features, which in turn leads to a more extensive understanding of the pathological process. In the present study, we generated a novel monoclonal antibody, which we found to be specific for the N-terminal region of Abeta. This antibody reacted to amyloid precursor protein expressed in cultured cells and labels Abeta plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in brain tissue from a mouse model of amyloidosis as well as post-mortem brain tissue from patients diagnosed with AD. This highly specific novel antibody will serve as a unique tool for future studies investigating Abeta deposition in novel mouse models and cross-sectional studies using post-mortem human tissue.
