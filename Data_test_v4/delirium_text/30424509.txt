30424509|t|Isolated Mammillary Bodies Damage-An Atypical Presentation of Wernicke Syndrome.
30424509|a|We report atypical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions in a case of Wernicke encephalopathy. The patient presented with isolated anterograde amnesia following a partial colectomy complicated by peritonitis. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2 MRI sequences were normal. However, bilateral contrast enhancement of mammillary bodies was shown on T1 gadolinium-enhanced sequences. Blood tests revealed thiamine deficiency. The diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy was made and thiamine supplementation was given, resulting in complete recovery of the memory functions.
