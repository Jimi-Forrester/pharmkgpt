35535285|t|Historical Perspective and Medical Maladies of Alexander the Great.
35535285|a|Alexander the Great (356 BC - 323 BC) was only 20 years old when he was named the next King of Macedonia after his father was assassinated. The following 11 years witnessed the evolution of an outstanding leader who expanded his empire from Egypt to the Indian frontier. Despite successfully conquering much of the world, he was afflicted with a febrile illness at the age of 32, which he battled for a mere 11 days before perishing. It has been almost 2,400 years since his death, but the exact cause remains a mystery. Did he die of natural causes or at the hands of conspirators? Numerous papers have been written about the illnesses suffered by Alexander, with the current evidence revealing a healthy 32-year-old man who developed fever and acute abdominal pain with rapid deterioration of his general condition leading to death within a short duration. We analyze various theories and discuss possible etiologies that may have contributed to his tragic death. Information was gathered from primary and secondary sources found through searching multiple online academic databases and the University of Southern California (USC), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Harvard libraries. Unreliable sources and the unavailability of Alexander's body for autopsy make reaching a definitive diagnosis an impossible task; however, based on existing information, we presume that he most probably died of a neurological cause due to acute necrotizing pancreatitis and encephalopathy secondary to peritonitis. Other potential causes include fulminant hepatic failure, acute demyelinating neuropathy or Guillain Barre Syndrome, and arsenic poisoning.
