37786418|t|The role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease and progress of treatment.
37786418|a|Microglia are permanent immune cells of the central nervous system. Microglia play an important role in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They are mainly involved in the uptake and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta), as well as the formation of neuroinflammation. We found that overactivated microglia increase Abeta and Tau, and Abeta and Tau in turn act as activators of microglia. Additionally, various cytokines and proteins, high cholesterol, and telomere shortening are all associated with microglia activation. More activated microglia induce the release of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors to regulate inflammation, while microglia express multiple homologous receptors that bind to neuroimmunomodulators to prevent microglia overactivation. Moreover, aging of the body promotes neuroinflammation by increasing the response to IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma), and aging of the microglia themselves promotes AD by inducing the accumulation of large amounts of iron and reducing autophagy by regulating protein levels. Cognitive dysfunction occurs when activated microglia induce an increase in beta oligomers, promoting the production of pro-inflammatory factors that alter the shape, composition, and density of synapses. Based on their correlation, microglia-mediated AD therapy as well as the corresponding targets and drugs are discussed. In contrast to similar reviews, this article also summarizes some novel microglia-mediated AD treatment methods over the recent years.
