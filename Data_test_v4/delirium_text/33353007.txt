33353007|t|Polyphenols from Brown Seaweeds (Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae): Phlorotannins in the Pursuit of Natural Alternatives to Tackle Neurodegeneration.
33353007|a|Globally, the burden of neurodegenerative disorders continues to rise, and their multifactorial etiology has been regarded as among the most challenging medical issues. Bioprospecting for seaweed-derived multimodal acting products has earned increasing attention in the fight against neurodegenerative conditions. Phlorotannins (phloroglucinol-based polyphenols exclusively produced by brown seaweeds) are amongst the most promising nature-sourced compounds in terms of functionality, and though research on their neuroprotective properties is still in its infancy, phlorotannins have been found to modulate intricate events within the neuronal network. This review comprehensively covers the available literature on the neuroprotective potential of both isolated phlorotannins and phlorotannin-rich extracts/fractions, highlighting the main key findings and pointing to some potential directions for neuro research ramp-up processes on these marine-derived products.
