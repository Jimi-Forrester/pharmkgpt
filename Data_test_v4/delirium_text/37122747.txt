37122747|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that targets the myelin sheath of central nervous system (CNS) neurons leading to axon injury, neuronal death, and neurological progression. Though women are more highly susceptible to developing MS, men that develop this disease exhibit greater cognitive impairment and accumulate disability more rapidly than women. Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have revealed that the greater neurological progression seen in males correlates with chronic immune activation and increased iron accumulation at the rims of chronic white matter lesions as well as more intensive whole brain and grey matter atrophy and axon loss. Studies in humans and in animal models of MS suggest that male aged microglia do not have a higher propensity for inflammation, but may become more re-active at the rim of white matter lesions as a result of the presence of pro-inflammatory T cells, greater astrocyte activation or iron release from oligodendrocytes in the males. There is also evidence that remyelination is more efficient in aged female than aged male rodents and that male neurons are more susceptible to oxidative and nitrosative stress. Both sex chromosome complement and sex hormones contribute to these sex differences in biology.
