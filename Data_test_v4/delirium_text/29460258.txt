29460258|t|Diabetes in the Elderly.
29460258|a|The elderly are an important and distinct yet heterogeneous group of persons living with diabetes. The elderly have a unique biomedical, psychological, and social constitution. Their needs are different from those of younger adults. This implies that special care must be taken while evaluating and planning their nursing and management. Diabetes management in the elderly should focus on prevention and limitation of geriatric syndromes (medical conditions encountered in elderly persons), hypoglycemia (low blood glucose), and neurocognitive dysfunction (impairment in the functioning of the nervous system and brain). This review takes a practical approach to the assessment, nursing care, and medical treatment of diabetes in the elderly. It highlights major challenges and suggests solutions to these commonly encountered clinical problems.
