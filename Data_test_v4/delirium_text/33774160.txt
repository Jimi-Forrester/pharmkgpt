33774160|a|The present investigation explores the potential of novel dual drug-loaded niosomes for nasal delivery of Rivastigmine (RIV) and N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) to the brain. The dual niosomes showed a particle size of 162.4 nm and % entrapment efficiencies of 97.7% for RIV and 85.9% for NAC. The niosomes were statistically validated using Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD) with good significance. Ultrastructural and chemical characterization of the niosomes using various analytical techniques like Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showcased drug-excipient compatibility and robust stability of 6 months in a liquid state at 4-8  C. The dual drug-loaded niosomes showed a sustained drug release pattern up to 2 days. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl) enzyme inhibition assays showed a better combinative effect than the free drug solutions. A 2-day nasal permeation proved the effectiveness and biocompatibility of the niosomes. In-vivo pharmacokinetic and organ biodistribution studies revealed a better drug profile and greater distribution of the niosomes in the brain compared to other organs, thereby indicating a direct nose-to-brain delivery of the niosomes.
