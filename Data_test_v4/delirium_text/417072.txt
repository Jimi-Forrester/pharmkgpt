417072|t|Acute cerebral symptomatology, a rare presentation of scleromyxedema.
417072|a|A 65 year old male with the entity, scleromyxedema, experienced exacerbation of the disease in which the main clinical features involved the central nervous system. He presented with clouded sensorium, disorganized thinking, combative behavior, headache, unsteady gait and grand mal seizures. A few days after hospital admission the symptoms abated. After a 6 day hiatus, the symptoms suddenly recurred, continuing for another week. The symptomatology again suddenly ceased with complete clearance of mental status. During the full-blown delirium, the electroencephalogram had demonstrated diffuse slowing while lumbar puncture, brain scan, E.M.I. scan and cerebral arteriogram failed to contribute to the understanding of the clinical presentation. Scleromyxedema rarely involves the central nervous system. This case illustrates a very unusual manifestation of scleromyxedema, prominent central nervous system involvement presenting as an acute organic brain syndrome. It is the only case which includes formal mental status examination, cerebrospinal fluid findings and electroencephalogram results.
