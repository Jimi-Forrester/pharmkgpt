19374444|t|Tacripyrines, the first tacrine-dihydropyridine hybrids, as multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
19374444|a|Tacripyrines (1-14) have been designed by combining an AChE inhibitor (tacrine) with a calcium antagonist such as nimodipine and are targeted to develop a multitarget therapeutic strategy to confront AD. Tacripyrines are selective and potent AChE inhibitors in the nanomolar range. The mixed type inhibition of hAChE activity of compound 11 (IC(50) 105 +/- 15 nM) is associated to a 30.7 +/- 8.6% inhibition of the proaggregating action of AChE on the Abeta and a moderate inhibition of Abeta self-aggregation (34.9 +/- 5.4%). Molecular modeling indicates that binding of compound 11 to the AChE PAS mainly involves the (R)-11 enantiomer, which also agrees with the noncompetitive inhibition mechanism exhibited by p-methoxytacripyrine 11. Tacripyrines are neuroprotective agents, show moderate Ca(2+) channel blocking effect, and cross the blood-brain barrier, emerging as lead candidates for treating AD.
