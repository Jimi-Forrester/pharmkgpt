23010326|a|The neuropathological character of copper(II) ions (Cu(2+)) upon interaction with soluble human amyloid-beta(1-42) that subsequently generates senile plaques and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered as one of the very important features of Alzheimer's disease. The present study carried out by using fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) indeed confirms the dual role played by Cu(2+), namely as mediator of protein aggregation and as generator of ROS leading to irreversible protein alteration, which most likely involve two distinct copper-binding sites. The AFM investigations clearly evidence the copper-induced aggregation of Abeta oligomers and protofibrils, while comparative fluorescence measurements with copper and zinc reveals the crucial involvement of redox-active copper in the generation of Abeta-cross-linked structures.
