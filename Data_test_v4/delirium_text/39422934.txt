39422934|t|Immunotherapy in Alzheimer's Disease: Current Status and Future Directions.
39422934|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Immunotherapy aims to harness the immune system to target the underlying pathology of AD and has shown promise as a disease-modifying treatment for AD. By focusing on the underlying disease pathogenesis and encouraging the removal of abnormal protein aggregates in the brain, immunotherapy shows promise as a potential treatment for AD. The development of immunotherapy for AD began with early attempts to use antibodies to target beta-amyloid. The amyloid hypothesis which suggests that the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain triggers the pathological cascade that leads to AD has been a driving force behind the development of immunotherapy for AD. However, recent clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid-beta have shown mixed results, highlighting the need for further research into alternative immunotherapy approaches. Additionally, the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy for AD remain an area of active investigation. Some immunotherapeutic approaches have shown promise, while others have been associated with significant side effects, including inflammation of the brain. Sleep has a significant impact on various physiological processes, including the immune system, and has been linked to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, improving sleep quality and duration may benefit the immune system and potentially enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches for AD. In this review, we discussed the promises of immunotherapy as a disease-modifying treatment for AD as well as possible methods to improve the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy to achieve better therapeutic outcomes.
