21836671|t|Indian research on acute organic brain syndrome: Delirium.
21836671|a|Delirium, though quite often referred to psychiatrists for management, does not find many takers for analysis, research and publications. Acute in onset, multiplicity of etiology and manifestations, high risk of mortality delirium is very rewarding in proper management and outcome. Delirium has a limited agenda on teaching programs, research protocols and therapeutic strategies. There is a dearth of Indian studies both in international and national scientific literature. This annotation is based on a Medline search for "delirium India" on Pubmed, which resulted in 54 articles. A search in Indian Journal of Psychiatry for "delirium" resulted in 38 published articles, "delirium tremens" showed up only five articles. The articles are primarily from the Indian Journal of Psychiatry with cross reference to articles on Pubmed or Google search on Indian studies and a few international studies.
