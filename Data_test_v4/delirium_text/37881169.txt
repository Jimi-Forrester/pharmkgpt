37881169|t|Examining Outcomes and Challenges of Telepsychiatry in Australian Elderly: A Scoping Review.
37881169|a|Methods: To find relevant articles, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We used a data extraction form to gather information from primary studies. Two researchers followed inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies and extract data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with all researchers. Studies needed to be in English, about telepsychiatry for Australian seniors, and use any technology type (synchronous, asynchronous, or both). We excluded nontelepsychiatry articles, books, book chapters, conference abstracts, and editor letters. Results: Telepsychiatry was effectively employed to manage depression, anxiety, delirium, and cognitive impairments. Among these four disorders, telepsychiatry was mostly used for depression. Videoconference and telephone were mostly used to provide telepsychiatry services. Most telepsychiatry services for Australian seniors included "patient education on disorder control and management," "creating continuous interaction between the patient and the therapist," and "remote patients' assessment." "Reductions in symptoms of disorders," "improving patients' satisfaction with telepsychiatry," and "cost-effectiveness of telepsychiatry" were the most important positive outcomes of using telepsychiatry. We also identified four challenges in using telepsychiatry for elderly individuals in Australia. Conclusions: This study is the first scoping review in Australia and provides valuable insight into telepsychiatry for elderly individuals.
