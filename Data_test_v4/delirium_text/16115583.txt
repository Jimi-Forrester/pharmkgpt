The identification of differences between men and women with AD might present opportunities to improve the quality of AD-related care provided by nursing facilities, as well as lead to additional analyses of nursing home residents with AD. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to gain additional insight into gender differences in nursing home residents with AD in the United States, and to provide a better understanding of their health status and the care they receive in nursing facilities. METHODS: All admission assessments recorded in the Minimum Data Set (MDS) throughout the United States during 2000 were analyzed. P values for all significant differences were <0.001. RESULTS: A total of 49,607 residents with a diagnosis of AD (67.9% women) were identified. Female residents with AD were more likely to be older and widowed, whereas male residents with AD were more likely to be married. We found minimal gender differences in cognitive impairment among these residents with AD, although women were more likely to understand and be understood by others. Male residents with AD were more likely to exhibit behavioral symptoms, whereas female residents with AD tended to be more physically impaired and dependent on others for activities of daily living. Significant differences in comorbidities were found between the sexes, with greater proportions of male residents with AD having cardiac-related conditions, stroke, cancer, and other life-threatening chronic conditions. Male residents with AD were more likely to receive care in AD special-care units; daily antipsychotic medications; and intervention programs for mood, behavior, and cognitive loss than female residents with AD. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of nursing home residents identified using the MDS, key differences were found between male and female residents with AD, including age; cognitive and communicative abilities; and mental health, mood, and behavioral patterns.
