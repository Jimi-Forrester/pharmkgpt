33260658|t|Synthesis, Molecular Modeling and Biological Evaluation of Metabolically Stable Analogues of the Endogenous Fatty Acid Amide Palmitoylethanolamide.
33260658|a|Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) belongs to the class of N-acylethanolamine and is an endogenous lipid potentially useful in a wide range of therapeutic areas; products containing PEA are licensed for use in humans as a nutraceutical, a food supplement, or food for medical purposes for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties demonstrating efficacy and tolerability. However, the exogenously administered PEA is rapidly inactivated; in this process, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) plays a key role both in hepatic metabolism and in intracellular degradation. So, the aim of the present study was the design and synthesis of PEA analogues that are more resistant to FAAH-mediated hydrolysis. A small library of PEA analogues was designed and tested by molecular docking and density functional theory calculations to find the more stable analogue. The computational investigation identified RePEA as the best candidate in terms of both synthetic accessibility and metabolic stability to FAAH-mediated hydrolysis. The selected compound was synthesized and assayed ex vivo to monitor FAAH-mediated hydrolysis and to confirm its anti-inflammatory properties. 1H-NMR spectroscopy performed on membrane samples containing FAAH in integral membrane protein demonstrated that RePEA is not processed by FAAH, in contrast with PEA. Moreover, RePEA retains PEA's ability to inhibit LPS-induced cytokine release in both murine N9 microglial cells and human PMA-THP-1 cells.
