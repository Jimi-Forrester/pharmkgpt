36675036|a|Anthocyanin is a natural antioxidant agent extracted from the fruits of Sambucus canadensis, which has been considered to have potential anti-aging effects. Cell senescence is the primary cause of aging and related diseases. Recently, research on the development of compounds for eliminating senescent cells or damaged organs have shown prospects. The compounds which promote the clearing of senescent cells are called "senolytics". Though anthocyanin is considered to have potential anti-aging effects owing to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, the mechanism of the elimination of senescent cells remains unclear. In this study, we prepared anthocyanins extracted from the fruits of Sambucus canadensis and evaluated their anti-aging effects in vivo and in vitro. We found that anthocyanin could significantly reduce cell senescence and aging of the lens by inhibiting the activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, consequently promoting the apoptosis of senescent cells, increasing the autophagic and mitophagic flux, and enhancing the renewal of mitochondria and the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis, leading to attenuating aging. Therefore, our study provided a basis for anthocyanin to be used as new "senolytics" in anti-aging.
