16086135|a|Art forms (music, painting, sculpture, literature and theatre) are essential components in all social and human contexts. The role of art, in this case of theatre, is to express a visual event that aims to help the spectator identify himself/herself in the characters. The play presented here is "A...come non so" and shows the characteristic aspects of Alzheimer's disease from the first stage of the disease to the last stage: amnesia, aphasia, agnosia and apraxia. It tells the story of Carlo Pontercoli, a gerontologist and specialist in cardiovascular disease, who, while writing his paper on "The elderly and sexuality", manifests the first signs of the disease that killed his mother not so long before. The monologue aims to be a new contribution to the whole understanding of the problems concerning Alzheimer's disease through observation and visual communication of those problems.
