33192996|a|Aim: To determine the predictive value of plasma neurofilament light protein (NfL) as a prognostic marker for outcomes in babies who have undergone therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Method: NfL levels from three groups of term newborns were compared: (1) those with mild HIE who did not receive TH, (2) newborns treated with TH who had minimal or no brain injury on MRI, and (3) newborns treated with TH who had substantial brain injury on MRI. Follow-up outcomes were collected from 18 months onward. Results: Follow-up was available for 33/37 (89%) of children. A cutoff NfL level >436 pg/ml after rewarming (median age 98 h) was associated with adverse outcome with a diagnostic sensitivity 75%, specificity 77%, PPV 75%, and NPV 77%. NfL levels at earlier time points were not predictive of outcome. Interpretation: This pilot study shows that persistently raised plasma NfL levels after rewarming are associated with adverse outcomes in babies with HIE who have undergone TH.
