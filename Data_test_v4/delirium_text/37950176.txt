37950176|t|Self-management of geriatric syndromes - an observational study.
37950176|a|BACKGROUND: Self-management of health refers to various actions and decisions that impact health outcomes. To improve health, independence, and quality of life (QoL) while reducing healthcare utilization and costs, patients' self-management abilities can be enhanced. However, disease-specific self-management interventions may not be applicable for older adults with multiple illnesses. Instead, focusing on prevalent geriatric syndromes, such as frailty, cognitive decline, pain, incontinence, or impaired mobility, may be more beneficial. To achieve this, a detailed understanding of the specific needs of the older population is crucial. METHODS: Patients who are 70 years old or older will be chosen from four geriatric hospitals, which include both inpatient and outpatient facilities. At baseline, each participant will undergo a comprehensive geriatric evaluation and answer various questionnaires that focus on their current self-management abilities, self-efficacy, anxiety, aging perception, and QoL. Moreover, extensive data on the presence and impact of geriatric syndromes will be gathered. Three and six months after the initial evaluation, follow-up assessments will be conducted to identify any changes in participants' health, independence in daily activities, geriatric syndromes, cognition and mood, QoL, and self-management. DISCUSSION: The present investigation aims to assess the factors that may facilitate or impede self-management in older adults afflicted with geriatric syndromes. Instead of concentrating on particular diseases, this study will analyze the association between self-management and geriatric syndromes. The information obtained will contribute to clinical expertise on the self-management habits of older adults and their effects on their well-being, autonomy, and overall QoL, as well as provide insights into geriatric syndromes. This valuable knowledge will be crucial for developing personalised programs to enhance self-management among older adults.
