33901789|t|Elevated plasma levels of galectin-3 binding protein are associated with post-stroke delirium - A pilot study.
33901789|a|To explore the role of systemic inflammation in post-stroke delirium, we investigated the level of two inflammatory mediators: high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and galectin-3 binding protein (Gal-3BP). Of 571 stroke patients, we compared plasma levels of HMGB1 and Gal-3BP in 79 delirious patients with 81 non-delirious patients matched for age and stroke severity. Delirious patients had higher Gal-3BP level (median: 1440 vs 1053 ng/mL, P < 0.01). An elevated level of Gal-3BP was associated with an increased risk of delirium. HMGB1 levels did not differ between groups. Our results suggest that pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages might be involved in delirium pathophysiology.
