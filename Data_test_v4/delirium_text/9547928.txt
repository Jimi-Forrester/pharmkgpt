9547928|t|Olfactory deficits in patients with schizophrenia and severe polydipsia.
9547928|a|BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to assess olfactory function in severely polydipsic/hyponatremic patients with schizophrenia who also had intermittent water intoxication. METHODS: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and an olfactory acuity battery were administered to three groups of male subjects: 9 patients with schizophrenia and severe polydipsia/hyponatremia, 9 control nonpolydipsic/normonatremic patients with schizophrenia, and 9 normal controls. RESULTS: Male patients with severe polydipsia/hyponatremia and intermittent water intoxication had marked olfactory acuity and identification deficits when compared to the patient control group of similar age and age at illness onset, and to normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of deficient acuity (detection threshold) in the polydipsic/hyponatremic group but not the nonpolydipsic, normonatremic group suggests that for this subgroup, abnormalities of olfactory sensory function may occur in a pattern previously reported for other brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
