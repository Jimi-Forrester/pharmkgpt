36714990|a|OBJECTIVES: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in subjects with MCI and associated with higher risk of progression to AD. The cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we sought to evaluate the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, regional tau deposition, and brain volumes in MCI subjects. METHODS: A total of 233 MCI and 305 healthy comparisons were selected from the ADNI-3 cohort. All the subjects underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, volumetric MR brain scan, and Flortaucipir PET for in vivo assessment of regional tau deposition. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was evaluated by means of the NPI questionnaire. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to detect differences in cognitive and imaging markers in MCI subjects with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: 61.4% MCI subjects showed at least one neuropsychiatric symptom, with the most prevalent ones being depression (26.1%), irritability (23.6%), and sleep disturbances (23.6%). There was a significant effect of neuropsychiatric symptoms on cognitive tests of frontal and executive functions. MCI subjects with neuropsychiatric symptoms showed reduced brain volumes in the orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, while no effects were detected on regional tau deposition. Posterior cingulate cortex volume was the only predictor of global neuropsychiatric burden in this MCI population. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur early in the AD trajectory and are mainly related to defects of control executive abilities and to the reduction of gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortices. A better understanding of the cognitive and neuroanatomical mechanisms of neuropsychiatric symptoms in MCI could help develop more targeted and efficacious treatment alternatives.
