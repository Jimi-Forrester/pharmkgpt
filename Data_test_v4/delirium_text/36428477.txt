36428477|t|Delayed Formation of Neonatal Reflexes and of Locomotor Skills Is Associated with Poor Maternal Behavior in OXYS Rats Prone to Alzheimer's Disease-like Pathology.
36428477|a|Postnatal brain development is characterized by high plasticity with critical windows of opportunity where any intervention may positively or adversely influence postnatal growth and lead to long-lasting consequences later in life. Poor maternal care is among these interventions. Here, we found that senescence-accelerated OXYS rats prone to an Alzheimer's disease-like pathology are characterized by more passive maternal behavior and insufficient care for pups as compared to control (Wistar) rats. OXYS pups demonstrated a delay in physical development (of auricle detachment, of emergence of pelage and incisors, of eye opening, and of vaginal opening in females) and late manifestation of reflexes and locomotor skills. All observed behavioral abnormalities are connected either with poor coordination of limbs' movements or with a decrease in motivation and development of depression-like behavior. It is possible that their manifestations can be promoted by the features of maternal behavior of OXYS rats. Overall, these early-life events may have long-lasting consequences and contribute to neurodegeneration and development of the Alzheimer's disease-like pathology later in life.
