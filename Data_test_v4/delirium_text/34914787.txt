34914787|a|BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is now viewed as a systemic disease with multifaceted clinical manifestations. Among the extra-intestinal features, neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are still a diagnostic challenge, since they can precede or follow the diagnosis of CD. In particular, it is well known that some adults with CD may complain of cognitive symptoms, that improve when the gluten-free diet (GFD) is started, although they may re-appear after incidental gluten intake. Among the neurophysiological techniques, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively probe in vivo the excitation state of cortical areas and cortico-spinal conductivity, being also able to unveil preclinical impairment in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in some systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as CD. We previously demonstrated an intracortical disinhibition and hyperfacilitation of MEP responses to TMS in newly diagnosed patients. However, no data are available on the central cholinergic functioning indexed by specific TMS measures, such as the short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which might represent the neurophysiological correlate of cognitive changes in CD patients, also at the preclinical level. METHODS: Cognitive and depressive symptoms were screened by means of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively, in 15 consecutive de novo CD patients and 15 healthy controls. All patients were on normal diet at the time of the enrolment. Brain computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. SAI, recorded at two interstimulus intervals (2 and 8 ms), was assessed as the percentage amplitude ratio between the conditioned and the unconditioned MEP response. Resting motor threshold, MEP amplitude and latency, and central motor conduction time were also measured. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable for age, sex, anthropometric features, and educational level. Brain CT ruled out intracranial calcifications and clear radiological abnormalities in all patients. Scores at MoCA and HDRS were significantly worse in patients than in controls. The comparison of TMS data between the two groups revealed no statistically significant difference for all measures, including SAI at both interstimulus intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Central cholinergic functioning explored by the SAI of the motor cortex resulted to be not affected in these de novo CD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls. Although the statistically significant difference in MoCA, an overt cognitive impairment was not clinically evident in CD patients. Coherently, to date, no study based on TMS or other diagnostic techniques has shown any involvement of the central acetylcholine or the cholinergic fibers within the CNS in CD. This finding might add support to the vascular inflammation hypothesis underlying the so-called "gluten encephalopathy", which seems to be due to an aetiology different from that of the cholinergic dysfunction. Longitudinal studies correlating clinical, TMS, and neuroimaging data, both before and after GFD, are needed.
