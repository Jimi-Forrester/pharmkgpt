37525176|t|Mitigation role of physical exercise participation in the relationship between blood cadmium and sleep disturbance: a cross-sectional study.
37525176|a|The neurotoxicity of heavy metals received increasingly attention in recent years. Sleeping is regulated and coordinated by nervous system, however, the health hazard of heavy metal like cadmium (Cd) exposure on sleep health remained unknown. Rescue strategies like physical exercise (PE) has emerged to mitigate such influence. An epidemiological design with cross-sectional data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010 was applied. The relationship between three blood heavy metals [cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg)] and sleep disturbance was analyzed. A total of 8,751 participants were finally included in and the weighted participants were 330,239,463. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression indicated that mixed blood metals were positively related to risk of sleep disturbance and the mixture effect of exposure to heavy metals was mainly attributable to Cd (89.1%). Weighted logistic regression showed a significant positive association between the highest quartile of blood Cd and sleep disturbance [(OR (95% CI)): 1.191 (1.014,1.400), p = 0.036] in the fully adjusted model, while no association was found under Pb and Hg exposure. In the association between Q3 and Q4 level of blood Cd and sleep disturbance, moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise group had lower risks than none and low exercise group. In the restricted cubic spline model, it was also verified that higher PE participation was associated with the lowest incidence of sleep disturbance with the increment in Cd concentration. Our study suggested that both policy makers and the public should minimize heavy metal exposure. Moreover, conducting moderate to vigorous physical exercise is a protecting factor to mitigate Cd's influence on sleep health.
