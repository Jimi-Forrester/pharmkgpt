31261895|a|Preventive approaches for age-related memory decline and dementia have become a high priority in the aging society because of the lack of therapeutic approaches. Recent epidemiological studies have reported that fermented dairy products can help prevent dementia. Previously, we identified tryptophan-tyrosine (WY) and tryptophan-methionine (WM) peptides as the suppressants of activation of the primary microglia and showed that WY peptide consumption suppresses inflammation in the brains of Alzheimer's disease model mice. However, the effects of the WM peptide on inflammation in the brain and Alzheimer's pathology have not been investigated. Here, we evaluated the effect of WM peptide consumption on Alzheimer's disease model (5xFAD) mice. In 5xFAD mice, intake of WM peptide suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, activation of microglia, and infiltration of activated microglia around beta amyloid (Abeta) depositions. WM peptide intake reduced Abeta deposition in the cortex and hippocampus and then improved the object recognition memory. Taken together with previous reports, the current findings indicate that ingestion of tryptophan-related peptides or food material rich in tryptophan-related peptides, thereby regulating microglial activity, represents a potential preventive approach for cognitive decline and dementia related to inflammation.
