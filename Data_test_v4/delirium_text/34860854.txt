34860854|t|Effect of changes in cerebral oximeter values during cardiac surgery on the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive deficits (POND): A retrospective study based on propensity score-matched analysis.
34860854|a|OBJECTIVES: The occurrence of postoperative neurocognitive deficits(POND)after major cardiac surgery is associated with an increase in perioperative mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress caused by oxygen can affect neuronal damage, which can lead to POND. Whether the intraoperative rSO2 value reflects oxidative stress and the associated incidence of POND is unknown. METHODS: Among 3482 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 976 patients were allocated for this retrospective study. Of these, 230 patients (32.5%) were observed to have postoperative neurologic symptoms. After propensity score 1:2 ratio matching, a total of 690 patients were included in the analysis. Recorded data on the occurrence of POND from the postoperative period to predischarge were collected from the electronic records. RESULTS: The mean baseline rSO2 value was higher in the POND (-) group than in the POND (+) group. The mean overall minimum rSO2 value was lower in the POND (+) group (52.2 +- 8.3 vs 48.3 +- 10.5, P < 0.001). The mean overall maximum rSO2 values were not significantly different between the two groups (72.7 +- 8.3 vs 73.2 +- 9.2, P = 0.526). However, there was a greater increase in the overall maximum rSO2 values as compared with baseline in the POND (+) group (10.9 +- 8.2 vs 17.9 +- 10.2, P < 0.001). The degree of increase in the maximum rSO2 value was a risk factor affecting the occurrence of POND (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.11; P < 0.001). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for delta values of minimal and maximal compared with baseline values were 0.60 and 0.71, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increased cerebral oximeter levels during cardiac surgery may also be a risk factor for POND. This is considered to reflect the possibility of oxidative neuronal damage, and further studies are needed in the future.
