35886888|a|The endothelium has multiple functions, ranging from maintaining vascular homeostasis and providing nutrition and oxygen to tissues to evocating inflammation under adverse conditions and determining endothelial barrier disruption, resulting in dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction represents a common condition associated with the pathogenesis of all diseases of the cardiovascular system, as well as of diseases of all of the other systems of the human body, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COVID-19 respiratory distress. Such evidence is leading to the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for preserving, reverting, or restoring endothelium integrity and functionality by promptly treating its dysfunction. Here, some strategies for achieving these goals are explored, despite the diverse challenges that exist, necessitating significant bench work associated with an increased number of clinical studies.
