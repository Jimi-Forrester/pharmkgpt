17659472|a|The oceans provide a rich source of structurally unique compounds that have demonstrated significant biological activities in a range of indications. In particular, the development of marine compounds is emerging as an important field for neurology. Several marine-derived compounds are currently in clinical trials or have been launched for the treatment of neuropathic pain, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. This review describes the development of several of these compounds, specifically covering the conopeptides, anabaseine and omega-3 fatty acids for the potential treatment of various neurological disorders.
