32069907|t|Flavonoid Profile of the Genista tridentata L., a Species Used Traditionally to Treat Inflammatory Processes.
32069907|a|Ethnopharmacological surveys on Portuguese flora reveal that Genista tridentata L. is a shrub used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various inflammation-related health problems, although scientific support of its benefits is still necessary. In order to establish the anti-inflammatory potential of G. tridentata and support its traditional use, ethanolic extracts of three sections of the plant (root, stem, and leaves) were subjected to in vitro evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulates macrophages as an inflammation model. Simultaneously, we also aimed to establish the extracts' flavonoids profile. The ethanolic extracts, obtained by Soxhlet extraction, profile of the three sections confirmed their richness in flavonoids, being three prenylated flavonoids isolated and characterized in the root, including a new natural compound, the 3-methoxymundulin. The extracts from the three plant sections showed strong antioxidant activity at the cellular level and significantly inhibit the LPS-triggered NO production by downregulating Nos2 gene transcription and consequently iNOS expression. Additionally, root and stem extracts also decreased the LPS-induced transcription of the pro-inflammatory genes Il1b, Il6, and Ptgs2. Thus, the results support the anti-inflammatory properties attributed to G. tridentate preparations. Relevantly, the roots of the shrub, plant part not used, is an unexplored source of compounds with pharmacological and nutraceutical value.
