36067994|t|Current and future perspectives on CAR-T cell therapy for renal cell carcinoma: A comprehensive review.
36067994|a|In the clinical setting of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), immune reactions such as tumor-specific T cell responses can be spontaneous events or can be elicited by checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, and other immunotherapy modalities. The results from immunotherapy have led to significant advances in treatment methods and patient outcomes. The approval of nivolumab primarily as a second-line monotherapy and the latest approval of novel combination therapies as first-line treatment have established the significance of immunotherapy in the treatment of RCC. In this perspective, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy represents a major advance in the developing field of immunotherapy. This treatment modality facilitates T cells to express specific CARs on the cell surface which are reinfused to the patient to treat the analogous tumor cells. After showing treatment potential in hematological malignancies, this new therapeutic approach has become a strong candidate as a therapeutic modality for solid neoplasms. Although CAR-T cell therapy has shown promise and clinical benefit compared to previous T-cell modulated immunotherapies, further studies are warranted to overcome unfavorable physiological settings and hindrances such as the lack of specific molecular targets, depletion of CAR-T cells, a hostile tumor microenvironment, and on/off-tumor toxicities. Several approaches are being considered and research is ongoing to overcome these problems. In this comprehensive review, we provide the rationale and preliminary results of CAR-T cell therapy in RCC and discuss emerging novel strategies and future directions.
