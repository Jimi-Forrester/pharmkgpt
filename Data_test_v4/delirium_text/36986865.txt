36986865|t|The Exosome-Mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway in Neurological Diseases.
36986865|a|As major public health concerns associated with a rapidly growing aging population, neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and neurological diseases are important causes of disability and mortality. Neurological diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Recent studies have indicated that apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress are the main players of NDDs and have critical roles in neurodegenerative processes. During the aforementioned inflammatory/apoptotic/oxidative stress procedures, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a crucial role. Considering the functional and structural aspects of the blood-brain barrier, drug delivery to the central nervous system is relatively challenging. Exosomes are nanoscale membrane-bound carriers that can be secreted by cells and carry several cargoes, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites. Exosomes significantly take part in the intercellular communications due to their specific features including low immunogenicity, flexibility, and great tissue/cell penetration capabilities. Due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, these nano-sized structures have been introduced as proper vehicles for central nervous system drug delivery by multiple studies. In the present systematic review, we highlight the potential therapeutic effects of exosomes in the context of NDDs and neurological diseases by targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
