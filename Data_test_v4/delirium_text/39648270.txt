39648270|t|Outcomes of a delirium prevention program after major abdominal emergency surgery: An interventional study.
39648270|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common complication after emergency surgery. Delirium is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical approach varies and pharmacological treatment is ineffective. We aimed to investigate if a structured non-pharmacological multidisciplinary intervention could reduce postoperative delirium. METHODS: An interventional study including all patients aged 65 years or older undergoing major abdominal emergency surgery in an 8 month period. The intervention consisted of improved screening, staff, patient, and family education, ward modifications and nurse-led daily motor and sensory stimulation. Data was obtained from medical records. Results were compared to an unmatched historic cohort. Primary outcome was occurrence of delirium, secondary outcomes were mortality, postoperative complications, and length of stay. RESULTS: 312 patients were included, 81 in the study group and 231 in the control group. Delirium occurred in 6.2% of the interventional group compared to 15.2% in the historic cohort (p = 0.038). In a multivariate regression analysis, the rate of delirium was significantly reduced in the interventional group; OR 0.185 95% CI (0.04-0.81), p = 0.026. The 90 day mortality was 14.8% in the interventional group and 8.7% in the historic cohort (p = 0.116). The rate of overall medical complications was significantly lower in the study group (37% vs. 63%, p < 0.001). Median length of stay was 6 days in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A structured cluster intervention may prevent the occurrence of postoperative delirium. The intervention did not reduce mortality or length of stay, but the need for supplementary nursing staff was eliminated.
