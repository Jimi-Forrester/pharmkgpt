In addition, food insecurity could make it harder for HIV patients to stick to their treatment plans as effectively as possible. Objective: This research aimed to determine the association between socio-demographic and food insecurity with adherence to antiretroviral therapy among people living with HIV on ART in Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria. Method: Using a cross-sectional design, a systematic random sampling method was used to select respondents aged 18-64 years on antiretroviral therapy for at least six months at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria, outpatients of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief clinic. Socio-demographic, food insecurity status and adherence to ART was obtained using self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and multiple logistic regression were used for data analysis. Results: Among the 385 people who took part in the study, about 67.5% of females and 32.5% of males took part in the survey, respectively. About 54% of adults adhered to ART. The majority of the respondents (87.0%) had a low level of food security. Food insecurity (OR = 1.2, p = <0.05), government employment (OR = 2.842, p = <0.01), self-employment (OR = 2.6, p = <0.001), and being divorced or widowed (OR = 2.0, p = <0.01) were all significantly associated with ART adherence. Conclusion: Food insecurity, employment, and marital status influenced adherence to ART. As a result, health care providers and HIV control programme implementers must continually emphasis and encourage strict adherence.
