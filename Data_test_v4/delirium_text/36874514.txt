36874514|t|Indian Psychiatric Society multicentre study: Diagnostic patterns, comorbidity and prescription practices for patients with Dementia.
36874514|a|Background: There are more than 5 million people with dementia in India. Multicentre studies looking at details of treatment for people with dementia In India are lacking. Clinical audit is a quality improvement process which aims to systematically assess, evaluate, and improve patient care. Evaluating current practice is the key to a clinical audit cycle. Aim: This study aimed to assess the diagnostic patterns and prescribing practices of psychiatrists for patients with dementia in India. Method: A retrospective case file study was conducted across several centers in India. Results: Information from the case records of 586 patients with dementia was obtained. Mean age of the patients was 71.14 years (standard deviation = 9.42). Three hundred twenty one (54.8%) were men. Alzheimer's disease (349; 59.6%) was the most frequent diagnosis followed by vascular dementia (117; 20%). Three hundred fifty five (60.6%) patients had medical disorders and 47.4% patients were taking medications for their medical conditions. Eighty one (69.2%) patients with vascular dementia had cardiovascular problems. Majority of the patients (524; 89.4%) were on medications for dementia. Most frequently prescribed treatment was Donepezil (230; 39.2%) followed by Donepezil-Memantine combination (225; 38.4%). Overall, 380 (64.8%) patients were on antipsychotics. Quetiapine (213, 36.3%) was the most frequently used antipsychotic. Overall, 113 (19.3%) patients were on antidepressants, 80 (13.7%) patients were on sedatives/hypnotics, and 16 (2.7%) patients were on mood stabilizers. Three hundred nineteen (55.4%) patients and caregivers of 374 (65%) patients were receiving psychosocial interventions. Conclusions: Diagnostic and prescription patterns in dementia which emerged from this study are comparable to other studies both nationally and internationally. Comparing current practices at individual and national levels against accepted guidelines, obtaining feedback, identifying gaps and instituting remedial measures help to improve the standard of care provided.
