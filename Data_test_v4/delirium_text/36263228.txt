36263228|a|Background: Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2) is one of the emerging immune checkpoints. Meanwhile, TDO2 is also a key enzyme in the tryptophan (Trp)-kynurenine (Kyn) signaling pathway. Many studies have evaluated that TDO2 is highly expressed in various malignant tumor patients and plays a prognostic role. However, the sample size of a single prognostic study was small, and the results were still controversial. Methods: We used Stata software and referenced the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement to conduct a meta-analysis on TDO2 and its clinical features and prognosis. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases to find publications concerning TDO2 expression in malignant tumor patients up to June 2021. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to evaluate the bias risk of the included literature. Risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were used for clinical outcomes, specifically overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In addition, we used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to verify our conclusions. Results: Nine studies including 667 patients with malignant tumors were identified. Our results suggested that overexpression of TDO2 was statistically correlated with poor OS and poor PFS (HR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.52-4.40, p = 0.0005; HR = 2.38, 95% CI = 0.99-5.73, p = 0.05). In terms of clinicopathological characteristics, the overexpression level of TDO2 was statistically correlated with TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) stage (RR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48-0.89, p = 0.002) and regional lymph node metastasis (RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.99, p = 0.04). Subgroup analysis revealed the potential sources of heterogeneity. In addition, bioinformatics studies suggested that the level of TDO2 was high in malignant tumors and higher in cancer tissue than in matched paracarcinoma tissue. Gene enrichment analysis showed that TDO2 was closely related to immune response. Conclusion: Overall, TDO2 may be a biomarker for the survival and prognosis of patients with malignant tumors and a potential therapeutic target in the future.
