38280903|a|Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process by which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics. This process induces cell migration and invasion, which are closely related to cancer metastasis and malignancy. EMT consists of various intermediate states that express both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, called partial EMT. Recently, several studies have focused on the roles of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels associated with EMT in cancer cell migration and invasion. In this study, we demonstrate the relationship between Kv3.4 and EMT and confirm the effects of cell migration and invasion. With TGF-beta treatment, EMT was induced and Kv3.4 was also increased in A549 cells, human lung carcinoma cells. The knockdown of Kv3.4 blocked the EMT progression reducing cell migration and invasion. However, the Kv3.4 overexpressed cells acquired mesenchymal characteristics and increased cell migration and invasion. The overexpression of Kv3.4 also has a synergistic effect with TGF-beta in promoting cell migration. Therefore, we conclude that Kv3.4 regulates cancer migration and invasion through TGF-beta-induced EMT and these results provide insights into the understanding of cancer metastasis.
