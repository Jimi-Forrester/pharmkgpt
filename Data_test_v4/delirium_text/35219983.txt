35219983|t|Pharmacotherapy for elderly patients with delirium in a general ward setting: A retrospective study.
35219983|a|Antipsychotic medications are widely used in patients with delirium. However, antipsychotics may lead to various adverse events including cardiac arrythmias, extrapyramidal side effects, and oversedation. This study aimed to investigate whether non-antipsychotic medications including ramelteon, suvorexant, and trazodone are useful for the treatment of elderly inpatients with delirium in a general ward setting. This was a retrospective cohort study using medical chart reviews of all consecutive inpatients with hyperactive forms of delirium who were admitted to a regional general hospital. The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate whether non-antipsychotic medication (ramelteon, suvorexant, and trazodone) is inferior, in terms of efficacy and safety, to antipsychotic medication in delirium treatment. Of 154 patients who consulted psychiatrists during the study period, 33 patients were diagnosed with hyperactive delirium. Of these patients, 21 were categorized into the antipsychotic medication group, and 12 were categorized into the non-antipsychotic medication group. The duration of delirium after pharmacological treatments was not statistically different between the two groups. However, the rates of adverse events related to psychotropic medications in the antipsychotic medication group were significantly higher than that in the non-antipsychotic medication group. This study demonstrated that, in the treatment of elderly patients with delirium, non-antipsychotic drugs, such as suvorexant, ramelteon, and trazodone, could be more useful than antipsychotics in terms of efficacy and safety.
