17920001|a|Environmental exposure to some heavy metals such as cadmium appears to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, definite mechanism of their toxicity in AD remains to be elucidated. Previous studies largely focused on the metal ions binding to beta-amyloid, however, very few papers concerned the interaction between tau and metal ions. For the first time, we investigated the impacts of Cd(II) on the conformation and self-aggregation of Alzheimer's tau peptide R3, corresponding to the third repeat of microtubule-binding domain. The initial state of R3 was proven to be dimeric linked by intermolecular disulfide bond, in the non-reducing buffer (Tris-HCl buffer pH7.5, containing no reducing reagent). In this paper, we show that Cd(II) can accelerate heparin-induced aggregation of R3 or independently induce the aggregation of R3, as monitored by ThS fluorescence. In the presence of Cd(II), the resulting R3 filaments became much smaller, as revealed by electron microscopy. Binding to the Cd(II) ion, the dimeric R3 partially lost its random coil, and converted to alpha-helix structure, as revealed by CD and Raman spectrum. Stoichiometric analysis of CD signal against the ratio of [Cd(II)]/[R3] suggested that the coordination intermediate consisted of two R3 dimers binding to a central cadmium ion. As the seed, the coordination intermediate could extensively accelerate the self-aggregation of R3 via promoting the nucleation step. On the other hand, gain in alpha-helix structure on the peptide chain, by coordinating with Cd(II), could be a critical role to promote self-aggregation, as revealed by Raman spectrum. These results provide a further insight into the mechanism of tau filament formation and emphasize the possible involvement of Cd(II) in the pathogenesis of AD.
