35989250|t|Early integration of palliative care in hematology: an urgency for patients, a challenge for physicians.
35989250|a|INTRODUCTION: Early integration between palliative care and other medical specialties in the care of patients with serious illnesses is consolidating itself as good medical practice, based on scientific and ethical evidence. Despite this, palliative care is still not part of the routine care of patients with hematological diseases, even in specialized centers. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: In this article, we review the benefits and the main barriers described in the literature for early integration of hematology and palliative care. We also point out the challenges encountered in clinical practice, such as end-of-life prognosis assessment in patients with hematological diseases and management of the most common symptoms in hematology. Finally, we review models of integration between palliative care and oncology centers in outpatient and inpatient settings. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Patients with hematological diseases can greatly benefit from early integration with palliative care, with improvement in symptom control, quality of life, reduction of emotional distress and the development of advanced care directives. It is necessary to make hematologists aware of the benefits of palliative care, provide adequate training for multidisciplinary teams and encourage specific studies of palliative care in patients with hematological diseases.
