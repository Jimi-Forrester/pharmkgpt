36421167|a|In this study, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-like activity of zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is reported for the first time. Then, colorimetric sensors for the ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) and copper ion (Cu2+) detection were developed based on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE)- and ALP-like activities of ZIF-8. The ZIF-8 has good mimetic enzyme activity and exhibits high affinity to the substrates. Its AChE- and ALP-like activities also have good reusability and storage stability. Good linear dependences are obtained in the range of 1.3-250.0 muM (AChE-like activity-based) and 4.5-454.5 muM (ALP-like activity based) for Cu2+ detection. Furthermore, good linear dependence is also obtained based on the ALP-like activity of ZIF-8 for AAO detection in the range of 2.3-454.5 U/L. Their limits of detection (LODs) are calculated to be 0.7 microM, 2.8 microM, and 1.8 U/L, respectively. Finally, the sample spiked recoveries of Cu2+ in tap water, Cu2+, and AAO in human serum and rabbit plasma were measured, and the results are in the range of 80.0-119.3%. In short, the preparation of ZIF-8 is simple, environmentally friendly, and harmless, and can realize highly selective detection of AAO and Cu2+ in an efficient and fast process.
