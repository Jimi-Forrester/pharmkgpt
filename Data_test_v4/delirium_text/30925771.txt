30925771|t|Antidiabetic, Anticholinesterase and Antioxidant Activity vs. Terpenoids and Phenolic Compounds in Selected New Cultivars and Hybrids of Artichoke Cynara scolymus L.
30925771|a|The aim of the study was to analyze the chemical composition of new artichoke cultivars and hybrids and to assess their potential health-promoting properties. Polyphenols, carotenoids and chlorophylls were identified by liquid chromatography-photodiode detector-mass spectrometry/quadrupole time of flight (LC-PDA-MS/QTof) and quantified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-photodiode detector (UPLC-PDA). Sugar and organic acid profiles were prepared, and antioxidant capacity (ABTS, FRAP and ORAC) and in vitro antidiabetic (inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase) and anticholinesterase (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)) potentials were evaluated. The analyses revealed a highly varied content of bioactive compounds and great health-promoting potential significantly depending on a cultivar. The content of polyphenolic compounds ranged from 1681.49 ("Sambo") to 3638.91 ("Symphony") mg/100 g of dry weight (DW). "Blanca de Tudela" contained the highest amounts of carotenoids and chlorophylls (3761.91 mg/100 g DW) and exhibited high ABTS and ORAC capacity. Inhibition of antidiabetic enzymes was significant in cvs. "Symphony" and "Calico". Additionally, all tested cultivars and hybrids turned out to be effective inhibitors of neurodegenerative enzymes.
