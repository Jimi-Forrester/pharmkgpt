31385474|t|The Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Male Reproductive Physiology and Pathology: A Review.
31385474|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, defined as prolonged disturbances in protein folding and accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Perturbation of the ER, such as distribution of oxidative stress, iron imbalance, Ca2+ leakage, protein overload, and hypoxia, can cause ER stress. The cell reacts to ER stress by activating protective pathways, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is comprised of cellular mechanisms aimed for maintaining cellular homeostasis or, in case of excessively severe stress, at the initiation of cellular apoptosis. The three UPR signaling pathways from the ER stress sensors are initiated by activating transcription factor 6, inositol requiring enzyme 1, and protein kinase RNA-activated-like ER kinase. A number of physiological and pathological conditions, environmental toxicants and variety of pharmacological agents showed disruption of proper ER functions and thereby cause ER stress in male reproductive organ in rat model. The present review summarizes the existing data concerning the molecular and biological mechanism of ER stress in male reproduction and male infertility. ER stress initiated cell death pathway has been related to several diseases, including hypoxia, heath disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Although there is not enough evidence to prove the relationship between ER stress and male infertility in human, most studies in this review found that ER stress was correlated with male reproduction and infertility in animal models. The ER stress could be novel signaling pathway of regulating male reproductive cellular apoptosis. Infertility might be a result of disturbing the ER stress response during the process of male reproduction.
