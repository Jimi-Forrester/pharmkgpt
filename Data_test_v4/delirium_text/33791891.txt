33791891|a|This study evaluated the effectiveness of selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD) application three times daily (t.i.d.) compared to the standard four times daily (q.i.d.). Retrospective equivalence (combined non-inferiority and non-superiority design) study with a before-and-after design on a tertiary ICU in which the SDD frequency was reduced from q.i.d. to t.i.d. All patients with ICU admissions >=72h and with >=2 surveillance cultures collected on different dates were included in this study. We compared successful decontamination of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Furthermore, time to decontamination, ICU-acquired GNB bacteraemia and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups. In total 1958 ICU admissions (1236 q.i.d., 722 t.i.d). Decontamination was achieved during the first week of admission in 77% and 76% of patients receiving SDD q.i.d and t.i.d., respectively. Successful decontamination within 14 days (without consecutive acquisition of Gram-negative bacteria) was achieved in 69.3% of the admissions with q.i.d. versus 66.8% in t.i.d. SDD (p-value = 0.2519). The proportions of successful decontamination of GNB were equivalent in both groups (-0.025, 98% CI: -0.087; 0.037). There was no significant difference in time to decontamination between the two regimens (log-rank test p-value = 0.55). Incidence (episodes/1000 days) of ICU-acquired GNB bacteraemia was 0.9 in both groups, and OR for death at day 28 in the t.i.d. group compared to the q.i.d. group was 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.21). This study shows that a t.i.d. application regimen achieves similar outcomes to the standard q.i.d. regime, for both microbiological and clinical outcome measures.
