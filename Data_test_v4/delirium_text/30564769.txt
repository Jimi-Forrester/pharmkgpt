30564769|t|Brief history of anti-seizure drug development.
30564769|a|The mainstay of therapy for epilepsy is anti-seizure drugs (ASDs, also referred to as anticonvulsants and anti-epileptic medications). Through much of the past century, only a handful for ASDs were available for clinical use. However, with the creation of the U.S. National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-sponsored Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP), coupled with the emergence of high-throughput screening platforms and methodologies, and advances in our understanding of the fundamental neurobiology of epilepsy, ASD development has greatly accelerated over the past 25 years. More than 18 new ASDs have been approved for clinical use since the inception of the ASP. Despite this remarkable success and the emergence of drugs possessing more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles that act on novel molecular targets, there has been increasing recognition that the paradigms for drug discovery have not yielded significant improvements in therapeutic efficacy, and that disease modification (i.e., anti-epileptogenesis), among other challenges, must be addressed. Thus, with the renewed framework and mission of improving the lives of people with epilepsy, the name of the ASP was changed to the Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP). This review briefly summarizes the history of ASD development and outlines some of the challenges and opportunities for the next generation of drug therapies for the epilepsy field.
