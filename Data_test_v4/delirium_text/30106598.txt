30106598|t|4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole Distinctly Labels Tau Deposits.
30106598|a|Tau deposits have distinct biochemical characteristics and vary morphologically based on identification with tau antibodies and several chemical dyes. Here, we report 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-positivity of tau deposits. Furthermore, we investigated the cause for this positivity. DAPI was positive in 3R/4R (3-repeat/4-repeat) tau deposits in Alzheimer's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and in 4R tau deposits in corticobasal degeneration, but negative in 4R tau deposits in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 and progressive supranuclear palsy. The peak emission wavelength of DAPI after binding to a tau deposit was similar to that after binding to a nucleus. This DAPI-positivity was conspicuous at the optimum concentration of 2 mug/ml. DAPI-positivity was diminished after formic acid treatment, but preserved after nucleic acid elimination and phosphate moiety blocking. Our results suggest that staining with 2 mug/ml DAPI is a common but useful tool to differentially detect tau deposits in various tauopathies.
