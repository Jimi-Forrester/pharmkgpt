35183222|a|SorLA is a member of the Vps10p-domain (Vps10p-D) receptor family of type-I transmembrane proteins conveying neuronal endosomal sorting. The extracellular/luminal moiety of SorLA has a unique mosaic domain composition and interacts with a large number of different and partially unrelated ligands, including the amyloid precursor protein as well as amyloid-beta. Several studies support a strong association of SorLA with sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although SorLA seems to be an important factor in AD, the large number of different ligands suggests a role as a neuronal multifunctional receptor with additional intracellular sorting capacities. Therefore, understanding the determinants of SorLA's subcellular targeting might be pertinent for understanding neuronal endosomal sorting mechanisms in general. A number of cytosolic adaptor proteins have already been demonstrated to determine intracellular trafficking of SorLA. Most of these adaptors and several ligands of the extracellular/luminal moiety are shared with the Vps10p-D receptor Sortilin. Although SorLA and Sortilin show both a predominant intracellular and endosomal localization, they are targeted to different endosomal compartments. Thus, independent adaptor proteins may convey their differential endosomal targeting. Here, we hypothesized that Sortilin and SorLA interact with the cytosolic adaptors PSD95 and PICK1 which have been shown to bind the Vps10p-D receptor SorCS3. We observed only an interaction for SorLA and PICK1 in mammalian-two-hybrid, pull-down and cellular recruitment experiments. We demonstrate by mutational analysis that the C-terminal minimal PDZ domain binding motif VIA of SorLA mediates the interaction. Moreover, we show co-localization of SorLA and PICK1 at vesicular structures in primary neurons. Although the physiological role of the interaction between PICK1 and SorLA remains unsolved, our study suggests that PICK1 partakes in regulating SorLA's intracellular itinerary.
