33790323|a|Exercise affords broad benefits for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) including less fatigue, depression, and improved cognition. In animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), exercise has been shown to improve remyelination, decrease blood-brain barrier permeability and reduce leukocyte infiltration. Despite these benefits many PwMS refrain from engaging in physical activity. This barrier to participation in exercise may be overcome by uncovering and describing the mechanisms by which exercise promotes beneficial changes in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that acute bouts of exercise in mice profoundly alters the proteome in demyelinating lesions. Following lysolecithin induced demyelination of the ventral spinal cord, mice were given immediate access to a running wheel for 4 days. Lesioned spinal cords and peripheral blood serum were then subjected to tandem mass tag labeling shotgun proteomics workflow to identify alteration in protein levels. We identified 86 significantly upregulated and 85 downregulated proteins in the lesioned spinal cord as well as 14 significantly upregulated and 11 downregulated proteins in the serum following acute exercise. Altered pathways following exercise in demyelinated mice include oxidative stress response, metabolism and transmission across chemical synapses. Similar acute bout of exercise in naive mice also changed several proteins in the serum and spinal cord, including those for metabolism and anti-oxidant responses. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms and duration of activity required to influence the injured CNS should motivate PwMS and other conditions to embrace exercise as part of their therapy to manage CNS disability.
