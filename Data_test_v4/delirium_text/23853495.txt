23853495|t|Morbidity and mortality in Jeju residents over 50-years of age with hip fracture with mean 6-year follow-up: a prospective cohort study.
23853495|a|This prospective cohort study was performed to estimate the morbidity and mortality with 790 patients over 50-yr of age that sustained a femoral neck or intertrochanteric fracture from 2002 to 2006, followed-up for a mean of 6 yr (range, 4 to 9 yr). Crude and annual standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated; and mortalities in the cohort and the age and sex matched general population were compared. The risk factors on mortality and activities pre- and post-injury were assessed. Accumulated mortality was 16.7% (132 patients) at 1 yr, 45.8% (337 patients) at 5 yr, and 60% (372 patients) at 8 yr. SMR at 5 yr post-injury was 1.3 times that of the general population. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (OR, 1.074; 95% CI, 1.050-1.097; P<0.001), woman (OR, 1.893; 95% CI, 1.207-2.968; P=0.005), and medical comorbidity (OR, 1.334; 95% CI, 1.167-1.524 P<0.001) were independently associated with mortality after hip fracture. Only 59 of the 150 patients (39.3%) who were able to ambulate normally outdoors at preinjury retained this ability at final follow-up. Patients with a hip fracture exhibits higher mortality at up to 5 yr than general population. Age and a preinjury comorbidity are associated with mortality.
