33786122|a|INTRODUCTION: A proactive approach is recommended in colorectal anastomosis leak treatment, and early diagnosis is very important. Early postoperative endoscopy would allow rapid diagnosis of anastomotic pathologies and consequent prompt intervention according to anastomotic disruption morphology. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of close endoscopic follow-up of all patients (including asymptomatic ones) in improving diagnosis of acute leak (AL) and reducing its complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 124 patients who had undergone rectum resection for rectal cancer with stapled anastomosis. Endoscopy was performed between the 7th and 10th postoperative day and 1 month postoperatively. For defect morphology assessment, a classification system was created based on four levels of severity. Photographic findings were evaluated by an independent, experienced gastroenterologist. RESULTS: Postoperative endoscopy revealed 28 (22.6%) patients with acute leakage. Initial endoscopy confirmed AL in 18 patients. Six (31.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 13 (68.4%) were symptomatic. The second endoscopy revealed another 9 (32.1%) leaks (4 (44.5%) asymptomatic and 5 (55.5%) symptomatic). Sixteen (57.1%) patients had grade A leakages, 7 (25.0%) had grade B leakages, and 5 (17.9%) had grade C leakages. Furthermore, 22 of 27 (81%) defects were located posterior and posterior-laterally. Fifteen (55.5%) defects were smaller than 1/3 the circumference, 7 (25.9%) affected 1/3-1/2 of the circumference, and 5 (18.5%) affected more than 1/2 of the circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of early endoscopy in postoperative management allows rapid diagnosis of AL and allows faster intervention, even in leaks that are clinically silent.
