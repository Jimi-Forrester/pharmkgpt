32916739|a|Surgical treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder can lead to disturbances (withdrawal syndrome, delirium) which require intensive care treatment. In a surgical ward, the diagnosis of an alcohol related disorder is not always simple. Oftentimes patients conceal or trivialize the issue and as a result are admitted to the hospital in a non-abstinent or unstable state. It is risky to assume that patients with alcohol use disorder will successfully be supplied with alcohol in general hospitals. The risk can be reduced through presurgical identification and alcohol withdrawal of such patients. A literature review concludes that there is no secured evidence for the application of alcohol as prophylaxis or therapy of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a surgical intensive care unit. The use of intravenous and oral alcohol in intensive care is an unnecessary risk to patients. There are more secure alternatives.
