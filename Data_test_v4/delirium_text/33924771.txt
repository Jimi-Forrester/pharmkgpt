33924771|t|Age-Dependent Microglial Response to Systemic Infection.
33924771|a|Inflammation is part of the aging process, and the inflammatory innate immune response is more exacerbated in older individuals when compared to younger individuals. Similarly, there is a difference in the response to systemic infection that varies with age. In a recent article by Hoogland et al., the authors studied the microglial response to systemic infection in young (2 months) and middle-aged mice (13-14 months) that were challenged with live Escherichia coli to investigate whether the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses mounted by microglia after systemic infection varies with age. Here, we comment on this study and its implications on how inflammation in the brain varies with age.
