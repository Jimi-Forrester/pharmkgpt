39051213|t|The Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Cognition in Diffuse Axonal Injury in a Rat Model.
39051213|a|Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) following sudden acceleration and deceleration can lead to cognitive function decline. Various treatments have been proposed. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive stimulation technique, is a potential treatment for enhancing neuroplasticity in cases of brain injury. The therapeutic efficacy of rTMS on cognitive function remains unconfirmed. This study investigated the effects of rTMS and the underlying molecular biomechanisms using a rat model of DAI. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 18) were randomly divided into two groups: one receiving rTMS after DAI and the other without brain stimulation. All rats were subjected to sudden acceleration and deceleration using a DAI modeling machine to induce damage. MRI was performed to confirm the DAI lesion. The experimental group received rTMS at a frequency of 1 Hz over the frontal cortex for 10 min daily for five days. To assess spatial memory, we conducted the Morris water maze (MWM) test one day post-brain damage and one day after the five-day intervention. A video tracking system recorded the escape latency. After post-MWM tests, all rats were euthanized, and their brain tissues, particularly from the hippocampus, were collected for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The escape latency showed no difference on the MWM test after DAI, but a significant difference was observed after rTMS between the two groups. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses indicated increased expression of BDNF, VEGF, and MAP2 in the hippocampal brain tissue of the DAI-T group. In conclusion, rTMS improved cognitive function in the DAI rat model. The increased expression of BDNF, VEGF, and MAP2 in the DAI-T group supports the potential use of rTMS in treating cognitive impairments associated with DAI.
