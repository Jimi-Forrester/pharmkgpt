29790502|t|Inhibition of tau-derived hexapeptide aggregation and toxicity by a self-assembled cyclic d,l-alpha-peptide conformational inhibitor.
29790502|a|Aggregation and accumulation of amyloid beta and tau proteins to plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the key pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we studied the capability of the cyclic d,l-alpha-peptide CP-2 as a conformational inhibitor of different amyloids to cross-interact with tau-derived AcPHF6 peptide and inhibit its aggregation, membrane perturbation and toxicity.
