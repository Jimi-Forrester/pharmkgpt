34813112|t|4D flow MRI hemodynamic biomarkers for cerebrovascular diseases.
34813112|a|Alterations in cerebral blood flow are common in several neurological diseases among the elderly including stroke, cerebral small vessel disease, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively new technique to investigate cerebrovascular disease, and makes it possible to obtain time-resolved blood flow measurements of the entire cerebral arterial venous vasculature and can be used to derive a repertoire of hemodynamic biomarkers indicative of cerebrovascular health. The information that can be obtained from one single 4D flow MRI scan allows both the investigation of aberrant flow patterns at a focal location in the vasculature as well as estimations of brain-wide disturbances in blood flow. Such focal and global hemodynamic biomarkers show the potential of being sensitive to impending cerebrovascular disease and disease progression and can also become useful during planning and follow-up of interventions aiming to restore a normal cerebral circulation. Here, we describe 4D flow MRI approaches for analyzing the cerebral vasculature. We then survey key hemodynamic biomarkers that can be reliably assessed using the technique. Finally, we highlight cerebrovascular diseases where one or multiple hemodynamic biomarkers are of central interest.
