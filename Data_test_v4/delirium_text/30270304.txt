30270304|a|OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined whether a combined regimen of a short-term nap and a light physical exercise is effective in improving sleep among elderly individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia in communal living group homes. METHODS: Twenty-three female residents (aged 87.4+-5.6 years) living in two group homes for the elderly with dementia were included in the present study. After undergoing an assessment for eligibility, they were randomly allocated to either the study group (N=11), who participated in the regimen of a short-term nap (<30 min) and light physical exercise for four weeks, or the control group (N=12), who received the usual nursing care without participating in the nap and exercise regimen. The lengths of sleep time and wake time were measured using a sleep monitor with a radiofrequency motion sensor. The frequencies of nocturnal behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia including excitement, violence, night delirium, wandering, and unhygienic behavior were investigated throughout the study period. RESULTS: The subjects participating in the nap and physical exercise regimen showed a significant increase in sleep efficacy as well as a reduction in the total nocturnal wake time, whereas no clear change was observed in the control subjects. The frequencies of nocturnal episodes of urination in the study group also decreased during the course of the study. However, there was no significant decrease in the frequencies of nocturnal behavioral or psychological symptoms associated with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that a short-term nap and a light physical exercise may be effective in adjusting the sleep-wake biorhythm in elderly patients with mild-to-moderate dementia and may improve sleep among these individuals.
