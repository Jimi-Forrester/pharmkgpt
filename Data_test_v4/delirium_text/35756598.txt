35756598|t|Rates of Cognitive Decline in 100 Patients With Alzheimer Disease.
35756598|a|Background: In the state of Louisiana, the prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is projected to increase 26.4% by 2025 because of the rapidly increasing geriatric population. While significant research is available on risk factors for developing AD, less data are available regarding AD progression and the rate of change among patients with the disease. To date, no research has established the baseline cognitive decline of patients with AD residing in New Orleans, Louisiana. Methods: We evaluated 100 patients in the Ochsner Health system from September 2013 to December 2019 who had a diagnosis of AD and repeated Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores to determine annual rates of decline. Associated variables that were analyzed included race, age at diagnosis, social factors, and comorbidities. Results: The average annual rates of decline for MMSE and MoCA scores were 2.43 (SD 2.82) points and 2.39 (SD 1.88) points, respectively. Our results were significant for a faster rate of decline in MMSE scores among smokers (3.50 points, SD 3.20) vs nonsmokers (1.54 points, SD 2.07). We found no significant difference in MoCA scores for smokers vs nonsmokers, in addition to other demographic and lifestyle variables. Conclusion: The rate of decline seen in an urban population of patients with AD is lower than the average rate of decline reported in the literature, a finding that can help inform future interventional studies that use rate of decline as a primary outcome.
