39682726|a|Viral infections leading to inflammation have been implicated in several common diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of note, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has been reported to be associated with AD. We sought to identify the transcriptomic changes due to HSV-1 infection and anti-viral drug (acyclovir, ACV) treatment of HSV-1 infection in dissociated cells from human cerebral organoids (dcOrgs) versus stem cell-derived pancreatic islets (sc-islets) to gain potential biological insights into the relevance of HSV-1-induced inflammation in AD and T1D. We observed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HSV-1-infected sc-islets were enriched for genes associated with several autoimmune diseases, most significantly, T1D, but also rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis, whereas DEGs in HSV-1-infected dcOrgs were exclusively enriched for genes associated with AD. The ACV treatment of sc-islets was not as effective in rescuing transcript perturbations of autoimmune disease-associated genes. Finally, we identified gene ontology categories that were enriched for DEGs that were in common across, or unique to, viral treatment of dcOrgs and sc-islets, such as categories involved in the transferase complex, mitochondrial, and autophagy function. In addition, we compared transcriptomic signatures from HSV-1-infected sc-islets with sc-islets that were infected with the coxsackie B virus (CVB) that had been associated with T1D pathogenesis. Collectively, this study provides tissue-specific insights into the molecular effects of inflammation in AD and T1D.
