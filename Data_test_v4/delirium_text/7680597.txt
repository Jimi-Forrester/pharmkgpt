7680597|t|Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles contain 2.1 nm filaments structurally identical to the microtubule-associated protein tau: a high-resolution transmission electron microscope study of tangles and senile plaque core amyloid.
7680597|a|Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaque core amyloid (SPCA) isolated from the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease were freeze-dried and replicated with a new platinum-carbon (Pt-C) vertical deposition method for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of this vertical Pt-C replication method is superior to either of the more conventional 20 degrees rotary replication or 45 degrees unidirectional replication methods and is dependent on the Pt-C film thickness coating the specimen. The paired helical filaments (PHF) observed within the tangles were right-handed helices with a fairly regular twist period averaging 79.3 +/- 5.9 nm and a fairly regular maximum width averaging 14.9 +/- 1.0 nm. The PHF regions of minimum width were not regular and fell into three size categories: 2.4 +/- 0.3 nm, 4.9 +/- 0.6 nm and 9.6 +/- 1.4 nm. In addition to the PHF found in the tangles, a new filament was found within all the tangles. These 2.1 +/- 0.2 nm diameter filaments were triple-stranded left helices with 1.0 +/- 0.2 nm diameter strands with a structure identical to bovine tau. Like bovine tau polymer a number of filaments (130 nm to 238 nm) were longer than a fully stretched tau monomer of 96 nm. Images of neuritic senile plaque core amyloid (SPCA) showed that amyloid had a more solid appearance than the NFT and its branched filament structures were unlike the approximately 2.1 nm diameter filaments or the PHF found in NFT.
