38952772|a|Objective: Stroke is a highly prevalent and devastating condition affecting millions worldwide. The Devil's Claw (DCW) plant is a native African plant whose anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties have been investigated. We postulated that DCW could protect the brain injury caused by cerebral ischemia. Materials and Methods: The rats were randomly divided into four groups. The sham and control (Ctrl) groups received pretreatment with a distilled water vehicle. Doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg were selected for pretreatment with DCW. The filament or intravascular occlusion method was used for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining method was used to investigate the infarct zone and penumbra volume. The neuroprotective effect of DCW was measured by hematoxylin staining. Movement performance was evaluated from neurological deficit score, rotarod performance, and open field tests. Results: TTC staining showed that the DCW/400 group could maintain the penumbra's structure and reduce the infarct volume compared to the Ctrl group (p<0.001). Histological studies confirmed the neuroprotective properties of DCW at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg compared to the Ctrl group (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively). The results of behavioral tests showed an improvement in behavioral performance in pretreatment 400 mg/kg doses compare to Ctrl group (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The study showed that pretreatment with DCW with its neuron protection potential reduces the infarct area and restores motor function after MCAO.
