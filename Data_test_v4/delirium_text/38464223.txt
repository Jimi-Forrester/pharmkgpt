38464223|a|Introduction: Heparin binding proteins (HBPs) with roles in extracellular matrix assembly are strongly correlated to beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, it remains challenging to detect these proteins in plasma using standard mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches. Methods: We employed heparin affinity chromatography, followed by off-line fractionation and tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS), to capture and enrich HBPs in plasma obtained from AD (n=62) and control (n=47) samples. These profiles were then correlated to a consensus AD brain proteome, as well as with Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau (pTau) CSF biomarkers from the same individuals. We then leveraged published human postmortem brain proteome datasets to assess the overlap with the heparin-enriched plasma proteome. Results: Heparin-enrichment from plasma was highly reproducible, enriched well-known HBPs like APOE and thrombin, and depleted high-abundance proteins such as albumin. A total of 2865 proteins, spanning 10 orders of magnitude were detectable. Utilizing a consensus AD brain protein co-expression network, we observed that specific plasma HBPs exhibited consistent direction of change in both brain and plasma, whereas others displayed divergent changes highlighting the complex interplay between the two compartments. Elevated HBPs in AD plasma, when compared to controls, included members of the matrisome module in brain that accumulate within Abeta deposits, such as SMOC1, SMOC2, SPON1, MDK, OLFML3, FRZB, GPNMB, and APOE. Additionally, heparin enriched plasma proteins demonstrated significant correlations with conventional AD CSF biomarkers, including Abeta, total tau, pTau, and plasma pTau from the same individuals. Conclusion: These findings support the utility of a heparin-affinity approach for enriching amyloid-associated proteins, as well as a wide spectrum of plasma biomarkers that reflect pathological changes in the AD brain.
