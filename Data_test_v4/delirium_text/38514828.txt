38514828|a|The high risk of neurological disorders in postmenopausal women is an emerging medical issue. Based on the hypothesis of altered estrogen receptors (ERalpha and beta) after the decline of estrogen production, we investigated the changes in ERs expressions across brain regions and depressive/amnesic behaviors. C57BL/6J female mice were ovariectomized (OVX) to establish a menopausal condition. Along with behavior tests (anxiety, depression, and memory), the expression of ERs, microglial activity, and neuronal activity was measured in six brain regions (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum, raphe nucleus, amygdala, and hypothalamus) from 4 to 12 weeks after OVX. Mice exhibited anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, as well as memory impairment. These behavioral alterations have been linked to a suppression in the expression of ERbeta. The decreased ERbeta expression coincided with microglial-derived neuroinflammation, as indicated by notable activations of Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and Interleukin-1beta. Additionally, the activity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), particularly in the hippocampus, decreased in a time-dependent manner from 4 to 12 weeks post-OVX. Our study provides evidence shedding light on the susceptibility to memory impairment and depression in women after menopause. This susceptibility is associated with the suppression of ERbeta and alteration of ERalpha in six brain regions.
