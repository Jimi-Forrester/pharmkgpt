9834544|a|The number of neuropathological markers used for the diagnosis of degenerative dementias is rapidly increasing, and this is somewhat confusing: some lesions described a long time ago, such as ballooned cells, proved to be less specific than they were supposed to be; this is also the case for Lewy bodies, that have been recognised in a larger spectrum of disorders than thought a few years ago. On the contrary, for an increasing number of neuropathologists, Pick bodies are now mandatory for the diagnosis of Pick disease, and this contrasts with the prevalent opinions of the late sixties or seventies. There are a number of reasons for the changing significance of neuropathological markers. Three of them can be easily identified: 1) the burst of immunohistochemistry into neuropathology allowed an easier recognition, a better delineation and new pathophysiological approaches to old lesions, and a dramatic increase in the description of new markers, especially in glial cells; 2) in some conditions characterized by the number and distribution of some lesions rather than by their mere presence, such as aging and Alzheimer disease, a better neuroanatomical point of view permitted new insights into the concept of disease versus age-related changes; 3) more accurate clinicopathologic correlations showed clearly the need of grouping or lumping together some entities: for example, obvious relationship aroused between progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration; in contrast, distinguishing different disorders in the frontal lobe dementias grouped together into "Pick disease" was felt necessary. This review summarizes the main criteria for identification, and the presumed meaning of the chief markers indicating the presence of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins, A beta peptides, and PrP proteins. Abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins can be stored in the neurons, and participate in the constitution of many lesions (neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, abnormal processes of the crown of neuritic senile plaques, Pick bodies, granulo-vacuolar degeneration, argyrophilic grains). When seen in neuroglia, they are the chief constituents of various lesions that affect mainly astrocytes (abnormal tufts of fibres, astrocytic plaques, thorn-shaped astrocytes, spiny astrocytes) and also oligodendrocytes (oligodendroglial threads and coils, glial cytoplasmic inclusions). A beta peptides, in "preamyloid" and amyloid conformations, can be seen in the extracellular space (plaques, of the neuritic or non-neuritic varieties, diffuse, focal and granular deposits) and in the vascular walls (amyloid angiopathies). Some PrP deposits are also of the amyloid variety (kuru type, multicentric or florid plaques), but immunohistochemistry, far more sensitive than conventional studies, revealed a number of other lesions (perivacuolar, neuronal, "synaptic" deposits...). Numerous markers are easily detected by ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. Lewy bodies, Pick bodies, neurofibrillary tangles had already be identified by other methods. In contrast, some ubiquitin-positive inclusions are shown, by this technique only, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other conditions which were thus related to this disease. Finally, this review deals with two classic markers, ballooned cells ("Pick cells") and spongiosis seen in disorders due to non conventional agents or prions (spongiform encephalopathies).
