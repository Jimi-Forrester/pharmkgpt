39409126|t|Potential Mechanisms of Tunneling Nanotube Formation and Their Role in Pathology Spread in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Proteinopathies.
39409126|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia worldwide. The etiopathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. Currently, several hypotheses attempt to explain its cause, with the most well-studied being the cholinergic, beta-amyloid (Abeta), and Tau hypotheses. Lately, there has been increasing interest in the role of immunological factors and other proteins such as alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). Recent studies emphasize the role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in the spread of pathological proteins within the brains of AD patients. TNTs are small membrane protrusions composed of F-actin that connect non-adjacent cells. Conditions such as pathogen infections, oxidative stress, inflammation, and misfolded protein accumulation lead to the formation of TNTs. These structures have been shown to transport pathological proteins such as Abeta, Tau, alpha-syn, and TDP-43 between central nervous system (CNS) cells, as confirmed by in vitro studies. Besides their role in spreading pathology, TNTs may also have protective functions. Neurons burdened with alpha-syn can transfer protein aggregates to glial cells and receive healthy mitochondria, thereby reducing cellular stress associated with alpha-syn accumulation. Current AD treatments focus on alleviating symptoms, and clinical trials with Abeta-lowering drugs have proven ineffective. Therefore, intensifying research on TNTs could bring scientists closer to a better understanding of AD and the development of effective therapies.
