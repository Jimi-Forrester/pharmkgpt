32701465|t|Multimodal Education Program to Improve Nurses' Knowledge and Confidence on Delirium Recognition in a Surgical-Trauma Intermediate-Care Setting.
32701465|a|BACKGROUND: High incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients has been reported in the United States and is significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The lack of knowledge and confidence in performing delirium assessment (KCDA) has led to significant underrecognition of delirium by nurses regardless of evidence-based education intervention. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a multimodal educational program (MEP) to enhance nurses' KCDA. METHODS: A MEP including an online didactic with a video-simulation and 1:1 bedside coaching with delirium screening (DS) was conducted in the surgical intermediate-care unit of an academic medical center. A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was used. RESULTS: Of 23 nurses, the majority were <41 years old (73.9%) and had at least a bachelor of science in nursing degree (78.3%) with <6 years of experience (60.9%). The overall KCDA scores and the performance of DS improved significantly after the MEP (p < .001). A positive correlation was noted between the changes of the KCDA scores (p = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The MEP demonstrated improvement in nurses' KCDA. The MEP should focus on an individualized learning approach with a targeted patient population, using current delirium screening tools. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Educational programs are recommended in either an orientation or continuing education program on nursing units. This is also recommended for use in other academic centers that encompass similar clinical settings and could possibly be considered for use in other disease processes.
