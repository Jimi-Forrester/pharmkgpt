31458503|a|Following on our 60-year research on the chemical constituents of the rain forest trees Galbulimima belgraveana and Galbulimima baccata, we report the isolation of seven new alkaloids: GB14 (14), GB22 (15), GB25 (16), GB21 (17), GB23 (18), GB24 (19), and GB26 (20). Their structures were elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic analyses and single-crystal X-ray crystallography, as well as structure degradation and interconversion. The newly isolated alkaloids are precursors or derivatives of the known family members from our early studies and could be intermediates in the biosynthesis of the Galbulimima alkaloids. Therefore, the present study has expanded the range of structures in this family of alkaloids and provided some missing links in the biosynthetic sequences.
