38296333|t|Resistance training does not increase myocellular garbage dumps: A pilot study on lipofuscin in skeletal muscle fibers of resistance trained young men.
38296333|a|Lipofuscin (LF) is an intracellular aggregate associated with proteostatic impairments, especially prevalent in nondividing skeletal muscle fibers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) drive LF-formation. Resistance training (RT) improves muscle performance but also increases ROS production, potentially promoting LF-formation. Thus, we aimed to investigate if RT of a mesocycle duration increases LF-formation in type-I and II muscle fibers and whether RT increases the antioxidant capacity (AOC) in terms of SOD1 and SOD2 content. An intervention group (IG) performed 14 eccentrically accented RT-sessions within 7 weeks. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected before and after the intervention from IG as well as from a control group (CG) which refrained from RT for the same duration. LF was predominantly found near nuclei, followed by membrane-near and a minor amount in the fiber core, with corresponding spot sizes. Overall, LF-content was higher in type-I than type-II fibers (p < 0.05). There was no increase in LF-content in type-I or IIA fibers, neither for the IG following RT nor for the CG. The same is valid for SOD1/2. We conclude that, in healthy subjects, RT can be safely performed, without adverse effects on increased LF-formation.
