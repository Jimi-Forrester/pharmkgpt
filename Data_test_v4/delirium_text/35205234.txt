35205234|t|Identification and Functional Analysis of the Regulatory Elements in the pHSPA6 Promoter.
35205234|a|Functional and expressional research of heat shock protein A6 (HSPA6) suggests that the gene is of great value for neurodegenerative diseases, biosensors, cancer, etc. Based on the important value of pigs in agriculture and biomedicine and to advance knowledge of this little-studied HSPA member, the stress-sensitive sites in porcine HSPA6 (pHSPA6) were investigated following different stresses. Here, two heat shock elements (HSEs) and a conserved region (CR) were identified in the pHSPA6 promoter by a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing strategy. Gene expression data showed that sequence disruption of these regions could significantly reduce the expression of pHSPA6 under heat stress. Stimulation studies indicated that these regions responded not only to heat stress but also to copper sulfate, MG132, and curcumin. Further mechanism studies showed that downregulated pHSPA6 could significantly affect some important members of the HSP family that are involved in HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90. Overall, our results provide a new approach for investigating gene expression and regulation that may contribute to gene regulatory mechanisms, drug target selection, and breeding stock selection.
