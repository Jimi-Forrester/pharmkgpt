36168240|t|Microneedle Transdermal Drug Delivery Systems for Allergen-Specific Immunotherapy, Skin Disease Treatment, and Vaccine Development.
36168240|a|Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDSs) overcome the hurdle of an intact skin barrier by penetrating the skin to allow molecules through. These systems reduce side effects associated with conventional hypodermic needles. Here, we introduce novel microneedle (MN) TDDSs that enhance drug delivery by creating micron-sized pores across the skin. Many MN TDDSs designed to deliver a diverse array of therapeutics, including allergen-specific immunotherapy, skin disease treatments, and vaccines, are under pre-clinical and clinical trials. Although epicutaneous approaches are emerging as new options for treating food allergy in many clinical trials, MN TDDSs could provide a more efficient and convenient route to deliver macromolecules. Furthermore, MN TDDSs may allow for safe vaccine delivery without permanent scars. MN TDDSs are a major emerging strategy for delivering novel vaccines and treatments for diseases, including skin diseases, allergic diseases, and so on.
