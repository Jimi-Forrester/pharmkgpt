33486370|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) potentiator phytochemicals are highly targeted as anti-Alzheimer s disease and as an anti-ageing process. A phytochemical study of Thunbergia erecta aerial parts resulted in the isolation of ten compounds (1-10). Their structures were identified based on spectral data and comparison with literature values. The activity of our pure isolates on AChE and TERT enzymes by documented in vitro assay methods were evaluated. The results indicated that apigenin (2), vanillic acid (4), and acacetin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (7) exhibited potent inhibition of AChE (IC50 37.33, 30.80 and 49.57 ng/mL, respectively), compared to the standard drug donepezil (IC50 31.25 ng/mL). In the TERT enzyme assay, compound 7 triggered a 1.66-fold increase in telomerase activity at the concentration of 2.85 ng/ml. This is the first study that demonstrates that compound 7 isolated from T. erecta can lead to such telomerase activity relative to control cells. Virtual screening studies including docking, rapid overlay chemical structure (ROCS), and calculated structure-property relationships (SPR) were implemented in this work. Molecular docking studies supported the binding of compounds 2, 4, and 7 through hydrogen bonds (HBs) formation to essential amino acid residues namely ARG:24 A, SER:347 A, LYS:51 A, PHE:346 A, and GLY:345 A of acetylcholinesterase. ROCS and SPR analyses realized compound 2 as a possible treatment of Alzheimer's disease and as a lead compound for drug development process through applying semisynthetic modifications.
