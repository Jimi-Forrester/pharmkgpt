33621708|a|INTRODUCTION: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is strongly associated with physiological and metabolic disturbances, and hyperuricemia has been proposed to predict the onset of ED. AIM: To investigate if hyperuricemia is an independent predictor for ED when all relevant confounding factors are taken into account. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of men aged between 45 and 70 years. The population was well characterized for established cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome, as well as kidney function, depression, and socioeconomic factors. Analysis was limited to 254 men with complete data and also serum uric acid (SUA) measurements were available. This included 150 men with and 104 without ED. The presence and severity of ED was evaluated using International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire. Risk of ED by SUA level was calculated using univariate and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. Effect modification by participant characteristics were evaluated in subgroup analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures of this study are prevalence and severity of erectile dysfunction. RESULTS: Patients with ED (59% of the study population) were older than men without ED (59 vs 54 years) and had lower serum testosterone (14.3, 95% CI 11.3-17.3 vs 15.1 nmol/l, 95% CI 12.1-18.8, respectively). Regarding all other variables, the groups were comparable. No significant difference was found for SUA by ED. SUA was not associated with ED risk in univariate or multivariable analysis (multivariable-adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.59-2.19, P = .7) for SUA level higher than median compared with median or lesser (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.997-1.006, P = .7 for continuous variable). No subgroup analysis modified the association. After multivariable adjustment age, education level and depression were statistically significant predictors of ED. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SUA was not found to be an independent risk factor for ED. Metabolic syndrome, glomerular filtration rate, or cardiovascular risk factors did not modify this result. ED cannot be predicted based on the level of SUA. A Tuokko, T Murtola, P Korhonen, et al. Hyperuricemia Is Not an Independent Predictor of Erectile Dysfunction. Sex Med 2021;9:100319.
