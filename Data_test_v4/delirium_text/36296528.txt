36296528|t|Synthesis, Conformational Analysis and Evaluation of the 2-aryl-4-(4-bromo-2-hydroxyphenyl)benzo[1,5]thiazepines as Potential alpha-Glucosidase and/or alpha-Amylase Inhibitors.
36296528|a|The ambident electrophilic character of the 5-bromo-2-hydroxychalcones and the binucleophilic nature of 2-aminothiophenol were exploited to construct the 2-aryl-4-(4-bromo-2-hydroxyphenyl)benzo[1,5]thiazepines. The structures and conformation of these 2-aryl-4-(4-bromo-2-hydroxyphenyl)benzo[1,5]thiazepines were established with the use of spectroscopic techniques complemented with a single crystal X-ray diffraction method. Both 1H-NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques confirmed participation of the hydroxyl group in the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction with a nitrogen atom. SC-XRD confirmed the presence of a six-membered intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded pseudo-aromatic ring, which was corroborated by the DFT method on 2b as a representative example in the gas phase. Compounds 2a (Ar = -C6H5), 2c (Ar = -C6H4(4-Cl)) and 2f (Ar = -C6H4(4-CH(CH3)2) exhibited increased inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase compared to acarbose (IC50 = 7.56 +- 0.42 microM), with IC50 values of 6.70 +- 0.15 microM, 2.69 +- 0.27 microM and 6.54 +- 0.11 microM, respectively. Compound 2f, which exhibited increased activity against alpha-glucosidase, also exhibited a significant inhibitory effect against alpha-amylase (IC50 = 9.71 +- 0.50 microM). The results of some computational approaches on aspects such as noncovalent interactions, calculated binding energies for alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and bioavailability properties, gastrointestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeability are also presented.
