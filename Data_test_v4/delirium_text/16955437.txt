16955437|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with an acute onset and fluctuating course. Several studies have suggested the presence of disturbed cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in delirium as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal concentrations of amino acids and of neurotransmitter metabolites have been found in plasma, platelets and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and in plasma and CSF of patients with a delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels in plasma of AD patients with a concurrent delirium. METHODS: In a case-control study of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with concurrent delirium, we investigated the contribution of delirium to some biochemical parameters in blood. We compared plasma amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels of 17 delirious AD patients with those of 17 age- and gender-matched non-delirious AD patients and 29 age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: Homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were higher in delirious AD patients than in controls, but only HVA concentrations were higher in delirious AD patients than in non-delirious AD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that central dopaminergic and serotonergic turnover are increased in AD patients with delirium and that the high dopaminergic turnover might reflect the consequences of delirium.
