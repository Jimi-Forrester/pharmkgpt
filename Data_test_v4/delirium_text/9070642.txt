9070642|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) is a plasma acute-phase protein, normally not found in the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of CRP in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, the presence of CRP-like immunoreactivity in AD neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) was demonstrated following pre-treatment of tissue sections with formic acid. CRP-like immunoreactivity was observed in both extracellular and intracellular NFT and was co-localized with the NFT marker PHF-1 and the amyloid P component (AP). The CRP-like immunoreactive NFT were less numerous and more limited in their distribution than PHF-1 or AP-immunoreactive NFT. The present results further support an involvement of inflammatory processes in the etiology of AD.
