38787633|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigated the degree of cognitive insight in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) regarding their hallucinations, aiming to elucidate the subjective experiences and perceptions associated with this phenomenon. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, we invited both AD patients (n = 31) and their informants to evaluate the occurrence of hallucinations. Degree of cognitive insight was based upon the discrepancy between the patients' and informants' evaluations. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated that AD patients rated the occurrence of hallucinations lower than their informants, indicating that patients tended to underestimate the frequency of their hallucinations. The discrepancy between the ratings of patients and informants was negatively correlated with cognitive functioning, suggesting that a greater discrepancy (indicating poorer insight) was associated with lower cognitive functioning in patients. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the deficits in insight into hallucinations among AD patients, specifically indicating that AD patients have limited awareness of their own hallucinations. Furthermore, our findings support the idea that deficits in insight into hallucinations are associated with the progression of AD.
