36824930|t|C9orf72 poly(PR) mediated neurodegeneration is associated with nucleolar stress.
36824930|a|The ALS/FTD-linked intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is translated into dipeptide repeat proteins, among which poly-proline-arginine (PR) displays the most aggressive neurotoxicity in-vitro and in-vivo . PR partitions to the nucleus when expressed in neurons and other cell types. Using drosophila and primary rat cortical neurons as model systems, we show that by lessening the nuclear accumulation of PR, we can drastically reduce its neurotoxicity. PR accumulates in the nucleolus, a site of ribosome biogenesis that regulates the cell stress response. We examined the effect of nucleolar PR accumulation and its impact on nucleolar function and determined that PR caused nucleolar stress and increased levels of the transcription factor p53. Downregulating p53 levels, either genetically or by increasing its degradation, also prevented PR-mediated neurotoxic phenotypes both in in-vitro and in-vivo models. We also investigated whether PR could cause the senescence phenotype in neurons but observed none. Instead, we found induction of apoptosis via caspase-3 activation. In summary, we uncovered the central role of nucleolar dysfunction upon PR expression in the context of C9-ALS/FTD.
