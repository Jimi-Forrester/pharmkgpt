39129396|a|INTRODUCTION: Information on the psychosocial impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker testing in adults at risk of AD is needed to inform best practices for communicating biomarker results. METHODS: Ninety-nine cognitively unimpaired older adults learned amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) results (mean age = 72.0 +- 4.8, 95% White, 28% elevated amyloid). Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to test the main effects and interaction of PET result x time on psychosocial outcomes up to 6 months after learning results. RESULTS: A significant interaction of PET result x time was observed for concern about AD (beta = 0.28, p = 0.02) and intrusive thoughts and avoidance (beta = -0.82, p < 0.001). A main effect of PET result was observed for AD test-related distress (beta = 12.09, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Cognitively unimpaired adults learning elevated-amyloid PET results reported mildly intrusive thoughts/avoidance initially following disclosure, but these symptoms decreased over time. Concern about AD dementia and AD biomarker test-related distress remained higher in elevated-amyloid compared to non-elevated-amyloid participants. HIGHLIGHTS: Longitudinal assessment of psychosocial reactions after amyloid PET disclosure was conducted. Transient highly intrusive thoughts or avoidance after learning elevated amyloid results. Persistent test result-related distress after receiving elevated-amyloid results. There is increased concern about AD dementia after receiving elevated-amyloid results. Happiness and relief are experienced after receiving non-elevated-amyloid results.
