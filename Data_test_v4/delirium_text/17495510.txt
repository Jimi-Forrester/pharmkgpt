17495510|t|Memory and the creation of art: the syndrome, as in de Kooning, of 'creating in the midst of dementia'.
17495510|a|The creation of abstract art demands high intellectual capacities. Willem de Kooning, nonetheless, accomplished his last paintings while crippled by impairments diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. Until my research neither art nor science offered an explanation, or a thinking method, for identifying this phenomenon, for solving a mystery that pertains to human discovery and creation. In this 'ArtScience' study of the de Kooning phenomenon I use 'Thinking Methods' which I devised by a systematic application of information on the workings of the brain, the 'Brain Methods'. With my 'Method of Observation' I examined de Kooning's paintings, created both before and during dementia, and found them comparable in technique and expression. This demonstrates the authenticity of art created in dementia. With my 'Cognitive Analysis' I identified in de Kooning the syndrome herein called 'Creating in the Midst of Dementia'. This Syndrome, unique in mechanisms and presentation, is characterized by (1) a specific combination of brain functions and malfunctions, in this case, preservation of three memory systems - working, procedural, and episodic - and deficit of the semantic memory system, and by (2) a response to precise stimuli, one that triggers brain reactivation, and as a consequence enables creating in the midst of dementia. My work offers: (1) The identification of the 'Syndrome of Creating in the Midst of Dementia'. It (a) presents its definition, the criteria of diagnosis, mechanism, rationale, and possibility of 'cognitive repair' and (b) solves the mystery of de Kooning creating art while crippled by dementia. (2) New Thinking Methods, the 'Brain Methods', that based on information on the workings of the brain, open a new path in the pursuit of truth. The 'Method of Observation' serves to define stimuli, and the 'Cognitive Analysis' to assess cognitive faculties. (3) The integration of art and science into a new discipline of study, 'ArtScience'.
