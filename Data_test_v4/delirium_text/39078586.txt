39078586|t|Reorganization of brain connectivity across the spectrum of clinical cognitive decline.
39078586|a|Clinical cognitive decline, leading to Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (ADD), has long been interpreted as a disconnection syndrome, hindering the information flow capacity of the brain, hence leading to the well-known symptoms of ADD. The structural and functional brain connectome analyses play a central role in studies of brain from this perspective. However, most current research implicitly assumes that the changes accompanying the progression of cognitive decline are monotonous in time, whether measured across the entire brain or in fixed cortical regions. We investigate the structural and functional connectivity-wise reorganization of the brain without such assumptions across the entire spectrum. We utilize nodal assortativity as a local topological measure of connectivity and follow a data-centric approach to identify and verify relevant local regions, as well as to understand the nature of underlying reorganization. The analysis of our preliminary experimental data points to statistically significant, hyper and hypo-assortativity regions that depend on the disease's stage, and differ for structural and functional connectomes. Our results suggest a new perspective into the dynamic, potentially a mix of degenerative and compensatory, topological alterations that occur in the brain as cognitive decline progresses.
