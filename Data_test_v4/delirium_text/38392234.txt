38392234|t|Oral Health and Older Adults: A Narrative Review.
38392234|a|Oral health's association with general health, morbidity, and mortality in older adults highlights its importance for healthy aging. Poor oral health is not an inevitable consequence of aging, and a proactive, multidisciplinary approach to early recognition and treatment of common pathologies increases the likelihood of maintaining good oral health. Some individuals may not have regular access to a dentist, and opportunities to improve oral health may be lost if health professionals fail to appreciate the importance of oral health on overall well-being and quality of life. The authors of this narrative review examined government websites, the American Dental Association Aging and Dental Health website, and the Healthy People 2030 oral objectives and identified xerostomia, edentulism, caries, periodontitis, and oral cancer as five key topics for the non-dental provider. These conditions are associated with nutritional deficiencies, poorer quality of life, increased risk of disease development and poorer outcomes for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other systemic conditions prevalent among older adults. It is important to note that there is a bi-directional dimension to oral health and chronic diseases, underscoring the value of a multidisciplinary approach to maintaining oral health in older adults.
