38407670|t|Theranostics: a multifaceted approach utilizing nano-biomaterials.
38407670|a|Biomaterials play a vital role in targeting therapeutics. Over the years, several biomaterials have gained wide attention in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases. Scientists are trying to make more personalized treatments for different diseases, as well as discovering novel single agents that can be used for prognosis, medication administration, and keeping track of how a treatment works. Theranostics based on nano-biomaterials have higher sensitivity and specificity for disease management than conventional techniques. This review provides a concise overview of various biomaterials, including carbon-based materials like fullerenes, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon nanofibers, and their involvement in theranostics of different diseases. In addition, the involvement of imaging techniques for theranostics applications was overviewed. Theranostics is an emerging strategy that has great potential for enhancing the accuracy and efficacy of medicinal interventions. Despite the presence of obstacles such as disease heterogeneity, toxicity, reproducibility, uniformity, upscaling production, and regulatory hurdles, the field of medical research and development has great promise due to its ability to provide patients with personalised care, facilitate early identification, and enable focused treatment.
