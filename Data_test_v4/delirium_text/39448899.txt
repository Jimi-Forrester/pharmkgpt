39448899|t|snRNA-seq of adipose tissues reveals the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of cold and disease resistance in Mongolian cattle.
39448899|a|BACKGROUND: Mongolian cattle are local breeds in northern China with excellent adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Adipose tissues play essential roles in tolerance to cold and disease, but the associated cellular and molecular mechanisms are unclear. METHODS: Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on the adipose tissues from the subcutaneous (SAT), greater omentum (OAT) and perirenal (PAT) of 3 healthy cattle. The adipogenic trajectory was analyzed, and the functional roles of gene of interest were verified in vitro. RESULTS: There were different cell subpopulations in adipose tissues. The lipid-deposition adipocytes identified by the PTGER3 marker exhibited outstanding characteristics in SAT. In PAT and OAT, aldosterone was expressed to provide clues for the differential brown adipocytes. Among the DEGs by comparing OAT with SAT and PAT with OAT, C3 was significantly expressed in most of the cell populations in SAT. G0S2, LIPE, LPIN1, PTGER3 and RGCC took part in the adipogenic trajectory from preadipocyte commitment to mature adipocytes. S100A4 expression affected Ca2+ signaling and the expression of UCP1 ~ 3, FABP4 and PTGER3. CONCLUSION: The cell heterogeneity and genes expressed in adipose tissues of Mongolian cattle not only determine the endocrine and energy storage, but contribute to adapt to cold and disease resistance.
