37362416|a|Anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) antibodies in the clinical laboratory are intimately linked to the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the characteristics of the analytical methods and the properties of the antibodies themselves are heterogeneous. To review the definition and properties of anti-double-stranded anti-DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, the adequacy of analytical methods, and the clinical requirements for this biomarker. Through PubMed we searched the existing literature with the terms anti-dsDNA, editorial, review, guideline, meta-analysis and SLE. The last search, anti-dsDNA and SLE restricted to the last two years. Information was expanded through related articles and those published in official state bodies related to anti-dsDNA and SLE. Clinical laboratory methods for anti-dsDNA analysis and their characteristics are analyze. The clinical utility of anti-dsDNA in its diagnostic, clinical association and follow-up aspects of SLE is reviewed. There is wide variability in analytical methods and deficits in standardization persist. They are part of the current SLE classification criteria and are used as markers in the follow-up of the disease. Their diagnostic usefulness improves when they are determined in antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive patients. In follow-up, quantification is of interest, preferably with the same analytical method (given the deficits in standardization).
