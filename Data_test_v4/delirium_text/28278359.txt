28278359|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an educational programme on registered nurses' knowledge and attitude in delirium care for hospitalised older adults with and without dementia, and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the programme from the participants' perspectives. BACKGROUND: Providing care for patients with delirium or delirium superimposed on dementia often poses particular challenges such as distinguishing between delirium and dementia for nurses. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative study was used. METHODS: A delirium educational programme based on adult learning principles was provided to the participants. A purposive sample of 12 registered nurses who participated in the educational programme undertook individual interviews. Content analysis was conducted to identify unique and common themes indicative of registered nurse perceptions. RESULTS: Registered nurses reported improved knowledge and attitude towards the delirium care of hospitalised older adults with dementia and at risk of delirium. Active learning in the programme facilitated the participants' learning processes. This active learning included deep learning, collaborative learning and application of new concepts to practice. Most participants felt that they had inadequate management support to apply their new knowledge in practice, and this included staff resource and policies and protocols. CONCLUSION: The qualitative findings indicated that the delirium education had benefited the participants by improving their knowledge and attitude towards the delirium care of hospitalised older adults with dementia and at risk of delirium. This study provided an understanding of the strengths and limitations of the educational programme delivered to registered nurses in South Korea. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Registered nurses in South Korea should need not only appropriate education, but also adequate resources, policies and guidelines as well as support from managers and from all other healthcare professionals.
