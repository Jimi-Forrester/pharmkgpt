39043762|a|Population aging around the world is rapidly progressing; as a result, cognitive decline developing into dementia is becoming a social problem. There is no drug that can cure dementia, and though drugs that alleviate the symptoms of dementia have been developed, they also have side effects. Therefore, we conducted a study on improving cognitive function using natural products that have secured safety. We confirmed the effect of an extract of Scrophularia buergeriana on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment through mouse behavioral experiments, and we observed metabolic changes in the cortex and hippocampus via brain tissue dissection after the behavioral experiment. Mitigating effects of S. buergeriana on cognitive impairment caused by scopolamine were observed in passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests. A metabolic analysis revealed biomarkers related to the alleviating effect of cognitive impairment. Niacinamide, tyrosine, uridine, and valine in the cortex and GABA, choline, creatine, formate, fumarate, hypoxanthine, leucine, myo-inositol, pyroglutamate, and taurine in the hippocampus were identified as biomarker candidates for recovering cognitive impairment. In addition to behavioral experiments, this metabolomics study using specific regions of the brain may be helpful in understanding the effects of cognitive improvement.
