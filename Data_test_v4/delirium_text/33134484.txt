33134484|a|Our aim was to determine whether hyponatremia is associated with waiting list or posttransplantation mortality in children having liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the united network for organ sharing/organ procurement transplantation network database on pediatric LT performed between 1988 and 2016 was conducted. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium of 130 mEq/L or below. Subjects were divided into 2 age groups: I (0-6 y old) and II (7-18 y old). Patient survival before and after LT, as well as graft survival, were compared in patients with and without hyponatremia. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for perioperative mortality. RESULTS: Data from 6606 children were available for analysis of waiting list mortality, and 4478 for postoperative mortality. The prevalence of hyponatremia at the time of registration was 2.8% and 3.7% at the time of LT. Waiting list mortality in patients with hyponatremia was significantly higher in group I (P < 0.001) but not in group II (P = 0.09). In group I, the relative risk of mortality adjusted to pediatric end-stage liver disease score was significantly associated with hyponatremia (P < 0.001). A sodium level below 130 mEq/L (hazard ration [HR] = 1.7), younger age (group I) (HR = 2.01), and need for dialysis (HR = 2.3) were independent predictors for increased waiting list mortality. There was no difference in overall postoperative patient or graft survival related to hyponatremia. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia is associated with increased waiting list mortality for pediatric LT candidates, particularly in younger children. Future studies examining incorporation of age-specific serum sodium levels into organ allocation policies in children seems warranted based on our findings.
