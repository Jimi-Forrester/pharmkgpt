32906123|a|The Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC) conducts 5 harmonized prospective clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging - with 1 study, the Latino Core, focused exclusively on Latinxs, 2 studies consisting of mostly non-Latinx whites, and 2 studies of mostly non-Latinx blacks. This paper contextualizes the Latino Core within the other 4 harmonized RADC cohort studies. The overall aim of the paper is to provide information from the RADC, so that researchers can learn from our participants and procedures to better advance the science of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in Latinxs. We describe an annual clinical evaluation that assesses risk factors for Alzheimer's dementia among older adults without known dementia at enrollment. As all RADC cohort studies offer brain donation as a part of research participation, we discuss our approach to brain donation and subsequent participant decision-making among older Latinxs. We also summarize baseline characteristics of older Latinxs across the 5 RADC cohort studies in relation to the baseline characteristics of non-Latinx blacks and non-Latinx whites. Finally, we outline challenges and considerations as well as potential next steps in cognitive aging research with older Latinxs.
