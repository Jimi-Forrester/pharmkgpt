31473905|t|GLUT12 Expression in Brain of Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease.
31473905|a|The brain depends on glucose as a source of energy. This implies the presence of glucose transporters, being GLUT1 and GLUT3 the most relevant. Expression of GLUT12 is found in mouse and human brain at low levels. We previously demonstrated GLUT12 upregulation in the frontal cortex of aged subjects that was even higher in aged Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the cause and the mechanism through which this increase occurs are still unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the upregulation of GLUT12 in AD is related with aging or Abeta deposition in comparison with GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. In the frontal cortex of two amyloidogenic mouse models (Tg2576 and APP/PS1) GLUT12 levels were increased. Contrary, expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 were decreased, while GLUT4 did not change. In aged mice and the senescence-accelerated model SAMP8, GLUT12 and GLUT4 were upregulated in comparison with young animals. GLUT1 and GLUT3 did not show significant changes with age. The effect of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition was also evaluated in Abeta peptide i.c.v. injected mice. In the hippocampus, GLUT12 expression increased whereas GLUT4 was not modified. Consistent with the results in the amyloidogenic models, GLUT3 and GLUT1 were downregulated. In summary, Abeta increases GLUT12 protein expression in the brain pointing out a central role of the transporter in AD pathology and opening new perspectives for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.
