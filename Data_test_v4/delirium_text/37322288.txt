37322288|t|ABCA7-Associated Clinical Features and Molecular Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease.
37322288|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Genetic factors are thought to account for a large proportion of the overall AD phenotypes. ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is one of the most important risk gene for AD. Multiple forms of ABCA7 variants significantly increase the risk of AD, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, premature termination codon variants, missense variants, variable number tandem repeat, mutations, and alternative splicing. AD patients with ABCA7 variants usually exhibit typical clinical and pathological features of traditional AD with a wide age of onset range. ABCA7 variants can alter ABCA7 protein expression levels and protein structure to affect protein functions such as abnormal lipid metabolism, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and immune cell function. Specifically, ABCA7 deficiency can cause neuronal apoptosis by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress through the PERK/eIF2alpha pathway. Second, ABCA7 deficiency can increase Abeta production by upregulating the SREBP2/BACE1 pathway and promoting APP endocytosis. In addition, the ability of microglia to phagocytose and degrade Abeta is destroyed by ABCA7 deficiency, leading to reduced clearance of Abeta. Finally, disturbance of lipid metabolism may also be an important method by which ABCA7 variants influence the incidence rate of AD. In the future, more attention should be given to different ABCA7 variants and ABCA7 targeted therapies for AD.
