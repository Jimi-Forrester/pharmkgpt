35351743|t|Continuous pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block through an elastomeric infusion system, associated with the lateral cutaneous nerve block of the thigh for total hip arthroplasty.
35351743|a|Orthopaedic surgeries can lead to pain that is difficult to treat, sometimes requiring prolonged hospitalisation. Peripheral nerve blocks stand out as an efficient strategy within the context of multimodal analgesia. The hypothesis is that continuous pericapsular nerve group block, when combined with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block, can provide excellent analgesic coverage for hip surgeries. Continuous infusion systems can prolong analgesia, minimising opioid consumption, adverse effects and providing faster recovery. We describe a case of efficient analgesia, in which a catheter was positioned between the iliopsoas muscle plane and the iliopubic eminence for total hip arthroplasty.
