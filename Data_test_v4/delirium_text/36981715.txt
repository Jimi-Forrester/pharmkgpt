36981715|t|Factors Associated with the Quality-of-Life of Young Unpaid Carers: A Systematic Review of the Evidence from 2003 to 2019.
36981715|a|The aim of this review was to identify factors influencing the quality of life (QoL) of young people providing care for family members with chronic illnesses, disabilities, and/or mental health and substance abuse problems (young unpaid carers; YC), as well as the social-care related QoL measures. Focused and broad search strategies were performed in four databases, identifying 3145 articles. Following screening, lateral searches, and quality appraisal, 54 studies were included for synthesis. An inductive approach was used to synthesise the findings, grouping factors associated with YC QoL into interrelated themes: "perceived normality of role and identifying as a carer", "social support from formal and unpaid networks", "caring demands and their impact", and "coping strategies". No social-care related QoL measures for YC were found. This systematic review provides groundwork for the development of such a tool and emphasises the need for further studies allowing the investigation of the interrelated factors affecting YC QoL.
