2199020|t|Surgical management of the hip in the elderly patient.
2199020|a|Hip surgery is the most common major orthopedic procedure performed in the elderly. The indications are fracture and pain secondary to degenerative arthritis. Patients undergoing hip replacement for arthritis have excellent outcomes with decreased pain, increased mobility, and a low mortality. Age should not be a contraindication to hip replacement, with patient selection being made on the basis of symptomatology and overall health. In hip fracture, the prognosis is more guarded. Poor functional outcome results from complications of the fracture, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head and fracture nonunion in femoral neck fractures and instability with delayed weight bearing in intertrochanteric fractures. In addition, patients sustaining hip fracture are more likely to have significant comorbidity and subsequent perioperative complications. Pressure ulcers, delirium, deep venous thrombosis, urinary retention and urinary tract infection, and cardiac events are the most frequent complications seen. These complications can be anticipated and prevented with careful preoperative assessment and post-operative prophylactic management. A team approach including the orthopedic surgeon, primary care physician, nursing staff, and physical therapists is essential for optimal outcome.
