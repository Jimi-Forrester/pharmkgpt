38443446|a|Research on the treatment outcomes and mortality of patients with cancer and hip fractures remains limited. We aimed to assess the treatment outcomes and mortality in older patients with cancer and hip fractures. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 1264 patients aged >= 60 years treated for hip fractures between January 2005 and April 2022. The operation time, blood transfusion-related indicators, postoperative complications, reoperation rate, length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit, mortality rate, and clinical scores were compared. We also performed survival analysis. Subsequently, 1:1 propensity-score matching was performed. In the unmatched cohort, we compared 273 patients with cancer and 991 controls. The cancer group exhibited a higher incidence of pneumonia (P = 0.025) and higher in-hospital and 1-year follow-up mortality rates (P = 0.044 and P < 0.001, respectively). In the matched cohort, the 1-year mortality rate remained higher in the cancer group (P < 0.001). The control group showed a higher survival rate in both unmatched and matched cohorts (P < 0.001 for both). The surgical outcomes for hip fractures were comparable between patients with and without cancer. We recommend surgical treatment for hip fractures in patients with cancer.
