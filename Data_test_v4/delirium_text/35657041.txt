35657041|t|A Comprehensive Review on Therapeutic Potential of Chrysin in Brain Related Disorders.
35657041|a|Brain disorders are currently one of the world's most serious and difficult health issues. These brain disorders are accountable for a massive number of morbidities and mortalities around the world. The current treatments of these disorders are frequently accompanied by severe side effects and cause a detrimental effect on health. Recently, plant flavonoids have sparked a surge in public and scientific attention in recent years because of their alleged health promoting impact and almost no adverse repercussions. Also, scientific research has shown that phytochemicals possess numerous neuroprotective properties under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Chrysin is a therapeutic phytochemical that falls under the class of flavonoids based on its structure. The biological activities and pharmacological effects of chrysin include anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities as well as amyloidogenic and neurotrophic effects. These therapeutic abilities of chrysin are attributed to its structural diverseness arising in ring-A and lack of oxygenation in B and C ring. Several studies have highlighted the rising significance of chrysin in a variety of brain illnesses, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety, brain tumours, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and ischemic stroke. This study depicts the relationship of chrysin with different brain related disorders and discusses the mechanisms responsible for the potential role of chrysin as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of different brain disorders, based on the results of several preclinical studies and taking into account the therapeutic effects of the compound.
