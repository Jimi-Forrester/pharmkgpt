34396103|a|Metabolomics in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort provides a powerful tool for mapping biochemical changes in Alzheimer's disease, and a unique opportunity to learn about the association between circulating blood metabolites and brain amyloid-beta deposition in Alzheimer's disease. We examined 140 serum metabolites and their associations with brain amyloid-beta deposition, cognition and conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Processed [18F] Florbetapir PET images were used to perform a voxel-wise statistical analysis of the effect of metabolite levels on amyloid-beta accumulation across the whole brain. We performed a multivariable regression analysis using age, sex, body mass index, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status and study phase as covariates. We identified nine metabolites as significantly associated with amyloid-beta deposition after multiple comparison correction. Higher levels of one acylcarnitine (C3; propionylcarnitine) and one biogenic amine (kynurenine) were associated with decreased amyloid-beta accumulation and higher memory scores. However, higher levels of seven phosphatidylcholines (lysoPC a C18:2, PC aa C42:0, PC ae C42:3, PC ae C44:3, PC ae C44:4, PC ae C44:5 and PC ae C44:6) were associated with increased brain amyloid-beta deposition. In addition, higher levels of PC ae C44:4 were significantly associated with lower memory and executive function scores and conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease dementia. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of peripheral phosphatidylcholine metabolism is associated with earlier pathological changes noted in Alzheimer's disease as measured by brain amyloid-beta deposition as well as later clinical features including changes in memory and executive functioning. Perturbations in phosphatidylcholine metabolism may point to issues with membrane restructuring leading to the accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain. Additional studies are needed to explore whether these metabolites play a causal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease or if they are biomarkers for systemic changes during preclinical phases of the disease.
