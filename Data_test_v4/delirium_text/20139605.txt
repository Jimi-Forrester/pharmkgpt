20139605|a|To determine the effects of kaempferol, rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) and Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were utilized as neuronal models. Using in vitro assays, kaempferol was shown to have protective effects against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Administration of kaempferol also significantly reversed amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-induced impaired performance in a Y-maze test. Taken altogether, the results reported here suggest that further investigation is warranted of the influence of kaempferol on pathways related to Alzheimer's disease.
