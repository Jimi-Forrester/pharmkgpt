35784899|t|The Footprint of Kynurenine Pathway in Cardiovascular Diseases.
35784899|a|Kynurenine pathway is the main route of tryptophan metabolism and produces several metabolites with various biologic properties. It has been uncovered that several cardiovascular diseases are associated with the overactivation of kynurenine pathway and kynurenine and its metabolites have diagnostic and prognostic value in cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, it was found that several kynurenine metabolites can differently affect cardiovascular health. For instance, preclinical studies have shown that kynurenine, xanthurenic acid and cis-WOOH decrease blood pressure; kynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid prevent atherosclerosis; kynurenic acid supplementation and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) inhibition improve the outcome of stroke. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) overactivity and increased kynurenine levels improve cardiac and vascular transplantation outcomes, whereas exacerbating the outcome of myocardial ischemia, post-ischemic myocardial remodeling, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. IDO inhibition and KMO inhibition are also protective against viral myocarditis. In addition, dysregulation of kynurenine pathway is observed in several conditions such as senescence, depression, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cirrhosis, and cancer closely connected to cardiovascular dysfunction. It is worth defining the exact effect of each metabolite of kynurenine pathway on cardiovascular health. This narrative review is the first review that separately discusses the involvement of kynurenine pathway in different cardiovascular diseases and dissects the underlying molecular mechanisms.
