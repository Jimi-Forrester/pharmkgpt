33230288|a|Brain embryonic periventricular endothelial cells (PVEC) crosstalk with neural progenitor cells (NPC) promoting mutual proliferation, formation of tubular-like structures in the former and maintenance of stemness in the latter. To better characterize this interaction, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse PVEC vs. adult brain endothelial cells (ABEC) in mono-culture or NPC co-culture. We identified > 6000 differentially expressed genes (DEG), regardless of culture condition. PVEC exhibited a 30-fold greater response to NPC than ABEC (411 vs. 13 DEG). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of DEG that were higher or lower in PVEC vs. ABEC identified "Nervous system development" and "Response to Stress" as the top significantly different biological process, respectively. Enrichment in canonical pathways included HIF1A, FGF/stemness, WNT signaling, interferon signaling and complement. Solute carriers (SLC) and ABC transporters represented an important subset of DEG, underscoring PVEC's implication in blood-brain barrier formation and maintenance of nutrient-rich/non-toxic environment. Our work characterizes the gene signature of PVEC and their important partnership with NPC, underpinning their unique role in maintaining a healthy neurovascular niche, and in supporting brain development. This information may pave the way for additional studies to explore their therapeutic potential in neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
