38376240|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited movement disorder characterized by a progressive decline in motor coordination. Despite the extensive functional connectivity (FC) alterations reported in previous SCA3 studies in the cerebellum and cerebellar-cerebral pathways, the influence of these FC disturbances on the hierarchical organization of cerebellar functional regions remains unclear. Here, we compared 35 SCA3 patients with 48 age- and sex-matched healthy controls using a combination of voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether cerebellar hierarchical organization is altered in SCA3. Utilizing connectome gradients, we identified the gradient axis of cerebellar hierarchical organization, spanning sensorimotor to transmodal (task-unfocused) regions. Compared to healthy controls, SCA3 patients showed a compressed hierarchical organization in the cerebellum at both voxel-level (p < .05, TFCE corrected) and network-level (p < .05, FDR corrected). This pattern was observed in both intra-cerebellar and cerebellar-cerebral gradients. We observed that decreased intra-cerebellar gradient scores in bilateral Crus I/II both negatively correlated with SARA scores (left/right Crus I/II: r = -.48/-.50, p = .04/.04, FDR corrected), while increased cerebellar-cerebral gradients scores in the vermis showed a positive correlation with disease duration (r = .48, p = .04, FDR corrected). Control analyses of cerebellar gray matter atrophy revealed that gradient alterations were associated with cerebellar volume loss. Further FC analysis showed increased functional connectivity in both unimodal and transmodal areas, potentially supporting the disrupted cerebellar functional hierarchy uncovered by the gradients. Our findings provide novel evidence regarding alterations in the cerebellar functional hierarchy in SCA3.
