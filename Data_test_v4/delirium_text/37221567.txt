37221567|t|Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS): recent updates.
37221567|a|An increasing number of patients are surviving critical illness, but some experience new or worsening long-lasting impairments in physical, cognitive and/or mental health, commonly known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). The need to better understand and improve PICS has resulted in a growing body of literature exploring its various facets. This narrative review will focus on recent studies evaluating various aspects of PICS, including co-occurrence of specific impairments, subtypes/phenotypes, risk factors/mechanisms, and interventions. In addition, we highlight new aspects of PICS, including long-term fatigue, pain, and unemployment.
