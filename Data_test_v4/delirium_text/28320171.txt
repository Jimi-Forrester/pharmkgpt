28320171|a|OBJECTIVE: The effect of delirium on stroke outcome has not been quantified in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the prevalence of delirium occurring within one week of stroke in Nigerian survivors and its association with dementia and mortality at 3months. METHODS: Delirium was ascertained after repeated assessments within one week of stroke using the Confusion Assessment Method. Demographic and clinical characteristics, stroke severity, current and pre-morbid cognitive functioning were also assessed. Participants were then followed up for 3months using culturally-validated neuropsychological tools. Probable dementia was ascertained according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS-AIREN) criteria. Associations were investigated using both binomial and multinomial logistic regression analyses and presented as odds ratios (O.R) and relative risk ratios (RRR). RESULTS: Of 101 consenting stroke survivors, 99 had two assessments for delirium within one week of the stroke. Delirium was present in 33.3% of stroke survivors (65.6% hypoactive, 21.9% hyperactive, and 12.1% mixed type). Having a severe stroke was associated with delirium (O.R=6.2, 95% C.I=1.1-13.8) after adjusting for age, gender, education and economic status, lifestyle factors, multimorbidities and laterality. At follow-up, those with severe stroke had a stronger association between delirium and dementia (RRR=4.3, 95% C.I=1.2-15.6) or death (RRR=3.7, 95% C.I=1.1-12.1). CONCLUSION: Delirium, in this sub-Saharan African sample, was already present in about one-third of survivors within one week of stroke. Survivors of severe stroke are at higher risk of delirium and its complications, and could be important target for delirium preventive interventions.
