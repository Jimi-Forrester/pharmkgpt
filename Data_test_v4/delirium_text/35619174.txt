35619174|a|INTRODUCTION: This study sought to explore the association between Life's Simple 7 (LS7) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological biomarkers in the cognitively normal northern Chinese population. METHODS: From the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study, 1106 cognitively normal participants were enrolled. The mean age was 62.34 years, and 39.6% were female. LS7 scores were summed with each metric assigned 0, 1, or 2 scores. The multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the association between LS7 scores and CSF AD biomarkers. RESULTS: We found that LS7 scores were significantly associated with CSF AD pathologies, including Abeta42/40 (beta = 0.034, P = .041), p-tau181 (beta =  - 0.043, P = .006), and t-tau (beta =  - 0.044, P = .003). In subscales, the biological metrics (blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose) were significantly related to CSF tau-related biomarkers. These associations were observed in the APOE epsilon4 allele non-carriers, yet not in carriers. The relationship of behavior metrics was found in the middle age and males. CONCLUSION: Improving LS7 scores might do a favor to alleviate the pathology of AD in the preclinical stage, especially among the APOE epsilon4 allele non-carriers.
