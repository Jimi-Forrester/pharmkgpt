26833350|t|Targeting Low Disease Activity in Elderly-Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis: Current and Future Roles of Biological Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs.
26833350|a|Elderly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is classified into two clinical subsets, elderly-onset RA (EORA) and younger-onset elderly RA. With the improvement of life expectancy in the general population and advent of the super-aging society, the number of patients with EORA is anticipated to increase. Both large and small joints are affected initially at onset, and individuals with early EORA have higher scores of disease activity and levels of acute-phase reactants than those with early younger-onset RA. EORA is a progressive disease similar to younger-onset RA. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are equally or slightly less effective in elderly patients than in younger patients with RA, and disease duration may have a greater impact on disease outcomes than age. Evidence of non-TNF biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug use in EORA is limited. TNF inhibitors may not increase the risk for infection in elderly patients any more than methotrexate; however, increasing age is an independent and strong risk factor for serious infections in patients with RA. Treatment choice in patients with EORA is strongly influenced by comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and frailty. To prevent progression to irreversible geriatric syndromes, non-frail patients with EORA, who are aging successfully should undergo intensive treatment using the treat-to-target strategy, and pre-frail and frail patients with EORA should be treated with the aim of returning to a non-frail or pre-frail stage, respectively. An appropriate treatment strategy for EORA and younger-onset elderly RA should be developed in the next decade using a multi-disciplinary approach.
