36803566|t|Emerging role of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and MSCs-derived exosomes in bone- and joint-associated musculoskeletal disorders: a new frontier.
36803566|a|Exosomes are membranous vesicles with a 30 to 150 nm diameter secreted by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and other cells, such as immune cells and cancer cells. Exosomes convey proteins, bioactive lipids, and genetic components to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Consequently, they have been implicated in regulating intercellular communication mediators under physiological and pathological circumstances. Exosomes therapy as a cell-free approach bypasses many concerns regarding the therapeutic application of stem/stromal cells, including undesirable proliferation, heterogeneity, and immunogenic effects. Indeed, exosomes have become a promising strategy to treat human diseases, particularly bone- and joint-associated musculoskeletal disorders, because of their characteristics, such as potentiated stability in circulation, biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and toxicity. In this light, a diversity of studies have indicated that inhibiting inflammation, inducing angiogenesis, provoking osteoblast and chondrocyte proliferation and migration, and negative regulation of matrix-degrading enzymes result in bone and cartilage recovery upon administration of MSCs-derived exosomes. Notwithstanding, insufficient quantity of isolated exosomes, lack of reliable potency test, and exosomes heterogeneity hurdle their application in clinics. Herein, we will deliver an outline respecting the advantages of MSCs-derived exosomes-based therapy in common bone- and joint-associated musculoskeletal disorders. Moreover, we will have a glimpse the underlying mechanism behind the MSCs-elicited therapeutic merits in these conditions.
