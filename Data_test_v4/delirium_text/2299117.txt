2299117|t|The concept of "reversible" dementia. How nonreliable terminology may impair effective treatment.
2299117|a|Although good clinical and research information continually appears in the dementia literature, there is the disconcerting sense that, in some areas, a lack of clarity and rigor exists regarding terminology. Although definitions in the field of dementia initially seem reasonably straightforward, specific problem areas exist. This multidisciplinary field encompasses a variety of physician specialists, as well as other diverse professionals and brings not only the benefit of a rich mix of backgrounds, but also provides a medium for potential misunderstanding due to miscommunication. The variety of definitions of dementia, and especially the label, "reversible dementia," exemplifies this problem. Disease-specific dementias, pseudodementia, and delirium are three clinical situations that may or may not be classified as "reversible dementias," depending on individual training, custom, and jargon. Use of the term "reversible dementia" may cause misunderstanding and inefficiency and benefits neither patient nor caregiver. It is suggested that the term be replaced. Further, all diagnostic labels should be clearly understood and explained. Emphasis must be placed on promoting the fact that all patients with cognitive/functional decline, no matter how defined or what the cause, are eminently treatable individuals.
