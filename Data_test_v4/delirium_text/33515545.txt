33515545|a|Gene duplication generates new functions and traits, enabling evolution. Human-specific duplicated genes in particular are primary sources of innovation during our evolution although they have very few known functions. Here we examine the brain function of one of these genes (CHRFAM7A) and its product (dupalpha7 subunit). This gene results from a partial duplication of the ancestral CHRNA7 gene encoding the alpha7 subunit that forms the homopentameric alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7-nAChR). The functions of alpha7-nAChR in the brain are well defined, including the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity underlying normal attention, cognition, learning, and memory processes. However, the role of the dupalpha7 subunit remains unexplored at the neuronal level. Here, we characterize that role by combining immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR and FRET techniques with functional assays of alpha7-nAChR activity using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell variants with different dupalpha7 expression levels. Our findings reveal a physical interaction between dupalpha7 and alpha7 subunits in fluorescent protein-tagged dupalpha7/alpha7 transfected cells that negatively affects normal alpha7-nAChR activity. Specifically, in both single cells and cell populations, the [Ca2+]i signal and the exocytotic response induced by selective stimulation of alpha7-nAChR were either significantly inhibited by stable dupalpha7 overexpression or augmented after silencing dupalpha7 gene expression with specific siRNAs. These findings identify a new role for the dupalpha7 subunit as a negative regulator of alpha7-nAChR-mediated control of exocytotic neurotransmitter release. If this effect is excessive, it would result in an impaired synaptic transmission that could underlie the neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with alpha7-nAChR dysfunction.
