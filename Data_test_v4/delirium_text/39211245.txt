39211245|a|BACKGROUND: Deferoxamine (DFO) and other iron chelators are clinically used for cancer and stroke. They may also be useful for Alzheimers disease (AD) to diminish iron from microbleeds. DFO may also stimulate antioxidant membrane repair which is impaired during AD. DFO, and other chelators do enter the brain despite some contrary reports. OBJECTIVE: Low dose, oral DFO was given in lab chow to wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice to evaluate potential impact on iron levels, iron-signaling and storage proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) and processing enzymes. Young WT mice do not have microbleeds or disrupted blood-brain barrier of AD mice. METHODS: Iron was measured by MRI and chemically after two weeks of dietary DFO. Cerebral cortex was examined for changes in iron metabolism, antioxidant signaling, and APP processing by Western blot. RESULTS: DFO decreased brain iron by 18% (MRI) and decreased seven major proteins that mediate iron metabolism by at least 25%. The iron storage proteins ferritin light and heavy chain decreased by at least 30%. APP and secretase enzymes also decreased by 30%. CONCLUSIONS: WT mice respond to DFO with decreased APP, amyloid processing enzymes, and antioxidant repair. Potential DFO treatment for early-stage AD by DFO should consider the benefits of lowered APP and secretase enzymes.
