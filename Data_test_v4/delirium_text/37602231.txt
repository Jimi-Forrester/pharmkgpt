37602231|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, and it is unlikely that any single drug or intervention will be very successful. The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease involves a range of complicated biological processes, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein and tau protein. Given the complexity of AD and amyloid accumulation, a combination of interventions remains to be further explored. Here, we investigated the potential of combining beta-asarone and cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment for AD. The study analyzed the combined effects of these two phytochemicals on beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein aggregation and toxicity in bulk solution, in cells as well as in C.elegans. We detailed the morphological and size changes of Abeta40 aggregates in the presence of beta-asarone and cannabidiol. More importantly, the presence of both compounds synergistically inhibited apoptosis and downregulated relative gene expression in cells, and that it may also slow aging, decrease the rate of paralysis, enhance learning capacity, and boost autophagy activity in C.elegans. Our studies suggest that multiple drugs, like beta-asarone and CBD, may be potentially developed as a medicinal adjunct in the treatment of AD, although further clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this combination treatment in humans.
