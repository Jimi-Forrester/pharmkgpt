37949073|a|The SORL1 gene (SORLA) is strongly associated with risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). SORLA is a regulator of endosomal trafficking in neurons and interacts with retromer, a complex that is a "master conductor" of endosomal trafficking. Small molecules can increase retromer expression in vitro, enhancing its function. We treated hiPSC-derived cortical neurons that are either fully deficient, haploinsufficient, or that harbor one copy of SORL1 variants linked to AD with TPT-260, a retromer-enhancing molecule. We show significant increases in retromer subunit VPS26B expression. We tested whether endosomal, amyloid, and TAU pathologies were corrected. We observed that the degree of rescue by TPT-260 treatment depended on the number of copies of functional SORL1 and which SORL1 variant was expressed. Using a disease-relevant preclinical model, our work illuminates how the SORL1-retromer pathway can be therapeutically harnessed.
