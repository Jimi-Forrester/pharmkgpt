36639811|a|PURPOSE: The prevalence of degenerative spinal deformity (DSD) and the increased cost of correction surgery impose substantial burdens on the health care and insurance system. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol on postoperative outcomes after complex spinal surgery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively established database of DSD was performed. The consecutive patients who underwent open correction surgery for degenerative spinal deformity between August 2016 and February 2022 were reviewed. We extracted demographic data, preoperative radiographic parameters, and surgery-related variables. The ERAS patients were 1:1 propensity-score matched to a historical cohort by the same surgical team based on age, gender, BMI, and number of levels fused. We then compared the length of hospital stay (LOS), physiological functional recovery, and the rates of complications and readmissions within 90 days after surgery between the groups. RESULTS: There were 108 patients included, 54 patients in the ERAS cohort, and 54 patients matched control patients in the historical cohort. The historical and ERAS cohorts were not significantly different regarding demographic characteristics, comorbidities, preoperative parameters, operative time, and reoperation rate (P > 0.05). Patients in the ERAS group had significantly shorter postoperative LOS (12.0 days vs. 15.1 days, P = 0.001), average days of drain and urinary catheters placement (3.5 days vs. 4.4 days and 1.9 days vs 4.8 days, respectively), and lower 90-day readmission rate (1.8% vs. 12.9%, P = 0.027). The first day of assisted-walking and bowel movement occurred on average 1.9 days (2.5 days vs. 4.4 days, P = 0.001) and 1.7 days (1.9 days vs. 3.6 days, P = 0.001) earlier respectively in the ERAS group. Moreover, the rate of postoperative urinary retention (3.7% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.026) and surgical site infection (0% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.046) were significantly lower with ERAS protocol applied. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that the ERAS protocol was safe and essential for patients undergoing thoracolumbar deformity surgery for DSD. The ERAS protocol was associated with a shorter postoperative LOS, a lower rate of 90-day readmission, less rehabilitation discharge, and less postoperative complications.
