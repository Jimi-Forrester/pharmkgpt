Over the last decades, the survival of critically ill patients has improved; however, cognitive deficits are among the long-term sequelae. We hypothesize that acute lung injury leads to upregulation of cerebral cytokine synthesis. METHODS: After approval of the institutional and animal care committee, 20 male pigs were randomized to one of three groups: (1) Lung injury by oleic acid injection (OAI), (2) ventilation only (CTR) or (3) untreated. We compared neuronal numbers, proportion of neurons with markers for apoptosis, activation state of Iba-1 stained microglia cells and cerebral mRNA levels of different cytokines between the groups 18 hours after onset of lung injury. RESULTS: We found an increase in hippocampal TNFalpha (p < 0.05) and IL-6 (p < 0.05) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the OAI compared to untreated group as well as higher hippocampal IL-6 mRNA compared to control (p < 0.05). IL-8 and IL-1beta mRNA showed no differences between the groups. We found histologic markers for beginning apoptosis in OAI compared to untreated (p < 0.05) and more active microglia cells in OAI and CTR compared to untreated (p < 0.001 each). CONCLUSION: Hippocampal cytokine transcription increases within 18 hours after the induction of acute lung injury with histological evidence of neuronal damage. It remains to be elucidated if increased cytokine mRNA synthesis plays a role in the cognitive decline observed in survivors of ARDS.
