38855352|t|Managing Delirium in the Emergency Department: An Updated Narrative Review.
38855352|a|Purpose of Review: Emergency departments (EDs) are facing an epidemic of overcrowding and ED boarding, particularly of older adults who often present with, or develop, delirium in the ED. Delirium is associated with increased complications, longer hospital length of stay, mortality, and costs to the healthcare system. However, we only have limited knowledge of how to successfully prevent and treat delirium in the ED in a pragmatic, sustainable, and cost-effective way. We present a narrative review of recent literature of delirium prevention and treatment programs in the ED. We aim to describe the components of successful delirium management strategies to be used by EDs in building delirium management programs. Recent Findings: We reviewed 10 studies (2005-2023) that report delirium interventions in the ED, and describe the different components of these interventions that have been studied. These interventions included: optimizing hemodynamics and oxygenation, treating pain, hydration and nutrition support, avoiding sedative hypnotics, antipsychotics and anticholinergics, promoting sleep, sensory stimulation, limiting the time spent in the ED, educating providers and staff, and developing multidisciplinary delirium protocols integrated into the electronic health record. Summary: Through our narrative review of the recent literature on delirium prevention and treatment programs in the ED, we have identified nine components of successful delirium prevention strategies in the ED. We also discuss three high priority areas for further research including identification of most effective components of delirium prevention strategies, conduct of additional high-quality trials in non-hip.
