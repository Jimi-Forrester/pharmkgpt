34427199|t|Effect of complicated ocular surgery in stress-related parameters: A novel outlook into surgeon's health.
34427199|a|PURPOSE: To assess the stress-related physiological parameters of ophthalmic surgeons during complicated cataract surgery and compare them with uncomplicated routine cataract surgery. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 110 patients of various types of cataract were divided into two groups: Group 1 included 55 patients with simple cataract (Grade <=3) with no ocular or systemic comorbidities, whereas Group 2 included 55 patients with complicated cataracts (Grade >3) and ocular/systemic comorbidities. All patients underwent phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation in the right eye only. The outcome measures were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2). RESULTS: The average SBP, DBP, MAP, and HR were significantly higher in the surgeon operating Group 2 (complicated cataract) compared with Group 1 (uncomplicated cataract; P < 0.05). The average SBP of the surgeon while operating Group 1 patients preoperatively and postoperatively was 125.42 +- 2.49 mmHg and 122.45 +- 2.10 mmHg, respectively, whereas in Group 2, the average SBP of the surgeon taken preoperatively and postoperatively was 145.98 +- 3.80 mmHg and 137.44 +- 3.45 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05). The surgeon's SpO2 showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: There is a significant level of increase in stress-related parameters of operating surgeons while doing complicated cataract surgery.
