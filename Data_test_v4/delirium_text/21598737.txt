21598737|t|[Basis of treatment of dementia. Pros and cons of early versus delayed treatment. Rationale].
21598737|a|The objective of this analysis was to review the clinical benefits of early treatment of Alzheimer's disease focusing on data on the use of inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. A number of well-done clinical trials show that therapy is effective in dropping the progressive deterioration of cognition and behavior. They also reveal significant benefits to start treatment early. These benefits include behavioral stabilization preserving the independence, in addition to delay cognitive impairment. There is evidence that favors initiating treatment early in the course of dementia and reinforces the need to estimate the behavior and activities to precisely evaluate treatment response.
