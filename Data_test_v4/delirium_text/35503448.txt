35503448|a|The clinical benefit of perospirone for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer is not sufficiently clear. The objective of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of perospirone to those of risperidone for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer. This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective observational study in nine psycho-oncology consultation services in Japan. The study used the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) Revised-98 to measure effectiveness and the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4 to assess safety. Data from 16 patients who received perospirone and 53 patients who received risperidone were analyzed. The mean age was 70 years in the perospirone group and 73 years in the risperidone group. Both groups showed a significant decrease in the total score of DRS-R-98 after three days of treatment (perospirone: 11.7 (7.9-15.4) to 7.0 (3.3-10.7), difference -4.7, effect size=0.72, p=0.003; risperidone: 15.5 (13.6-17.4) to 12.2 (10.1-14.2), difference -3.3, effect size=0.55, p=0.00). The risperidone group showed significant improvements in sleep-wake cycle disturbance, orientation, attention, and visuospatial ability. In the perospirone group, there was a significant improvement of sleep-wake cycle disturbance. The median daily dose of perospirone was 4 mg/day. There were fewer episodes of somnolence as an adverse event in the perospirone group. Low-dose perospirone was thus found to be effective for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer and may be associated with fewer episodes of over-sedation as an adverse event.
