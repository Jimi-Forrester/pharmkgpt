29344434|t|Rare Multidrug-Resistant Pulmonary Nocardiosis in AIDS.
29344434|a|Nocardiosis is an opportunistic infection in patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity. Inhalation is the primary route for exposure via dust particles. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are at increased risk of disseminated disease. A challenge in the diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is that it can mimic other pulmonary diseases. Nocardia farcinica tends to be a more virulent, multidrug-resistant strain with an increased tendency to disseminate. This report describes a 64-year-old man with AIDS found to have pulmonary nocardiosis that did not respond to standard antibiotic therapy. Further evaluation revealed the virulent, multidrug-resistant Nocardia farcinica species. Targeted antibiotic therapy was initiated, after which the patient had an improvement in pulmonary symptoms. It is important to suspect pulmonary nocardiosis in immunocompromised patients who fail to respond to standard antimicrobial therapy. Susceptibilities should be obtained so that appropriate therapy can be promptly initiated as Nocardia farcinica is highly resistant to multiple antimicrobials.
