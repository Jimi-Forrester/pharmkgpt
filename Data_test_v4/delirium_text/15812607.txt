15812607|a|OBJECTIVE: Ethanol-inhibited glutamatergic neurotransmission has been shown to mediate pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of alcoholism, including withdrawal symptoms. NMDA-receptor 2B (NR2B) is a subunit that confers a high sensitivity to ethanol-induced inhibition. Previously we had reported a lack of association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1806201 in the NR2B gene (GRIN2B) and alcoholism. Shortly thereafter, an association between the polymorphism and early-onset alcoholism has been reported. One aim of the present study was to test whether the association between the GRIN2B polymorphism rs1806201 and early-onset alcoholism can be replicated in a larger sample. Moreover, we hypothesized that another genetic variation within GRIN2B (rs1806191) may have an effect in the etiology of alcoholism or withdrawal-related traits. METHODS: We extended our original study sample to a size of 377 patients and 464 healthy volunteers and performed a replication study, including the second GRIN2B SNP. Associations between allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of the two polymorphisms and alcoholism as well as with patients' phenotypes were investigated. RESULTS: No associations were found between any of the two polymorphisms, tested individually or as haplotypes, and alcoholism, respectively withdrawal-related traits. CONCLUSION: Neither the analyzed SNPs nor any of their haplotypes likely modify susceptibility to alcohol dependence or withdrawal-related phenotypes.
