38651367|t|Unveiling Gene Interactions in Alzheimer's Disease by Integrating Genetic and Epigenetic Data with a Network-Based Approach.
38651367|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex disease and the leading cause of dementia in older people. We aimed to uncover aspects of AD's pathogenesis that may contribute to drug repurposing efforts by integrating DNA methylation and genetic data. Implementing the network-based tool, a dense module search of genome-wide association studies (dmGWAS), we integrated a large-scale GWAS dataset with DNA methylation data to identify gene network modules associated with AD. Our analysis yielded 286 significant gene network modules. Notably, the foremost module included the BIN1 gene, showing the largest GWAS signal, and the GNAS gene, the most significantly hypermethylated. We conducted Web-based Cell-type-Specific Enrichment Analysis (WebCSEA) on genes within the top 10% of dmGWAS modules, highlighting monocyte as the most significant cell type (p < 5 x 10-12). Functional enrichment analysis revealed Gene Ontology Biological Process terms relevant to AD pathology (adjusted p < 0.05). Additionally, drug target enrichment identified five FDA-approved targets (p-value = 0.03) for further research. In summary, dmGWAS integration of genetic and epigenetic signals unveiled new gene interactions related to AD, offering promising avenues for future studies.
