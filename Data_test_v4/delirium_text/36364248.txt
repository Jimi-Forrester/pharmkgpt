36364248|a|Accumulating evidence has shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) is a systemic disease other than a mere central nervous system (CNS) disorder. One of the most important peripheral symptoms is gastrointestinal dysfunction. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is regarded as an essential gateway to the environment. The discovery of the prion-like behavior of alpha-synuclein makes it possible for the neurodegenerative process to start in the ENS and spread via the gut-brain axis to the CNS. We first confirmed that synucleinopathies existed in the stomachs of chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/probenecid (MPTP/p)-induced PD mice, as indicated by the significant increase in abnormal aggregated and nitrated alpha-synuclein in the TH-positive neurons and enteric glial cells (EGCs) of the gastric myenteric plexus. Next, we attempted to clarify the mechanisms in single MPTP-injected mice. The stomach naturally possesses high monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity and low superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, making the stomach susceptible to MPTP-induced oxidative stress, as indicated by the significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the stomach and elevated 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the EGCs after MPTP exposure for 3 h. Additionally, stomach synucleinopathies appear before those of the nigrostriatal system, as determined by Western blotting 12 h after MPTP injection. Notably, nitrated alpha-synuclein was considerably increased in the EGCs after 3 h and 12 h of MPTP exposure. Taken together, our work demonstrated that the EGCs could be new contributors to synucleinopathies in the stomach. The early-initiated synucleinopathies might further influence neighboring neurons in the myenteric plexus and the CNS. Our results offer a new experimental clue for interpreting the etiology of PD.
