35329121|a|Chronic low-grade inflammation that accompanies aging is associated with adverse health outcomes and may exacerbate the severity of infectious disease such as COVID-19. Resistance training (RT) has the potential to improve chronic low-grade inflammation, but the evidence remains inconclusive. This study evaluated the effects of RT on chronic low-grade inflammation in elderly adults. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, RISS, NDSL, and KoreaMed were searched. We included studies that assessed the effect of RT on C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in those aged >=60 years. The effect size was estimated using fixed or random-effects models. Subgroup analysis was performed regarding age, health status, training method, number of exercises, intensity, weekly frequency, and duration. In the 18 randomized controlled trials (539 patients) included, RT was effective in alleviating CRP (effect size = -0.72, 95% confidence interval = -1.06 to -0.38, p < 0.001), IL-10 (-3.34, -6.16 to -0.53, p = 0.02), and TNF-alpha (-0.56, -1.08 to -0.03, p = 0.04) in elderly adults and tended to reduce IL-6 (-0.59, -1.18 to 0.00, p = 0.05). Subgroup analyses showed CRP reduction regardless of age, training method, number of exercises, intensity, weekly frequency, and duration. RT can be used to ameliorate chronic low-grade inflammation in elderly adults.
