16542445|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical and neuropathological overlap between Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is now well recognized. Such cases of concurrent AD and Lewy body disease (AD/LBD) show neuropathological changes that include Lewy bodies (alpha-synuclein aggregates), neuritic amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates). The co-occurrence of these clinical and neuropathological changes suggests shared pathogenic mechanisms in these diseases, previously assumed to be distinct. Glial activation, with overexpression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and other proinflammatory cytokines, has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of both AD and PD. METHODS: Rat primary cultures of microglia and cortical neurons were cultured either separately or as mixed cultures. Microglia or cocultures were treated with a secreted fragment (sAPPalpha) of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). Neurons were treated with IL-1beta or conditioned medium from sAPPalpha-activated microglia, with or without IL-1 receptor antagonist. Slow-release pellets containing either IL-1beta or bovine serum albumin (control) were implanted in cortex of rats, and mRNA for various neuropathological markers was analyzed by RT-PCR. Many of the same markers were assessed in tissue sections from human cases of AD/LBD. RESULTS: Activation of microglia with sAPPalpha resulted in a dose-dependent increase in secreted IL-1beta. Cortical neurons treated with IL-1beta showed a dose-dependent increase in sAPPalpha release, an effect that was enhanced in the presence of microglia. IL-1beta also elevated the levels of alpha-synuclein, activated MAPK-p38, and phosphorylated tau; a concomitant decrease in levels of synaptophysin occurred. Delivery of IL-1beta by slow-release pellets elevated mRNAs encoding alpha-synuclein, betaAPP, tau, and MAPK-p38 compared to controls. Finally, human cases of AD/LBD showed colocalization of IL-1-expressing microglia with neurons that simultaneously overexpressed betaAPP and contained both Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that IL-1 drives production of substrates necessary for formation of the major neuropathological changes characteristic of AD/LBD.
