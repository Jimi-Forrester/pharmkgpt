18766151|t|In search of a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and potential immunonosuppresive therapeutic interventions.
18766151|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease of aging. Recent projections of the dramatic increase in AD incidence worldwide by 2050 reveal its magnitude as a world-wide health crisis and underscore the urgent need to understand the etiology of AD in order to develop therapeutic interventions. A popular debate among scientists has traditionally pitted those in support of Beta amyloid protein as a causative factor ("Baptists") against others who implicate tau hyperphosphorylation ("Tauists"). Considering the significance of Beta amyloid protein and hyperphosphorlyated tau protein aggregates in AD pathology, this article delves into the nature of inflammation associated with these aggregates. Aspects of inflammation focus on microglia, resident immune cells of the CNS that are activated during AD inflammation and are known to play a significant role in pathogenesis. This article discusses the role of microglia, inflammation, and the immune response as a middle ground in the debate between the "Tauists" and the "Baptists" respective positions. It explores recent advances in immunotherapy and supports continued research in and use of immunosuppressive regimens as potential therapeutic interventions for AD.
