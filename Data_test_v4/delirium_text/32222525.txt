32222525|t|5-lipoxygenase pathway and its downstream cysteinyl leukotrienes as potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease.
32222525|a|5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is an enzyme involved in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, a metabolic pathway in which cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are the resultant metabolites. Both ALOX5 and CysLTs are clinically significant in a number of inflammatory diseases, such as in asthma and allergic rhinitis, and drugs antagonizing the effect of these molecules have long been successfully used to counter these diseases. Interestingly, recent advances in 'neuroinflammation' research has led to the discovery of several novel inflammatory pathways regulating many cerebral pathologies, including the ALOX5 pathway. By means of pharmacological and genetic studies, both ALOX5 and CysLTs receptors have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative/neurological diseases, such as in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In both transgenic and sporadic models of AD, it has been shown that the levels of ALOX5/CysLTs are elevated, and that genetic/pharmacological interventions of these molecules can alleviate AD-related behavioral and pathological conditions. Clinical relevance of these molecules has also been found in AD brain samples. In this review, we aim to summarize such important findings on the role of ALOX5/CysLTs in AD pathophysiology, from both the cellular and the molecular aspects, and also discuss the potential of their blockers as possible therapeutic choices to curb AD-related conditions.
