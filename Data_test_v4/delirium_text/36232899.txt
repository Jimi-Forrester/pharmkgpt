36232899|t|Two Important Anticancer Mechanisms of Natural and Synthetic Chalcones.
36232899|a|ATP-binding cassette subfamily G and tubulin pharmacological mechanisms decrease the effectiveness of anticancer drugs by modulating drug absorption and by creating tubulin assembly through polymerization. A series of natural and synthetic chalcones have been reported to have very good anticancer activity, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration lower than 1 microM. By modulation, it is observed in case of the first mechanism that methoxy substituents on the aromatic cycle of acetophenone residue and substitution of phenyl nucleus by a heterocycle and by methoxy or hydroxyl groups have a positive impact. To inhibit tubulin, compounds bind to colchicine binding site. Presence of methoxy groups, amino groups or heterocyclic substituents increase activity.
