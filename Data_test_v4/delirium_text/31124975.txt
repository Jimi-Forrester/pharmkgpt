31124975|a|BACKGROUND: We evaluated the relationship between ultrasonographical acquired parameters and short-term postoperative cognitive function in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP). METHODS: Ninety elderly patients scheduled for RALP had their optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and the IJV valve (IJVV) competency assessed by ultrasound. The patients were analyzed in 2 groups based on whether displayed IJVV incompetency (IJVVI). The 3 parameters were measured before anesthesia (T0), immediately after induction of general anesthesia (T1), 5 minutes after establishing pneumoperitoneum (T2), 5 minutes after placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position (T3), and 5 minutes after the release of the pneumoperitoneum in the supine position (T4). Regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) was also measured by near-infrared spectroscopy intraoperatively. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) were performed the day before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS: We found that 52% of patients had evidence of IJVVI after being placed in the Trendelenburg position after pneumoperitoneum was established (T4). Patient with IJVVI showed a significant increase of ONSD and CSA at T1, T2, T3, T4 but there was no associated decrease in rSO2. MMSE scores were reduced at postoperative day 1 and the 7 patients that developed postoperative delirium came from Group IJVVI. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that elderly patients that show IJVVI after adequate positioning for RALP may develop elevated intracranial pressure as well as mildly compromised postoperative cognitive function in the short term.
