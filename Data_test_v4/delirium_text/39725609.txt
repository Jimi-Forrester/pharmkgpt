39725609|t|Brain energy homeostasis: the evolution of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis.
39725609|a|The brain's substantial metabolic requirements, consuming a substantial fraction of the body's total energy despite its relatively small mass, necessitate sophisticated metabolic mechanisms for efficient energy distribution and utilization. The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis has emerged as a fundamental framework explaining the metabolic cooperation between astrocytes and neurons, whereby astrocyte-derived lactate serves as a crucial energy substrate for neurons. This review synthesizes current understanding of brain energy metabolism, focusing on the dual roles of lactate as both an energy substrate and a signaling molecule. We examine the molecular underpinnings of metabolic compartmentalization, particularly the differential expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes between astrocytes and neurons, which facilitates directional lactate flux. Recent evidence has challenged aspects of the classical ANLS model, revealing greater metabolic flexibility in neurons than previously recognized, including substantial LDHA expression and direct glucose utilization capabilities. Our recent studies on LDHB-deficient neurons provide new insights into the compensatory mechanisms and limitations of neuronal lactate metabolism, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of the ANLS hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss lactate's emerging role as a signaling molecule in synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and neuroprotection, particularly in ischemic conditions where elevated lactate levels correlate with enhanced neuronal survival through prostaglandin E2-mediated vasodilation. This comprehensive review integrates classical perspectives with recent advances, providing an updated framework for understanding brain lactate metabolism and its therapeutic implications in neurological disorders.
