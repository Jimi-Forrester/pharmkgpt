20224684|a|C3 and C3b, the components central to the complement activation, also play a damaging role in several inflammatory disorders. Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) and curcumin (Cur) are natural compounds with different biological origins reported to regulate complement activation. However, both VCP and Cur have not been investigated for their interaction with the third component (C3) prior to it being converted to its activated form (C3b). These two compounds have also not been compared to each other with respect to their interactions with C3 and C3b. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is a novel technology used to study the interaction of biomolecules. This technology was applied to characterize the interactions of VCP, Cur and appropriate controls with the key complement components. Cur as well as VCP showed binding to both C3 and to C3b, Cur however bound to C3b to a lesser extent.
