20029684|t|Involvement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in amyloid beta-fragment-induced intracellular Ca(2+) elevation in cultured rat cortical neurons.
20029684|a|The amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced disturbance of intracellular calcium homeostasis has been regarded as the final route whereby Abeta insults neurons. However, the mechanism of Abeta-induced Ca(2+) overloading is still unclear so far. Especially, it remains to be clarified whether nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in the Abeta-induced elevation of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). In the present study, we observed the effects of Abeta fragments 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)) and 31-35 (Abeta(31-35)) on [Ca(2+)](i) in primary cultured rat cortical neurons using laser-scanning confocal calcium imaging technique, and investigated its probable cholinergic mechanism. The results showed that: (1) Both Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(31-35) induced similar and significant [Ca(2+)](i) elevation in a concentration-dependent manner, and no statistical difference was found between the effects of both peptides; (2) The reverse peptide of Abeta(31-35), i.e. Abeta(35-31), had no effect on [Ca(2+)](i) elevation; (3) Mecamylamine (MCA), a non-specific nAChRs antagonist, significantly and dose-dependently blocked the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation induced by Abeta(25-35) or Abeta(31-35) (4) Dihydro-beta-erythroidine (D-beta-E), a specific alpha4beta2 subtype nAChRs antagonist, also significantly inhibited the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation induced by Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(31-35), but the effect was weaker than the effect of MCA at the same concentration. These results indicate that Abeta(31-35) may be a shorter active sequence in full length of Abeta molecule, and the overactivation of nAChRs, including alpha4beta2 subtype, may be, at least partly, responsible for the Abeta-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cultured rat cortical neurons. Thus, the present study suggests a new potential target of Abeta in the brain, and provides a new insight into the mechanisms by which Abeta impairs the cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.
