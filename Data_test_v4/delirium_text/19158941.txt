These effects may be related to the antioxidant properties of polyphenols. Juice consumption and flavonoid intake may also affect appetite. OBJECTIVE: To study the acute effects of grape juice consumption on appetite, mood and implicit memory during a time of increased lethargy - the post-lunch dip. DESIGN: Thirty-five participants with a mean age of 26 years who smoked a mean of 11 cigarettes/day for 8 years were included in the study. It included a practice session and two treatment sessions. All sessions involved consumption of grape juice or an energy-matched placebo with lunch followed by assessments of mood, implicit memory, appetite and food intake. RESULTS: Mood decreased over time for both treatments, but there were no differences after lunch between grape juice and placebo for any measure. CONCLUSION: This study did not document any acute effects of grape juice consumption on mood, implicit memory, appetite or food intake in smokers.
