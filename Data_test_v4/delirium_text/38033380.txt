38033380|a|Background: The effectiveness of ketamine as adjunctive or monotherapy for post-intubation sedation in adults with trauma on mechanical ventilation is unclear. Methods: A rapid review of systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, then randomized controlled trials or observational studies was conducted searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) and one clinical trial registry on June 1, 2022. We used a prespecified protocol following Cochrane rapid review methods. Results: We identified eight systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Among the included reviews, only the most relevant, up to date, highest quality-assessed reviews and reviews that reported on critical outcomes were considered. Adjunctive ketamine showed a morphine sparing effect (MD -13.19 micromg kg-1 h-1, 95 % CI -22.10 to -4.28, moderate certainty of evidence, 6 RCTs), but no to little effect on midazolam sparing effect (MD 0.75 micromg kg-1 h-1, 95 % CI -1.11 to 2.61, low certainty of evidence, 6 RCTs) or duration of mechanical ventilation in days (MD -0.17 days, 95 % CI -3.03 to 2.69, moderate certainty of evidence, 3 RCTs).Adjunctive ketamine therapy may reduce mortality (OR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.54 to 1.43, P = 0.60, very low certainty of evidence, 5 RCTs, n = 3076 patients) resulting in 30 fewer deaths per 1000, ranging from 132 fewer to 87 more, but the evidence is very uncertain. Ketamine results in little to no difference in length of ICU stay (MD 0.04 days, 95 % CI -0.12 to 0.20, high certainty of evidence, 5 RCTs n = 390 patients) or length of hospital stay (MD -0.53 days, 95 % CI -1.36 to 0.30, high certainty of evidence, 5 RCTs, n = 277 patients).Monotherapy may have a positive effect on respiratory and haemodynamic outcomes, however the evidence is very uncertain. Conclusion: Adjunctive ketamine for post-intubation analgosedation results in a moderate meaningful net benefit but there is uncertainty for benefit and harms as monotherapy.
