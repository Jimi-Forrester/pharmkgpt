33133805|t|The Effect of Simple Cost Effective Interventions in Improving Enhanced Recovery in Neck of Femur Fracture Care.
33133805|a|Aim Due to the frequency and high mortality and morbidity associated with neck of femur fractures, pathways of care have been established in the United Kingdom. These include the Enhanced Recovery Program (ERP), which aims to maximise the quality of care whilst reducing their length of stay, and the Best Practice Tariff (BPT) which if adhered to warrants $1335 per neck of femur fracture. We conducted a prospective audit to assess adherence to these pathways in a trauma unit. Methods An audit was carried out between November 2015 and May 2016. The information was obtained from neck of femur fracture proformas, anaesthetic charts and drug charts by two investigators. Results Nine out of the 10 ERP components were adhered to in all 31 patients. This highlighted a deficiency in requesting day one post-operative osteoporosis bloods, which was only carried out in 61.3% of patients. As an intervention, a reminder sticker was placed on the operation note as an intervention. Re-audit following the introduction of the stickers showed a marked improvement of 90%. During the initial admission 38.7% of patients adhered to the BPT. The main area for improvement was fracture prevention assessment, specifically Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) scores and Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores. To improve this these sections were highlighted in the proformas to promote their importance. Additionally, a smartphone application was made available to doctors to aid with ease of calculation. Following these interventions, 93% of patients had this data entered, with an improvement in overall tariff attainment to 63.3%. Conclusions The introduction of simple measures is beneficial both for patient safety and economically for hospitals.
