34858804|t|Mass Cytometry in Hematologic Malignancies: Research Highlights and Potential Clinical Applications.
34858804|a|Recent advances in global gene sequencing technologies and the effect they have had on disease diagnosis, therapy, and research have fueled interest in technologies capable of more broadly profiling not only genes but proteins, metabolites, cells, and almost any other component of biological systems. Mass cytometry is one such technology, which enables simultaneous characterization of over 40 parameters per cell, significantly more than can be achieved by even the most state-of-the-art flow cytometers. This mini-review will focus on how mass cytometry has been utilized to help advance the field of neoplastic hematology. Common themes among published studies include better defining lineage sub-populations, improved characterization of tumor microenvironments, and profiling intracellular signaling across multiple pathways simultaneously in various cell types. Reviewed studies highlight potential applications for disease diagnosis, prognostication, response to therapy, measurable residual disease analysis, and identifying new therapies.
