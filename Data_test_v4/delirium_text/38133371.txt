38133371|a|This study investigated the effects of subchronic arsenic exposure on behavior, neurological function, and hippocampal damage in rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups and exposed to different concentrations of arsenic in their drinking water for 12 weeks, while weekly water intake and body weight were recorded. Various neurobehavioral tests were conducted, evaluating overall activity levels, exploratory behavior, short-term memory, spatial learning and memory, anxiety-like behavior, and depressive-like states. Arsenic levels in urine, serum, and brain tissue were measured, and histopathological analysis assessed hippocampal damage using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results demonstrated that arsenic exposure did not significantly affect overall activity or exploratory behavior. However, it impaired short-term memory and spatial learning and memory functions. Arsenic-exposed rats exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and a depressive-like state. Arsenic levels increased dose-dependently in urine, serum, and brain tissue. The histopathological examinations revealed significant hippocampal damage, including neuronal shrinkage, cell proliferation, irregular structure, disordered arrangement, and vacuolation. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the impact of arsenic exposure on behavior and brain health, highlighting its potential neurological consequences.
