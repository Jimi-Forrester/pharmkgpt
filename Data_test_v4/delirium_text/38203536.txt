38203536|t|Control Theory and Systems Biology: Potential Applications in Neurodegeneration and Search for Therapeutic Targets.
38203536|a|Control theory, a well-established discipline in engineering and mathematics, has found novel applications in systems biology. This interdisciplinary approach leverages the principles of feedback control and regulation to gain insights into the complex dynamics of cellular and molecular networks underlying chronic diseases, including neurodegeneration. By modeling and analyzing these intricate systems, control theory provides a framework to understand the pathophysiology and identify potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, this review examines the most widely used control methods in conjunction with genomic-scale metabolic models in the steady state of the multi-omics type. According to our research, this approach involves integrating experimental data, mathematical modeling, and computational analyses to simulate and control complex biological systems. In this review, we find that the most significant application of this methodology is associated with cancer, leaving a lack of knowledge in neurodegenerative models. However, this methodology, mainly associated with the Minimal Dominant Set (MDS), has provided a starting point for identifying therapeutic targets for drug development and personalized treatment strategies, paving the way for more effective therapies.
