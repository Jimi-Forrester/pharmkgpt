32292478|t|Outcomes of the Extreme Elderly Undergoing Anaesthesia and Surgery amongst Southeast Asians.
32292478|a|RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were identified. The mean age is 93.6 years. Majority were ASA 2 and ASA 3 patients. The most common type of surgery performed was orthopaedic, followed by vascular and urologic. Seven of the 62 patients required re-operations. Regional was the predominant anaesthetic technique employed, followed by general anaesthesia. Intraoperative hypotension was seen in 16 of the patients, all of whom recovered uneventfully. Hypothermia, desaturation, and hypertension were the top three complications observed in the recovery. Seventeen patients were admitted to a high-dependency facility postoperatively. The mean length of stay was 13.7 days. The 30-day mortality was 1.6 percent. CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a snapshot of very elderly patients coming for surgery. The results show that this group of elderly patients do well postoperatively with relatively low complication and 30-day mortality rates. The outcomes presented can be used as a guide for risk counseling in the perioperative period.
