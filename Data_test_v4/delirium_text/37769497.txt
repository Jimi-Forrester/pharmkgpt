37769497|t|Modulation of chicken gut contractility by Melissa officinalis-ex vivo study.
37769497|a|Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) has a long history of being used in traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal tract disorders in human thanks to its spasmolytic and stress reducing effects. These pharmacological properties have been confirmed in laboratory animals. Unfortunately, in the case of veterinary medicine, the effect of lemon balm on gut contractility has been never subjected to a detailed investigation. On the other hand, there is urgent need of new drugs that could be safely used in animals for both, causative and symptomatic treatment. In broiler chicken, one of the major health concerns includes gastrointestinal disorders with gut hypermotility. Thus, it is crucial to verify the potential utility of Melissa officinalis extract in gastrointestinal dysmotilities. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of lemon balm extract and some of its active ingredients on chicken intestine motility. The study was performed on isolated proximal and distal jejunum preparations collected from broiler chicken which underwent routine slaughter procedure. The effect of lemon balm and 3 phenolic acids (rosmarinic, chlorogenic, and lithospermic) was verified under isometric conditions, toward spontaneous and acetylcholine (ACh)-induced smooth muscle activity. Surprisingly, M. officinalis turned out to be rather a myocontractile agent as it increased ACh-provoked contractility of proximal and distal jejunum strips and also intensified the spontaneous activity of distal jejunum. Only in the case of proximal intestine lemon balm extract diminished the force of spontaneous motoric activity up to approx. Sixty-seven percent of the control conditions. None of the tested phenolic acids displayed analog effect with the whole plant extract. In fact in the case of ACh-induced contractility, the acids had the opposite, that is, myorelaxant, effect than the extract, with a small exception of lithospermic acid in distal jejunum. Thus, it is impossible to assign one or more individual constituents to the effect of the whole Melissa officinalis extract. The obtained results do not support the use of lemon balm extract in broiler diseases which are accompanied by gut motility disturbances, including diarrhea.
