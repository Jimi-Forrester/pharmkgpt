38584828|a|To investigate the impact of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients with colorectal cancer, we conducted a randomized controlled trial. Eighty elderly patients who underwent elective laparoscopic radical resection of colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to either the GDFT group or the conventional fluid therapy group. The primary outcome was the incidence of POCD during the initial 7 postoperative days, while secondary outcomes included inflammatory marker levels such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and S100beta protein, hemodynamics, level of lactic acid, postoperative functional recovery, and complications. Among 88 randomized patients, 80 were evaluable for the primary outcome. The incidence of POCD was significantly lower in the GDFT group (15.0%) compared to the conventional fluid therapy group (30.0%), with the highest occurrence observed on day 3 postoperatively in both groups (P < 0.05). IL-6 and S100beta concentrations were consistently lower in the GDFT group than in the conventional fluid therapy group at the corresponding time points (P < 0.05). The GDFT group exhibited more stable perioperative hemodynamics and lower lactate levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, patients in the GDFT group exhibited better postoperative functional recovery indicators and a lower incidence of postoperative complications (P < 0.05). In summary, GDFT appears to reduce the incidence of early POCD, accelerate postoperative recovery, and enhance overall prognosis.
