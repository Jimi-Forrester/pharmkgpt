Current practices of crushing medications or using food vehicles have limitations and potential risks. This report describes the implementation of a medication lubricant, Gloup, for pill dysphagia on an acute care ward using Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project was to evaluate the implementation of Gloup in the acute care ward setting and assess its acceptability and uptake by patients and ward nurses during medication administration. METHODS: The project involved chart audits of medication administration records, collection of patient feedback, and staff feedback through meetings. Patient characteristics and medication administration practices were documented. The implementation process included education and training sessions for staff, development of a medication chart sticker for evaluation data collection and small-scale testing of Gloup with patients before ward-level implementation. RESULTS: The implementation of Gloup on the acute care ward showed high uptake and acceptability. The majority of patients using Gloup had crushed medications, and the use of Gloup varied based on patient needs. CONCLUSION: The implementation of Gloup as a medication lubricant for pill dysphagia on an acute care ward was successful and well received by patients and staff. The use of Gloup appeared to improve medication administration practices and reduce the need for crushing medications or using food vehicles. This project highlights the importance of addressing pill dysphagia in acute care settings and provides insights for other wards considering similar interventions.
