27700077|a|Oligomers of the 42-mer amyloid-beta protein (Abeta42), rather than fibrils, cause synaptic dysfunction in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The nucleation phase in a nucleation-dependent aggregation model of Abeta42 is related to the formation of oligomers. Uncaria rhynchophylla is one component of "Yokukansan", a Kampo medicine, which is widely used for treating AD symptoms. Previously, an extract of U. rhynchophylla was found to reduce the aggregation of Abeta42, but its active principles have yet to be identified. In the present work, uncarinic acid C (3) was identified as an inhibitor of Abeta42 aggregation that is present in U. rhynchophylla. Moreover, compound 3 acted as a specific inhibitor of the nucleation phase of Abeta42 aggregation. Compound 3 was synthesized from saponin A (10), an abundant byproduct of rutin purified from Uncaria elliptica. Comprehensive structure-activity studies on 3 suggest that both a C-27 ferulate and a C-28 carboxylic acid group are required for its inhibitory activity. These findings may aid the development of oligomer-specific inhibitors for AD therapy.
