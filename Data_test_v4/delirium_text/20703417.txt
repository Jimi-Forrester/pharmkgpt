20703417|a|AIM: To evaluate the profile of psychiatric disorders in geriatric inpatients. METHODS: A total of 528 patients (age 65 years and above) admitted to various departments of the teaching hospital attached to the Government Medical College, Amritsar from 15 September 2001 to 14 September 2002 were included in the study. Psychiatric assessment of patients was made on the basis of psychogeriatric assessment scales (PAS) and present state examination (PSE-ninth edition, 1974). The ICD-10 criteria were used for psychiatric diagnoses. General medical conditions were diagnosed by consultants of the respective departments. The patients were finally assessed by the consultant of the Department of Psychiatry. The obtained data were analysed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Of the 528 patients, 260 (49%) had psychiatric co-morbidity. The most common psychiatric disorder was depression (25.94%), followed by adjustment disorders (11%), anxiety disorders (4.54%), dementias (3.6%), delirium (3%), bipolar disorders (0.8%), and substance-related disorders (0.4%). CONCLUSION: The above findings emphasize the importance of consultation-liaison psychiatry, especially in geriatric patients.
