30775980|t|The Role of Apolipoprotein E Isoforms in Alzheimer's Disease.
30775980|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia worldwide, is characterized by high levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Genetically, the e4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been established as the major risk factor for developing late-onset AD (LOAD), the most common form of the disease. Although the role ApoE plays in AD is still not completely understood, a differential role of its isoforms has long been known. The current review compiles the involvement of ApoE isoforms in amyloid-beta protein precursor transcription, Abeta aggregation and clearance, synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Due to the complexity of LOAD, an accurate description of the interdependence among all the related molecular mechanisms involved in the disease is needed for developing successful therapies.
