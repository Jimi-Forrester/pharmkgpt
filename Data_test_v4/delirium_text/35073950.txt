35073950|a|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease in which many processes are detected including (neuro)inflammation. Many drugs have been tested for ALS in clinical trials but most have failed to reach their primary endpoints. The development and inclusion of different types of biomarkers in diagnosis and clinical trials can assist in determining target engagement of a drug, in distinguishing between ALS and other diseases, and in predicting disease progression rate, drug responsiveness, or an adverse event. Ideally, among other characteristics, a biomarker in ALS correlates highly with a disease process in the central nervous system or with disease progression and is conveniently obtained in a peripheral tissue. Here, we describe the state of biomarkers of inflammation in ALS by focusing on peripherally detectable and cellular responses from blood cells, and provide new (combinatorial) directions for exploration that are now feasible due to technological advancements.
