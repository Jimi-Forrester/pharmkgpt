36362272|t|A Concise Review of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantification Methods for Short Chain Fatty Acids as Endogenous Biomarkers.
36362272|a|Fatty acids are widespread naturally occurring compounds, and essential constituents for living organisms. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) appeared as physiologically relevant metabolites for their involvement with gut microbiota, immunology, obesity, and other pathophysiological functions. This has raised the demand for reliable analytical detection methods in a variety of biological matrices. Here, we describe an updated overview of sample pretreatment techniques and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based methods for quantitative analysis of SCFAs in blood, plasma, serum, urine, feces and bacterial cultures. The present review incorporates various procedures and their applications to help researchers in choosing crucial parameters, such as pretreatment for complex biological matrices, and variables for chromatographic separation and detection, to establish a simple, sensitive, and robust quantitative method to advance our understanding of the role of SCFAs in human health and disease as potential biomarkers.
