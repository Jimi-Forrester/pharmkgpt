38002473|t|CSF, Blood, and MRI Biomarkers in Skogholt's Disease-A Rare Neurodegenerative Disease in a Norwegian Kindred.
38002473|a|Skogholt's disease is a rare neurological disorder that is only observed in a small Norwegian kindred. It typically manifests in adulthood with uncharacteristic neurological symptoms from both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The etiology of the observed cerebral white matter lesions and peripheral myelin pathology is unclear. Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of protein have been confirmed, and recently, very high concentrations of CSF total and phosphorylated tau have been detected in Skogholt patients. The symptoms and observed biomarker changes in Skogholt's disease are largely nonspecific, and further studies are necessary to elucidate the disease mechanisms. Here, we report the results of neurochemical analyses of plasma and CSF, as well as results from the morphometric segmentation of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. We analyzed the biomarkers Abeta1--42, Abeta1-40, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, Abetax-42, total and phosphorylated tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, and beta-trace protein. All analyzed CSF biomarkers, except neurofilament light chain and Abeta1/x-42, were increased several-fold. In blood, none of these biomarkers were significantly different between the Skogholt and control groups. MRI volumetric segmentation revealed decreases in the ventricular, white matter, and choroid plexus volumes in the Skogholt group, with an accompanying increase in white matter lesions. The cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter volumes were increased in the Skogholt group. Pathophysiological changes resulting from choroidal dysfunction and/or abnormal CSF turnover, which may cause the increases in CSF protein and brain biomarker levels, are discussed.
