38823488|t|Connecting the emotional-cognitive puzzle: The role of tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor isoform imbalance in age-related emotional and cognitive impairments.
38823488|a|Age-related cognitive and affective disorders pose significant public health challenges. Notably, emotional and cognitive symptoms co-occur across multiple age-associated conditions like normal aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. While the intricate interplay underlying this relationship remains poorly understood, this article highlights the possibility that an imbalance between full-length (TrkB.FL) and truncated (TrkB.T1) isoforms of tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB in the neurotrophic system may significantly affect age-associated emotional and cognitive functions, by altering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, integral to neuronal health, cognitive functions and mood regulation. While the contribution of this imbalance to pathogenesis awaits full elucidation, this review evaluates its potential mediating role, linking emotional and cognitive decline across age-related disorders The interplay between TrkB.T1 and TrkB.FL isoforms may be considered as a pivotal shared regulator underlying this complex relationship. The current review aims to synthesize current knowledge on TrkB isoform imbalance, specifically its contribution to age-related cognitive decline and mood disorders. By examining shared pathogenic pathways between aging, cognitive decline, and mood disorders through the lens of TrkB signaling, this review uncovers potential therapeutic targets not previously considered, offering a fresh perspective on combating age-related mental health issues as well as cognitive deficits.
