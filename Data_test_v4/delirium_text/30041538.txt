30041538|a|The detection of cognitive impairment in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may improve detection of the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This detection is challenging, however, given the lack of sensitive assessment tools. The main objective of this study was to determine the potential contribution of word production tasks to the detection of cognitive impairment in SCD. The performances of 20 individuals with SCD, healthy controls (HCs), and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were compared on object and action naming and free fluency tasks. Participants with SCD performed similarly to HCs, while both groups differed significantly from participants with MCI in object naming and object fluency. Results showed that participants with SCD were at the midpoint between HCs and participants with MCI in action naming. They also revealed a HCs > SCD = MCI pattern in action fluency. This study provides evidence that verb production is impaired in SCD and that SCD is a pre-MCI condition.
