METHODS: Post hoc analysis of OPtimizing Transdermal Exelon In Mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (OPTIMA), a double-blind trial comparing 13.3 and 9.5 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch in patients with AD demonstrating functional and cognitive decline with 9.5 mg/24 h patch. Efficacy on Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-instrumental ADL (ADCS-IADL) items, higher level function (HLF), and autonomy factors was assessed. RESULTS: The ADCS-IADL, HLF, and autonomy factors favored 13.3 mg/24 h patch at all time points, reaching significance from weeks 16 to 48, 24 to 48, and 32 to 48, respectively. Higher dose patch demonstrated significantly greater efficacy on 10 of 17 ADCS-IADL items at 1 or more time points (P < .05 vs 9.5 mg/24 h patch). More adverse events were observed with higher dose patch; study discontinuations were similar between the doses. CONCLUSIONS: Greater efficacy of 13.3 versus 9.5 mg/24 h patch on ADL, including autonomy and HLF factors, supports this additional dosing option to prolong patients' independence.
