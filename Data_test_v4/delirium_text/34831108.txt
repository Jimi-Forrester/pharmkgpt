34831108|t|A Microbiome-Derived Peptide Induces Apoptosis of Cells from Different Tissues.
34831108|a|Apoptosis is a programmed cell death involved in embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis under physiological conditions. However, abnormalities in the process of apoptosis are implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. The human microbiota may release products that induce apoptosis of host cells. We recently identified a novel microbiome-derived peptide called corisin that worsens lung fibrosis by inducing apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. We hypothesized that corisin and a corisin-like peptide might also induce apoptosis of cells from different tissues. We cultured podocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, keratinocytes, retinal and intestinal cells treated with corisin and evaluated apoptosis by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Although at different grades, flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting showed that corisin and a corisin-like peptide induced apoptosis of podocytes, keratinocytes, tubular epithelial cells, retinal, and intestinal cells. In addition, we found that corisin synergistically enhances the proapoptotic activity of transforming growth factor-beta1 on podocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that corisin and corisin-like peptides may play a role in the pathogenesis of disease in different organs by promoting apoptosis of parenchymal cells.
