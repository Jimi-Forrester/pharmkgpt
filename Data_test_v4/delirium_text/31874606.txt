31874606|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline has emerged as a significant threat to both public health and personal welfare, and mild cognitive decline/impairment (MCI) can further develop into Dementia/Alzheimer's disease. While treatment of Dementia/Alzheimer's disease can be expensive and ineffective sometimes, the prevention of MCI by identifying modifiable risk factors is a complementary and effective strategy. RESULTS: In this study, based on the data collected by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the nationwide telephone survey, we apply a data-driven approach to re-exam the previously founded risk factors and discover new risk factors. We found that depression, physical health, cigarette usage, education level, and sleep time play an important role in cognitive decline, which is consistent with the previous discovery. Besides that, the first time, we point out that other factors such as arthritis, pulmonary disease, stroke, asthma, marital status also contribute to MCI risk, which is less exploited previously. We also incorporate some machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh the importance of various factors contributed to MCI and predicted cognitive declined. CONCLUSION: By incorporating the data-driven approach, we can determine that risk factors significantly correlated with diseases. These correlations could also be expanded to another medical diagnosis besides MCI.
