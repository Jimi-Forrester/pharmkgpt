35220489|t|Enhanced recovery from fulminant myocarditis by treatment with the combined use of the Impella left ventricular assist device with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a case series.
35220489|a|BACKGROUND: We experienced two adult cases of fulminant myocarditis with severe cardiogenic shock where Impella left ventricular assist device [left ventricle (LV)-Impella] was concomitantly used with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO). CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man and a 49-year-old man with fulminant myocarditis were transferred to our hospital with mechanical support of V-A ECMO and IABP. Impella 5.0 and Impella CP were implanted 21 h and 17 h after establishing V-A ECMO for each case. Within 1 week, the patients' LV function progressively improved. Then the Impellas were withdrawn after discontinuing V-A ECMO. They were discharged from the intensive care unit within the following 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal introducing timing of LV-Impella is not currently precise. However, this case report suggests that the initiation of LV-Impella within at least 24 h after establishing V-A ECMO may be acceptable for the recovery of cardiac function.
