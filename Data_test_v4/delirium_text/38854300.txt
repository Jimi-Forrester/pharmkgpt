38854300|t|Neuraxial Anesthesia for Combined Left Nephrectomy and Left Hemicolectomy in a One-Lung Patient.
38854300|a|Monopulmonary patients undergoing major abdominal surgery represent a high-risk population. While general anesthesia is typically the standard approach, mechanical ventilation can cause significant complications, particularly in patients with pre-existing lung conditions. Tailored anesthesia strategies are essential to mitigate these risks and preserve respiratory function. We present the case of a 71-year-old female with a history of prior right pneumonectomy for lung cancer. She was scheduled for combined left nephrectomy and left hemicolectomy laparotomic surgery because of extended colon cancer. The patient was prepared according to the local Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol and underwent thoracic neuraxial anesthesia with sedation maintaining spontaneous breathing, so avoiding general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Anesthesia in the surgical field was effective, and no respiratory problems occurred intraoperatively. The patient's rapid recovery and early discharge underscore the success of our "tailored anesthesia strategy." Our experience highlights the feasibility and benefits of tailored anesthesia in monopulmonary patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. By avoiding general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, we mitigated risks and optimized patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of individualized approaches in high-risk surgical populations.
