31092147|t|Brain Injury-Mediated Neuroinflammatory Response and Alzheimer's Disease.
31092147|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health problem in the United States, which affects about 1.7 million people each year. Glial cells, T-cells, and mast cells perform specific protective functions in different regions of the brain for the recovery of cognitive and motor functions after central nervous system (CNS) injuries including TBI. Chronic neuroinflammatory responses resulting in neuronal death and the accompanying stress following brain injury predisposes or accelerates the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in high-risk individuals. About 5.7 million Americans are currently living with AD. Immediately following brain injury, mast cells respond by releasing prestored and preactivated mediators and recruit immune cells to the CNS. Blood-brain barrier (BBB), tight junction and adherens junction proteins, neurovascular and gliovascular microstructural rearrangements, and dysfunction associated with increased trafficking of inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cells from the periphery across the BBB leads to increase in the chronic neuroinflammatory reactions following brain injury. In this review, we advance the hypothesis that neuroinflammatory responses resulting from mast cell activation along with the accompanying risk factors such as age, gender, food habits, emotional status, stress, allergic tendency, chronic inflammatory diseases, and certain drugs can accelerate brain injury-associated neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and AD pathogenesis.
