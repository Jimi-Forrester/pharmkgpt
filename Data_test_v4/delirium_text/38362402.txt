38362402|t|Diagnostic Performance Using a Combination of MRI Findings for Evaluating Cognitive Decline.
38362402|a|Purpose: We investigated potentially promising imaging findings and their combinations in the evaluation of cognitive decline. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 138 patients with subjective cognitive impairments, who underwent brain MRI. We classified the same group of patients into Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD groups, based on the neuropsychiatric evaluation. We analyzed imaging findings, including white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), using the Kruskal-Wallis test for group comparison, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for assessing the diagnostic performance of imaging findings. Results: CMBs in the lobar or deep locations demonstrated higher prevalence in the patients with AD compared to those in the non-AD group. The presence of lobar CMBs combined with periventricular WMH (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.702 [95% confidence interval: 0.599-0.806], p < 0.001) showed the highest performance in differentiation of AD from non-AD group. Conclusion: Combinations of imaging findings can serve as useful additive diagnostic tools in the assessment of cognitive decline.
