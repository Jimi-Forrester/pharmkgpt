33415322|t|Fisher-Rao Regularized Transport Analysis of the Glymphatic System and Waste Drainage.
33415322|a|In this work, a unified representation of all the time-varying dynamics is accomplished with a Lagrangian framework for analyzing Fisher-Rao regularized dynamical optimal mass transport (OMT) derived flows. While formally equivalent to the Eulerian based Schrodinger bridge OMT regularization scheme, the Fisher-Rao approach allows a simple and interpretable methodology for studying the flows of interest in the present work. The advantage of the proposed Lagrangian technique is that the time-varying particle trajectories and attributes are displayed in a single visualization. This provides a natural capability to identify and distinguish flows under different conditions. The Lagrangian analysis applied to the glymphatic system (brain waste removal pathway associated with Alzheimer's Disease) successfully captures known flows and distinguishes between flow patterns under two different anesthetics, providing deeper insights into altered states of waste drainage.
