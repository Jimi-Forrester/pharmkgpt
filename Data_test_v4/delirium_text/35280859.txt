35280859|t|Role of Intensified Lung Physiotherapy Bundle on the Occurrence of Pneumonia After Cardiac Surgery.
35280859|a|Objective: The role of intensified lung physiotherapy bundle after cardiac surgery was investigated. Methods: A before- and after-surgery comparison was conducted between the study from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (control group), when traditional lung physiotherapy bundle was used, and from January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021 (study group), when the intensified bundle was used. The baseline data, clinical features, incidence of postoperative pneumonia, and prognoses of all the enrolled cardiac surgery patients were analyzed. Results: In accordance with the study criteria, 358 patients were enrolled. The incidence rate of postoperative pneumonia was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (14.2 vs. 22.7%, P = 0.037), as was in-hospital mortality (1.5 vs. 5.2%, P = 0.043). Patients receiving the intensified lung physiotherapy bundle had much shorter mechanical ventilation time (92 vs. 144 h, P < 0.0001), much shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay (5 vs. 7 days, P < 0.001), and much shorter hospital stay (17 vs. 18.5 days, P = 0.022). The intensified lung physiotherapy bundle was an independent protective factor enabling the reduced occurrence of pneumonia (P = 0.007). On univariate analysis, this bundle significantly improved in-hospital mortality (P = 0.043). Conclusions: Our intensified lung physiotherapy bundle potentially reduces the rate of postoperative pneumonia after cardiac surgery. This bundle might also be adopted as a suitable reference guide for the prevention of other postoperative pulmonary complications.
