Several promising tau markers, pT181, pT217, and pT231, rely on increased phosphorylation within a common molecular motif threonine-proline-proline (TPP). METHODS: We validated new and existing antibodies against pT217, pT231, pT175, and pT181, then combined immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoassays (ELISA) to broadly examine the phosphorylation of the tau TPP motif in AD brains. RESULTS: The tau burden, as examined by IHC and ELISA, correlates to Braak stages across all TPP sites. Moreover, we observed regional variability across four TPP motif phosphorylation sites in multiple brains of sporadic AD patients. DISCUSSION: We conclude that there is an elevation of TPP tau phosphorylation in AD brains as disease advances. The regional variability of pTPP tau suggests that examining different phosphorylation sites is essential for a comprehensive assessment of tau pathology.
