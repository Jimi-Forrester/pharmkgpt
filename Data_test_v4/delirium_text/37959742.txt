37959742|t|Acid/Base-Triggered Photophysical and Chiroptical Switching in a Series of Helicenoid Compounds.
37959742|a|A series of molecules that possess two quinolines, benzoquinolines, or phenanthrolines connected in a chiral fashion by a biaryl junction along with their water-soluble derivatives was developed and characterized. The influence of the structure on the basicity of the nitrogen atoms in two heterocycles was examined and the photophysical and chiroptical switching activity of the compounds upon protonation was studied both experimentally and computationally. The results demonstrated that changes in the electronic structure of the protonated vs. neutral species, promoting a bathochromic shift of dominant electronic transitions and alternation of their character from pi-to-pi* to charge-transfer-type, when additionally accompanied by the high structural flexibility of a system, leading to changes in conformational preferences upon proton binding, produce particularly pronounced modifications of the spectral properties in acidic medium. The latter combined with reversibility of the read-out make some of the molecules in this series very promising multifunctional pH probes.
