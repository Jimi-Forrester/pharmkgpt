36299874|a|Background: Functional vitamin B12 deficiency is common in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as heart failure and myocardial infarction. Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a specific and sensitive marker of vitamin B12 deficiency. However, there are scarce data in regard to the relationship between MMA and CVDs. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed data of 5,313 adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014. Associations between MMA and other variables were assessed with linear regression models. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to explore the association between MMA and CVDs. Results: The weighted prevalence of CVDs was 8.8% in the general population of the USA. Higher MMA levels were found in participants with CVDs (p < 0.001). Linear regression models revealed positive associations between serum MMA level and age (p < 0.001), glycohemoglobin (p = 0.023), fasting glucose (p = 0.044), mean cell volume (p = 0.038), and hypertension (p = 0.003). In the multivariable logistic model adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, glycohemoglobin, body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), renal dysfunction and vitamin B12, serum MMA (adjusted odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval: 1.63-5.81, p = 0.002, per ln nmol/L increment) was associated with CVDs. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that elevated serum MMA levels were independently associated with the presence of CVDs and may be used to predict the occurrence of CVDs.
