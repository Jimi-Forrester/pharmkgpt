16500279|t|Current status and future promise of pharmacotherapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.
16500279|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is evolving rapidly. Unless new discoveries continue to emerge to facilitate prevention and effective treatment of the disease, the anticipated burden of this disease on caregivers and society at large will overwhelm resources. The objective of this paper is to review the state of development of approaches likely to yield effective interventional measures with regard to AD in the future. DESIGN: A comprehensive systematic search of MEDLINE using focused search criteria, a search of reference lists from these studies and reviews, a review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and a hand search of relevant journals was conducted. Selection of articles was based on the clinical focus. Additional inclusion criteria preferentially selected key articles that contained higher-level evidence in accordance with explicit, validated criteria. RESULTS: Pharmaceutical interventions are being developed and tested that confer neuroprotective benefits by targeting causative mechanisms. CONCLUSION: The paradigm that AD is pharmacologically unresponsive is shifting. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration will soon allow us to more specifically target and interrupt the processes that contribute to this dementia.
