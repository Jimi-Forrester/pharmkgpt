32648472|t|Practicality Assessment of the Improved ICT-Based Dementia Care Mapping Support System.
32648472|a|OBJECTIVES: Authors have developed an ICT (Information-Communication Technology)-based Dementia Care Mapping (DCM ) support system and assessed its usefulness previously using videos. The aim of this study is to evaluate practicality of the improved support system by actual mapping. METHODS: We obtained highly reliable mapping data by a team of 3 mappers (M1, M2, and M3), who mapped 5 elderly people with dementia continuously over 4 hours in 2 sites. M1 mapped by conventional paper-based DCM , while M2 and M3 mapped using the support system. Collected mapping data (n = 8, total of 232.5 hours = 2790 time frames) were compared. RESULTS: The concordance rates between M1 and M2/M3 were over 70%; the required level for DCM  evaluation purposes, with 1 exception. We also obtained users' positive ratings regarding the system usability. CONCLUSION: Practicality of the ICT-based DCM  support system was confirmed for evaluation purposes, demonstrating the system is ready for practical use.
