37861526|a|Few proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have explored chemotherapy-related biochemical changes in brain regions. This observational study aimed to longitudinally assess short-term cognitive changes and brain metabolite concentrations in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. We analyzed 11 women with newly diagnosed stage 1 to 3 breast cancer. Patients were evaluated via objective cognitive testing, and patient self-report tests. Patients were examined using single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the medial frontal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and left thalamus at baseline and after the completion of chemotherapy on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. At the posttreatment evaluation as compared to baseline, 7 of the 10 (70%) patients reported worsening memory on the MD Anderson symptom inventory (annualized change = 1.82 +- 2.88, P = .08), while the delayed recall raw score of the Rey Osterrieth complex figure test did not change from pre- to post-chemotherapy (mean annualized change = 5.00 +- 14.38, P = .30). The annualized change in the creatine concentration in the posterior cingulate gyrus was statistically significant. The annualized change in the MD Anderson symptom inventory was negatively correlated with the annualized change in the medial frontal N-acetylaspartate (Spearman correlation coefficient [rho] = -0.78, P = .01) and positively correlated with the annualized change in the posterior cingulate gyrus creatine (rho = 0.66, P = .04). Annualized changes in the Rey Osterrieth complex figure test were positively correlated with annualized changes in choline (rho = 0.83, P = .01) in the medial frontal cortex, choline (rho = 0.76, P = .04) in the left thalamus, and creatine (rho = 0.73, P = .02) in the medial frontal cortex. Our data suggest that chemotherapy may lead to the worsening of self-reported memory function, which is associated with alterations in brain metabolites.
