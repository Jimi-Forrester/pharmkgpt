24039430|a|BACKGROUND: There have not been any reports in Japan clarifying the efficacy and safety of intramuscular (IM) olanzapine and IM levomepromazine in agitated elderly patients with schizophrenia. This study was a comparative investigation of the clinical efficacy and safety of IM olanzapine and IM levomepromazine in agitated elderly patients with schizophrenia at 2 hours post-dose. METHODS: The subjects were 52 inpatients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV. Their clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC), PANSS, and Agitation Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and their safety was assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), and glucose test. RESULTS: The PANSS-EC total score, the ACES score, and the glucose level significantly decreased from baseline in both the IM olanzapine group and the levomepromazine injection group; however, no between-group differences were observed. Mean change from baseline in the PANSS total score, positive score, the BARS score, and the DIEPSS total score was significantly greater in the IM olanzapine injection group compared with the levomepromazine injection group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that agitated elderly patients rapidly respond to IM olanzapine and IM levomepromazine treatment. Furthermore, these results suggest that IM olanzapine is safer than IM levomepromazine and causes greater improvement in positive symptoms.
