36685294|t|Design, Synthesis, anticancer evaluation and in silico studies of 2,4,6-trimethoxychalcone derivatives.
36685294|a|Chalcone, a common chemical scaffold of many naturally occurring compounds, has been widely used as an effective template for drug discovery due to its broad biological activities. In this study, a series of chalcone derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the hybridization of 1-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)butan-1-one with chalcone. Interestingly, most of the target compounds exhibited inhibitory effect of tumor cells in vitro. Especially, (E)-3-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-1-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (B3) revealed over 10-fold potency than 5-fluorocrail against the Hela and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 3.204 and 3.849 muM respectively. Moreover, B3 displayed low toxicity on normal cells. Further experiments indicated that B3 effectively inhibited the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, and promoted their apoptosis. The calculation and prediction of ADME showed that the target compounds may have good pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. Reverse molecular docking suggested that the possible target of B3 is CDK1. Taken together, these results suggested that B3 appears to be a promising candidate that merits further attention in the development of anticancer drugs.
