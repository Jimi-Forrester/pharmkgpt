32382177|t|Age, preoperative higher serum cortisol levels, and lower serum acetylcholine levels predict delirium after percutaneous coronary intervention in acute coronary syndrome patients accompanied with renal dysfunction.
32382177|a|BACKGROUND: The objective of the study is to investigate the incidence and risk factors of delirium after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients accompanied with renal dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective and cohort study, performed in a medical center from July 2014 to June 2017, which enrolled ACS patients accompanied with renal dysfunction who were treated with PCI. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the incidence and risk factors of delirium. RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 119 patients. The 7-day incidence of delirium after PCI in ACS patients accompanied with renal dysfunction was 15.97% (n = 19/119). The binary logistic regression analysis results indicate that age (odd ratio [OR] 1.463; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.070-2.001; P = 0.017), preoperative higher serum cortisol (COR) (OR 1.025; 95% CI 1.002-1.048; P = 0.030), and lower serum acetylcholine (Ach) (OR 0.965; 95% CI 0.937-0.993; P = 0.016) were significant differences in delirium and nondelirium groups. CONCLUSIONS: Age, preoperative higher serum COR levels, and lower serum Ach levels were independent risk factors for delirium after PCI in ACS patients accompanied with renal dysfunction.
