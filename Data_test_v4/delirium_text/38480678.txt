38480678|t|Adapting prescribing criteria for amyloid-targeted antibodies for adults with Down syndrome.
38480678|a|Prior authorization criteria for Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved immunotherapeutics, among the class of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), established by state drug formulary committees, are tailored for adults with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This overlooks adults with Down syndrome (DS), who often experience dementia at a younger age and with different diagnostic assessment outcomes. This exclusion may deny DS adults access to potential disease-modifying treatments. To address this issue, an international expert panel convened to establish adaptations of prescribing criteria suitable for DS patients and parameters for access to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) registries. The panel proposed mitigating disparities by modifying CMS and payer criteria to account for younger onset age, using alternative language and assessment instruments validated for cognitive decline in the DS population. The panel also recommended enhancing prescribing clinicians' diagnostic capabilities for DS and initiated awareness-raising activities within healthcare organizations. These efforts facilitated discussions with federal officials, aimed at achieving equity in access to anti-amyloid immunotherapeutics, with implications for national authorities worldwide evaluating these and other new disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.
