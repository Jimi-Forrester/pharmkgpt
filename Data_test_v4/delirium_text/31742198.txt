31742198|a|Acquired causes of Fanconi syndrome in adults are usually due to drugs, toxins or paraproteinaemias. Infectious causes are rarely described. We report a case of invasive pneumococcal disease in a patient who developed a Fanconi-like syndrome during the course of her illness. This patient presented with multiple electrolyte derangements consisting predominantly of hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia during hospitalization for invasive pneumococcal disease with possible Austrian syndrome. Further evaluation revealed significant urinary losses of these electrolytes, uric acid and beta2-microglobulin. Together with evidence of hypouricaemia, this is suggestive of proximal renal tubulopathy, and hence a Fanconi-like syndrome. The patient's clinical condition and biochemical anomalies improved following pneumococcus treatment. LEARNING POINTS: Suspect Fanconi syndrome when there are multiple electrolyte derangements consisting of hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia.Recognise the common causes of Fanconi syndrome and appreciate that infections such as legionellosis, leptospirosis and pneumococcal disease can potentially result in Fanconi syndrome.The management of Fanconi syndrome is generally supportive and involves treating the underlying cause.
