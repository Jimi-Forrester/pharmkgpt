31845363|a|Cardiovascular clinicians tend to pay little attention to issues related to cognition, and yet those caring for older adults will encounter a variety of conditions that may lead to cognitive impairment. Most commonly, these include cardiovascular disease-specific conditions such as cerebrovascular disease or heart failure, but may also include neurodegenerative conditions, mood disorders, medication side effects and polypharmacy, and nutritional deficiencies and metabolic derangements among others. This review presents evidence supporting the importance of assessing cognitive status in older adults with cardiovascular disease, and suggests a practical approach to assessment and management of cognitive impairment in this population when it is found. Special attention is paid to the importance of collaboration between cardiovascular and geriatric specialists, and the value it may bring to patients.
