36615626|a|Recent evidences indicate that there is a substantial increase in worldwide cases of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia and may contribute to 60-70% of cases. Quercetin is a unique bioflavonoid that has numerous therapeutic benefits such as anti-allergy, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-cancer, immuno-modulatory, anti-infective, antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, neuroprotective effects, etc. In the present study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of orally administered quercetin with memantine in albino Wistar rats after inducing neurotoxicity through AlCl3 (100 mg/kg, p.o.). Chronic administration of AlCl3 resulted in poor retention of memory and significant oxidative damage. Various behavioral parameters, such as locomotor activity, Morris water maze, elevated plus maze, and passive avoidance test, were assessed on days 21 and 42 of the study. The animals were euthanatized following the completion of the last behavioral assessment. Various oxidative stress parameters were assessed to know the extent of oxidative damage to brain tissue. Quercetin with memantine has shown significant improvement in behavioral studies, inhibition of AChE activity, and reduction in oxidative stress parameters. Histopathological studies assessed for cortex and hippocampus using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and Congo red stain demonstrated a reduction in amyloid-beta plaque formation after treatment of quercetin with memantine. Immunohistochemistry showed that quercetin with memantine treatment also improved the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inhibited amyloid-beta plaque formation. The present study results demonstrated protective effects of treatment of quercetin with memantine in the neurotoxicity linked to aluminum chloride in albino Wistar rats.
