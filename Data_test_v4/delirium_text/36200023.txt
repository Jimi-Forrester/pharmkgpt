36200023|t|A computational protocol for the calculation of the standard reduction potential of iron complexes: application to Fe2+/3+-Abeta model systems relevant to Alzheimer's disease.
36200023|a|Iron complexes play a key role in several biological processes, and they are also related to the development of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. One of the main properties involved in these processes is the standard reduction potential (SRP) of iron complexes. However, the calculation of this property is challenging, mainly due to problems in the electronic structure description, solvent effects and the thermodynamic cycles used for its calculation. In this work, we proposed a computational protocol for the calculation of SRPs of iron complexes by evaluating a wide range of density functionals for the electronic structure description, two implicit solvent models with varying radii and two thermodynamic cycles. Results show that the M06L density functional in combination with the SMD solvation model and the isodesmic method provides good results compared with SRP experimental values for a set of iron complexes. Finally, this protocol was applied to three Fe2+/3+-Abeta model systems involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease and the obtained SRP values are in good agreement with those reported previously by means of MP2 calculations.
