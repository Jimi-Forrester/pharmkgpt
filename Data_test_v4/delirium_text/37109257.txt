37109257|t|Practical Aspects of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Children.
37109257|a|Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) in children is a potentially life-threatening condition that represents a challenge for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. It is defined as bleeding from any location within the upper esophagus to the ligament of Treitz. UGB can have many causes that vary with age. The impact on the child is often proportional to the amount of blood lost. This can range from mild bleeding that is unlikely to cause hemodynamic instability, to massive bleeding that requires admission to the intensive care unit. Proper and prompt management are very important factors in reducing morbidity and mortality. This article aims to summarize current research regarding the diagnosis and treatment of UGB. Most of the data used in the literature published on this subject is extrapolated from adulthood.
