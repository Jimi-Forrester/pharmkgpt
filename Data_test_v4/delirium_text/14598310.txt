14598310|a|In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved within the amyloid-beta domain by alpha-secretase precluding deposition of intact amyloid-beta peptide. The large ectodomain released from the cell surface by the action of alpha-secretase has several neuroprotective properties. Studies with protease inhibitors have shown that alpha-secretase is a zinc metalloproteinase, and several members of the adamalysin family of proteins, tumour necrosis factor-alpha convertase (TACE, ADAM17), ADAM10, and ADAM9, all fulfil some of the criteria required of alpha-secretase. We review the evidence for each of these ADAMs acting as the alpha-secretase. What seems to be emerging from numerous studies, including those with mice in which each of the ADAMs has been knocked out, is that there is a team of zinc metalloproteinases able to cleave APP at the alpha-secretase site. We also discuss how upregulation of alpha-secretase activity by muscarinic agonists, cholesterol-lowering drugs, steroid hormones, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and metal ions may explain some of the therapeutic actions of these agents in Alzheimer's disease.
