8195569|t|Special care units: meeting the needs of cognitively impaired persons.
8195569|a|1. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fourth leading cause of death of older persons. Families frequently turn to nursing homes to provide the care that they are unable to provide during the later stages of the disease. 2. Sloane and Mathew concluded that special care units resulted in better care based on appearance, little difference in weight loss, similar range of services to traditional units, higher amount of interaction with residents more often out of their room, greater mobility, fewer medications, less physical restraint, and similar use of chemical restraints. 3. Alzheimer's disease does not affect an individual only; it affects a family. Effective programming includes the family. From the initial contact with the institution through placement on the special care unit--and often beyond the death of the resident--families are supported by the staff.
