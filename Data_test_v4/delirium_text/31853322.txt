31853322|a|Effects of micro ribonucleic acid (miR)-9 on neuronal apoptosis and expression levels of apoptosis genes B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) in depression model rats, as well as its regulatory mechanism, were investigated. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group (n=10), model group (n=10) and miR-9 inhibitor group (n=10). The rat model of depression was established using the chronic stress method. The learning and memory abilities of rats were detected via water maze test, the neuronal morphology of the brain was detected using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the levels of serum Bcl-2 and Bax were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Moreover, the neuronal apoptosis in the brain was determined through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and the protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1 in brain tissues were measured via western blot analysis. Compared with the control group, the rats in the model group presented significantly decreased learning and memory abilities, poor neuronal morphology of the brain, significantly higher neuronal apoptosis rate in the brain, decreased level of serum Bcl-2, increased level of serum Bax, and significantly decreased protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1 in brain tissues. Compared with the model group, the rats in miR-9 inhibitor group showed obviously improved learning and memory abilities, improved neuronal morphology of the brain, an obviously lower neuronal apoptosis rate in the brain, increased level of serum Bcl-2, decreased level of serum Bax, and obviously increased protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1 in brain tissues. In conclusion, miR-9 inhibitor can promote the neurological function recovery and inhibit the neuronal apoptosis of depression model rats through activating the Notch signaling pathway, suggesting that miR-9 can be an important therapeutic target for depression.
