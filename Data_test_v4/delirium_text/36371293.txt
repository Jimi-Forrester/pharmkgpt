36371293|a|BACKGROUND: Caring for patients with delirium is challenging and overwhelming for intensive care unit (ICU) nurses. Investigating the psychological impact of delirium care on ICU nurses is crucial to maintaining their psychological health and improving the quality of care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the psychological stress of ICU nurses in caring for patients with delirium and potential factors. METHODS: A total of 355 nurses from three tertiary care hospitals in Hunan Province, China, participated in this cross-sectional survey. Data were collected using the demographic sheet, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Occupational Coping Self-Efficacy Scale for Nurses. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with psychological stress. RESULTS: ICU nurses suffered moderate psychological stress related to delirium care. The recent time to care for patients with delirium (P < 0.001), familiarity with delirium-related knowledge (P = 0.002), satisfaction with delirium-related support (P = 0.046), psychological resilience (P < 0.001), and occupational coping self-efficacy (P < 0.001) were significant contributors to psychological stress. CONCLUSION: Nurse managers and researchers need to focus on the psychological well-being of ICU nurses in caring for patients with delirium, especially those who are currently caring for patients with delirium, and provide tailored support, increase their knowledge of delirium, and also boost psychological resilience and coping skills.
