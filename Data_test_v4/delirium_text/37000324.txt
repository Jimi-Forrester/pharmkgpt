37000324|t|NRF2 and STAT3: friends or foes in carcinogenesis?
37000324|a|NRF2 is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis, also through the interaction with several pro-survival pathways. NRF2 controls the transcription of detoxification enzymes and a variety of other molecules impinging in several key biological processes. This perspective will focus on the complex interplay of NRF2 with STAT3, another transcription factor often aberrantly activated in cancer and driving tumorigenesis as well as immune suppression. Both NRF2 and STAT3 can be regulated by ER stress/UPR activation and their cross-talk influences and is influenced by autophagy and cytokines, contributing to shape the microenvironment, and both control the execution of DDR, also by regulating the expression of HSPs. Given the importance of these transcription factors, more investigations aimed at better elucidating the outcome of their networking could help to discover new and more efficacious strategies to fight cancer.
