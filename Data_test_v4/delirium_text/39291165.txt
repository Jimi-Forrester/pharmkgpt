39291165|a|Co-pathologies are common in dementia with Lewy bodies and other dementia disorders. We investigated cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease co-pathologies in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies in comparison with patients with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, mixed dementia, vascular dementia or Parkinson's disease with dementia and cognitively unimpaired participants. We assessed the association of biomarkers of cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease co-pathologies with medial temporal atrophy and global cognitive performance. Additionally, we evaluated whether the findings were specific to dementia with Lewy bodies. We gathered a multi-cohort dataset of 4549 participants (dementia with Lewy bodies = 331, cognitively unimpaired = 1505, mild cognitive impairment = 1489, Alzheimer's disease = 708, mixed dementia = 268, vascular dementia = 148, Parkinson's disease with dementia = 120) from the MemClin Study, Karolinska Imaging in Dementia Study, Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies and the European DLB Consortium. Cerebrovascular co-pathology was assessed with visual ratings of white matter hyperintensities using the Fazekas scale through structural imaging. Alzheimer's disease biomarkers of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau were assessed in the cerebrospinal fluid for a subsample (N = 2191). Medial temporal atrophy was assessed with visual ratings and global cognition with the mini-mental state examination. Differences and associations were assessed through regression models, including interaction terms. In dementia with Lewy bodies, 43% had a high white matter hyperintensity load, which was significantly higher than that in cognitively unimpaired (14%), mild cognitive impairment (26%) and Alzheimer's disease (27%), but lower than that in vascular dementia (62%). In dementia with Lewy bodies, white matter hyperintensities were associated with medial temporal atrophy, and the interaction term showed that this association was stronger than that in cognitively unimpaired and mixed dementia. However, the association between white matter hyperintensities and medial temporal atrophy was non-significant when beta-amyloid was included in the model. Instead, beta-amyloid predicted medial temporal atrophy in dementia with Lewy bodies, in contrast to the findings in mild cognitive impairment where medial temporal atrophy scores were independent of beta-amyloid. Dementia with Lewy bodies had the lowest performance on global cognition, but this was not associated with white matter hyperintensities. In Alzheimer's disease, global cognitive performance was lower in patients with more white matter hyperintensities. We conclude that white matter hyperintensities are common in dementia with Lewy bodies and are associated with more atrophy in medial temporal lobes, but this association depended on beta-amyloid-related pathology in our cohort. The associations between biomarkers were overall stronger in dementia with Lewy bodies than in some of the other diagnostic groups.
