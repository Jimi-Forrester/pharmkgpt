39445302|t|Incidence of Delirium in ICU Patients With and Without COVID-19 in a Costa Rican Hospital.
39445302|a|INTRODUCTION:  Delirium is a common and serious neurological complication in intensive care units (ICUs), often leading to poor patient outcomes and increased mortality. This study aimed to compare the incidence of delirium in ICU patients with COVID-19 to those with other respiratory infections in a private hospital in Costa Rica. Additionally, it evaluated the prevalence, severity, duration, and treatment of delirium in these critically ill patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted, analyzing multiple variables obtained from the electronic health records of patients hospitalized in the ICU of Hospital Clinica Biblica. The study included patients admitted between January 2020 and December 2023. It compared the incidence of delirium among patients admitted for COVID-19 and those admitted for other diagnoses. The main outcomes measured were the incidence of delirium and the correlation of its management with international guidelines. The measures included the use of mechanical ventilation, the development of delirium, and the use of sedatives. RESULTS: A total of 137 patients were analyzed, of whom 57.7% were over 70 years old, 67.2% were men, 45.2% were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 90.5% used mechanical ventilation, and 49.6% of patients developed delirium. Dexmedetomidine was the most used sedative, which was the only one that showed a significant relationship with the development of delirium (p=0.0002). Delirium management was mainly done through the administration of dexmedetomidine (52.9%) and quetiapine (41.2%). There was no correlation between delirium development and mortality (p=0.2670). CONCLUSION: The study results do not show a significant relationship between COVID-19-positive patients and the development of delirium. Similarly, no higher mortality was observed in those patients who experienced delirium during their ICU stay.
