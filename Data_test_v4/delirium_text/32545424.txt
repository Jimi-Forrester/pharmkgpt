32545424|t|Iron and Chelation in Biochemistry and Medicine: New Approaches to Controlling Iron Metabolism and Treating Related Diseases.
32545424|a|Iron is essential for all living organisms. Many iron-containing proteins and metabolic pathways play a key role in almost all cellular and physiological functions. The diversity of the activity and function of iron and its associated pathologies is based on bond formation with adjacent ligands and the overall structure of the iron complex in proteins or with other biomolecules. The control of the metabolic pathways of iron absorption, utilization, recycling and excretion by iron-containing proteins ensures normal biologic and physiological activity. Abnormalities in iron-containing proteins, iron metabolic pathways and also other associated processes can lead to an array of diseases. These include iron deficiency, which affects more than a quarter of the world's population; hemoglobinopathies, which are the most common of the genetic disorders and idiopathic hemochromatosis. Iron is the most common catalyst of free radical production and oxidative stress which are implicated in tissue damage in most pathologic conditions, cancer initiation and progression, neurodegeneration and many other diseases. The interaction of iron and iron-containing proteins with dietary and xenobiotic molecules, including drugs, may affect iron metabolic and disease processes. Deferiprone, deferoxamine, deferasirox and other chelating drugs can offer therapeutic solutions for most diseases associated with iron metabolism including iron overload and deficiency, neurodegeneration and cancer, the detoxification of xenobiotic metals and most diseases associated with free radical pathology.
