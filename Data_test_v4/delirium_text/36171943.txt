36171943|t|Effect of caudally administered clonidine on sevoflurane induced emergence agitation-A randomized trial.
36171943|a|Background and Aims: Emergence agitation (EA) is an unpleasant problem encountered in children following anesthesia with Sevoflurane. We studied the effectiveness of caudal epidural block (CEB) with ropivacaine 0.2% and clonidine two microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg) on the incidence of EA, with respiratory depression and hemodynamic variables as secondary end points. Material and Methods: Ninety children aged one to eight years undergoing infra umbilical surgeries were randomly allocated into two groups. Group RS: Ropivacaine 0.2% one ml/kg + . Saline one ml and Group RC: Ropivacaine 0.2% one ml/kg + Clonidine two mcg/kg made to one ml. They were then administered general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation followed by CEB using test drugs. Post surgery, EA was evaluated by Modified Richmond Agitation Scale at 15-minute intervals for one hour. The results were then analyzed using mean and standard deviation (SD), Chi square test, and Independent t test. Results: EA was significantly lower in group RC when compared to group RS (P < 0.0001). Group RC had 12 (28.5%) children with EA at 15 minutes compared to 35 (83.3%) children in Group RS. At 30 minutes, it was seen in five (11.3%) and 27 (64.2%) children in group RC and RS, respectively. No significant respiratory depression was noted in both groups. A significant decrease in heart rate was seen in Group RC (P < 0.001) but was not significant clinically. No adverse events were recorded in both the groups. Conclusion: Addition of clonidine (2mcg/kg) to ropivacaine 0.2% offers an advantage over 0.2% ropivacaine alone in decreasing the incidence of sevoflurane induced EA in children undergoing lower abdominal surgery without any adverse effects.
