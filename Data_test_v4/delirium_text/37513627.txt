37513627|t|Alpha Lipoic Acid Efficacy in PCOS Treatment: What Is the Truth?
37513627|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is among the most common female endocrinopathies, affecting about 4-25% of women of reproductive age. Women affected by PCOS have an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and endometrial cancer. Given the pivotal role of insulin resistance (IR) in the pathogenesis of PCOS, in the last years, many insulin-sensitizing factors have been proposed for PCOS treatment. The first insulin sensitizer recommended by evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and treatment of PCOS was metformin, but the burden of side effects is responsible for treatment discontinuation in many patients. Inositols have insulin-mimetic properties and contribute to decreasing postprandial blood glucose, acting by different pathways. ALA is a natural amphipathic compound with a very strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect and a very noteworthy role in the improvement of insulin metabolic pathway. Given the multiple effects of ALA, a therapeutic strategy based on the synergy between inositols and ALA has been recently proposed by many groups with the aim of improving insulin resistance, reducing androgen levels, and ameliorating reproductive outcomes in PCOS patients. The purpose of this study is to review the existing literature and to evaluate the existing data showing the efficacy and the limitation of a treatment strategy based on this promising molecule. ALA is a valid therapeutic strategy applicable in the treatment of PCOS patients: Its multiple actions, including antinflammatory, antioxidant, and insulin-sensitizing, may be of utmost importance in the treatment of a very complex syndrome. Specifically, the combination of MYO plus ALA creates a synergistic effect that improves insulin resistance in PCOS patients, especially in obese/overweight patients with T2DM familiarity. Moreover, ALA treatment also exerts beneficial effects on endocrine patterns, especially if combined with MYO, improving menstrual regularity and ovulation rhythm. The purpose of our study is to review the existing literature and to evaluate the data showing the efficacy and the limitations of a treatment strategy based on this promising molecule.
