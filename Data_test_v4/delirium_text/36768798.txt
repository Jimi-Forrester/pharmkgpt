36768798|t|The Interplay between alpha-Synuclein and Microglia in alpha-Synucleinopathies.
36768798|a|Synucleinopathies are a set of devastating neurodegenerative diseases that share a pathologic accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). This accumulation causes neuronal death resulting in irreversible dementia, deteriorating motor symptoms, and devastating cognitive decline. While the etiology of these conditions remains largely unknown, microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have been consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies. Microglia are generally believed to be neuroprotective in the early stages of alpha-syn accumulation and contribute to further neurodegeneration in chronic disease states. While the molecular mechanisms by which microglia achieve this role are still being investigated, here we highlight the major findings to date. In this review, we describe how structural varieties of inherently disordered alpha-syn result in varied microglial receptor-mediated interactions. We also summarize which microglial receptors enable cellular recognition and uptake of alpha-syn. Lastly, we review the downstream effects of alpha-syn processing within microglia, including spread to other brain regions resulting in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in chronic disease states. Understanding the mechanism of microglial interactions with alpha-syn is vital to conceptualizing molecular targets for novel therapeutic interventions. In addition, given the significant diversity in the pathophysiology of synucleinopathies, such molecular interactions are vital in gauging all potential pathways of neurodegeneration in the disease state.
