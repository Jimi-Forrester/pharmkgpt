35968501|a|Objective: To investigate the clinical value of sufentanil combined with propofol for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) in radical mastectomy. Methods: The data of 120 patients undergoing radical mastectomy of breast cancer in our hospital from February 2020 to February 2021 were retrospectively analyzed, and they were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EXG) (n = 60) and the control group (COG) (n = 60). The anesthesia maintenance scheme was 0.01-0.03 mug/(kg min) of sufentanil + 80-100 mug/(kg min) of propofol in EXG and 3 mug/(kg h) of fentanyl + 80-100 mug/(kg min) of propofol in COG. The hemodynamic indices, stress indexes, postoperative pain scores, and incidence of adverse reactions were compared between EXG and COG. Results: The heart rates (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) after tracheal intubation (T2) and at separation of deep tissues (T3), tracheal extubation (T4), and the end of surgery (T5) were markedly lower in EXG than in COG (P < 0.001). The stress indexes and postoperative pain scores at 1 h (T6), 6 h (T7), and 12 h (T8) after surgery were lower in EXG than in COG (P < 0.001). The incidence of dizziness, headache, pruritus, and emergence agitation in EXG was lower compared with that in COG (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Sufentanil combined with propofol for TIVA can stabilize intraoperative hemodynamic indices of patients undergoing radical mastectomy, alleviate perioperative stress response, and reduce pain perception. Therefore, this anesthesia method is safe and merits clinical promotion.
