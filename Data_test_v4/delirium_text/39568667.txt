39568667|t|The potential role of CGRP in synuclein-associated neurodegenerative disorders.
39568667|a|In this hypothesis article, the potential clinicopathological associations of Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) with the development of synuclein-associated neurodegenerative disorders (SAND) are discussed. The presence of alpha-syn and CGRP in the CNS and the ENS and the intricate role of CGRP and its related pathways in inflammation, apoptosis, metabolism, neuromodulation, and brain-gut communication are analyzed. Since this hypothesis is confirmed, modulating CGRP-potential related pathways may lead to novel disease-modifying therapies.
