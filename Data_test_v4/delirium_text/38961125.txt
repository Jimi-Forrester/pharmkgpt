38961125|a|Epileptogenesis is the process by which a normal brain becomes hyperexcitable and capable of generating spontaneous recurrent seizures. The extensive dysregulation of gene expression associated with epileptogenesis is shaped, in part, by microRNAs (miRNAs) - short, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate protein levels. Functional miRNA-mediated regulation can, however, be difficult to elucidate due to the complexity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. Here, we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiles sampled over multiple time-points during and after epileptogenesis in rats, and applied bi-clustering and Bayesian modelling to construct temporal miRNA-mRNA-mRNA interaction networks. Network analysis and enrichment of network inference with sequence- and human disease-specific information identified key regulatory miRNAs with the strongest influence on the mRNA landscape, and miRNA-mRNA interactions closely associated with epileptogenesis and subsequent epilepsy. Our findings underscore the complexity of miRNA-mRNA regulation, can be used to prioritise miRNA targets in specific systems, and offer insights into key regulatory processes in epileptogenesis with therapeutic potential for further investigation.
