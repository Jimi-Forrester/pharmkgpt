36118773|a|Experimental evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a key pathological event of many diseases affecting the nervous system. It has been well recognized that these devastating illnesses (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, depression, and chronic pain) are multifactorial, involving many pathogenic mechanisms, reason why pharmacological treatments are unsatisfactory. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a vegetal mixture capable of offering a multiple approach required to manage the multifactoriality of neuroinflammation. A mixture composed of Zingiber officinale (150 mg kg-1), Echinacea purpurea (20 mg kg-1), and Centella asiatica (200 mg kg-1) was tested in a mouse model of systemic neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg kg-1). Repeated treatment with the vegetal mixture was able to completely counteract thermal and mechanical allodynia as reported by the Cold plate and von Frey tests, respectively, and to reduce the motor impairments as demonstrated by the Rota rod test. Moreover, the mixture was capable of neutralizing the memory loss in the Passive avoidance test and reducing depressive-like behavior in the Porsolt test, while no efficacy was shown in decreasing anhedonia as demonstrated by the Sucrose preference test. Finally, LPS stimulation caused a significant increase in the activation of glial cells, of the central complement proteins and of inflammatory cytokines in selected regions of the central nervous system (CNS), which were rebalanced in animals treated with the vegetal mixture. In conclusion, the vegetal mixture tested thwarted the plethora of symptoms evoked by LPS, thus being a potential candidate for future investigations in the context of neuroinflammation.
