38639893|a|INTRODUCTION: Alterations in metabolic status, body composition, and food intake are present in all neurodegenerative diseases. Aim of this study was to detect the progression of these changes in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 15 patients with PSP. The assessments were performed at baseline (T0) and after 7(IQR = 5) months of follow-up (T1). We collected anthropometric measures including body weight, height, body mass index and waist circumference, metabolic parameters through indirect calorimeters, body composition using bioimpedance analysis, and dietary habits with a validated questionnaire. PSP-rating scale (PSP-rs) was used to evaluate disease severity and dysphagia. RESULTS: The majority of patients (66.66%) presented PSP-Richardson Syndrome and 33.33% the other variant syndromes of the disease. At T1 there was a decrease in intake of total daily calories (p < 0.001), proteins (p < 0.001), fibers (p = 0.001), calcium (p = 0.008), iron (p < 0.001), zinc (0.034), vitamin E (p = 0.006) and folates (p = 0.038) compared to T0. No other changes were found. As for T1 data, no significant differences were shown according to disease phenotypes or the presence of clinically significant dysphagia for solids. CONCLUSIONS: Within a mid-term follow up, PSP patients presented reduced caloric and proteins intake regardless the presence of dysphagia. The PSP-rs is likely not adequate to assess dysphagia, which should be investigated by specific clinical scales or instrumental examinations. With the goal of maintaining adequate nutritional status, the administration of protein and vitamin supplements should be considered even in the absence of dysphagia evidenced by the rating scales.
