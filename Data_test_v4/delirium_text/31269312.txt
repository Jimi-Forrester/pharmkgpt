31269312|t|Neurological outcomes after on-pump vs off-pump CABG in patients with cerebrovascular disease.
31269312|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The possible association of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with reduced risk of postoperative stroke and enhanced benefits in high-risk patients support the hypothesis that patients with a positive history of cerebrovascular disease would benefit from off-pump coronary surgery. This study aims to investigate the impact of off-pump CABG on the incidence of postoperative neurologic events in patients with a previous history of cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: From January 2015 to September 2018, 414 patients underwent isolated CABG with a previous history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke: 295 patients had on-pump CABG and 119 patients had off-pump CABG. Neurological outcomes of interest are postoperative stroke (transient or permanent), delirium requiring pharmacological treatment or a combination of both, collectively defined "Major Adverse Neurological Events" (MANE). Propensity score (PS) adjusted analysis has been used for regression models. RESULTS: Off-pump CABG carried a lower incidence of postoperative stroke (3.4% vs 9.8%, P = .046, PS-adjusted odds ratio 0.34 with P = .044). Postoperative delirium occurred more than twice as often in the on-pump group (11.5% vs 4.2%, P = .034, PS-adjusted odds ratio 2.78 with P = .043). The composite outcome of MANE occurred in 20.3% in the on-pump group, and in 7.6% in the off-pump group (P = .003). Other complications were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a previous TIA or stroke, off-pump CABG is associated with a reduced risk of stroke, delirium, and postoperative adverse neurological events, compared to on-pump CABG. Patients with high neurological risk can potentially benefit from off-pump CABG, due to an overall reduction of postoperative neurological complications.
