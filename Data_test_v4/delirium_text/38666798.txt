38666798|t|Symptom-based staging for logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia.
38666798|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) is a major variant presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that signals the importance of communication dysfunction across AD phenotypes. A clinical staging system is lacking for the evolution of AD-associated communication difficulties that could guide diagnosis and care planning. Our aim was to create a symptom-based staging scheme for lvPPA, identifying functional milestones relevant to the broader AD spectrum. METHODS: An international lvPPA caregiver cohort was surveyed on symptom development under an 'exploratory' survey (34 UK caregivers). Feedback from this survey informed the development of a 'consolidation' survey (27 UK, 10 Australian caregivers) in which caregivers were presented with six provisional clinical stages and feedback was analysed using a mixed-methods approach. RESULTS: Six clinical stages were endorsed. Early symptoms included word-finding difficulty, with loss of message comprehension and speech intelligibility signalling later-stage progression. Additionally, problems with hearing in noise, memory and route-finding were prominent early non-verbal symptoms. 'Milestone' symptoms were identified that anticipate daily-life functional transitions and care needs. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a new symptom-based staging scheme for lvPPA, and highlights milestone symptoms that could inform future clinical scales for anticipating and managing communication dysfunction across the AD spectrum.
