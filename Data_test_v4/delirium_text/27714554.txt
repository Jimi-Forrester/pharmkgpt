27714554|t|Intrinsic functional connectivity alterations in cognitively intact elderly APOE epsilon4 carriers measured by eigenvector centrality mapping are related to cognition and CSF biomarkers: a preliminary study.
27714554|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the best established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is a need to understand the effects of this genotype on the brain by simultaneously assessing intrinsic brain network and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers changes in healthy older epsilon4 carriers. Thirteen cognitively intact, elderly APOE epsilon4 carriers and 22 epsilon3 homozygotes were included in the present study. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) was used to identify brain network hub organization based on resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). We evaluated comprehensive cognitive ability and tested levels of Abeta1-42, total-tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau181) in CSF. Comparisons of ECM between two groups were conducted, followed by correlations analyses between EC values with significant group differences and cognitive ability/CSF biomarkers. APOE epsilon4 carriers showed significantly decreased EC values in left medial temporal lobe (MTL), left lingual gyrus (LG) and increased EC values in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) as compared to non-carriers. Correlation analysis demonstrated that left LG EC value correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test total learning (RAVLT, r = 0.57, p < 0.05) and t-tau level (r = -0.57, p < 0.05), while left MFG EC values correlated with log-transformed Trail-Making Test B (TMT-B, r = -0.67, p < 0.05) in APOE epsilon4 carriers. This study suggests the APOE epsilon4 allele contributes to disruption of brain connectedness in certain functional nodes, which may result from neuronal death caused by toxicity of neurofibrillary tangles.
