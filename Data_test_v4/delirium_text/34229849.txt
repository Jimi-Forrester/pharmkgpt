34229849|a|Amyloid plaques generated from the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) fibrils in the brain is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a most common neurodegenerative disorder. Abeta aggregation can produce neurotoxic oligomers and fibrils, which has been widely accepted as the causative factor in AD pathogenesis. Accordingly, both soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils have been considered as diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Among the existing analytical methods, fluorometry using fluorescent probes has exhibited promising potential in quantitative detection and imaging of both soluble and insoluble Abeta species, providing a valuable approach for the diagnosis and drug development of AD. In this review, the most recent advances in the fluorescent probes for soluble or insoluble Abeta aggregates are discussed in terms of design strategy, probing mechanism, and potential applications. In the end, future research directions of fluorescent probes for Abeta species are also proposed.
