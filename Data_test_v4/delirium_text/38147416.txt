38147416|t|A novel neuroimaging signature for ADRD risk stratification in the community.
38147416|a|INTRODUCTION: Early risk stratification for clinical dementia could lead to preventive therapies. We identified and validated a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signature for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ARDR). METHODS: An MRI ADRD signature was derived from cortical thickness maps in Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants with AD dementia and matched controls. The signature was related to the risk of ADRD and cognitive function in FHS. Results were replicated in the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (UCD-ADRC) cohort. RESULTS: Participants in the bottom quartile of the signature had more than three times increased risk for ADRD compared to those in the upper three quartiles (P < 0.001). Greater thickness in the signature was related to better general cognition (P < 0.01) and episodic memory (P = 0.01). Results replicated in UCD-ADRC. DISCUSSION: We identified a robust neuroimaging biomarker for persons at increased risk of ADRD. Other cohorts will further test the validity of this biomarker.
