28839416|t|Effect of Nonsurgical Periodontal Therapy on Serum Highly Sensitive Capsule Reactive Protein and Homocysteine Levels in Chronic Periodontitis: A Pilot Study.
28839416|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on circulating serum high-sensitivity capsule reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine (Hcy) levels in patients with chronic periodontitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved fifty participants. The test group included 25 systemically healthy controls (mean age 38.44 +- 3.27 years) with severe chronic periodontitis and the control group (n = 25) included age- and sex-matched systemically and periodontally healthy controls. Clinical parameters were recorded, intraoral periapical radiographs were taken, hematological tests and assessment of serum hs-CRP levels and Hcy levels were performed at baseline and 3 months after completion of nonsurgical periodontal therapy. RESULTS: Mean serum hs-CRP and Hcy concentration in patients with chronic periodontitis were 3.37 +- 0.54 mg/L and 21.47 +- 7.93 mumol/L, respectively, and was significantly higher than the controls (1.68 +- 0.71 mg/L and 13.93 +- 8.30 mumol/L, respectively) (P < 0.05). Posttreatment, the mean serum hs-CRP and Hcy concentration reduced significantly in both test and control groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Chronic periodontitis leads to an increase in circulating levels of hs-CRP and Hcy in plasma and nonsurgical periodontal therapy decreases periodontal inflammation, which in turn reduces systemic inflammation and consequently decreases serum levels of hs-CRP and Hcy.
