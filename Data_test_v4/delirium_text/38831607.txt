38831607|a|The composition of the human gut microbiome has been observed to change over the course of an individual's life. From birth, it is shaped by mode of delivery, diet, environmental exposures, geographic location, exposures to medications, and by aging itself. Here, we present a narrative review of the gut microbiome across the lifespan with a focus on its impacts on aging and age-related diseases in humans. We will describe how it is shaped, and features of the gut microbiome that have been associated with diseases at different phases of life and how this can adversely affect healthy aging. Across the lifespan, and especially in old age, a diverse microbiome that includes organisms suspected to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, has been reported to be associated with healthy aging. These findings have been remarkably consistent across geographic regions of the world suggesting that they could be universal features of healthy aging across all cultures and genetic backgrounds. Exactly how these features of the microbiome affect biologic processes associated with aging thus promoting healthy aging will be crucial to targeting the gut microbiome for interventions that will support health and longevity.
