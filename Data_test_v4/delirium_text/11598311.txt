11598311|a|Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is the most common form of cortical dementia occurring in the presenium after Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed two types of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and semantic dementia (SD) selected from a consecutive series of outpatients based on neuropsychological symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and abnormal behavior. In our series of 134 patients with primary degenerative dementia, there were 16 cases of FTD and 6 cases of SD. Patients with subgroups of FTD and patients with SD were distinguishable only by the presence of aphasia in the latter group. They were not distinguishable from one another by other neuropsychological examinations, behavioral abnormalities or psychiatric symptoms assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory.
