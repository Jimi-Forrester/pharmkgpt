30505429|a|This article summarizes the seminal publications from mid-2016 through 2017 in the area of medical care for older adults with cancer. Areas addressed include chemotherapy tolerance and efficacy in the aged, geriatric fitness assessments, and advancements in palliative and supportive care. The practice-changing finding from this past year's publications is that antipsychotics should not be used in the management of terminal delirium in older adults receiving palliative care. The other trials demonstrated an improved understanding of the utility of geriatric assessments in patients with cancer, developed the body of information about which chemotherapy agents are safe and effective in older adults (and which are not), and expanded our understanding of good palliative and supportive care.
