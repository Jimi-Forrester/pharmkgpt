39433157|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one kind of devasting neurodegenerative disorders affecting over 50 million people worldwide. Multi-targeted therapy has emerged as a new treatment for diagnosing and alleviating the pathogenesis process of AD; however, the current strategy is limited by its unsatisfactory efficiency. In our study, engineered activated neutrophil-derived exosomes (MP@Cur-MExo) were developed to improve the mitochondrial function in neurons by targeting and alleviating Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. MP@Cur-MExo are exosomes derived from IL-8-stimulated neutrophils decorated with mitochondria targeting ligand and Abeta targeted ligand modified SPION. Engineered exosomes can be cleaved by matrix metallopeptidase-2, which is overexpressed in the AD brain. Consequently, the released SPION and Curcumin-loaded engineered exosomes collaboratively protected neuron cells against Abeta-induced mitochondrial deficiency. In addition, MP@Cur-MExo effectively accumulated in the inflamed region of AD brain at an early stage, allowing early diagnosis of AD through bimodal (MRI/IVIS) imaging. Importantly, in a mouse model at an early stage of AD, intravenously injected MP@Cur-MExo restored mitochondrial function and reduced Abeta-induced mitochondrial damage, thereby attenuating AD progression. In conclusion, our designed engineered exosomes demonstrated that omnidirectional improvement of mitochondrial function can serve as a novel and practical approach for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This study also reveals a promising therapeutic agent for impeding AD progression for future clinical applications.
