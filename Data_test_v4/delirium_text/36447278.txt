36447278|t|A comprehensive understanding of ambient particulate matter and its components on the adverse health effects based from epidemiological and laboratory evidence.
36447278|a|The impacts of air pollution on public health have become a great concern worldwide. Ambient particulate matter (PM) is a major air pollution that comprises a heterogeneous mixture of different particle sizes and chemical components. The chemical composition and physicochemical properties of PM change with space and time, which may cause different impairments. However, the mechanisms of the adverse effects of PM on various systems have not been fully elucidated and systematically integrated. The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework was used to comprehensively illustrate the molecular mechanism of adverse effects of PM and its components, so as to clarify the causal mechanistic relationships of PM-triggered toxicity on various systems. The main conclusions and new insights of the correlation between public health and PM were discussed, especially at low concentrations, which points out the direction for further research in the future. With the deepening of the study on its toxicity mechanism, it was found that PM can still induce adverse health effects with low-dose exposure. And the recommended Air Quality Guideline level of PM2.5 was adjusted to 5 mug/m3 by World Health Organization, which meant that deeper and more complex mechanisms needed to be explored. Traditionally, oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis were considered the main mechanisms of harmful effects of PM. However, recent studies have identified several emerging mechanisms involved in the toxicity of PM, including pyroptosis, ferroptosis and epigenetic modifications. This review summarized the comprehensive evidence on the health effects of PM and the chemical components of it, as well as the combined toxicity of PM with other air pollutants. Based on the AOP Wiki and the mechanisms of PM-induced toxicity at different levels, we first constructed the PM-related AOP frameworks on various systems.
