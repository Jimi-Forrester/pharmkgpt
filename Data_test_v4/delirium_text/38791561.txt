38791561|a|This work aimed to study the effect of repeated exposure to low doses of ozone on alpha-synuclein and the inflammatory response in the substantia nigra, jejunum, and colon. Seventy-two male Wistar rats were divided into six groups. Each group received one of the following treatments: The control group was exposed to air. The ozone groups were exposed for 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days for 0.25 ppm for four hours daily. Afterward, they were anesthetized, and their tissues were extracted and processed using Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR. The results indicated a significant increase in alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra and jejunum from 7 to 60 days of exposure and an increase in NFkappaB from 7 to 90 days in the substantia nigra, while in the jejunum, a significant increase was observed at 7 and 15 days and a decrease at 60 and 90 days for the colon. Interleukin IL-17 showed an increase at 90 days in the substantia nigra in the jejunum and increases at 30 days and in the colon at 15 and 90 days. Exposure to ozone increases the presence of alpha-synuclein and induces the loss of regulation of the inflammatory response, which contributes significantly to degenerative processes.
