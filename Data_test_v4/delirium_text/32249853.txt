32249853|a|BACKGROUND: Although ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, have been associated with olfaction impairment, studies exploring how to ameliorate this impairment are limited. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of various types of physical exercise on olfaction decline in ageing. METHODOLOGY: 99 healthy community-dwelling participants (85 women; mean (SD) age, 62.5 (5.7) years) were included. All the participants were required to complete the tests consisting of a questionnaire, cognitive test and olfaction test. RESULTS: Odor identification scores for participants who exercised regularly for more than 1 year (more than 3 times/wk; more than 30 min each time) were significantly higher than those for non-exercisers, and odor detection threshold scores were significantly higher in the exercisers. Both odor threshold and odor identification scores for those who exercised by practicing taiji (tai chi), dancing, or running were significantly better than those for participants who exercised by walking or who did not exercise. CONCLUSION: Compared with those among older people who did not exercise, measures of olfaction among older adults who exercised were better, and the type of physical exercise mattered. Therefore, if physical exercise intervention is suggested to prevent or delay olfactory deterioration in older adults, the type of physical exercise should be considered.
