36388176|t|The mobile sleep medicine model in neurologic practice: Rationale and application.
36388176|a|Background: Undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in neurological practice and significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality. OSA is prevalent in US adults and causes poor quality sleep and significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular impairments. Timely treatment of OSA reduces cardio-cerebrovascular risks and improves quality of life. However, most of the US population has limited systematic access to sleep medicine care despite its clinical significance. Focus: We discuss the importance of systematic screening, testing, and best-practice management of OSA and hypoventilation/hypoxemia syndromes (HHS) in patients with stroke, neurocognitive impairment, and neuromuscular conditions. This review aims to introduce and describe a novel integrated Mobile Sleep Medicine (iMSM) care model and provide the rationale for using an iMSM in general neurological practice to assist with systematic screening, testing and best-practice management of OSA, HHS, and potentially other sleep conditions. Key points: The iMSM is an innovative, patient-centered, clinical outcome-based program that uses a Mobile Sleep Medicine Unit-a "sleep lab on wheels"-designed to improve access to OSA management and sleep care at all levels of health care system. The protocol for the iMSM care model includes three levels of operations to provide effective and efficient OSA screening, timely testing/treatment plans, and coordination of further sleep medicine care follow-up. The iMSM care model prioritizes effective, efficient, and patient-centered sleep medicine care; therefore, all parties and segments of care that receive and provide clinical sleep medicine services may benefit from adopting this innovative approach.
