12214033|a|Excess iron accumulation in the brain is a consistent observation in Alzheimer's Disease. Iron affects amyloid precursor protein (AbetaPP) processing and promotes deposition of Abeta. Iron is also among the most potent biological toxins because of its ability to react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species. Consequently, elucidation of the mechanisms associated with maintaining brain iron homeostasis is fundamentally important to understanding the underlying pathogenesis in AD. The iron overload disorder, Hemochromatosis, is the most common genetic disorder (1:200) so a significant percentage of AD patients can be expected to carry this mutation. Heterozygotes for this mutation also have an increased, but sub-clinical iron burden. Given the high percentage of the population who are at significant risk for iron overload, we propose that the hemochromatosis mutation be considered as a confounding factor when evaluating the contribution of genetic associations with AD and treatment strategies and efficacy. Two recent papers and new evidence presented here that the protein associated with hemochromatosis is expressed on blood vessels, choroid plexus and the ependymal cells in the brain are offered as support for this proposal.
