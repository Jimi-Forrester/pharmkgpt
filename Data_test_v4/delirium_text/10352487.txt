10352487|t|Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
10352487|a|For the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, both b-protein immunoreactivity and hyperphosphorylated t-protein immunoreactivity have to be found in the neocortex. The former is age-related, and the latter occurs in several neurodegenerative diseases. The cooccurrence of these lesions in the neocortex of Alzheimer patients is likely the result of the abnormal vulnerability of selected nerve cell populations to b-protein.
