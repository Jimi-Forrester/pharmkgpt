37301377|a|Spontaneous deamidation of asparaginyl residues in proteins, if not repaired or cleared, can set in motion a cascade that leads to deteriorated health. Previously, we have discovered that deamidated human serum albumin (HSA) is elevated in blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, while the level of endogenous antibodies against deamidated HSA is significantly diminished, creating an imbalance between the risk factor and the defense against it. Endogenous antibodies against deamidated proteins are still unexplored. In the current study, we employed the SpotLight proteomics approach to identify novel amino acid sequences in antibodies specific to deamidated HSA. The results provide new insights into the clearance mechanism of deamidated proteins, a possible avenue for prevention of neurodegeneration.
