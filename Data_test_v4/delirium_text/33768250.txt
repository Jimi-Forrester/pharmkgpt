33768250|a|Chronic short sleep (CSS) is prevalent in modern societies and has been proposed as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In support, short-term sleep loss acutely increases levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau in wild type (WT) mice and humans, and sleep disturbances predict cognitive decline in older adults. We have shown that CSS induces injury to and loss of locus coeruleus neurons (LCn), neurons with heightened susceptibility in AD. Yet whether CSS during young adulthood drives lasting Abeta and/or tau changes and/or neural injury later in life in the absence of genetic risk for AD has not been established. Here, we examined the impact of CSS exposure in young adult WT mice on late-in-life Abeta and tau changes and neural responses in two AD-vulnerable neuronal groups, LCn and hippocampal CA1 neurons. Twelve months following CSS exposure, CSS-exposed mice evidenced reductions in CA1 neuron counts and volume, spatial memory deficits, CA1 glial activation, and loss of LCn. Abeta 42 and hyperphosphorylated tau were increased in the CA1; however, amyloid plaques and tau tangles were not observed. Collectively the findings demonstrate that CSS exposure in the young adult mouse imparts late-in-life neurodegeneration and persistent derangements in amyloid and tau homeostasis. These findings occur in the absence of a genetic predisposition to neurodegeneration and demonstrate for the first time that CSS can induce lasting, significant neural injury consistent with some, but not all, features of late-onset AD.
