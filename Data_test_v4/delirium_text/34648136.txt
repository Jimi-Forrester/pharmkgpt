34648136|t|Pancreaticobiliary Malignancies in the Emergency Room: Management of Acute Complications and Oncological Emergencies.
34648136|a|BACKGROUND: Management of pancreaticobiliary (PB) malignancies remains a clinical challenge. In this review, we focus on the management of oncological emergencies in PB malignancies and the potential complication of associated therapeutic interventions. METHODS: Biobliographic review of current evidence on the management of oncological emergencies, their potential complications, as well as synthesis of recommendations was performed. The pathogenesis, frequency, related symptoms as well as appropriate investigations are presented. RESULTS: The oncologic emergencies in PB patients were summarised in six categories: (1) hematological (including febrile neutropaenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathies), (2) gastrointestinal (gastric outlet and biliary obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding), (3) thromboembolic events, (4) ascites, (5) metabolic disorders and (6) neurologic complications. The pathogenesis, frequency, related symptoms as well as appropriate investigations are also presented. CONCLUSION: Patients with PB malignancies are at increased risk of a wide variation of medical emergencies. Clinical knowledge, early recognition and collaboration with the relevant specialties are critical to manage these complications effectively, tailoring overall management around the actual prognosis and individuals' expectations.
