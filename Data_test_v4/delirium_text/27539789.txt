27539789|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To survey intensive care unit healthcare professionals' awareness and practice related to delirium. BACKGROUND: Despite the current evidence revealing the risks linked to delirium and advances in practice guidelines promoting delirium assessment, healthcare professionals show little sensitivity towards delirium and evident training needs. DESIGN: The study had a cross-sectional survey design. METHODS: A sample of 168 intensive care unit healthcare professionals including nurses and physicians completed a semistructured questionnaire to survey their awareness, screening and management of delirium in intensive care units. The survey took place at 11 intensive care units from academic (university) and nonacademic (nonuniversity) governmental hospitals in Mansoura, Egypt. RESULTS: The mean score of delirium awareness was 64 4 +- 14 0 among intensive care unit healthcare professionals. Awareness of delirium was significantly lower when definition of delirium was not provided, among diploma nurses compared to bachelor degree nurses and physicians, among those who did not attend any workshop/lecture or read an article related to delirium and lastly, those who work in an intensive care unit when <50% of patients develop delirium. The survey found that only 26 8% of the healthcare professionals screen for delirium on a routine basis, and 14 3% reported attending workshops or lectures or reading an article related to delirium in the last year. In screening delirium, healthcare professionals did not use any tools, nor did they follow adopted protocols or guidelines to manage delirium. To manage delirium, 52 4% of the participants reported using sedatives, 36 9% used no drugs, and 10 7% reported using antipsychotics (primarily haloperidol). CONCLUSION: Intensive care unit healthcare professionals do not have adequate training or routine screening of delirium. There is an evident absence of using standardised tools or adapting protocols to monitor and manage delirium. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study has the potentials to shed some lights on the variables that might explain the problem of underdiagnosing delirium by healthcare professionals at intensive care units in Mansoura.
