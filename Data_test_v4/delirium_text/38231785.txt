38231785|t|Characterization and In Vitro Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Ginsenosides Extracted from Forest-Grown Wild Panax quinquefolius L.
38231785|a|American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is known for its health benefits, which are attributed to various terpenoids. However, the specific composition and activities of these terpenoids in forest-grown wild American ginseng remain understudied. This study aimed to characterize the terpenoid composition, particularly triterpene saponins, in forest-grown wild American ginseng. The analysis revealed that triterpene saponins, notably American ginseng ginsenosides (AGGs), are the predominant active components, as identified through LC-MS/MS and HPLC. A subsequent in vitro evaluation of AGGs showcased their potent antioxidant capabilities, displaying the dose-dependent scavenging of free radicals and reducing agents. Moreover, AGGs demonstrated efficacy in reducing oxidative injury and intracellular ROS levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with H2O2. In addition to their antioxidant properties, AGGs exhibited anti-inflammatory effects, significantly inhibiting NO and inflammatory substance production in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These findings highlight the potential of AGG-rich forest-grown wild American ginseng as a functional food with promising implications for improving human health.
