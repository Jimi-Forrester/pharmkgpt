33375724|t|Recent Advances in Functional Polymers Containing Coumarin Chromophores.
33375724|a|Natural and synthetic coumarin derivatives have gained increased attention in the design of functional polymers and polymer networks due to their unique optical, biological, and photochemical properties. This review provides a comprehensive overview over recent developments in macromolecular architecture and mainly covers examples from the literature published from 2004 to 2020. Along with a discussion on coumarin and its photochemical properties, we focus on polymers containing coumarin as a nonreactive moiety as well as polymer systems exploiting the dimerization and/or reversible nature of the [2pis + 2pis] cycloaddition reaction. Coumarin moieties undergo a reversible [2pis + 2pis] cycloaddition reaction upon irradiation with specific wavelengths in the UV region, which is applied to impart intrinsic healability, shape-memory, and reversible properties into polymers. In addition, coumarin chromophores are able to dimerize under the exposure to direct sunlight, which is a promising route for the synthesis and cross-linking of polymer systems under "green" and environment-friendly conditions. Along with the chemistry and design of coumarin functional polymers, we highlight various future application fields of coumarin containing polymers involving tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, soft robotics, or 4D printing applications.
