32383993|a|Cerebrovascular dysfunction is a critical risk factor for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purinergic P2Y2 receptor and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are tightly associated with vascular dysfunction and the pathogenesis of AD. However, the protective effects of exercise training on P2Y2 receptor- and ER stress-associated cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD are mostly unknown. Control (C57BL/6, CON) and AD (APP/PS1dE9, AD) mice underwent treadmill exercise training (EX). 2-MeS-ATP-induced dose-dependent vasoreactivity was determined by using a pressurized posterior cerebral artery (PCA) from 10-12-mo-old mice. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were exposed to laminar shear stress (LSS) at 20 dyn/cm2 for 30 min, 2 h, and 24 h. The expression of P2Y2 receptors, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and ER stress signaling were quantified by Western blot analysis. Notably, exercise converted ATP-induced vasoconstriction in the PCA from AD mice to vasodilation in AD+EX mice to a degree commensurate to the vascular reactivity observed in CON mice. Exercise reduced the expression of amyloid peptide precursor (APP) and increased the P2Y2 receptor and Akt/eNOS expression in AD mice brain. Mechanistically, LSS increased the expression of both P2Y2 receptor and eNOS protein in HBMECs, but these increases were blunted by a P2Y2 receptor antagonist in HBMECs. Exercise also reduced the expression of aberrant ER stress markers p-IRE1, p/t-eIF2alpha, and CHOP, as well as Bax/Bcl-2, in AD mice brain. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that exercise mitigates cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD through modulating P2Y2 receptor- and ER stress-dependent endothelial dysfunction.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A limited study has investigated whether exercise training can improve cerebrovascular function in Alzheimer's disease. The novel findings of the study are that exercise training improves cerebrovascular dysfunction through enhancing P2Y2 receptor-mediated eNOS signaling and reducing ER stress-associated pathways in AD. These data suggest that exercise training, which regulates P2Y2 receptor and ER stress in AD brain, is a potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
