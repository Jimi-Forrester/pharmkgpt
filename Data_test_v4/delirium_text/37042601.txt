37042601|t|ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AN ASSOCIATION OR A COMPLICATION OF PAGET'S DISEASE? STUDY OF AN OBSERVATION IN GUINEA.
37042601|a|If Paget's disease can undermine Alzheimer's disease, there is the possibility of an association between Alzheimer's disease and Paget's disease. We report the observation of an 81-year-old hypertensive patient with Alzheimer's disease, who presented with an isolated increase in alkaline phosphatase, which led to the discovery of Paget's disease. The physician must therefore be careful to distinguish between genuine Alzheimer's disease and a neurological complication of Paget's disease.
