38612801|t|Pharmacological Activation of Piezo1 Channels Enhances Astrocyte-Neuron Communication via NMDA Receptors in the Murine Neocortex.
38612801|a|The Piezo1 mechanosensitive ion channel is abundant on several elements of the central nervous system including astrocytes. It has been already demonstrated that activation of these channels is able to elicit calcium waves on astrocytes, which contributes to the release of gliotransmitters. Astrocyte- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent slow inward currents (SICs) are hallmarks of astrocyte-neuron communication. These currents are triggered by glutamate released as gliotransmitter, which in turn activates neuronal NMDA receptors responsible for this inward current having slower kinetics than any synaptic events. In this project, we aimed to investigate whether Piezo1 activation and inhibition is able to alter spontaneous SIC activity of murine neocortical pyramidal neurons. When the Piezo1 opener Yoda1 was applied, the SIC frequency and the charge transfer by these events in a minute time was significantly increased. These changes were prevented by treating the preparations with the NMDA receptor inhibitor D-AP5. Furthermore, Yoda1 did not alter the spontaneous EPSC frequency and amplitude when SICs were absent. The Piezo1 inhibitor Dooku1 effectively reverted the actions of Yoda1 and decreased the rise time of SICs when applied alone. In conclusion, activation of Piezo1 channels is able to alter astrocyte-neuron communication. Via enhancement of SIC activity, astrocytic Piezo1 channels have the capacity to determine neuronal excitability.
