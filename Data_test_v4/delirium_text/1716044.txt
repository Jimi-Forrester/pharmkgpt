1716044|t|Immunohistochemical colocalization of amyloid precursor protein with cerebrovascular amyloid of Alzheimer's disease.
1716044|a|Molecular cloning and cDNA sequencing have indicated that the fibril-forming, amyloidogenic beta/A4 peptide of cerebrovasculature and plaque core in AD is encoded as part of a larger precursor, amyloid precursor protein (APP). A panel of antibodies directed against synthetic peptides, which correspond to distinct domains of this putative APP molecule (i.e., amino acid residues 45-62, 587-596, 597-606, 597-638 [beta/A4 peptide], 638-658 and 653-661), were used to probe immunohistochemically serial sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains for the presence of APP and/or its derivatives. Histochemical staining of adjacent sections with Bielschowsky's silver impregnation and with Congo red or thioflavin S-staining techniques was also done to identify the structures with amyloid deposition. All these antibodies exhibited intense immunoreactivity with amyloidotic cerebral vessels, including meningeal and parenchymal. This observation indicates that the amyloidotic vasculature of AD brain contains, in addition to the fibril-forming beta/A4 protein, nonamyloidogenic APP and/or its derivatives. More importantly, this APP immunoreactivity colocalized with angiopathic amyloid, which is characterized by phenol-resistant, birefringent congophilia. Parallel analyses with a dual SABC/silver impregnation procedure further confirmed that APP and/or its derivatives, including the amyloidogenic beta/A4, colocalized with argentophilic amyloid in the cerebrovasculature of AD.
