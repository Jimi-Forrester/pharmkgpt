38742046|a|In addition to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the hippocampus is now known to be affected in variants of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). In semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), characterized by language impairments, hippocampal atrophy is greater in the left hemisphere. Nonverbal impairments (e.g., visual object recognition) are prominent in the right temporal variant of FTD (rtvFTD), and hippocampal atrophy may be greater in the right hemisphere. In this study we examined the hypothesis that leftward hippocampal asymmetry (predicted in svPPA) would be associated with selective verbal memory impairments (with relative preservation of visual memory), while rightward asymmetry (predicted in rtvFTD) would be associated with the opposite pattern (greater visual memory impairment). In contrast, we predicted that controls and individuals in the amnestic mild cognitive impairment stage of AD (aMCI), both of whom were expected to show symmetrical hippocampal volumes, would show roughly equivalent scores in verbal and visual memory. Participants completed delayed recall tests with words and geometric shapes, and hippocampal volumes were assessed with MRI. The aMCI sample showed symmetrical hippocampal atrophy, and similar degree of verbal and visual memory impairment. The svPPA sample showed greater left hippocampal atrophy and verbal memory impairment, while rtvFTD showed greater right hippocampal atrophy and visual memory impairment. Greater asymmetry in hippocampal volumes was associated with larger differences between verbal and visual memory in the FTD samples. Unlike AD, asymmetry is a core feature of brain-memory relationships in temporal variants of FTD.
