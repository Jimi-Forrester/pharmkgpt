37895111|t|Effects of Prokineticins on Cerebral Cell Function and Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability.
37895111|a|Prokineticins are a family of small proteins with diverse roles in various tissues, including the brain. However, their specific effects on different cerebral cell types and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PROK1 and PROK2 on murine cerebral cell lines, bEnd.3, C8.D30, and N2a, corresponding to microvascular endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons, respectively, and on an established BBB co-culture model. Western blot analysis showed that prokineticin receptors (PROKR1 and PROKR2) were differentially expressed in the considered cell lines. The effect of PROK1 and PROK2 on cell proliferation and migration were assessed using time-lapse microscopy. PROK1 decreased neural cells' proliferation, while it had no effect on the proliferation of endothelial cells and astrocytes. In contrast, PROK2 reduced the proliferation of all cell lines tested. Both PROK1 and PROK2 increased the migration of all cell lines. Blocking PROKRs with the PROKR1 antagonist (PC7) and the PROKR2 antagonist (PKR-A) inhibited astrocyte PROK2-mediated migration. Using the insert co-culture model of BBB, we demonstrated that PROKs increased BBB permeability, which could be prevented by PROKRs' antagonists.
