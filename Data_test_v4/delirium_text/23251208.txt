METHODS: Blood samples of 26 patients with AD and 28 normal controls were collected to separate peripheral lymphocytes. We measured the proportion of each cell cycle phase in activated lymphocytes using flow cytometry and evaluated the responsiveness of these lymphocytes to rapamycin. RESULTS: The patients with AD were older than the normal controls (AD 74.03+-7.90 yr vs. control 68.28+-6.21 yr, p=0.004). The proportion of G1 phase cells in the AD group was significantly lower than that in the control group (70.29+-6.32% vs. 76.03+-9.05%, p=0.01), and the proportion of S phase cells in the AD group was higher than that in control group (12.45+-6.09% vs. 6.03+-5.11%, p=0.001). Activated lymphocytes in patients with AD were not arrested in the G1 phase and they progressed to the late phase of the cell cycle despite rapamycin treatment, in contrast to those of normal subjects. CONCLUSION: The patients with AD probably have a control defect of early phase cell cycle in peripheral lymphocytes that may be associated with the underlying pathology of neuronal death.
