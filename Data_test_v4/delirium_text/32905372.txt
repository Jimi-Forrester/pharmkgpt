32905372|t|Distinguishing the Effect on the Rate and Yield of Abeta42 Aggregation by Green Tea Polyphenol EGCG.
32905372|a|Deposition of Abeta42 aggregates in the form of amyloid plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A desired avenue of intervention is the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenol in green tea, has been generally considered an inhibitor of Abeta aggregation. However, previous experiments focused on the reduction of the amount of Abeta42 aggregates, while the effect of EGCG on the rate of Abeta42 aggregation was not critically analyzed. Here we performed an experimental evaluation of Abeta42 aggregation kinetics in the absence and presence of EGCG at a wide range of concentrations. We found that EGCG reduced thioflavin T fluorescence in an EGCG concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that EGCG reduced the amount of Abeta42 fibrils. The effect of EGCG on the rate of Abeta42 aggregation appears to be bimodal. We found that higher EGCG-to-Abeta42 ratios promoted the rate of Abeta42 aggregation, while lower EGCG-to-Abeta42 ratios inhibited the aggregation rate. To confirm that the reduction of thioflavin T fluorescence is due to the lowered aggregate quantity, but not due to perturbation of thioflavin T binding to Abeta42 fibrils, we probed the effect of EGCG on Abeta42 aggregation using site-directed spin labeling. Electron paramagnetic resonance of spin-labeled Abeta42 aggregates suggests that high EGCG-to-Abeta42 ratios led to a greatly reduced amount of Abeta42 fibrils, and these aggregates adopt similar structures as the fibrils in the no-EGCG sample. Potential implications of this work in designing prevention or therapeutic strategies using EGCG are discussed.
