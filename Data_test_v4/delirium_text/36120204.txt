36120204|a|Neurological manifestations are common in scrub typhus in children. A 12-year-old girl presented with acute onset fever, bilateral lower limb weakness, and urinary retention. On initial investigations, scrub typhus immunoglobulin M (IgM) ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was reactive. She was given an injection of doxycycline along with other supportive therapies.
