11481129|a|The authors assessed the equivalence of the factor structure of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) in samples of Anglo and Hispanic patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Comparing the factor structure of the CSDD in these groups helps establish its validity and aids in its clinical interpretation with Hispanic patients. CSDD ratings were first subjected to preliminary exploratory factor analyses; then the factor structure of the CSDD across groups of English- and Spanish-speaking patients was tested using structural equation modeling. Analyses showed overall similarity in the CSDD factor structure for the two groups but also revealed differences in factor content for several items. The authors discuss the relevance of these differences for those using the CSDD with Hispanic AD patients.
