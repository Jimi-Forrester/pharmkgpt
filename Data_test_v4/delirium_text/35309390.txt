35309390|t|Reinforcing the bulwark: unravelling the efficient applications of plant phenolics and tannins against environmental stresses.
35309390|a|Phenolic compounds are plant secondary metabolites that play a vital role in plant resistance. They are mainly synthetized from the amino acid L-phenylalanine, which is converted to trans-cinnamic acid in a series of biochemical reactions. These compounds take part in the regulation of seed germination and cooperate in regulating the growth of plants, also taking part in defense responses during infection, UV exposure, injuries, and heavy metal stress. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of phenolic compounds in the interactions of plants with various stress factors, both biotic and abiotic with special attention to their antioxidant properties. Therefore, understanding the biochemical potential of the phenylpropanoid derivatives would be beneficial in sustaining the metabolic processes used by plants to thrive and endure under adverse conditions.
