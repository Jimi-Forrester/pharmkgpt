37334739|t|Cigarette smoking is linked to an increased risk of delirium following arthroplasty in patients suffering from osteoarthritic pain.
37334739|a|AIMS: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common postoperative complication, and the potential relationship between cigarette smoking and POD is still unclear. The current study evaluated the relationship between preoperative smoking status in patients suffering from osteoarthritic pain and POD after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: A total of 254 patients who had undergone unilateral TKA were enrolled between November 2021 and December 2022, with no gender limitation. Preoperatively, patients' visual analog scale (VAS) scores at rest and during movement, hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scores, pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) scores and smoking status were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, which was evaluated by the confusion assessment method (CAM). RESULTS: A total of 188 patients had complete datasets for final analysis. POD was diagnosed in 41 of 188 patients (21.8%) who had complete data for analysis. The incidence of smoking was significantly higher in Group POD than in Group Non-POD (22 of 41 patients [54%] vs. 47 of 147 patients [32%], p < 0.05). The postoperative hospital stays were also longer than those of Group Non-POD (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative smoking (OR: 4.018, 95% CI: 1.158-13.947, p = 0.028) was a risk factor for the occurrence of POD in patients with TKA. The length of hospital stay was correlated with the occurrence of POD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients who smoked preoperatively were at increased risk of developing POD following TKA.
