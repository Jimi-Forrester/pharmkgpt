19001351|a|Cognitive impairment and seizures are common in our aging population. Anticonvulsant treatment is problematic due to sedation, cognitive slowing, and behavioral changes. Levetiracetam has favorable pharmacokinetics, good efficacy in elderly individuals, a favorable side effect profile, and lacks major drug interactions. We conducted a prospective, uncontrolled, phase 4, open label, 12-week study of levetiracetam to better profile its efficacy, safety, and impact on cognitive/behavioral status in 24 cognitively impaired, elderly individuals. In total, 69% were seizure free for the duration of the study; the remaining participants had satisfactory seizure control. Fatigue was the most common side effect (5 participants). Significant overall improvements were observed for the Folstein's Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive. No significant changes were seen in behavioral or functional measures. Levetiracetam is an effective antiepileptic drug in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment. At 3 months, participants who remained on levetiracetam showed excellent cognitive tolerability.
