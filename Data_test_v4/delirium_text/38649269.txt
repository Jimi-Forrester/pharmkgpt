38649269|t|Inhibitory Roles of Apolipoprotein E Christchurch Astrocytes in Curbing Tau Propagation Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Models.
38649269|a|Genetic variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene affect the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APOE Christchurch (APOE Ch) variant has been identified as the most prominent candidate for preventing the onset and progression of AD. In this study, we generated isogenic APOE3Ch/3Ch human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from APOE3/3 healthy control female iPSCs and induced them into astrocytes. RNA expression analysis revealed the inherent resilience of APOE3Ch/3Ch astrocytes to induce a reactive state in response to inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, cytokine treatment changed astrocytic morphology with more complexity in APOE3/3 astrocytes, but not in APOE3Ch/3Ch astrocytes, indicating resilience of the rare variant to a reactive state. Interestingly, we observed robust morphological alterations containing more intricate processes when cocultured with iPSC-derived cortical neurons, in which APOE3Ch/3Ch astrocytes reduced complexity compared with APOE3/3 astrocytes. To assess the impacts of tau propagation effects, we next developed a sophisticated and sensitive assay utilizing cortical neurons derived from human iPSCs, previously generated from donors of both sexes. We showed that APOE3Ch/3Ch astrocytes effectively mitigated tau propagation within iPSC-derived neurons. This study provides important experimental evidence of the characteristic functions exhibited by APOE3Ch/3Ch astrocytes, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of novel clinical interventions in AD research.
