24711813|t|Cardioprotection and anticholinesterases in patients with Alzheimer's disease: time for reappraisal.
24711813|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Traditional risk factors, like impaired transmitral flow in diastolic filling [vortex formation time (VFT) as echocardiographic parameter], contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, we observed that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide a significant cardioprotection. We assessed the pathogenetic role of VFT as early cardiovascular risk factor in 23 AD patients and 24 controls. RESULTS: The results showed no statistical difference between the two groups, but the VFT values were significantly lower in nontreated AD patients, and higher value were observed in AD patients treated with anticholinesterases. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the beneficial effects of anticholinesterases on the cardiovascular system of AD patients. Thus, the transition to evidence-based medicine and an in vivo model of cardiomyocytes might strengthen these results.
