38559190|a|Age is the strongest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder. However, the mechanisms connecting advancing age to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease are incompletely understood. We conducted an unbiased, genome-scale, forward genetic screen for age-associated neurodegeneration in Drosophila to identify the underlying biological processes required for maintenance of aging neurons. To connect genetic screen hits to Alzheimer's disease pathways, we measured proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease. We further identified Alzheimer's disease human genetic variants that modify expression in disease-vulnerable neurons. Through multi-omic, multi-species network integration of these data, we identified relationships between screen hits and tau-mediated neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we computationally and experimentally identified relationships between screen hits and DNA damage in Drosophila and human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells. Our work identifies candidate pathways that could be targeted to attenuate the effects of age on neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease.
