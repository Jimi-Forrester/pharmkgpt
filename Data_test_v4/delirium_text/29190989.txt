29190989|a|Many studies have applied arterial spin labeling (ASL) to characterize cerebral perfusion patterns of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, findings across studies are not conclusive. A quantitatively voxel-wise meta-analysis to pool the resting-state ASL studies that measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) alterations in AD was conducted to identify the most consistent and replicable perfusion pattern using seed-based d mapping. The meta-analysis, including 17 ASL studies encompassing 327 AD patients and 357 healthy controls, demonstrated that decreased rCBF in AD patients relative to healthy controls were consistently identified in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortices (PCC)/precuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobules (IPLs), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The meta-regression analysis showed that more severe cognitive impairment in the AD samples correlated with greater decreases of rCBF in the bilateral PCC and left IPL. This study characterizes an aberrant ASL-rCBF perfusion pattern of AD involving the posterior default mode network and executive network, which are implicated in its pathophysiology and hold promise for developing imaging biomarkers.
