33192191|a|OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to determine the effect of massage with and without aromatic oil on the delirium of patients hospitalized in the cardiac intensive care unit. METHODS: This study was a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Using a convenience method, 150 patients were selected and assigned into 3 groups: control, massage with aroma, and massage without aroma using the minimization method. Only routine care was provided for the control group. Brown massage with 4% rose oil in the base of sweet almond oil was given to the massage group with aroma 1 day after the surgery. The same steps and massage techniques with sweet almond oil were performed for the massage group without aroma. The incidence and severity of delirium were evaluated at the end of each day using the Neelon and Champagne Confusion Scale. RESULTS: Delirium scores were not significantly different among the 3 groups on the first, second, and third days (P > .05). Also, the incidence of delirium significantly decreased in all 3 groups from day 1 to day 3. CONCLUSION: The results of this study could not prove the beneficial effects of massage with and without aroma on delirium incidence. Further studies are suggested to determine the best intervention to reduce delirium in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery.
