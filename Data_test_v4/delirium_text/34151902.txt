34151902|t|Recent Developments in Diabetic Retinal Neurodegeneration: A Literature Review.
34151902|a|Neurodegeneration plays a significant role in the complex pathology of diabetic retinopathy. Evidence suggests the onset of neurodegeneration occurs early on in the disease, and so a greater understanding of the process is essential for prompt detection and targeted therapies. Neurodegeneration is a common pathway of assorted processes, including activation of inflammatory pathways, reduction of neuroprotective factors, DNA damage, and apoptosis. Oxidative stress and formation of advanced glycation end products amplify these processes and are elevated in the setting of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and glucose variability. These key pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, as well as diagnostic modalities and novel therapeutic avenues, with an emphasis on recent discoveries. The aim of this article is to highlight the crucial role of neurodegeneration in diabetic retinopathy and to review the molecular basis for this neuronal dysfunction, its diagnostic features, and the progress currently made in relevant therapeutic interventions.
