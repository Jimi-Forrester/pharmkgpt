30661899|t|Liver Transplantation for Fulminant Hepatic Failure Due to Heat Stroke: A Case Report.
30661899|a|Heat stroke is a condition caused by an excessive increase in body temperature in a relatively short period of time, and is clinically characterized by central nervous system dysfunction, including delirium, seizures, coma, and severe hyperthermia. In this context, the resulting fulminant hepatic failure makes liver transplant the best choice when there are no guarantees of better results with conservative treatment. We present our experience in this case, possible alternative choices, and the current role of liver transplantation in the resolution of fulminant liver failure due to heat stroke. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a history of malabsorption syndrome and unconfirmed celiac disease controlled with a gluten-free diet, who, while working on a typical summer midday in southern Spain (approximately 40 C), abruptly presented with loss of consciousness, coma, and a temperature of 42 C, as well as seizures at the initial medical assessment that subsided after the administration of diazepam. On the third day, the patient presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He did not improve with the support of conservative treatment, therefore it was decided to perform an urgent liver transplant, after which he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation should be a main choice of treatment for cases in which, despite intensive medical treatment, there is still clinical and analytical evidence of massive and/or irreversible hepatocellular damage.
