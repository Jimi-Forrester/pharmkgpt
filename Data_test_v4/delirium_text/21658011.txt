21658011|a|BACKGROUND: The view of delirium has changed considerably over the last decade, and delirium is now a very topical issue within the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Delirium has proved to be common in critically ill patients and is manifested as acute changes in mental status with reduced cognitive ability, incoherent thought patterns, impaired consciousness, agitation and acute confusion. In order to be able to prevent, identify and alleviate problems related to delirium it is important that validated instruments for delirium screening are implemented and evaluated. The aim of this study was to translate the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) into Swedish and test the inter-rater reliability in a Swedish general ICU setting. METHODS: The study was carried out during 2009 in a general Swedish ICU. A translation of the scale from English into Swedish was made, including back-translation, critical review and pilot testing. A total of 49 paired ratings were carried out using the Swedish version of the ICDSC scale. The inter-rater reliability was tested using weighted kappa (kappa) statistics (linear weighting). RESULTS: The ICDSC scale was successfully translated into Swedish and the inter-rater reliability testing of the Swedish version resulted in a weighted k value of 0.92. CONCLUSION: The result of this study indicates that the Swedish version of the ICDSC scale has a very good inter-rater reliability. The high inter-rater reliability and the ease of administration make the ICDSC scale applicable for delirium screening in a Swedish ICU setting.
