34680995|t|Impact of ABCG2 Gene Polymorphism on the Predisposition to Psoriasis.
34680995|a|Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease which is caused by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Evidence shows an association of psoriasis with co-morbidities including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia. Genome-wide association studies have revealed that the ABCG2 gene encoding ATP-binding cassette G2 protein was associated with inflammation and higher serum urate concentrations. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of ABCG2 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility to psoriasis. The genotype distribution of two ABCG2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2231142 and rs2231137, was examined in 410 psoriasis patients and 1,089 gender-matched non-psoriasis controls. We found that heterozygotes (GT) for rs2231142 was associated with a decreased risk of psoriasis (p = 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.532; 95% CI, 0.370-0.765) after adjusting for age, as compared with homozygotes for the major allele (GG). Subjects who carried at least one polymorphic allele (homozygote or heterozygote for the minor allele) were less susceptible to psoriasis (p = 0.002; adjusted OR = 0.594; 95% CI, 0.249-0.823) and bearing higher serum urate levels (p = 0.026) than those homozygous for the major allele. Our results indicated that the ABCG2 gene polymorphism was associated with the risk of psoriasis.
