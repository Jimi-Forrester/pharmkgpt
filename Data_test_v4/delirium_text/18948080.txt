18948080|a|Formation of SDS-insoluble protein aggregates in affected neurons is a cellular pathological feature of polyglutamine (polyQ) disease. We identified a multi-WD-domain protein, receptor for activated protein kinase C1 (RACK1), as a novel polyQ aggregate component from a Drosophila transgenic polyQ disease model. We showed that WD domains were crucial determinants for the recruitment of RACK1 to polyQ aggregates. Over-expression of the human RACK1 protein suppressed polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. This is the first report to demonstrate the involvement of WD-domain proteins in polyQ pathogenesis, and the proteomic approach described here can be applied to the investigation of other protein aggregation disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
