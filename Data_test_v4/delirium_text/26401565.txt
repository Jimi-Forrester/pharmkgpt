26401565|a|BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported an association of atherosclerosis with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia independent of cardiovascular risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cross-sectional association of the ankle-brachial index (ABI), intima media thickness (IMT), and coronary artery calcification (CAC) with MCI and its subtypes, amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) in the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall cohort study. METHODS: 4,086 participants performed a validated brief cognitive assessment at the first follow-up examination (2006-2008). MCI was diagnosed according to previously published criteria. Prevalence ratio (PR) regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, cardiovascular risk factors, and APOE genotype were used to compare the association of the ABI, the CAC-Agatston score and the IMT with MCI and its subtypes. RESULTS: We identified 490 participants with MCI (mean age 66.1 +- 7.8, 46.9 % male, aMCI n = 249, naMCI n = 241) and 1,242 cognitively normal participants. A decreasing ABI (per 0.1) was significantly associated with a higher MCI prevalence in fully adjusted models (PR 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.11), whereas an increasing CAC (log(CAC+1)) or IMT (per 0.1 mm) were not associated after adjustment. A decreasing ABI was also significantly associated with naMCI in fully adjusted models (PR 1.12; CI 1.03-1.21) but not with aMCI. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the degree of generalized atherosclerosis as measured by the ABI is associated with MCI and with naMCI in a population-based cohort.
