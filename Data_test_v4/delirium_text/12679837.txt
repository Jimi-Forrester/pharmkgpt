12679837|t|Lipoproteins and lipid peroxidation in Alzheimer's disease.
12679837|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a clinical-pathological entity that probably derives from different causes. Mounting evidence strongly implicates regionally increased oxidative damage to brain beyond what occurs with aging as one of the processes that may contribute to AD progression. While several different classes of molecules may be affected, lipid peroxidation is thought to be a prominent and especially deleterious form of oxidative damage in brain due to this organ's relative enrichment in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Our laboratory recently has demonstrated that lipoproteins in AD brain extracellular fluid are more vulnerable to oxidation than lipoproteins in control brain extracellular fluid. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the principal apolipoprotein in the central nervous system (CNS), and it serves as the major apolipoprotein that is capable of lipid transport and regulation of lipid metabolism through known receptor-mediated processes. Moreover, inheritance of the APOE4 allele represents the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. Evidence suggests that apoE isoforms may specifically influence the cellular distribution of lipid peroxidation products in brain and may therefore contribute to the stratification of risk for AD associated with APOE. Here, we review possible mechanisms whereby lipoprotein trafficking and lipid peroxidation converge to contribute to neurodegeneration in AD brain.
