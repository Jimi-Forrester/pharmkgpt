37704682|t|FAM3 family genes are associated with prognostic value of human cancer: a pan-cancer analysis.
37704682|a|Family with sequence similarity three member (FAM3) plays a crucial role in the malignant development of various cancers of human. However, there remains doubtful what specific role of FAM3 family genes in pan-cancer. Our study aimed to investigate the role of FAM3 family genes in prognosis, immune subtype, tumor immune microenvironment, stemness score, and anticancer drug sensitivity of pan-cancer. We obtained data from UCSC Xena GDC and CellMiner databases, and used them to study the correlation of the expression, survival, immune subtype, tumor microenvironment, stemness score, and anticancer drug sensitivity between FAM3 family genes with pan-cancer. Furthermore, we investigated the tumor cellular functions and clinical prognostic value FAMC3 in pancreatic cancer (PAAD) using cellular experiments and tissue microarray. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell invasion, wound-healing and apoptosis assays were performed to study the effect of FAM3C on SW1990 cells' proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Immunohistochemical staining was used to study the relationship between FAM3C expression and clinical characteristics of pancreatic cancer patients. The results revealed that FAM3 family genes are significantly differential expression in tumor and adjacent normal tissues in 7 cancers (CHOL, HNSC, KICH, LUAD, LUSC, READ, and STAD). The expression of FAM3 family genes were negatively related with the RNAss, and robust correlated with immune type, tumor immune microenvironment and drug sensitivity. The expression of FAM3 family genes in pan-cancers were significantly different in immune type C1 (wound healing), C2 (IFN-gamma dominant), C3 (inflammatory), C4 (lymphocyte depleted), C5 (immunologically quiet), and C6 (TGF-beta dominant). Meanwhile, overexpression FAM3C promoted SW1990 cells proliferation, migration, invasion and suppressed SW1990 cells apoptosis. While knockdown of FAM3C triggered opposite results. High FAM3C expression was associated with duodenal invasion, differentiation and liver metastasis. In summary, this study provided a new perspective on the potential therapeutic role of FAM3 family genes in pan-cancer. In particular, FAM3C may play an important role in the occurrence and progression of PAAD.
