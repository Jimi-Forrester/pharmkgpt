35734159|t|Cardiac Critical Care: The Evolution of a Novel Subspecialty.
35734159|a|Driven by evolving patient demographics and disease burdens over the past several decades, the demands placed on the cardiac intensive care unit have steadily increased. Originally born out of the need for post-infarction arrhythmia monitoring, the modern cardiac intensive care space is now encountering progressively more complex patients with multisystem organ failure and, increasingly, complex mechanical circulatory support. This complexity has fueled a demand for specifically trained cardiac intensivists, and many different training pathways have emerged nationwide. In this article, we provide an overview of the evolution, landscape, training, and future of the subspecialty of cardiac critical care.
