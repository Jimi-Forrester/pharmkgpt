30627368|t|Effect of ghrelin on serum metabolites in Alzheimer's disease model rats; a metabolomics studies based on 1H-NMR technique.
30627368|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is dysfunction of the central nervous system and as a neurodegenerative disease. The objective of this work is to investigate metabolic profiling in the serum of animal models of AD compared to healthy controls and then to peruse the role of ghrelin as a therapeutic approach for the AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique was used for identification of metabolites that are differentially expressed in the serum of a rat model of the AD with or without ghrelin treatment. Using multivariate statistical analysis, models were built and indicated. RESULTS: There were significant differences and high predictive power between AD and ghrelin-treated groups. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Q2 were 0.870 and 0.759, respectively. A biomarker panel consisting of 14 metabolites was identified to discriminate the AD from the control group. Another panel of 12 serum metabolites was used to differentiate AD models from treated models. CONCLUSION: Both panels had good agreements with clinical diagnosis. Analysis of the results displayed that ghrelin improved memory and cognitive abilities. Affected pathways by ghrelin included oxidative stress, and osteoporosis pathways and vascular risk factors.
