25799653|a|Several studies contributed to improving the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of delirium in hospitalized older patients. Direct patient education proved efficient in benzodiazepines withdrawal. A position statement of the American Geriatrics Society does not recommend tube feeding when eating difficulties arise in older persons suffering from advanced dementia. Several studies emphasized once again the potential importance of preventative interventions (in particular physical activity) to prevent or delay dementia occurrence. Two randomized controlled trials of monoclonal antibodies that bind amyloid did not show benefit in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's dementia (AD). In contrast, vitamin E reduced functional decline in these patients, and citalopram reduced agitation among AD patients as well as their caregiver's stress.
