36865485|t|Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in the Elderly, the Birjand Longitudinal Aging Study.
36865485|a|Cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for chronic and atherosclerotic vascular disease that causes preventable considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study is aimed at comparing inflammation and the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in elderly subjects. The authors recruited the participants (1281 older adults) from the Birjand Longitudinal of Aging study. They measured oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers serum levels in the 101 cigarettes and 1180 nonsmokers. The mean age of smokers was 69.3 +- 7.95 years, and most were male. The most percentage of male cigarette smokers have lower body mass index (BMI) (<=19 kg/m2). Females have higher BMI categories than males (P <= 0.001). The percentage of diseases and defects was different between cigarette and non-cigarette smoker adults (P <= 0.01 to P <= 0.001). The total white blood cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils were significantly higher in cigarettes compared to non-cigarette smokers (P <= 0.001). Besides, cigarette consumers' percentage of hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to other aged people was significantly different (P <= 0.001). However, biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant levels were not significant differences between the two senior groups. Cigarette smoking in older adults was associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers and cells, but it did not find a significant difference in oxidative stress markers. Longitudinal prospective studies may help illuminate the mechanisms inducing oxidative stress and inflammation due to cigarette smoking in each gender.
