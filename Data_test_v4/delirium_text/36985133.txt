36985133|a|Thraustochytrids are unicellular heterotrophic marine protists that have been described as producing a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Among them, arachidonic acid (ARA) stands out as a precursor of several mediators of pivotal importance for the immune system. However, the biotechnological potential of thraustochytrids for ARA production has not been developed. The objective of this study is to isolate and identify native strains from different Chilean coastal environments and evaluate in vitro the effect of culture parameters such as C/N ratio (19 and 33) and temperature (15  C and 23  C) on biomass production and arachidonic acid content. A total of nine strains were identified and classified into four genera of the Thraustochitridae family. The Lng2 strain with 99% identity belongs to the species Ulkenia visurgenis and was the most prominent one for ARA production. Temperature had an effect on the PUFA profile but not on the ARA content nor on the biomass yield. Additionally, the C/N ratio has been identified as a key parameter. The ARA productivity increased by 92% (from 0.6 to 8.3 ARA mg/g-DW) and its total biomass by 62.7% (from 1.9 to 5.1 g/L) at a high C/N ratio (33) as compared to the control.
