37755159|t|Melatonin Use in Pediatric Intensive Care Units: A Single-Center Experience.
37755159|a|Growing evidence indicates that altered melatonin secretion during critical illness may influence the quality and quantity of sleep, delirium, and overall recovery. However, limited data exist regarding the use of melatonin in pediatric critical illness. Data were reviewed over a 5-year period at a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit for pediatric patients (ages 0-18 years) who were prescribed melatonin with the aim of identifying the frequency of and indications for use. Data collection included the hospital day of initiation, the dose, the frequency, the duration of use, and the length of stay. The results demonstrate that melatonin was infrequently prescribed (6.0% of patients admitted; n = 182) and that the majority of patients received melatonin as continuation of home medication (46%; n = 83 of 182). This group had significantly earlier melatonin use (0.9 +- 2.3 day of hospitalization; p < 0.0001) and significantly reduced lengths of stay compared to the other groups (mean LOS 7.2 +- 9.3 days; p < 0.0001). Frequently, clear documentation of indication for melatonin use was absent (20%; n = 37). In conclusion, given that melatonin is infrequently used within a tertiary PICU with the most common indication as the continuation of home medication, and often without clear documentation for indication, this presents an opportunity to emphasize a more attentive and strategic approach regarding melatonin use in the PICU population.
