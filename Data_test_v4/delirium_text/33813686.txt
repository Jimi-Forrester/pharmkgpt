33813686|t|Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery of elderly patients as an independent risk factor for prolonged length of stay in intensive care unit and in hospital.
33813686|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a relevant and underdiagnosed complication after cardiac surgery that is associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS). The aim of this subgroup study was to compare the frequency of tested POD versus the coded International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) diagnosis of POD and to evaluate the influence of POD on LOS in ICU and hospital. METHODS: 254 elective cardiac surgery patients (mean age, 70.5 +- 6.4 years) at the University Hospital Bonn between September 2018 and October 2019 were evaluated. The endpoint tested POD was considered positive, if one of the tests Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) or Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), 4 'A's Test (4AT) or Delirium Observation Scale (DOS) was positive on one day. RESULTS: POD occurred in 127 patients (50.0%). LOS in ICU and hospital were significantly different based on presence (ICU 165.0 +- 362.7 h; Hospital 26.5 +- 26.1 days) or absence (ICU 64.5 +- 79.4 h; Hospital 14.6 +- 6.7 days) of POD (p < 0.001). The multiple linear regression showed POD as an independent predictor for a prolonged LOS in ICU (48%; 95%CI 31-67%) and in hospital (64%; 95%CI 27-110%) (p < 0.001). The frequency of POD in the study participants that was coded with the ICD F05.0 and F05.8 by hospital staff was considerably lower than tests revealed by the study personnel. CONCLUSION: Approximately 50% of elderly patients who underwent cardiac surgery developed POD, which is associated with an increased ICU and hospital LOS. Furthermore, POD is highly underdiagnosed in clinical routine.
