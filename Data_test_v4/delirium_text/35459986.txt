The main purpose of this study was to establish reference equations for the 6MWD in obese Chinese subjects. METHODS: In our study, a total of 214 individuals with obesity performed the six-minute walking tests (6MWTs) according to the American thoracic society (ATS) guidelines, and the longer 6MWD was used for further analysis. The reference equations for the 6MWD were developed using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The newly established equations for the 6MWD were compared to the existing prediction equations. RESULTS: The mean 6MWD for the cohort was 523 +- 56 m. We found that the reliability of two 6MWTs was good. Age and BMI were identified as independent factors, and explained 31% and 27% of the variance in the 6MWD for the male and female participants, respectively. Thus, the reference equations reported in the previous studies did not accurately predict the 6MWD in our subjects. CONCLUSION: Our study was the first to describe the 6MWD in obese Chinese subjects and to propose new predictive equations. These established equations can improve the assessment of the health of obese Chinese patients whose exercise capacity is affected by the disease. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, Cohort study.
