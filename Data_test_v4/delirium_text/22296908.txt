22296908|a|OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether clusterin polymorphism (rs11136000) was associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han population. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was performed on genotype rs11136000 and APOEepsilon4 in 127 patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and 143 control individuals. Previous published data from other Chinese samples was also included for further meta-analysis. RESULTS: APOEepsilon4 was demonstrated to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Chinese population (odds ratio = 2.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.40-3.96). There is no significant association between clusterin rs11136000 with late-onset sporadic AD in our small cohort. However, meta-analysis revealed significant allele and genotype differences between Alzheimer's disease and controls following a recessive model. CONCLUSION: Clusterin (rs11136000) was associated with Alzheimer's disease in Chinese Han population.
