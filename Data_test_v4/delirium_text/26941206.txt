26941206|a|Delirium is a syndrome of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms that can accompany virtually any serious medical condition. Delirium is characterized by a disturbance of attention and awareness, as well as variety of other aspects of cognition that develops over a short period of time in response to another medical condition. It is an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality and is associated with increased lengths of stay and costs of care. Despite this, it frequently goes unrecognized, and debate continues about the best prevention and treatment strategies. This article will review the current best practices for the prevention and treatment of delirium and how collaborative care can aid in improving outcomes and minimizing adverse events for patients suffering from delirium.
