36425743|t|Neuropsychiatric Consequences of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Synthetic Review from a Global Perspective.
36425743|a|Some research suggests that distress, secondary to isolation and fear following COVID-19 infection, can negatively affect the long-term more than the COVID-19 infection itself. This narrative review aims to provide a global view on the neuropsychiatric consequences of COVID-19 that can be ascribed to several factors, ranging from the direct effect of infection, to the body's responses against the infection, or to the psychological sequelae of social isolation, unemployment, and fear for one's health and livelihood. Current findings show that the more severe the respiratory infection, the more likely are central nervous system (CNS) complications regarding the infection itself. The immune reactions to the infection may result in symptoms similar to chronic fatigue as well as neurocognitive deficits, which last long after the infection is gone. An increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma-related stress may also follow upon economic fears and isolation from friends and family. The consequences of the pandemic are not limited to adults; children learning remotely and away from classmates and routine activities may develop adjustment disorders, acute stress disorder, and a variety of manifestations of grief. A summary of case reports suggests that COVID-19-related stress, economic recession, and political unrest increase the risk of suicidal behaviors and acts of violence. However, it is unknown whether manifestations of mental disorders result from social causes or whether CNS complications may be responsible.
