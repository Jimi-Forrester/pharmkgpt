20018636|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations of [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and [(18)F]FDDNP with impairment in specific cognitive domains over the broader spectrum comprising cognitively normal elderly subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Twelve patients with AD, 13 patients with MCI, and 15 cognitively normal elderly subjects were included. Paired [(11)C]PIB and [(18)F]FDDNP PET scans were performed in all subjects. Binding potential (BP(ND)) was calculated using parametric images of BP(ND) for global, frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex; medial temporal lobe; and posterior cingulate. Cognitive functions were assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Linear regression analyses were used to assess associations of [(11)C]PIB and [(18)F]FDDNP binding with cognitive measures. RESULTS: Adjusted for age, sex, and [(18)F]FDDNP binding, higher global [(11)C]PIB binding was associated with lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination, immediate and delayed recall of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), Visual Association Task, and Trail Making Test part B. Conversely, higher [(18)F]FDDNP binding was independently associated with lower scores on immediate recall of the RAVLT. After additional adjustment for diagnosis, higher [(11)C]PIB binding remained independently associated with delayed recall (standardized beta = -0.39, p = 0.01), whereas higher [(18)F]FDDNP binding remained independently associated with immediate recall (standardized beta = -0.32, p = 0.03). When regional binding was assessed using stepwise models, both increased frontal [(11)C]PIB and temporal [(18)F]FDDNP binding were associated with memory, whereas increased parietal [(11)C]PIB binding was associated with nonmemory functions. CONCLUSION: Increased [(18)F]FDDNP binding is specifically associated with impairment of episodic memory, whereas increased [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B binding is associated with impairment in a broader range of cognitive functions.
