30211292|a|INTRODUCTION: Freeze-thaw instability may contribute to preanalytical variation in blood-based biomarker studies. We investigated the effects of up to four freeze-thaw cycles on single molecule array immunoassays of serum neurofilament light chain and plasma total tau, amyloid beta 1-40 (Ass40), and Abeta 1-42 (Abeta42). METHODS: Individuals who had peripheral venepuncture during investigation of suspected neurodegenerative disease were recruited. After standardized preprocessing, 200 muL of plasma and serum aliquots were stored at -80 C within 60 minutes. Aliquots underwent one to four freeze-thaw cycles. RESULTS: There was no significant difference across four freeze-thaw cycles for serum neurofilament light chain (n = 12), plasma total tau (n = 11), or plasma Abeta42 (n = 12). For plasma Abeta40 (n = 14), there were significant median reductions by ratios of .96 and .92 at the third and fourth cycles, respectively. DISCUSSION: Up to four freeze-thaw cycles do not influence single molecule array blood biomarkers of neurofilament light chain, total tau, or Abeta42, with at most minor reductions in Abeta40.
