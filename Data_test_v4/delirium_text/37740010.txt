37740010|a|Bacteroides fragilis, one of the potential next-generation probiotics, but its protective mechanism is not yet known. We aimed to characterize the anti-inflammatory effect of B. fragilisATCC25285 and to elucidate its mechanism through in vivo and in vitro experiments. An in vitro model of inflammation by induction of colonic cells with TNF-a, and co-cultured with B. fragilis to detect cell viability, apoptosis and invasive capacity. Furthermore, critical proteins of the TLR/NF-kappaB pathway and the inflammatory cytokines were measured. For animal trials, C57BL/6 J male mice were orally administered B. fragilis or PBS once daily for 21 days. Colitis was induced by drinking 2.5% DSS from days 0 to 7. The mice were weighed daily and rectal bleeding, stool condition and blood in the stool were recorded. We found that B. fragilis treatment alone was harmless and had no effect on cell viability or apoptosis. While predictably TNF-alpha decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, B. fragilis attenuated this deterioration. The NF-kappaB pathway and inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta activated by TNF-alpha were also blocked by B. fragilis. Notably, the metabolic supernatant of B. fragilis also has an anti-inflammatory effect. Animal studies showed that live B. fragilis rather than dead strain ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, as evidenced by weight loss, shortened colon length and enhanced barrier function. The colonic tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) were decreased and IL-10 was increased as a result of B. fragilis administration. In conclusion, B. fragilis ATCC25285 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects whether in vivo or in vitro, and it may be a potential probiotic agent for improving colitis.
