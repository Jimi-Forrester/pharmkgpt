35299869|a|Atrophic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disease that causes severe structural changes to the nasal mucosa leading to squamous epithelial metaplasia. However, treatment regarding AR remains a major challenge. We used network pharmacology and molecular docking methods to explore the potential mechanisms of the Yiqi Qingre Ziyin method to modulate neuropeptides in the treatment of AR. The active ingredients of the Yiqi Qingre Ziyin method and their targets of action were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systematic Pharmacology Database Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Disease targets for AR were obtained from four databases: GeneCards, PharmGKB, DrugBank, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). A total of 59 active ingredients, 39 potential targets, and 76 relevant neuropeptides were obtained after deduplication. We constructed target interaction networks with the STRING database. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed on the 14 potential target proteins. We used Cytoscape software to construct the "drug-active ingredient-potential target" and "ingredient-target-pathway" networks of the Yiqi Qingre Ziyin method for treating AR. Molecular docking results suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), opioid receptor gene d1 (OPRD1), and opioid receptor m1 (OPRM1) are key targets for the Yiqi Qingre Ziyin method. Therefore, this study proposed a potential mechanism for the treatment of AR by affecting the expression of neuropeptide-related genes (including DPP4, OPRD1, and OPRM1), which may potentially improve the immune microenvironment of the nasal mucosa.
