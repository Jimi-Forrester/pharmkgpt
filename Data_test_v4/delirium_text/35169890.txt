35169890|t|Circadian regulation of innate immunity in animals and humans and implications for human disease.
35169890|a|Circadian rhythms are 24-h oscillating variations in physiology generated by the core circadian clock. There is now a wide body of evidence showing circadian regulation of the immune system. Innate immune cells contain the molecular circadian clock which drives rhythmic responses, from the magnitude of the inflammatory response to the numbers of circulating immune cells varying throughout the day. This leads to rhythmic presentation of disease clinically, for example the classic presentation of nocturnal asthma or the sudden development of pulmonary oedema from acute myocardial infarction first thing in the morning.
