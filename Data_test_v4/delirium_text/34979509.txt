34979509|t|Psychometric Properties of the Polish Version of the Frontotemporal Dementia Knowledge Scale.
34979509|a|INTRODUCTION: Taking into account a progressive increase in the number of individuals affected by dementia and the importance of being knowledgeable about its symptoms, it has become crucial to develop well-validated instruments for measuring knowledge about dementia. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Frontotemporal Dementia Knowledge Scale (FTDKS) in a Polish population. METHODS: The FTDKS was translated into the Polish language based on the most highly recommended methodological approaches for translating and validating instruments for cross-cultural healthcare research. Psychometric properties were evaluated in a sample of 869 individuals (general population, healthcare professionals, and caregivers) who completed the questionnaire. The reliability of the FTDKS was tested as an internal consistency using both Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega factor analysis. The convergent and discriminant validity was assessed using the Heterotrait-monotrait Ratio of Correlation between scores of FTDKS, vocabulary intelligence, and Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (AKDS). RESULTS: The results indicate that the scale produces satisfactory psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega over 0.80). The internal consistency was slightly higher in the population of healthcare professionals and caregivers than among the general population. DISCUSSION: The internal consistency of the Polish version of FTDKS demonstrates a similar validity to the original version. The FTDKS can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions among caregivers, healthcare professionals, and the general population.
