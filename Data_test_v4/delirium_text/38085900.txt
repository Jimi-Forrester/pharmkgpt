38085900|a|OBJECTIVE: Immunotherapeutic approaches have revolutionized cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T-cell therapy now approved to treat a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. This article summarizes the distinctive neurologic side effects of these therapies as well as their management. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Neurologic immune-related adverse events are rare but potentially serious complications of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Both peripheral and central nervous system disorders have been described, often necessitating a pause or cessation of immunotherapy. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome is a potentially serious complication of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. While symptoms may be mild and self-limited, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and fulminant cerebral edema can be seen. Close neurologic monitoring is imperative. The mainstay of treatment for neurologic complications includes high-dose corticosteroids, although other immunomodulatory strategies may be used in severe or refractory cases. ESSENTIAL POINTS: The spectrum of neurologic complications of cancer immunotherapy is broad, encompassing both central and peripheral nervous system disorders, indolent as well as fulminant clinical presentations, and wide-ranging severity with variable response to treatment. Early identification and multidisciplinary management are crucial to balance neurologic recovery and antitumor control.
