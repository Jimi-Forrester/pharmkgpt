34670594|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to monitor the compliance and impact on a protocol change of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis in cardiac surgery favouring cefazolin instead cefuroxime, initiated by the hospital's antimicrobial stewardship team. METHODS: This quality improvement study was performed in a tertiary care hospital in collaboration with the department of cardiothoracic surgery and the hospitals antimicrobial stewardship team following a revision of the standard for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis including 1029 patients who underwent cardiac surgery. 582 patients receiving cefuroxime and 447 patients receiving cefazolin respectively were compared without altering any other preventative perioperative measures including its postoperative duration of less than 24 h. Adherence and surgical site infections were compiled and analysed. RESULTS: A complete adherence was achieved. Overall surgical site infections occurred in 37 (3.6%) of the cases, 20 (3.4%) in cefuroxime patients and 17 (3.8%) in cefazolin patients (p value = 0.754). No statistically significant differences could be found in any of the primary endpoints, but there was a trend towards less deep sternal wound infections in the cefazolin group. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the role of antimicrobial stewardship in cardiac surgery and mirrors the success of a multidisciplinary team aiming to minimize adverse events by optimizing antibiotic use.
