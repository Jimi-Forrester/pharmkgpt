34439640|t|The Assessment of Serum Concentrations of AGEs and Their Soluble Receptor (sRAGE) in Multiple Sclerosis Patients.
34439640|a|BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of the study was to determine serum concentrations of AGEs and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) in MS patients and healthy controls and to investigate their possible influence on disease activity. METHODS: Serum concentrations of AGE and sRAGE in patients with MS and healthy controls were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The mean serum AGE concentration in patients with MS was higher than in healthy controls, whereas the mean serum sRAGE concentration was lower than in the control group. However, the differences were not statistically significant. In MS patients, serum AGE and sRAGE concentrations did not differ significantly, depending on the duration of the disease and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sclerosis may be accompanied by disturbances of the AGE-sRAGE axis. However, further studies are warranted to confirm it. The duration of the disease and the degree of disability do not seem to affect the progression of the glycation process, particularly in the stable phase of the disease.
