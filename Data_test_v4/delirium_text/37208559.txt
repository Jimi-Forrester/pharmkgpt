37208559|a|BACKGROUND: Lipid-lowering medications are widely used to control blood cholesterol levels and manage a range of cardiovascular and lipid disorders. We aimed to explore the possible associations between LDL-lowering and multiple disease outcomes or biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a Mendelian randomisation phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) in 337,475 UK Biobank participants to test for associations between four proposed LDL-C-lowering genetic risk scores (PCSK9, HMGCR, NPC1L1 and LDLR) and 1135 disease outcomes, with follow-up MR analyses in 52 serum, urine, imaging, and clinical biomarkers. We used inverse variance weighted MR in the main analyses and complementary MR methods (weighted median, weighted mode, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO) as sensitivity analyses. We accounted for multiple testing with false discovery rate correction (p<2.0 x 10-4 for phecodes, p<1.3 x 10-2 for biomarkers). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found evidence for an association between genetically instrumented LDL-lowering and 10 distinct disease outcomes, suggesting potential causality. All genetic instruments were associated with hyperlipidaemias and cardiovascular diseases in the expected directions. Biomarker analyses supported an effect of LDL-C lowering through PCSK9 on lung function [FEV (beta per 1mg/dL lower LDL-C -1.49, 95% CI -2.21, -0.78); FVC (-1.42, 95% CI -2.29, -0.54)] and through HMGCR on hippocampal volume (beta per 1mg/dL lower LDL-C 6.09, 95% CI 1.74, 10.44). CONCLUSION: We found genetic evidence to support both positive and negative effects of LDL-C lowering through all four LDL-C-lowering pathways. Future studies should further explore the effects of LDL-C lowering on lung function and changes in brain volume.
