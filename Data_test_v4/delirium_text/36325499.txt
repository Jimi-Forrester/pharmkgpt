36325499|t|Comparative Analysis of Antioxidants Activity of Indigenously Produced Moringa Oleifera Seeds Extracts.
36325499|a|Medicinal plants are used to control and remediate oxidative stress related diseases caused by free radicals. Thus, these plants find their use as remedy. Moringa oleifera is an extremely valued plant for its medicinal properties. Herein, two indigenously produced accessions of Moringa oleifera seeds [originated from Multan (M-Mln) and India (PKM1)] were investigated for their antioxidant properties by 2.2-Diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, total phenolics content and total flavonoids content. The presence of various phenolics as well as flavonoids was further confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy detected the presence of various functional groups. In conclusion, these findings revealed that the methanol extract of M-Mln variety seeds showed high antioxidant potential, having IC50 value of 84 mug/ml. While, hexane extract of PKM1 showed least activity. The methanol extract of M-Mln was found to show highest total phenolics content as 33.83 +- 1.19 mg GAE/g. The methanol extract of M-Mln was found to show highest total flavonoids content as 76.07 +- 1.10 mg CAE/g. The hexane extract of PKM1 was found to show least total flavonoids content as 22.47 +- 1.70 mg CAE/g. The detection of phenolics (ferulic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, coumaric acid, and gallic acid) as well as flavonoids (catechin and quercetin) revealed the potential of methanol extracts of both varieties as a good source of antioxidants. The results indicated the importance of seed extracts in the treatment of oxidative stress related diseases. In future, the use of natural antioxidants will prevent the progression of diseases.
