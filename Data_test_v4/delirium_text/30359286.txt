30359286|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric solid tumor that originates from neural crest-derived sympathoadrenal precursor cells that are committed to development of sympathetic nervous system. The well differentiated histological phenotype of NB tumor cells has been reportedly associated with favorable patient outcome. Retinoic acid (RA) can effectively induce NB cell differentiation, thereby being used in the clinic as a treatment agent for inducing the differentiation of high-risk NB. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of regulating differentiation remain elusive. METHODS: The correlation between clinical characteristics, survival and the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) expression were assessed using a neuroblastic tumor tissue microarray, and then validated in three independent patient datasets. The different expression of UCHL1 in ganglioneuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma and NB was detected by immunohistochemistry, mass spectra and immunoblotting analysis, and the correlation between UCHL1 expression and the differentiated histology was analyzed, which was also validated in three independent patient datasets. Furthermore, the roles of UCHL1 in NB cell differentiation and proliferation and the underlying mechanisms were studied by using short hairpin RNA and its inhibitor LDN57444 in vitro. RESULTS: Based on our neuroblastic tumor tissue microarrays and three independent validation datasets (Oberthuer, Versteeg and Seeger), we identified that UCHL1 served as a prognostic marker for better clinical outcome in NB. We further demonstrated that high UCHL1 expression was associated with NB differentiation, indicated by higher UCHL1 expression in ganglioneuroblastomas/ganglioneuromas and well-differentiated NB than poorly differentiated NB, and the positive correlation between UCHL1 and differentiation markers. As expected, inhibiting UCHL1 by knockdown or LDN57444 could significantly inhibit RA-induced neural differentiation of NB tumor cells, characterized by decreased neurite outgrowth and neural differentiation markers. This effect of UCHL1 was associated with positively regulating RA-induced AKT and ERK1/2 signaling activation. What's more, knockdown of UCHL1 conferred resistance to RA-induced growth arrest. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify a pivotal role of UCHL1 in NB cell differentiation and as a prognostic marker for survival in patients with NB, potentially providing a novel therapeutic target for NB.
