38427248|t|Enzyme Inhibition Assays for Monoamine Oxidase.
38427248|a|Monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamines with two isoforms, namely, MAO-A and MAO-B, in mitochondrial outer membranes. These two types of MAO-A and MAO-B participate in changes in levels of neurotransmitter such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and dopamine. Selective MAO-A inhibitors have been targeted for anti-depression treatment, while selective MAO-B inhibitors are targets of therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. For this reason, study on the development of MAO inhibitors has recently become important. Here, we describe methods of MAO activity assay, especially continuous spectrophotometric methods, which give relatively high accuracy. MAO-A and MAO-B can be assayed using kynuramine and benzylamine as substrates, respectively, at 316 nm and 250 nm, respectively, to measure their respective products, 4-hydroxyquinoline and benzaldehyde. Inhibition degree and pattern can be analyzed by using the Lineweaver-Burk and secondary plots in the presence of inhibitor, and reversibility of inhibitor can be determined by using the dialysis method.
