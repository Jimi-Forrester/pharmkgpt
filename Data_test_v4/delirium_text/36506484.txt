36506484|a|Background: Tooth loss is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we reported that tooth loss induced memory impairment in amyloid precursor protein knock-in mice by decreasing neuronal activity and synaptic protein levels and increasing glial activation, neuroinflammation, and pyramidal neuronal cell loss without altering amyloid-beta levels in the hippocampus. However, the effects of tooth loss in young wild-type mice have not been explored yet. Objective: We investigated the effects of tooth loss on memory impairment, neuronal activity, synaptic protein levels, glial activation, and pyramidal neuronal cell loss in young wild-type mice. Methods: Two-month-old wild-type mice were randomly divided into control and tooth loss groups. In the tooth loss group, maxillary molar teeth on both sides were extracted, whereas no teeth were extracted in the control group. Two months after tooth extraction, we performed a novel object recognition test to evaluate memory function. Glial activation, neuronal activity, synaptic protein levels, and the number of pyramidal neurons were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Results: The tooth loss group exhibited memory impairment and decreased neuronal activity and the levels of synaptic proteins in both the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, tooth loss increased the activation of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and glial activation and reduced the number of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Tooth loss in the young wild-type mice will attenuate neuronal activity, decrease synaptic protein levels, and induce pyramidal neuronal loss, and eventually lead to memory impairment.
