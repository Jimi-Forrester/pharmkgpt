36178224|a|A critical review of literature data on the toxic effects of mercury and arsenic on the human brain and their relationship with the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases is presented. In the first case, the toxic effect of mercury and arsenic on the brain stimulates oxidative stress, which leads to the formation of free oxygen species and a decrease in the antioxidant defense of neurons. In the second case, the harmful effect of mercury changes the structure and properties of beta-amyloid, and the toxic effect of arsenic contributes to its accumulation. In the pathogenesis of the diseases under consideration, particular importance is attached to the reaction of astrocytes that initiate neuroinflammation, which is also characteristic of mercury and arsenic intoxication. Considering that the symptoms recorded during intoxication with mercury and arsenic are in many respects similar to those of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and their pathogenetic mechanisms (oxidative stress and neuroinflammation) coincide, then the toxic effects of mercury and arsenic in neurodegenerative diseases analyzed in this review can be characterized as the influence of the most significant risk factors.
