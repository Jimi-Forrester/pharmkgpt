35017419|t|Small interfering RNAs based therapies for intracerebral hemorrhage: challenges and progress in drug delivery systems.
35017419|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke associated with higher rates of mortality. Currently, no effective drug treatment is available for ICH. The molecular pathways following ICH are complicated and diverse. Nucleic acid therapeutics such as gene knockdown by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been developed in recent years to modulate ICH's destructive pathways and mitigate its outcomes. However, siRNAs delivery to the central nervous system is challenging and faces many roadblocks. Existing barriers to systemic delivery of siRNA limit the use of naked siRNA; therefore, siRNA-vectors developed to protect and deliver these therapies into the specific-target areas of the brain, or cell types seem quite promising. Efficient delivery of siRNA via nanoparticles emerged as a viable and effective alternative therapeutic tool for central nervous system-related diseases. This review discusses the obstacles to siRNA delivery, including the advantages and disadvantages of viral and nonviral vectors. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in nanotherapeutics areas, primarily focusing on the delivery system of siRNA for ICH treatment.
