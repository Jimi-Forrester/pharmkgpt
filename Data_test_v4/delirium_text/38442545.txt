38442545|t|Herpes simplex encephalitis initially presenting without fever or cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and with typical neuroimaging findings.
38442545|a|Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a common viral encephalitis that can be fatal if not adequately treated. Fever, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and typical neuroimaging findings are commonly observed in HSE cases. We encountered a patient with HSE who did not exhibit these classic clinical features. A 63-year-old male presented with his first-ever seizure. Fever did not develop until the fourth day of admission, and neither neuroimaging nor CSF analysis revealed abnormalities. Under suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis, methylprednisolone was administered. Subsequently, when the patient developed fever, a follow-up neuroimaging study was performed and revealed abnormalities consistent with HSE. The patient was promptly treated with acyclovir, which led to a full recovery. Diagnosing HSE in patients who present without fever or CSF pleocytosis and with typical neuroimaging findings poses a challenge. Therefore, prior to initiating immunosuppressive treatment, it is crucial to closely observe patients and to conduct follow-up tests, including neuroimaging and CSF analysis.
