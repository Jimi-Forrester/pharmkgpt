39103717|a|BACKGROUND: Neurologically critically ill patients present with unique disease trajectories, prognostic uncertainties, and challenges to end-of-life (EOL) care. Acute brain injuries place these patients at risk for underrecognized symptoms and unmet EOL management needs, which can negatively affect their quality of care and lead to complicated grief in surviving loved ones. To care for patients nearing the EOL in the neurointensive care unit, health care clinicians must consider neuroanatomic localization, barriers to symptom assessment and management, unique aspects of the dying process, and EOL management needs. AIM: We aim to define current best practices, barriers, and future directions for EOL care of the neurologically critically ill patient.
