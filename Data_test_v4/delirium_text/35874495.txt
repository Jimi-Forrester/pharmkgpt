35874495|a|Background: Many neurodegenerative such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress which is a key event in neuronal death process. Thus, anticholinesterase and anti-oxidation compounds are two promising strategies in the development of AD drugs. Beyond their culinary use, spices are today studies for health purpose. In this study, some spices consumed in Cameroon were evaluated for their anticholinesterase and neuroprotective effects. Methods: Colorimetric methods were used to determine total flavonoid and alkaloid content of a combinated extract (hydroethanolic + ethanolic extracts) of different selected spices. Aftermaths, anti-cholinesterase activity of spice extract was carried out using Ellman's method. Finally, neuroprotective effects performed on human SK-N-SH cells stressed with H2O2 by assessing neuronal survival ( resazurin assay) and neuronal death (LDH assay). Results: Flavonoid content of spices extract were ranged from 22.94 to 32.01 mg EQ/g DM and alkaloid content were ranged from 320 to 896 mg EQu/g DM. Among the spices studied, Xylopia parviflora presented the greatest acetylcholinesterase inhibition with an IC50 = 14 microg/mL. In Cell culture experiments, pre-incubation of SK-N-SH cell with the selected spices at different concentrations were improved neuronal survival and reduced the percentage of neuronal cells dead. Conclusion: The present results reveal that selected spices consumed in Cameroon have good anticholinesterase activity as well as neuroprotective effect on SK-N-SH which may provide new natural compounds that could help in the management of Alzheimer's disease.
