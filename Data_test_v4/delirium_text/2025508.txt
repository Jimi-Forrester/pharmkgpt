2025508|a|Recent advances have been made in defining the imaging findings associated with degenerative brain disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, and multiple sclerosis. CT and MR imaging are capable of evaluating structural changes seen in these abnormalities. Positron emission tomography and single-photon emission CT studies, by evaluating metabolic changes, may demonstrate abnormalities before those seen on CT or MR imaging. Recent articles pertaining to the imaging of degenerative brain disorders are reviewed and discussed.
