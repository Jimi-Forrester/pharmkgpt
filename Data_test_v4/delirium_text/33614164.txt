33614164|a|Research into the neurogenetic basis of addiction identified and characterized by Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) includes all drug and non-drug addictive, obsessive and compulsive behaviors. We are proposing herein that a new model for the prevention and treatment of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) a subset of RDS behaviors, based on objective biologic evidence, should be given serious consideration in the face of a drug epidemic. The development of the Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS) followed seminal research in 1990, whereby, Blum's group identified the first genetic association with severe alcoholism published in JAMA. While it is true that no one to date has provided adequate RDS free controls there have been many studies using case -controls whereby SUD has been eliminated. We argue that this deficiency needs to be addressed in the field and if adopted appropriately many spurious results would be eliminated reducing confusion regarding the role of genetics in addiction. However, an estimation, based on these previous literature results provided herein, while not representative of all association studies known to date, this sampling of case- control studies displays significant associations between alcohol and drug risk. In fact, we present a total of 110,241 cases and 122,525 controls derived from the current literature. We strongly suggest that while we may take argument concerning many of these so-called controls (e.g. blood donors) it is quite remarkable that there are a plethora of case -control studies indicating selective association of these risk alleles ( measured in GARS) for the most part indicating a hypodopaminergia. The paper presents the detailed methodology of the GARS. Data collection procedures, instrumentation, and the analytical approach used to obtain GARS and subsequent research objectives are described. Can we combat SUD through early genetic risk screening in the addiction field enabling early intervention by the induction of dopamine homeostasis? It is envisaged that GARS type of screening will provide a novel opportunity to help identify causal pathways and associated mechanisms of genetic factors, psychological characteristics, and addictions awaiting additional scientific evidence including a future meta- analysis of all available data -a work in progress.
