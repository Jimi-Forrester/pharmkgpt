27757059|t|Neuropsychiatric genomics in precision medicine: diagnostics, gene discovery, and translation.
27757059|a|Only a few years after its development, next-generation sequencing is rapidly becoming an essential part of clinical care for patients with serious neurological conditions, especially in the diagnosis of early-onset and severe presentations. Beyond this diagnostic role, there has been an explosion in definitive gene discovery in a range of neuropsychiatric diseases. This is providing new pointers to underlying disease biology and is beginning to outline a new framework for genetic stratification of neuropsychiatric disease, with clear relevance to both individual treatment optimization and clinical trial design. Here, we outline these developments and chart the expected impact on the treatment of neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disease.
