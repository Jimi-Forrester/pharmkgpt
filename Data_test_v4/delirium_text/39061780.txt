39061780|t|Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy in the Determination of the Dielectric Properties of Tau-441 Protein for Dielectrophoresis Response Prediction.
39061780|a|This study employs electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to probe the behavior of Tau-441 protein, a key component implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Through meticulous experimentation and analysis, the impedance of Tau-441 protein suspension revealed a conductivity peak value of 1.02 S/m. The study demonstrates a high level of specificity and selectivity, particularly within the challenging nanomolar concentration range. Additionally, the EIS method enabled the prediction of Tau-441 protein's dielectrophoresis (DEP) response and the determination of the associated frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of the molecular intricacies surrounding Tau-441 and hold promise for unraveling implications related to Alzheimer's disease. This study establishes a robust foundation for future research on neurodegenerative disease and biosciences, offering valuable insights into the electrochemical dynamics of Tau-441 protein.
