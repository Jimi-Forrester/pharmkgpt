39736565|a|INTRODUCTION: Calf muscular vein thrombosis (CMVT) is a type of distal deep vein thrombosis, which is common in geriatric hip fracture patients. However, studies focusing on whether the orthopedic operation has an impact on the prognosis of geriatric hip fracture patients with CMVT are very limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether geriatric hip fractures with CMVT affect the mortality of patients within one year postoperatively. The difficulty of the operation, postoperative complications, the status of thrombosis, and function scores were also compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Geriatric hip fracture patients who underwent surgery between January 2019 and January 2021 were included. Patients were divided into groups with and without CMVT by preoperative color Doppler ultrasound examination. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was performed in a ratio of 1:1 between the patient with and without CMVT groups. Baseline characteristics, laboratory results, perioperative indicators and prognosis of patients were collected retrospectively. Intraoperative and postoperative comparisons were conducted between patients with and without CMVT. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty geriatric hip fracture patients were included. Eighty-nine patients in each group were matched after PSM. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups at one-month, three-month, six-month, and one-year postoperatively. However, patients with CMVT had longer hospital stays, a higher incidence of postoperative complications, and a higher incidence of thrombosis progression than patients without CMVT in the follow-up. CONCLUSION: No significant difference in mortality within one year postoperatively was observed in Chinese geriatric hip fracture patients with or without CMVT formation. Strategies such as close monitoring the status of thrombosis, individualized care, and strengthening rehabilitation are recommended to reduce the risk of complications and optimize patient outcomes in this patient population.
