31167157|a|Being among the top five causes of death in the developed world, Alzheimer's disease represents a major socio-economic issue. We administered a single intramuscular dose of two new hybrid anti-Alzheimer's compounds, with 7-methoxytacrine (7-MEOTA; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and tryptophan (inhibitor of amyloid accumulation) in their structure, to rats. Using validated ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) methods, we uncovered their inability to enter the site of action - the brain. We discuss four possible explanations: i) physico-chemical properties, ii) lack of active/facilitated transport, iii) effective efflux and/or iv) extensive metabolism. High-resolution mass spectrometric analyses proved that the compounds are easily hydrolysed at amide bond between tryptophan and the linker both in vitro and in vivo. Contrary to the parent compounds these metabolites - analogues of 7-MEOTA - can enter the brain in significant amounts.
