21841262|a|Autobiographical memory comprises memories of one's own past that are characterized by a sense of subjective time and autonoetic awareness. Although autobiographical memory deficits are among the major complaints of patients with dementia, they have rarely been systematically assessed in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. We therefore investigated semantic and episodic aspects of autobiographical memory for remote and recent life periods in a sample of 239 nursing home residents (165 in different stages of Alzheimer's disease, 33 with mild cognitive impairment, and 41 cognitively unimpaired) with respect to potential confounders. Episodic autobiographical memories, especially the richness of details, were impaired early in the course of Alzheimer's disease or even in the preclinical phase, while semantic memories were spared until moderate stages, indicating a dissociation between both memory systems. The examination of autobiographic memory loss can facilitate the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
