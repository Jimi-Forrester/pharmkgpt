12637040|a|Thomas Willis (1621-1675), author of the classical work Cerebri Anatome (1664), was arguably the father of the modern era of neurology. His clinical neurology, as described in his Pathologiae Cerebri (1667) and De Anima Brutorum (1672), was largely derived from personal observations and not from traditional authorities and was based around his concept of the animal spirits, a fictitious entity in many ways analogous to the present day idea of the nerve impulse. This concept allowed him to develop a pathology of the animal spirits which embraced the whole content of the clinical neurology and psychiatry of his times. The anatomical and physiological background to Willis' concepts of animal spirit dysfunction, and those disorders he regarded as due to disturbed function of intrinsically normal animal spirits, have been dealt with in the previous part of this paper. The disorders he attributed to intrinsically abnormal animal spirits, dealt with in this part of the paper, comprised two categories. In one, the animal spirits possessed explosive properties, whilst in the other the abnormalities were non-explosive in their nature. The former category included epilepsy, hysteria and hypochondriasis, whilst the latter included mainly disorders now considered psychiatric e.g. delirium, melancholy, madness and stupidity. Willis' ideas about the pathogenesis of nervous system disorder seem never to have been generally accepted, partly because they appeared at a time when others were increasingly calling into question the existence of the animal spirits. Nevertheless, Willis' attempt to record and interpret all nervous system disease on the basis of disorder of function of a single underlying mechanism represents a formidable synthetic intellectual endeavour on the part of a very busy physician.
