38928733|t|Unraveling the In Vitro Anti-Advanced Glycation End-Product (Anti-AGE) Potential of Fermented Red Cabbage and Beetroot: Insights into Composition and Activities.
38928733|a|This study verified the in vitro activity of red cabbage and beetroot against the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and their relationship with the biomolecules' content. Fermentation of cabbage increased the total phenolic (~10%) and flavonoid contents (~14%), whereas decreased total phenolics/flavonoids in beetroot. Fermented cabbage exhibited higher ability against AGEs, i.e., 17% in the bovine serum albumin-methylglyoxal (BSA-MGO) model and 25% in the BSA-glucose model, while beetroot exhibited 23% and 18%, respectively. The major compounds of cabbage products were cyanidin 3-(sinapoyl)(sinapoyl)-diglucoside-5-glucoside, sinapic acid, and epicatechin. Syringic acid and epicatechin were predominantly present in fermented beetroot. 2,17-bidecarboxy- and 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-betanin were the major betalains. Fermented vegetables can be effective inhibitors of the AGE formation/accumulation and could be recommended in the prevention of diet-related diseases.
