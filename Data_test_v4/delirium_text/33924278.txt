33924278|t|Efficacy and Safety of Inhalation Sedation during Office Probing for Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction.
33924278|a|We compared the effectiveness of inhaled sevoflurane versus physical restraint during probing in children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO). We performed a retrospective review of children with CNLDO who underwent office probing procedures by a single surgeon under sedation or restraint. Patients' characteristics at the time of probing, including age, sex, laterality, previous non-surgical treatment, presence of dacryocystitis, outcomes of probing, and complications were compared between the sedation and restraint groups. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the prognostic factors associated with the success of probing. A subgroup analysis by 12 months of age was also conducted. The overall success rate was 88.6% in 202 eyes of 180 consecutive children (mean age, 15.1 +- 7.7 months). The sedation group had a marginally higher success rates than the restraint group (93.8% vs. 85.1%, p = 0.056). The success rate was not significantly different between the two groups in children aged <12 months (90.9% vs. 93.1%, p = 0.739), but it was significantly higher in the sedation group (94.7% vs. 77.8%. p = 0.006) in children aged >=12 months. Inhalation sedation was the most potent factor associated with success (adjusted odds ratio = 5.56, 95% confidence interval = 1.33-23.13, p = 0.018) in children aged >=12 months. There were no surgical or sedation-related complications intra- and postoperatively. Inhaled sevoflurane sedation resulted in more successful, controlled, painless probing, particularly in children aged >=12 months. It represents a safe, efficient alternative to general anesthesia.
