30310425|t|At the Heart of Brain Disorders - Preventing Cognitive Decline and Dementia.
30310425|a|Vascular risk factors are shared by heart and brain. Vascular brain injury (small vessel disease, stroke) alone or combined with neurodegenerative pathology (beta-amyloid depositions) brings about either cognitive decline and vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Long-term exposure to vascular risk factors precedes the onset of neurocognitive diseases by one or two decades. Early detection and control of modifiable vascular risk factors seem to be the only current strategies to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia.
