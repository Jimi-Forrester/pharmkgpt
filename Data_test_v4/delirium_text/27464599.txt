METHODS: Of 603 consecutive patients from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center dataset (FTLD = 350; AD = 253), 120 FTLDs were included in a Rasch analysis to verify CDR-FTLD psychometric properties; 483 (FTLD = 230; AD = 253) were included to analyse disease progression, with 195 (FTLD = 82; AD = 113) followed-up (24 months). RESULTS: The CDR-FTLD demonstrated good consistency, construct and concurrent validity and correlated well with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and disease duration (ps < 0.05). At baseline, FTLD showed greater dementia severity than AD after matched for MMSE and disease duration (p < 0.001). Independent Rasch analyses demonstrated different patterns of progression for FTLD and AD in terms of the domains initially and then subsequently affected with disease progression. At follow-up, although MMSE showed significant changes (p < 0.05), these were greater on the CDR-FTLD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The CDR-FTLD satisfactorily measures dementia severity and change in FTLD, distinguishing disease progression between FTLD and AD, with clear implications for care, prognosis and future clinical trials.   2016 The Authors.
