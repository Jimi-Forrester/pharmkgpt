30092581|t|A Point Prevalence Study of Delirium in Italian Nursing Homes.
30092581|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common geriatric syndrome. Few studies have been conducted in nursing home (NH) residents. The aim of this project was to perform a point prevalence study of delirium in Italian NHs. METHODS: Data collected in 71 NHs are presented. Inclusion criteria were age >=65 years and native Italian speaker. Exclusion criteria were coma, aphasia, and end-of-life status. Sociodemographic and medical data were recorded. Delirium was assessed using the Assessment Test for Delirium and Cognitive Impairment (4-AT). Patients with a 4-AT score >=4 were considered to have delirium. Motor subtype was evaluated using the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS). RESULTS: A total of 1,454 patients were evaluated (mean age 84.4 +- 7.4 years, 70.2% female), of whom 535 (36.8%) had delirium. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, variables significantly associated with delirium were education (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97), dementia (OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.38-4.09), functional dependence (OR 6.13, 95% CI 3.08-12.19 for ADL score 0; OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.03-3.84 for ADL score 1-5), malnutrition (OR 4.87, 95% CI 2.68-8.84), antipsychotics (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.81-3.18), and physical restraints (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.71-3.59). CONCLUSION: Delirium is common in older NH residents. Simple assessment tools might facilitate its recognition in this vulnerable population.
