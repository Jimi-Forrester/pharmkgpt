36754930|t|Daridorexant in Insomnia Disorder: A Profile of Its Use.
36754930|a|Daridorexant (Quviviq ) is a useful option for the treatment of insomnia disorder, which has shown efficacy in younger and older adults. It antagonises the orexin receptors, thereby reducing the wake drive. Daridorexant is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist to be approved for the treatment of chronic insomnia in the EU and has been approved for insomnia in the USA. In phase 3 clinical trials, daridorexant dose-dependently improved objective latency to persistent sleep, objective wake time after sleep onset, subjective total sleep time and, at the 50 mg dose, subjective daytime functioning compared with placebo. Daridorexant was generally well tolerated. Adverse events (AEs) commonly associated with insomnia drugs, such as somnolence, fatigue and dizziness, occurred at a similar or slightly greater frequency with daridorexant than with placebo. Falls occurred at a similar or lower frequency with daridorexant than with placebo. Most AEs were mild in severity and the incidence was not dose-dependent. The efficacy of daridorexant was maintained during a 12-month extension trial, with no new safety or tolerability concerns.
