35433531|t|Case Report: COVID-19-Associated ROHHAD-Like Syndrome.
35433531|a|It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may cause neurologic damage. Rapid-onset obesity, hypoventilation, hypothalamus dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is a disease of unknown etiology with a progressive course and unclear outcomes. The etiology of ROHHAD syndrome includes genetic, epigenetic, paraneoplastic, and immune-mediated theories, but to our knowledge, viral-associated cases of the disease have not been described yet. Here we present the case of a 4-year-old girl who developed a ROHHAD syndrome-like phenotype after a COVID-19 infection and the results of 5 months of therapy. She had COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by electrolyte disturbances (hypernatremia and hyperchloremia), hypocorticism and hypothyroidism, central hypoventilation-requiring prolonged assisted lung ventilation-bulimia, and progressive obesity with hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperinsulinemia. The repeated MRI of the brain and hypothalamic-pituitary region with contrast enhancement showed mild post-hypoxic changes. Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome as well as PHOX2B-associated variants was ruled out. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and monthly courses of intravenous immunoglobulin led to a dramatic improvement. Herein the first description of ROHHAD-like syndrome is timely associated with a previous COVID-19 infection with possible primarily viral or immune-mediated hypothalamic involvement.
