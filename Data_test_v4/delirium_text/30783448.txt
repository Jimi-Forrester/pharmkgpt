30783448|t|Effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway on JNK3 in Parkinsonian rats.
30783448|a|Effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway on the expression of JNK3 in Parkinsonian rats was investigated. A total of 200 rats were used for Parkinson's disease (PD) modeling and 180 models were successfully established. Rats were randomly divided into four groups including A, B, C, and D, 45 in each group. Group A was control group and no inhibitor was given. Group B was given PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Group C was given rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin; and group D was given inhibitor LY294002 and inhibitor rapamycin. JNK3 mRNA expression was detected by RT-qPCR and expression of p-mTOR protein and JNK3 protein was detected by western blot analysis. Expression level of JNK3 mRNA and protein in groups C and D was significantly lower than that in group B (P<0.01). Expression level of JNK3 mRNA and protein in group D was significantly lower than that in group C (P<0.01). Relative expression level of p-mTOR protein in groups C and D was significantly lower than that in group B (P<0.01). Relative expression level of JNK3 protein in group D was significantly lower than that in group C (P<0.01). Pearson's correlation analysis showed that expression of JNK3 mRNA was positively correlated with the expression of JNK3 protein and Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.98 (P<0.01). There was also a positive correlation between the expression of JNK3 mRNA and the expression of p-mTOR protein and Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.95 (P<0.01). Expression of JNK3 protein was positively correlated with the expression of p-mTOR protein, and the Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.93 (P<0.01). Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is negatively correlated with the expression of JNK3. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway leads to a decrease in the expression of JNK3, which protects dopaminergic neurons and improves PD.
