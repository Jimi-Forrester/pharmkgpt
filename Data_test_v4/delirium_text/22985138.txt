22985138|a|OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative effects of environment, comorbidities, stage of dementia and other variables on disability onset. DESIGN: A 1-year prospective cohort study was conducted in which the walking and eating abilities of long-term care residents were observed fortnightly. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the contributions of individual and environmental factors to the onset of disability. SETTING: Fifteen nursing homes in western Canada. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty residents with middle-stage Alzheimer disease or related dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Environmental quality was assessed using the Professional Environmental Assessment Protocol, comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and stage of dementia using the Global Deterioration Scale. RESULTS: More-advanced baseline dementia had a direct effect on onset of walking and eating disability (standardized maximum likelihood estimate (SMLE) = 0.24, P = .006). Resident environment (SMLE = -0.25, P = .007) and comorbidities (SMLE = 0.32, P < .001) influenced disability onset approximately as strongly as stage of dementia. Smaller and publicly owned facilities provided superior environmental quality, which indirectly contributed to a delay in onset of walking and eating disability. CONCLUSION: Environmental quality and extent of comorbidity are at least as important as progression of dementia in initiating or delaying the onset of disability.
