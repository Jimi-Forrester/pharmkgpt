30775404|t|Transcriptional Targeting and MicroRNA Regulation of Lentiviral Vectors.
30775404|a|Gene expression regulation is the result of complex interactions between transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls, resulting in cell-type-specific gene expression patterns that are determined by the developmental and differentiation stage of pathophysiological conditions. Understanding the complexity of gene expression regulatory networks is fundamental to gene therapy, an approach which has the potential to treat and cure inherited disorders by delivering the correct gene to patient specific cells or tissues by means of both viral and non-viral vectors. Besides the issues of biosafety, in recent years efforts have focused on achieving a robust and sustained transgene expression, which attains a phenotypic correction in several diseases, while avoiding transgene-related adverse effects, such as overexpression-associated cytotoxicity and/or immune responses to the transgene. In this sense, the use of cell-type-specific promoters and microRNA target sequences (miRTs) in gene transfer expression cassettes have allowed for a restricted expression after gene transfer in several studies. This review will focus on the use of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation to achieve a highly specific and safe transgene expression, as well as their application in ex vivo and in vivo gene therapeutic approaches.
