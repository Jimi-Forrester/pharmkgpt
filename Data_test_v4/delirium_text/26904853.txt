26904853|t|[The Role of Leptin in Cognitive Development During Aging].
26904853|a|Brain aging is accompanied by alternations of brain structure, functions and the cognitive impairment. With respect to cognitive decline, the elderly population is far from homogeneous, as well as heterogeneous, which presents successful aging, normal aging, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Studies demonstrated that higher serum leptin levels are associated with normal cognition in older adults without significant neurological conditions, while it is lower in most mild cognitive impairment patients. Leptin can improve cognitive disorders and referred to as a potential cognitive enhancer. Therefore, low level of leptin plays an significant role in cognitive impairment development in elderly people.
