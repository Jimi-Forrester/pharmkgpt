38801651|t|Advancing Diversity in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research and Clinical Care: Lessons Learned from Educational and Career Trajectories of Recent Mentorship Program Graduates.
38801651|a|Underrepresented minorities (URMs) are disproportionately affected with aging-related conditions and have inadequate representation in gerontology and geriatrics professions. The Mentorship for Advancing Undergraduate Research on Aging (MADURA) Program aims to increase inclusion of URMs by improving undergraduate retention and success, increasing rates of graduate/medical school applications, and increasing entry into aging research/clinical employment. MADURA provides cohorts with faculty and peer mentorship, research skills training, paid research lab experiences and professional development opportunities. About 87% of the 2023 MADURA cohort intends to take 1+ year after receiving a Bachelor's degree, to prepare for graduate education. Planned activities include gaining work experience, preparing for standardized tests, and obtaining formal training to strengthen graduate/medical school applications. In addition to immediate graduate program acceptances, other student outcomes should be assessed. Longitudinal research on the effectiveness of various post-graduation pathways could assist Mentorship programs in supporting their graduates' longer term educational and career goal attainment.
