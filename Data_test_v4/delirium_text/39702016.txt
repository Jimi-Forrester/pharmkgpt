39702016|t|Catatonia-asossicated urinary retention in geriatric patients: a case series report.
39702016|a|BACKGROUND: Catatonia is an underdiagnosed neuropsychiatric condition, with only a few studies focusing on medical sequalae among elderly populations. Delayed treatment results in complications with high morbidity and mortality. Among elderly individuals, one such complication is urinary retention. Urinary retention can result in prolonged catheter use. In geriatric populations, prolonged use of catheters become particularly concerning and problematic as it can limit patient mobility, are potential sources for infection, and increase the risk for delirium. Catheter use has been independently associated with increased mortality in nursing home settings. Given the above risks and implications of catheter use, this case series describes clinical cases of catatonia-associated urinary retention specifically in older populations, whereby the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) resulted in resolution of urinary retention concurrent with resolution of depressive and catatonic symptoms using validated scales. CASE PRESENTATION: This study involved four patients ranging from 66-84 years old who met criteria for major depressive disorder and catatonia. At admission, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores ranged from 40-56, indicating severe illness in all patients. All patients also met criteria for catatonia as measured by the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS). During the admission, each patient experienced urinary retention as evidenced by post-void residual (PVR) bladder volumes ranging from 569-1400 mL. Medical workup was completed to exclude alternative causes for urinary retention. Each patient completed ECT treatment, ranging from 14-19 sessions which resulted in resolution of catatonia. All four patients were also noted to have PVR volumes ranging from 6-75 mL, thereby suggesting concurrent resolution of urinary retention. Posttreatment, the MADRS scores ranged from 3-16, indicating a mild or subthreshold index of illness. There was no recurrence of elevated post-void residual volumes, and therefore, all patients were discharged from hospital without the requirements of urinary catheter insertion. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, there are no case reports that describe the concurrent resolution of catatonia, depressive symptoms and urinary retention simultaneously using validated scales throughout the ECT treatment course. Furthermore, there are no prior reports describing catatonia-related urinary retention specifically among a group of geriatric populations. Identifying and treating catatonia in a timely manner can reduce the complications associated with prolonged catheter use. There remains a gap in current research to describe if there exists any overlapping mechanisms and pathways to explain how ECT can treat catatonia, depression, and catatonia-associated urinary retention.
