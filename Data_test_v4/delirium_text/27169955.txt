27169955|a|BACKGROUND: The mini-mental status examination (MMSE) includes a task in which participants are asked to write a sentence of their own choice. The emotional tone of the sentence may be related to the emotions of the writer; therefore, it was investigated whether the emotional tone of the sentence in the MMSE written by people with dementia was associated with health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was carried out based on the cross-sectional data of 107 people with dementia included in the "7th framework EU project RightTimePlaceCare". Two raters assessed the emotional tone of the sentence based on a standardized procedure as positive, neutral or negative. The association between the emotional tone of the sentence, health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms was investigated. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the quality of life in Alzheimer's disease questionnaire and depressive symptoms by the Cornell scale for depression in dementia questionnaire. RESULTS: The sentences were rated as either positive or neutral in both cases with 42 % and 16 % were judged to have a negative emotional tone. The variance analysis by ANOVA indicated significant differences between the three groups of sentences regarding health-related quality of life of the writer (p = 0.04). The results of the Scheffe test confirmed a significant difference between sentences with a positive and negative tone and the health-related quality of life where people who wrote a sentence with a negative tone showed a lower health-related quality of life (p = 0.043). No significant association was revealed regarding depressive symptoms (p = 0.97). CONCLUSION: It remains to be investigated in future studies whether the emotional tone is a reliable indicator of health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms of people with dementia, so that the written MMSE sentence can be used for diagnostic purposes.
