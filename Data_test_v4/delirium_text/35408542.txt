35408542|t|Design, Synthesis and Bioactivity Evaluation of Coumarin-BMT Hybrids as New Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors.
35408542|a|Coumarin possesses the aromatic group and showed plentiful activities, such as antioxidant, preventing asthma and antisepsis. In addition, coumarin derivatives usually possess good solubility, low cytotoxicity and excellent cell permeability. In our study, we synthesized the compound bridge methylene tacrine (BMT), which has the classical pharmacophore structure of Tacrine (THA). Based on the principle of active substructure splicing, BMT was used as a lead compound and synthesized coumarin-BMT hybrids by introducing coumarin to BMT. In this work, 21 novel hybrids of BMT and coumarin were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity on AChE. All obtained compounds present preferable inhibition. Compound 8b was the most active compound, with the value of Ki as 49.2 nM, which was higher than Galantamine (GAL) and lower than THA. The result of molecular docking showed that the highest binding free energy was -40.43 kcal/mol for compound 8b, which was an identical trend with the calculated Ki.
