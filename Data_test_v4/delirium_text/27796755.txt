27796755|t|Association of Plasma beta-Amyloid with Cognitive Performance and Decline in Chronic Kidney Disease.
27796755|a|Decreased beta-amyloid (Abeta) clearance from the brain has been suggested to contribute to cerebral Abeta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. Based on the idea of a dynamic Abeta equilibrium in different body compartments, plasma Abeta levels have been investigated as biomarker candidates for preclinical Alzheimer's pathology, yet with inconsistent results. Since the kidneys are involved in Abeta elimination from the blood, we evaluated how chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects the association between plasma Abeta and cognitive deficits and cognitive decline. In 28 CKD patients, stages 3-5D, and 26 control subjects with comparable vascular risk profile from the New Tools for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease (NTCVD) cohort, plasma total Abeta was determined with a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Cognition was evaluated using a comprehensive battery of ten neuropsychological tests at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Subjects with high plasma Abeta level (above median) demonstrated a significantly worse baseline cognitive performance than subjects exhibiting low Abeta level (summary score of global cognitive performance at baseline z = -0.46 +- 0.76 vs z = -0.08 +- 0.57, p = 0.045). Cognitive performance moderately decreased over the 2-year follow-up in subjects with high plasma Abeta level (Deltaz = -0.13 +- 0.51), but increased in subjects with low plasma Abeta level (Deltaz = 0.16 +- 0.41, p = 0.023). In linear regression analyses, baseline plasma Abeta was significantly associated with cognitive decline both in unadjusted analyses (beta = -0.28, 95% CI = -0.55 to -0.01) and analyses adjusted for age (beta = -0.27, 95% CI = -0.54 to -0.01). Our results suggest the utility of plasma Abeta level in predicting cognitive decline in patients suffering from CKD.
