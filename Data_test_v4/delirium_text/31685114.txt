31685114|t|Assessing Nursing and Pediatric Resident Understanding of Delirium in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.
31685114|a|Delirium is a common disease process in the pediatric critical care unit, yet practices for screening and prevention vary drastically between institutions. The authors hypothesized that surveying pediatric residents and nurses who care for patients in the intensive care setting would expose misunderstandings about delirium. They brought to light common incorrect beliefs that benzodiazepines are appropriate therapy for delirium and that children who are delirious will not have memories of the experience. Many nurses and residents listed that they were not comfortable or were extremely uncomfortable identifying delirious patients. Findings demonstrate an opportunity to improve on nursing and resident knowledge.
