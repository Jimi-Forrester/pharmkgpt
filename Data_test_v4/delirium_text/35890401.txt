35890401|t|Polymeric Nanosystems Applied for Metal-Based Drugs and Photosensitizers Delivery: The State of the Art and Recent Advancements.
35890401|a|Nanotechnology-based approaches for targeting the delivery and controlled release of metal-based therapeutic agents have revealed significant potential as tools for enhancing the therapeutic effect of metal-based agents and minimizing their systemic toxicities. In this context, a series of polymer-based nanosized systems designed to physically load or covalently conjugate metal-based therapeutic agents have been remarkably improving their bioavailability and anticancer efficacy. Initially, the polymeric nanocarriers were applied for platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents resulting in some nanoformulations currently in clinical tests and even in medical applications. At present, these nanoassemblies have been slowly expanding for nonplatinum-containing metal-based chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, for metal-based photosensitizers (PS) applied in photodynamic therapy (PDT), especially for cancer treatment, strategies employing polymeric nanocarriers have been investigated for almost 30 years. In this review, we address the polymeric nanocarrier-assisted metal-based therapeutics agent delivery systems with a specific focus on non-platinum systems; we explore some biological and physicochemical aspects of the polymer-metallodrug assembly. Finally, we summarize some recent advances in polymeric nanosystems coupled with metal-based compounds that present potential for successful clinical applications as chemotherapeutic or photosensitizing agents. We hope this review can provide a fertile ground for the innovative design of polymeric nanosystems for targeting the delivery and controlled release of metal-containing therapeutic agents.
