36590092|a|Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome with psychotic behavioral abnormalities and marked cognitive deficits. It is widely accepted that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. However, the etiology and pathology of the disease remain largely unexplored. Recently, the synaptopathology and the dysregulated synaptic plasticity and function have emerging as intriguing and prominent biological mechanisms of schizophrenia pathogenesis. Synaptic plasticity is the ability of neurons to change the strength of their connections in response to internal or external stimuli, which is essential for brain development and function, learning and memory, and vast majority of behavior responses relevant to psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia. Here, we reviewed molecular and cellular mechanisms of the multiple forms synaptic plasticity, and the functional regulations of schizophrenia-risk factors including disease susceptible genes and environmental alterations on synaptic plasticity and animal behavior. Recent genome-wide association studies have provided fruitful findings of hundreds of risk gene variances associated with schizophrenia, thus further clarifying the role of these disease-risk genes in synaptic transmission and plasticity will be beneficial to advance our understanding of schizophrenia pathology, as well as the molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity.
