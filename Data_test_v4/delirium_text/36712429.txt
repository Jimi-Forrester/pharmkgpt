36712429|t|Serum neurofilament light chain in myasthenia gravis subgroups: An exploratory cohort and case-Control study.
36712429|a|Background: This study aimed to evaluate the association of neurofilament light chain (Nfl) with neuromuscular destruction and disease severity in the serum of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Materials and methods: Sera from 134 patients with MG with varying degrees of disease severity and autoantibody (Abs) status were analyzed and compared to controls in a cross-sectional design. Prospectively, we additionally measured serum NfL (sNfl) levels in patients with MG longitudinally for up to 3 years. Based on linear regression, differences between patients and controls were assessed. With correlation coefficients and mixed linear regression, the association among sNfl levels, socio-demographics, disease activity (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale), Abs-status (acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-Abs), muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibody (MuSK-Abs), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), and seronegative), Abs titer, treatment regime (pyridostigmine, steroids, and immunosuppressive therapies), and thymectomy were investigated. Results: sNfl levels were higher in patients with MG compared to controls (median: 11.2 vs. 7.88), where sNfl levels were highest in anti-AChR-Abs positive patients (median 12.6), followed by anti-MuSK-Abs positive, anti-LRP4-Abs positive, and seronegative patients. Adjusting for age and sex, sNfl levels of patients with MG were on average 35% higher compared to controls (35.1, 95% CI: 8.4;68.3) and highest for patients with seronegative MG (44.35; 95% CI 16.47; 78.90). We found no relevant relationship between individual changes in sNfl and changes in QMG and MG-ADL scores. Conclusion: sNfl levels are higher in patients with MG than in controls but were not consistently associated with clinical severity. Thus, sNfl is not a suitable biomarker to monitor individual disease progression in patients with MG.
