34568122|t|Prognostic importance of deranged sodium level in critically ill patients: A systemic literature to review.
34568122|a|It is common upon admission or during stay at a hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) for patients to present with or acquire a serum sodium abnormality. Hyponatremia, serum sodium level less than 135 mmol/L, frequently associated with critical illnesses such as heart failure and liver cirrhosis, is an indicator of disease severity as well as a risk factor for poor prognosis. Hypernatremia, serum sodium level greater than 145 mmol/L, results due to any ailment disabling a patient's modality of thirst or the ability to relieve it once sensed. Hypernatremia has a more frequent iatrogenic component than hyponatremia. It can develop insidiously among patients through IV fluid administration of saline; both its presentation upon admission and development during stay is associated with mortality. Hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and its treatment with morbidity as it carries a risk of overcorrection and consequently the development of central pontine myelinolysis. This review article covers the findings, and subsequent correlation between findings sought, of six articles catering to underscore the correlation between sodium disorders and prognosis of hospitalized or critically ill patients. PubMed search engine was utilized to select articles befitting the purpose of this review. Cumulatively, this review article substantiates the need to diligently evaluate and treat serum sodium disorders in hospitalized patients to achieve better prognosis.
