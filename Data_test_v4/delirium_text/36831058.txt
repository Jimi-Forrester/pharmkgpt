36831058|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) often manifest parkinsonism, which likely results from cortical and subcortical degeneration of brain structures involved in motor control. We used a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to investigate possible structural and/or functional alterations in FTD patients with and without parkinsonism (Park+ and Park-). METHODS: Thirty FTD patients (12 Park+, 18 Park-) and 30 healthy controls were enrolled and underwent 3T MRI scanning. MRI analyses included: (1) surface-based morphometry; (2) basal ganglia and thalamic volumetry; (3) diffusion-based probabilistic tractography of fiber tracts connecting the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) to the putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus; and (4) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the aforementioned regions. RESULTS: Patients in Park+ and Park- groups showed comparable patterns of cortical thinning in frontotemporal regions and reduced thalamic volume with respect to controls. Only Park+ patients showed reduced putaminal volume and reduced fractional anisotropy of the fibers connecting the SMA to the globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus, with respect to controls. Park+ patients also showed decreased RSFC between the SMA and putamen with respect to both Park- patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support the hypothesis that FTD patients with parkinsonism are characterized by neurodegenerative processes in specific corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical motor loops.
