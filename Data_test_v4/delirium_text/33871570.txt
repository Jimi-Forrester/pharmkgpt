33871570|t|Early Identification of Retinal Neuropathy in Subclinical Diabetic Eyes by Reduced Birefringence of the Peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer.
33871570|a|Purpose: To study birefringence of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) of diabetic eyes with no clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) or mild to moderate DR stages using spectral-domain polarization-sensitive (PS) optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: In this observational pilot study, circular PS-OCT scans centered on the optic nerve head were recorded in prospectively recruited diabetic and age-matched healthy eyes. From averaged circumpapillary intensity and retardation tomograms plots of RNFL birefringence were obtained by a linear fit of retardation versus depth within the RNFL tissue for each A-scan position and mean birefringence values for RNFL calculated. Spectral-domain OCT imaging (Heidelberg Engineering) was performed to assess peripapillary RNFL thickness and macular ganglion cell complex (GCC). Results: Out of 70 eyes of 43 diabetic patients (mean +- SD age: 50.86 +- 15.71) 36 showed no signs of DR, 17 mild and 17 moderate nonproliferative DR with no diabetic macular edema. Thirty-four eyes of 34 healthy subjects (53.21 +- 13.88 years) served as controls. Compared with healthy controls (0.143  +- 0.014 /microm) mean total birefringence of peripapillary RNFL was significantly reduced in subclinical diabetic eyes (0.131  +- 0.014 /microm; P = 0.0033), as well as in mild to moderate DR stages (0.125  +- 0.018 /microm, P < 0.0001) with borderline statistically significant differences between diabetic patients (P = 0.0049). Mean birefringence values were significantly lower in inferior compared with superior RNFL sectors (P < 0.0001) of diabetic eyes with no such difference detected in the healthy control group. Conclusions: We identified evidence of early neuroretinal alteration in diabetic eyes through reduced peripapillary RNFL birefringence assessed by PS-OCT occurring before appearance of clinical microvascular lesions or GCC alterations.
