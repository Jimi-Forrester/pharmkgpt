35904685|a|Postoperative delirium is a challenge for patients, relatives, nurses, physicians, and healthcare systems. Delirium is associated with increased mortality, longer hospitalization, reduced quality of life, and higher average treatment costs. Consequently, the most recent version of the German Guideline on Analgesia, Sedation and Delirium Management in Intensive Care Medicine (DAS Guideline 2020) emphasizes the importance of delirium prevention. In particular, nonpharmacological interventions play a special role in this regard for basically all patients receiving intensive care. The DAS Guideline stresses the importance of regular systematic screening with validated instruments to recognize developing delirium early and take the appropriate measures in time, as the duration of delirious conditions influences both mortality and quality of life. If delirium manifests, intervention must be immediate and symptom-oriented.
