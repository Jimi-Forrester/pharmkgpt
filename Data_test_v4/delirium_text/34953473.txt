34953473|t|Validating MARK2 Gene Polymorphism as a Predictor of Response to Lithium Treatment in Bipolar Patients
34953473|a|Background: Lithium is a therapeutic option for the treatment of the acute phase of the bipolar disorder and long-term management of this disorder. However,  it  is  estimated  that  10  to  60%  of  patients  do  not  properly response to this medication. Methods: To investigate the role of MARK2 gene in response to lithium, we genotyped the MARK2 rs10792421 polymorphism in Iranian bipolar patients using amplification Refractory Mutation System-PCR. Results: Results of this study showed a significant association of this polymorphism with response to lithium. The A allele was more frequent in the  responder  than  the  non-responder  group  and  also  in  the  semi- responder group compared to the non-responder group in the codominant model of analysis. AA and AG genotypes were more frequent in both the responder and semi-responder groups compared to the non-responder group in dominant model of analysis. Conclusion: Based on the findings of the current study, the rs10792421 variant of MARK2 gene could be considered as a potential biomarker for predicting the treatment outcome of bipolar disorder type 1 in Iranian population.
