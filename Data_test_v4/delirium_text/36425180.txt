36425180|a|Iris lactea Pall. var. chinensis (Fisch.) Koidz (Iris lactea) is an herbaceous perennial widely distributed in China, India, and South Korea. Iris lactea has been extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine. The present study isolated a new oligostilbene (compound 1), together with three known oligostilbenes (compounds 2, 3 and 4) from the seeds of Iris lactea. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by HRESIMS, NMR, and chemical analyses. The network-based pharmacologic analysis platform was used to predict the target proteins related to inflammation of isolated compounds. Furthermore, the isolated compounds were tested for their anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In this network, 138 candidate targets of compounds related to its therapeutic effect on inflammation were identified. In addition, compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 significantly decreased NO content and the IL-6 levels as well as the expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
