22242269|t|[Efficacy of reamberin in patients with acetic acid poisoning].
22242269|a|Efficacy of reamberin infusion therapy was estimated in 38 patients with severe acetic acid intoxication. Reamberin was shown to have positive effect on certain end-points of the treatment, viz. caused a 2-fold decrease in duration of exotoxic shock (which allowed to use smaller volumes of infusion solutions), 3-fold decrease in the frequency of pneumonia, 5-fold reduction in the frequency of delirium and acute renal insufficiency in the early post-traumatic period. The use of reamberin allowed to reduce duration of patients' stay in intensive therapy and resuscitation wards by 1.2 times and mortality rate by 18.5%.
