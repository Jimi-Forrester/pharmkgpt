37315666|a|It has been found that the main cause of neurodegenerative proteinopathies, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of Abeta amyloid plaques, which can be regulated by application of potential small molecules. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of danshensu on Abeta(1-42) aggregation and relevant apoptotic pathway in neurons. A broad range of spectroscopic, theoretical, and cellular assays were done to investigate the anti-amyloidogenic characteristics of danshensu. It was found that danshensu triggers its inhibitory effect against Abeta(1-42) aggregation through modulation of hydrophobic patches as well as structural and morphological changes through a stacking interaction. Furthermore, it was observed that incubation of Abeta(1-42) samples with danshensu during aggregation process recovered the cell viability and mitigated the expression of caspase-3 mRNA and protein as well caspase-3 activity deregulated by Abeta(1-42) amyloid fibrils alone. In general, obtained data showed that danshensu potentially inhibits Abeta(1-42) aggregation and associated proteinopathies through regulation of apoptotic pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, danshensu may be used as a promising biomolecule against the Abeta aggregation and associated proteinopathies, which can be further analyzed in the future studies for the treatment of AD.
