32552669|a|BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is one of the common causes of acute encephalitis in humans. Japanese encephalitis is characterized by the uncontrolled release of inflammatory cytokines, which ultimately results in neuronal cell damage. In recent years, with the advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology, studies have shown that circRNAs, by competing with endogenous miRNAs, play a vital role in the pathology of CNS diseases. However, it is unknown whether circRNAs participate in JEV-induced neuroinflammation. RESULTS: By employing Illumina RNA-sequencing, we identified 180 circRNAs and 58 miRNAs that showed significant differential expression in JEV-infected mice brain tissues. The functional enrichment analyses revealed that these differentially regulated circRNAs were predominantly related to neurotransmission, histone modifications, transcription misregulation, and inflammation-associated calcium signaling pathway. Our established competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction network suggested the correlation of several circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in regulating the inflammatory response during JEV infection. Among the predicted interactions, the correlation between circ_0000220, miR-326-3p, and BCL3/MK2/TRIM25 mRNAs was experimentally validated by knockdown or overexpression of the non-coding RNA entities in cultured mouse microglia. The knockdown of circ_0000220 or overexpression of miR-326-3p caused a lower production of JEV-induced inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, our study provides new insights into the host response to JEV infection and proposes the circRNA-targeting therapeutic interventions to rein in Japanese encephalitis.
