1859513|t|[Pharmacokinetics of clonidine following intravenous administration of high doses for the treatment of delirium tremens].
1859513|a|Concentrations of clonidine (CAS 4205-09-7. Catapresan) were measured in the plasma and the urine of 6 patients with delirium tremens who received 1.8-13.8 mg clonidine on the third treatment day. There was a linear correlation between the daily dose of clonidine and the steady state concentration of clonidine in the plasma, even with the high doses of clonidine used in this study. The total clonidine clearance was 29-62% lower than in normal volunteers. The renal clearance were 49-75% lower than normal. The renal excretion of the non-metabolized clonidine was significantly lower than the normal range. The creatinine clearance on the other hand was only slightly reduced. The present study gives first hints that the metabolic clearance of clonidine in patients with delirium tremens is not decreased remarkably.
