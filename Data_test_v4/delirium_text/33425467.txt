33425467|t|The Role of Advanced Practitioners in Optimizing Clinical Management and Support of Patients With Cytokine Release Syndrome From CAR T-Cell Therapy.
33425467|a|CAR T-cell therapy is rapidly emerging as a promising treatment for many hematologic malignancies. However, CAR T cells can be associated with unique toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can be severe or fatal if not recognized promptly and treated appropriately. Therefore, it is essential that advanced practitioners caring for patients who have received CAR T-cell therapy to be knowledgeable regarding the signs and symptoms of CRS and understand how to grade and manage toxicities. Understanding the risk factors that may be associated with the development of toxicities as well as the incidence, severity, and timing of CRS with different CAR T-cell products will allow for earlier recognition and treatment, and therefore improvement of outcomes in patients receiving this novel therapy.
