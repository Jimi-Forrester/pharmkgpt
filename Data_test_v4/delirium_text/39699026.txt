39699026|t|Cognitive function and its longitudinal predictability by intensity of physical activity in Chinese middle-aged and older adults.
39699026|a|BACKGROUND: The aging population faces several health problems, including cognitive decline that can progress to Alzheimer's disease. Regular physical activity is widely recognized for its extensive benefits, including physical and mental health improvements especially for older adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the prediction of physical activity intensities on cognitive function of older adults. METHODS: Data from 8 years prospective survey among Chinese population aged 45 years and older is used. Cognitive function was measured by word recall, orientation, numeric subtraction, and copying a picture. Physical activity was assessed with three intensity levels. General estimating equations (GEE) with unstructured correlation matrix is used to test the prediction of physical activity intensity on cognitive function. RESULTS: Cognitive function of participants significantly declined from 9.81 at baseline to 8.81 after 8 years. Moderate-intensity physical activity for 3 days/week was strongest positive predictor of cognitive function with a betta coefficient of 0.64. Light-intensity physical activity also positively predicted cognitive function, however vigorous physical activity for more than 3 days/week negatively predicted cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function of the Chinese population is found to continuously decline after 60 years old age. Fortunately, this decline can be delayed with age-tolerable light to moderate-intensity physical activities.
