35344326|t|Controlled and Selective Photo-oxidation of Amyloid-beta Fibrils by Oligomeric p-Phenylene Ethynylenes.
35344326|a|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy to clear toxic amyloid aggregates involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. A major limitation of PDT is off-target oxidation, which can be lethal for the surrounding cells. We have shown that a novel class of oligo-p-phenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) exhibit selective binding and fluorescence turn-on in the presence of prefibrillar and fibrillar aggregates of disease-relevant proteins such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein. Concomitant with fluorescence turn-on, OPE also photosensitizes singlet oxygen under illumination through the generation of a triplet state, pointing to the potential application of OPEs as photosensitizers in PDT. Herein, we investigated the photosensitizing activity of an anionic OPE for the photo-oxidation of Abeta fibrils and compared its efficacy to the well-known but nonselective photosensitizer methylene blue (MB). Our results show that, while MB photo-oxidized both monomeric and fibrillar conformers of Abeta40, OPE oxidized only Abeta40 fibrils, targeting two histidine residues on the fibril surface and a methionine residue located in the fibril core. Oxidized fibrils were shorter and more dispersed but retained the characteristic beta-sheet rich fibrillar structure and the ability to seed further fibril growth. Importantly, the oxidized fibrils displayed low toxicity. We have thus discovered a class of novel theranostics for the simultaneous detection and oxidization of amyloid aggregates. Importantly, the selectivity of OPE's photosensitizing activity overcomes the limitation of off-target oxidation of traditional photosensitizers and represents an advancement of PDT as a viable strategy to treat neurodegenerative disorders.
