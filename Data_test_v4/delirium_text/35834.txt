35834|a|The authors research work brings out the privileged place occupied by tiapride in the course of weaning 150 chronic alcoholics. This product enabled them, whatever the initial symptoms presented by the patient might be (DT, pre-DT or chronic alcoholism), to carry out a quick weaning while preserving the patient's lucidity, his freedom to move about and his ability to satisfy his physiological needs. A number of drawbacks are avoised thanks to the procedure the authors have developed, such as: the prescription of the usual psychotropic medicines and, consequently, the side effects associated with them; the complications caused by a prolonged confinement to bed; the over-demanding involvement of the nursing staff; finally, the atmosphere of struggle which accompanies the admission of a delirium tremens. Therefore the use of tiapride seems to be a turning point in the treatment of the chronic alcoholic.
