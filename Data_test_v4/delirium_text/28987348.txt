28987348|a|The electrooxidation of N-acetylcysteine (N-AC) was studied by a novel Ni(II) complex modified ZrO2 nanoparticle carbon paste electrode [Ni(II)/ZrO2/NPs/CPE] using voltammetric methods. The results showed that Ni(II)/ZrO2/NPs/CPE had high electrocatalytic activity for the electrooxidation of N-AC in aqueous buffer solution (pH = 7.0). The electrocatalytic oxidation peak currents increase linearly with N-AC concentrations over the concentration ranges of 0.05-600muM using square wave voltammetric methods. The detection limit for N-AC was equal to 0.009muM. The catalytic reaction rate constant, kh, was calculated (7.01 x 102 M-1 s-1) using the chronoamperometry method. Finally, Ni(II)/ZrO2/NPs/CPE was also examined as an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for the determination of N-AC in real samples such as tablet and urine.
