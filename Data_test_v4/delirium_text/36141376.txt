36141376|t|Occupational Therapy Interventions for Dementia Caregivers: Scoping Review.
36141376|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) often experience a significant caregiver burden. Occupational Therapy (OT) is a helpful discipline for improving quality of life and other health factors for these caregivers. We conducted a Scoping Review to describe OT interventions for caregivers of PwD. METHODS: two authors searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Web of Science databases and OT journals indexed in the Journal Citation Reports. Terms included in the search strategy were: dementia, Alzheimer, Parkinson, caregivers and OT. We included articles with experimental design in which an OT intervention in caregivers of PwD was carried out, written in Spanish or English and with the full text available. RESULTS: a total of 2121 articles were obtained, 31 of which were included; 22 of them described home-based OT interventions: Tailored Activity Program (TAP) (n = 5), Environmental Skill-Building Program (ESP) (n = 4) and Advancing Caregiver Training (ACT) (n = 3) and other household interventions (n = 10); the remaining studies described OT interventions in other settings (n = 9). CONCLUSIONS: OT interventions for caregivers of PwD were mainly carried out at home. The most commonly used interventions were TAP focused on caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease, aimed at lessening the burden, depression and stress experienced by caregivers.
