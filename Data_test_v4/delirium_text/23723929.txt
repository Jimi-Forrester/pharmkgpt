23723929|a|In the title compound, C20H25NO5, the di-hydro-pyridine ring adopts a flattened boat conformation. The meth-oxy-phenyl ring is almost perpendicular to the mean plane of the pyridine ring [dihedral angle = 88.42 (3) ]. The two carbonyl units adopt a synperiplanar conformation with respect to the double bonds in the di-hydro-pyridine ring. In the crystal, mol-ecules are connected by N-H O hydrogen bonds into R 4 (4)(24) tetra-meric rings. A region of disordered electron density, located at the center of four adjacent mol-ecules, was treated with the SQUEEZE routine in PLATON [Spek (2009  ). Acta Cryst. D65, 148-155]. It is probably the result of traces of the solvent of crystallization and was not taken into account during the structure refinement.
