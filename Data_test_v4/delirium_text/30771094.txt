30771094|a|OBJECTIVE: Consistent with the aging population in the Western world, there is a growing number of elderly patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the recommended reperfusion strategy in elderly patients; risk models to determine which of these patients are prone to have poor clinical outcomes are, however, essential. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between frailty and short-term mortality and PCI-related serious adverse events (SAE) in elderly patients. METHODS: All STEMI patients (aged >=70 years) treated with primary PCI in 2013-2015 at the Leiden University Medical Centre were assessed. The Safety Management Programme (VMS) score was used to identify frail elderly patients. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality; the secondary endpoint included 30-day clinical death, target vessel failure, major bleeding, contrast induced kidney insufficiency and stroke. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients were included (79 +- 6.4 years, 119 [58%] male). The VMS score was >=1 in 28% of all cases. Primary and secondary endpoint rates were 5 and 23% respectively. VMS score >=1 was an independent predictor for both 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] 9.6 [95% confidence interval, CI 1.6-56.9] p-value = 0.013) and 30-day SAE (OR 2.9 [95% CI 1.1-7.9] p-value = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: VMS score for frailty is independently associated with short-term mortality and PCI-related SAE in elderly patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI. These results suggest that frailty in elderly patients is an important feature to measure and to be taken into account when developing risk models.
