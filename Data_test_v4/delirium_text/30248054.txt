30248054|t|Age-Dependent Decrease of Mitochondrial Complex II Activity in a Familial Mouse Model for Alzheimer's Disease.
30248054|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder for which the exact etiology is largely unknown. An increasingly recognized and investigated notion is the pathogenic role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. We assessed mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzyme activities in the APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mouse model from 4.5 to 14 months of age. We show an age-dependent decrease in mitochondrial complex-II activity starting at 9 months in APP/PS1 mice. Other enzymes of the OXPHOS do not show any alterations. Since amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are already present from 4 months of age, mitochondrial dysfunction likely occurs downstream of Abeta pathology in this mouse model.
