24931933|a|INTRODUCTION: Treatment of major depression in advanced cancer patients is often difficult because of their special characteristics. METHOD: The authors developed a treatment algorithm for major depression in advanced cancer patients and report on their clinical experience using it. The applicability, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of the algorithm were evaluated in 95 advanced cancer patients with major depression. RESULTS: The algorithm was not suitable for seven patients and was not used correctly in 14 cases. It was correctly applied to 74 patients (77%), 23 of whom dropped out for cancer-related reasons (deterioration of physical condition, transfer to other hospitals, cancer death). As for tolerability, 22 patients (43%) of the 51 dropped out of the antidepressant treatment regimen because of delirium due to deterioration of their physical condition, adverse effects of the antidepressant, etc. In the 29 cases that could be followed up, clinical efficacy was evaluated for 4 weeks, and improvement was observed in 22 cases (76%). CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that use of the algorithm may be feasible, but that it requires some alterations to manage major depression in advanced cancer patients.
