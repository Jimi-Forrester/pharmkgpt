23844568|t|Neuroendocrine small cell rectal cancer metastasizing to the liver: a unique treatment strategy, case report, and review of the literature.
23844568|a|We describe the treatment of a 46-year-old Saudi man with advanced stage liver metastatic neuroendocrine rectal cancer. The patient presented with a large liver lesion and rectal bleeding. He was cachectic, with a firm tender mass 20 mm above the anal verge. Computed tomography (CT) showed a mass 9.5 x 13 cm in size in the right hemi-liver, abutting the middle hepatic vein. The patient refused treatment, and consulted another hospital. After 3 months, he presented with the same symptoms in addition to delirium. Colonoscopy showed an ulcerating anorectal mass, from which a biopsy was taken. Repeat CT showed an increase in the size of the liver lesion to 17 cm and no change in the pelvis. The final histopathology report identified anaplastic small cell carcinoma. The patient underwent extended right liver resection followed by abdominoperineal resection, then 13 cycles of chemotherapy and monthly somatostatin injections. At the most recent follow-up, the patient had been disease-free for 48 months. Surgical resection (R0) of the primary and secondary tumor, followed by platinum-based chemotherapy can result in good survival in cases of small cell carcinoma with large liver metastasis, irrespective of whether the primary or secondary tumor is resected first.
