METHODS: A convenient sampling method was used to recruit inpatients of a hospital as subjects from July 2016 to July 2018. According to the even/odd attribute of admission number, subjects were divided into a control group and an observation group. The number of recruited subjects was 311: the control group comprised 135 participants and the observation group 176. The average length of hospital stay, hospital fees, quality of life, and satisfaction with the quality of nursing were compared between the two groups. SPIRIT checklist was completed (see File S1). RESULTS: After intervention, patients in the observation group had shorter average hospital stay (15.98 +- 2.7), lower hospital fees (81,018 +- 1.3), higher satisfaction with the quality of nursing (98.3%), lower incidence of complications (19.89%), improved ability to perform activities of daily living, and lower rate of disease outcome and re-admission, with statistically significant differences from the control group (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The application of inter-professional care model in single disease patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage can shorten the average hospital stay, reduce hospital fees, improve the quality of life of patients, and increase patients' satisfaction with the quality of nursing, which is worthy of clinical promotion and application. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT SECTION: Nursing managers can use this model to improve the ability to ensure coordination between medical professionals and integrate the ability of nursing problems, the ability to make rational distribution of nursing human resources, and the ability of critical thinking. It can be used as reference to improve the nursing management of all kinds of single diseases.
