39095486|t|Human Exposure to Heavy Metals over the Last 100 Years.
39095486|a|The primary objective of the presented research was to assess the impact of intense global economic development, over the last 100 years, on the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the human body. This evaluation was conducted based on the measurement of heavy metals in human hair samples collected 100 years ago in present-day southern Poland.In this study, concentrations of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and selenium (Se) were measured in 61 hair samples,28 of which were obtained from individuals who lived 100 years ago, while the remaining 33 constituted the contemporary control group. The concentrations were determined using a triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Agilent 8900). Statistical analysis of the obtained results was conducted using the Principal Cmponent Analysis and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. In the case of As, Pb, Cd, and Fe, the concentrations were significantly higher in individuals who lived 100 years ago compared to those living today. Over this period, the median concentrations were shown to have decreased by 95%, 94%, 85%, and 69% for As, Pb, Cd, and Fe, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed for Cu, Zn, and Se. The results obtained for Pb, Cd, As, and Fe unequivocally indicate that the population studied from 100 years ago was more exposed to internal contamination with these metals than people who live nowadays.
