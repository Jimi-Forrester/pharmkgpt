34611426|t|A Novel Pyroptosis-Associated Long Noncoding RNA Signature to Predict the Prognosis of Patients with Colorectal Cancer.
34611426|a|PURPOSE: Pyroptosis plays an important role in tumor progression. However, there is no pyroptosis-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature to predict the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RNA sequencing data (RNA-seq) and corresponding clinical information relating to CRC patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the GSE39582 dataset. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify pyroptosis-associated lncRNAs linked to CRC prognosis. Subsequently, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to construct a pyroptosis-associated lncRNAs signature within the TCGA cohort, which was then validated using the GSE39582 dataset. We used Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to evaluate our novel lncRNA signature. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the potential function of the lncRNA signature. RESULTS: We constructed a pyroptosis-associated lncRNA signature comprising four lncRNAs (ELFN1-AS1, PCAT6, TNRC6C-AS1, and ZEB1-AS1). CRC patients were subdivided into high- and low-risk groups based on median risk scores. The results of the K-M, PCA, and ROC analyses showed that this signature could accurately predict the prognosis of CRC patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the pyroptosis-associated signature was an independent prognostic factor. Functional analysis suggested that tumor-associated pathways were enriched for in the high-risk CRC patient group. CONCLUSION: Our study established an effective prognostic signature for CRC patients that may represent a potential therapeutic target.
