35600441|a|Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) function requires the stoichiometric interaction among dozens of proteins but their co-regulation has not been defined in the human brain. Here, using quantitative proteomics across three independent cohorts we systematically characterized the co-regulation patterns of mitochondrial RC proteins in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Whereas the abundance of RC protein subunits that physically assemble into stable complexes were correlated, indicating their co-regulation, RC assembly factors exhibited modest co-regulation. Within complex I, nuclear DNA-encoded subunits exhibited >2.5-times higher co-regulation than mitochondrial (mt)DNA-encoded subunits. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was unrelated to mtDNA-encoded subunits abundance, suggesting that mtDNA content is not limiting. Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibited reduced abundance of complex I RC subunits, an effect largely driven by a 2-4% overall lower mitochondrial protein content. These findings provide foundational knowledge to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to age- and disease-related erosion of mitochondrial function in the human brain.
