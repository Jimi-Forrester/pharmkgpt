23173064|t|Dye-binding assays for evaluation of the effects of small molecule inhibitors on amyloid (abeta) self-assembly.
23173064|a|Dye-binding assays, such as those utilizing Congo red and thioflavin T, are among the most widely used tools to probe the aggregation of amyloidogenic biomolecules and for the evaluation of small molecule inhibitors of amyloid aggregation and fibrillization. A number of recent reports have indicated that these dye-binding assays could be prone to false positive effects when assessing inhibitors' potential toward Abeta peptides, species involved in Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, this review focuses on the application of thioflavin T for determining the efficiency of small molecule inhibitors of Abeta aggregation and addresses potential reasons that might be associated with the false positive effects in an effort to increase reliability of dye-binding assays.
