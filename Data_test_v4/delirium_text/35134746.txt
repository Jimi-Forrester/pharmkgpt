35134746|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has limited the provision of in-person care and accelerated the need for virtual care. Older adults (65+ years) were 1 of the highest user groups of in-person health care services prior to the pandemic. Social distancing guidelines and high rates of mortality from coronavirus infections among older adults made receiving in-person health care services challenging for older adults. The provision of virtual care technologies can help to ensure continuity of care and provide essential health care services during the pandemic to those at high risk of contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus, including older adults. It is also essential to understand and address potential socioeconomic, demographic, and health disparities in the demand for and use of virtual care technologies among older adults. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate socioeconomic disparities in the demand for and use of virtual visits during the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults in Canada. METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey was conducted with 12,052 Canadians over the age of 16 years, selected from Leger's Leger Opinion panel from July 14 to August 6, 2021. Associations between socioeconomic factors and the demand for and use of virtual visits were tested using chi2 tests and logistic regression models for telephone visits, video visits, and secure messaging. Weighting was applied using the 2016 census reference variables to render a representative sample of the Canadian population. RESULTS: A total of 2303 older adults were surveyed. Older adults expressed the highest demand for and use of telephone visits, following by video visits and secure messaging. eHealth literacy was positively associated with the use of all 3 virtual care modalities. Higher income was negatively associated with the use of video visits (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.428-0.974, P=.03). Having no private insurance coverage was negatively associated with use of secure messaging (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.539-0.983, P=.04), but living in a rural community (OR 0.172, 95% CI 1.12-2.645, P=.01) and being born outside of Canada (OR 0.150, 95% CI 1.041-2.173, P=.03) were positively associated with the use of secure messaging. Higher education (OR 0.078, 95% CI 0.633-0.97, P=.02) and being non-White (OR=0.054, 95% CI 0.312-0.92, P=.02) were negatively associated with the use of the telephone. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that compared to video visits and secure messaging, the demand for and use of telephone visits were more prevalent among older adults during the pandemic. The gaps between the demand for and use of video and secure messaging services remain substantial. Our results highlight socioeconomic disparities among older adults that could potentially explain this trend. Lower income and a lower education level may act as barriers for older adults in acquiring the skills and technologies necessary to use more complex solutions, such as video and secure messaging. In addition, higher eHealth literacy was found to be critical for older adults to successfully navigate all types of virtual visit technologies.
