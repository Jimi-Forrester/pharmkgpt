22272899|t|Association of platelet activation with vascular cognitive impairment: implications in dementia development?
22272899|a|Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and with cognitive dysfunction. However, the precise pathogenic mechanisms responsible for this association remain elusive. In the present study, CAD patients with cognitive impairment showed significantly higher platelet activation compared with CAD patients without cognitive impairment. In addition, we identified platelet activity to be a significant independent predictor for the severity of cognitive impairment in these patients. We discuss the link between platelet hyperactivity and dementia (including Alzheimer`s disease) based on the literature and our findings. We also discuss the potential mechanisms involved. This link may become a therapeutic option.
