39042846|t|Graded Multidimensional Clinical and Radiologic Variation in Patients With Alzheimer Disease and Posterior Cortical Atrophy.
39042846|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer disease (AD) spans heterogeneous typical and atypical phenotypes. Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a striking example, characterized by prominent impairment in visual and other posterior functions in contrast to typical, amnestic AD. The primary study objective was to establish how the similarities and differences of cognition and brain volumes within AD and PCA (and by extension other AD variants) can be conceptualized as systematic variations across a transdiagnostic, graded multidimensional space. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, single-center, observational, cohort study performed at the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom. Data were collected from a cohort of patients with PCA and AD, matched for age, disease duration, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. There were 2 sets of outcome measures: (1) scores on a neuropsychological battery containing 22 tests spanning visuoperceptual and visuospatial processing, episodic memory, language, executive functions, calculation, and visuospatial processing and (2) measures extracted from high-resolution T1-weighted volumetric MRI scans. Principal component analysis was used to extract the transdiagnostic dimensions of phenotypical variation from the detailed neuropsychological data. Voxel-based morphometry was used to examine associations between the PCA-derived clinical phenotypes and the structural measures. RESULTS: We enrolled 93 participants with PCA (mean: age = 59.9 years, MMSE = 21.2; 59/93 female) and 58 AD participants (mean: age = 57.1 years, MMSE = 19.7; 22/58 female). The principal component analysis for PCA (sample adequacy confirmed: Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin = 0.865) extracted 3 dimensions accounting for 61.0% of variance in patients' performance, reflecting general cognitive impairment, visuoperceptual deficits, and visuospatial impairments. Plotting AD cases into the PCA-derived multidimensional space, and vice versa, revealed graded, overlapping variations between cases along these dimensions, with no evidence for categorical-like patient clustering. Similarly, the relationship between brain volumes and scores on the extracted dimensions was overlapping for PCA and AD cases. DISCUSSION: These results provide evidence supporting a reconceptualization of clinical and radiologic variation in these heterogenous AD phenotypes as being along shared phenotypic continua spanning PCA and AD, arising from systematic graded variations within a transdiagnostic, multidimensional neurocognitive geometry.
