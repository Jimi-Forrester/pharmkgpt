37812646|a|Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) act as important modulators of gene expression and they have been confirmed to play critical roles in the physiology and development of malignant tumors. Understanding the synergism of multiple ncRNAs in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation can provide important insights into the mechanisms of malignant tumors caused by ncRNA regulation. In this work, we present a framework, SCOM, for identifying ncRNA synergistic competition. We systematically construct the landscape of ncRNA synergistic competition across 31 malignant tumors, and reveal that malignant tumors tend to share hub ncRNAs rather than the ncRNA interactions involved in the synergistic competition. In addition, the synergistic competition ncRNAs (i.e. ncRNAs involved in the synergistic competition) are likely to be involved in drug resistance, contribute to distinguishing molecular subtypes of malignant tumors, and participate in immune regulation. Furthermore, SCOM can help to infer ncRNA synergistic competition across malignant tumors and uncover potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignant tumors. Altogether, the SCOM framework (https://github.com/zhangjunpeng411/SCOM/) and the resulting web-based database SCOMdb (https://comblab.cn/SCOMdb/) serve as a useful resource for exploring ncRNA regulation and to accelerate the identification of carcinogenic biomarkers.
