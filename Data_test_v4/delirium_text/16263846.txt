Affected subjects are assumed to be at higher risk for the development of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about the group of young-old subjects with respect to the prevalence and natural course of cognitive decline. METHOD: Within the population-based Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging, neuropsychological functioning was assessed in 500 community-dwelling young-old subjects of two German urban regions who were born during 1930-1932. The participants were carefully screened for physical and mental health and reexamined 4 years later. The concept of "aging-associated cognitive decline" was applied. RESULTS: At baseline, 13.4% of the subjects fulfilled criteria for aging-associated cognitive decline. Four years later, the prevalence rates for rose to 23.6%; 52.3% of the subjects initially classified as having aging-associated cognitive decline retained the diagnosis at follow-up. Although subjects with aging-associated cognitive decline showed a reduced performance in all neuropsychological domains addressed, a significant decline was confined to delayed verbal memory test performance during the 4-year follow-up period in relation to comparison subjects. Aging-associated cognitive decline did not predict conversion to dementia during the follow-up interval. CONCLUSIONS: In young-old community-dwelling individuals, aging-associated cognitive decline is a frequent condition with a high temporal stability. During a 4-year follow-up, subjects with aging-associated cognitive decline deteriorated specifically in measures of episodic memory, underscoring the value of the respective deficits in characterizing "mild cognitive impairment."
