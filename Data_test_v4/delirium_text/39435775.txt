MATERIAL AND METHODS: 497 patients with moderate to severe dementia, average age 75.4+6.81 years, received Mioreol (donepezil 10 mg+memantine 20 mg). Treatment efficacy was assessed using the MMSE, clock drawing, Sandoz Clinical Geriatric Scale, and Clinical Global Impressions after 3 months of therapy. All adverse events during treatment were recorded. RESULTS: The transition to Mioreol was accompanied by a reliable improvement in cognitive functions, emotional-behavioral indicators and neuropsychiatric status in general. CONCLUSIONS: Mioreol demonstrated clinical efficacy, safety and good tolerability in patients with AD and AD with cerebrovascular pathology with moderate to severe dementia syndrome.
