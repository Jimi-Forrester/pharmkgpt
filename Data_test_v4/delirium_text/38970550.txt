38970550|a|The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) have recently published their guideline SIGN168 on 'Assessment, Diagnosis, Care, and Support for People with Dementia and their Carers'. The guideline makes evidence-based recommendations for best practice in the assessment, care and support of adults living with dementia. Topics featured in this guideline are limited to those prioritised by stakeholders, especially people with lived and living experience, and those not well covered under pre-existing guidance. We summarise the guideline recommendations related to identification and diagnosis of dementia, investigative procedures, postdiagnostic support living with dementia, including non-pharmacological approaches for distressed behaviours, using technology to support people with dementia, grief and dementia and changing needs of people with dementia. The guideline content is summarised as officially published, with additional commentary in the final section.
