35272592|t|Targeting Estrogen Signaling in the Radiation-induced Neurodegeneration: A Possible Role of Phytoestrogens.
35272592|a|Radiation for medical use is a well-established therapeutic method with an excellent prognosis rate for various cancer treatments. Unfortunately, a high dose of radiation therapy comes with its own share of side effects, causing radiation-induced non-specific cellular toxicity; consequently, a large percentage of treated patients suffer from chronic effects during the treatment and even after the post-treatment. Accumulating data evidenced that radiation exposure to the brain can alter the diverse cognitive-related signaling and cause progressive neurodegeneration in patients because of elevated oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and loss of neurogenesis. Epidemiological studies suggested the beneficial effect of hormonal therapy using estrogen in slowing down the progression of various neuropathologies. Despite its primary function as a sex hormone, estrogen is also renowned for its neuroprotective activity and could manage radiation-induced side effects as it regulates many hallmarks of neurodegenerations. Thus, treatment with estrogen and estrogen-like molecules or modulators, including phytoestrogens, might be a potential approach capable of neuroprotection in radiation-induced brain degeneration. This review summarized the molecular mechanisms of radiation effects and estrogen signaling in the manifestation of neurodegeneration and highlighted the current evidence on the phytoestrogen mediated protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury. This existing knowledge points towards a new area to expand to identify the possible alternative therapy that can be taken with radiation therapy as adjuvants to improve patients' quality of life with compromised cognitive function.
