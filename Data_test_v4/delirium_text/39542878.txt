39542878|a|Oligomer amyloid beta 42 (Abeta) is considered the key pathogenic molecule in Alzheimer disease (AD) and causes specific lamin fragmentation. Curcumin has been recognized for its protective effects against Abeta-induced toxicity in AD, though its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the inhibitory mechanism of curcumin against Abeta-induced lamin fragmentation and cell death was investigated. Human neuroblastoma cells were used to examine Abeta-induced lamin fragmentation and lamin deformation by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy, while cell viability was measured using MTT and alamarBlue assay. Caspase and cathepsin L activity were assessed by spectrofluorometry, and Abeta aggregation was evaluated by ThT assay. Our results demonstrated that curcumin inhibited Abeta aggregation, reducing intracellular Abeta uptake by 45% compared to Abeta-treated cells. Curcumin also inhibited the Abeta-induced intracellular calcium rise, subsequently leading to a onefold reduction in cathepsin L activity. This reduction in cathepsin L activity by curcumin blocked the Abeta-induced lamin fragmentation. Collectively, these findings suggest that curcumin inhibits Abeta-induced cell death by preventing Abeta entry and lamin cleavage, providing potential new insights for AD treatment.
