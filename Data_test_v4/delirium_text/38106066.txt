38106066|a|The absence of a natural animal model is one of the main challenges in Alzheimer's disease research. Despite the challenges of using non-human primates in studies, they can bridge mouse models and humans, as non-human primates are phylogenetically close to humans and can spontaneously develop AD-type pathology. The capuchin monkey, a New World primate, has recently attracted attention due to its skill in creating and using instruments. We analyzed three capuchin brains using structural 7T MRI and neuropathological evaluation. Alzheimer-type pathology was found in one case. Widespread beta-amyloid pathology mainly in the form of focal deposits with variable morphology and high density of mature plaques. Noteworthy, plaque-associated dystrophic neurites, associated with disrupted of axonal transport and early cytoskeletal alteration, were frequently found. Unlike other species of New World monkeys, cerebral arterial angiopathy was not the predominant form of beta-amyloid pathology. Additionally, abnormal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau, resembling neurofibrillary pathology, were observed in the temporal and frontal cortex. Besides, astrocyte hypertrophy surrounding plaques was found, suggesting a neuroinflammatory response. Aged capuchin monkeys can spontaneously develop Alzheimer-type pathology, indicating that they may be an advantageous animal model for research in Alzheimer's disease. One-Sentence Summary : Capuchin monkeys can spontaneously develop Alzheimer-type pathology.
