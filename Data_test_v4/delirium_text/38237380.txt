38237380|a|The mechanisms of central neuropathic pain (CNP) caused by spinal cord injury have not been sufficiently studied. We have found that the upregulation of astrocytic aquaporin-4 (AQP4) aggravated peripheral neuropathic pain after spinal nerve ligation in rats. Using a T13 spinal cord hemisection model, we showed that spinal AQP4 was markedly upregulated after SCI and mainly expressed in astrocytes in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). Inhibition of AQP4 with TGN020 suppressed astrocyte activation, attenuated the development and maintenance of below-level CNP and promoted motor function recovery in vivo. In primary astrocyte cultures, TGN020 also changed cell morphology, diminished cell proliferation and suppressed astrocyte activation. Moreover, T13 spinal cord hemisection induced cell-surface abundance of the AQP4 channel and perivascular localization in the SDH. Targeted inhibition of AQP4 subcellular localization with trifluoperazine effectively diminished astrocyte activation in vitro and further ablated astrocyte activation, attenuated the development and maintenance of below-level CNP, and accelerated functional recovery in vivo. Together, these results provide mechanistic insights into the roles of AQP4 in the development and maintenance of below-level CNP. Intervening with AQP4, including targeting AQP4 subcellular localization, might emerge as a promising agent to prevent chronic CNP after SCI.
