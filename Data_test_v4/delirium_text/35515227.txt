35515227|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become one of the major diseases endangering the health of the elderly. Clarifying the features of each AD animal model is valuable for understanding the onset and progression of diseases and developing potential treatments in the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, we aimed to clarify plasma metabolomics and neurotransmitter dysfunction in the process of AD model rat induced by amyloid beta 25-35 (Abeta 25-35). Firstly, Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was used to investigate cognitive impairment in AD rat after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of modelling. Based on this, the effects on levels of AD-related enzymes and eight neurotransmitters were analyzed. And plasma metabolomics analysis based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was used to research the metabolic disturbances in the process of AD rat. The results shown the injury on the spatial learning ability of AD rats was gradually aggravated within 4 weeks, reached the maximum at 4 weeks and then was stable until 8 weeks. During 8 weeks of modeling, the levels of enzymes including beta-secretase, gamma-secretase, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), acetyl cholinesterase (AchE) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were significant increased in the plasma of AD rats. The neurotransmitter dysfunction was mainly involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetyl choline (Ach), glutamic acid (Glu), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). 17 endogenous metabolites correlated with AD were successfully detected in the metabolomics analysis. These metabolites were mainly involved in fatty acids, sphingolipids, and sterols metabolisms, vitamin metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. These metabolites might be the potential biomarkers that correctly mark different stages of AD. The study on peripheral plasma indices reflecting the process of AD laid the foundation for understand the pathophysiology of AD and find an effective and radical cure. And the rules of endogenous metabolic disorder in AD rats also have a certain guiding significance for the future study of food-drug interactions at different stages of AD.
