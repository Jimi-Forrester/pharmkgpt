33800622|t|Evaluation of Antioxidant and Enzyme Inhibition Properties of Croton hirtus L'Her. Extracts Obtained with Different Solvents.
33800622|a|Croton hirtus L'Her methanol extract was studied by NMR and two different LC-DAD-MSn using electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources to obtain a quali-quantitative fingerprint. Forty different phytochemicals were identified, and twenty of them were quantified, whereas the main constituents were dihydro alpha ionol-O-[arabinosil(1-6) glucoside] (133 mg/g), dihydro beta ionol-O-[arabinosil(1-6) glucoside] (80 mg/g), beta-sitosterol (49 mg/g), and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside (26 mg/g). C. hirtus was extracted with different solvents-namely, water, methanol, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate-and the extracts were assayed using different in vitro tests. The methanolic extracts presented the highest 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values. All the tested extracts exhibited inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), with a higher activity observed for dichloromethane (AChE: 5.03 and BChE: 16.41 mgGALAE/g), while the methanolic extract showed highest impact against tyrosinase (49.83 mgKAE/g). Taken together, these findings suggest C. hirtus as a novel source of bioactive phytochemicals with potential for commercial development.
