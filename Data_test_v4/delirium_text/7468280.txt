7468280|t|Detoxication cure. Some points for discussion.
7468280|a|Are we providing alcoholics with the most suitable therapy for their needs, and are we giving sufficient thought to the causes and consequences of their illness ? Detoxication is usually not a single medico technical matter involving one individual, but a complex problem involving family, friends and work, each patient requiring an individual tailored programme of therapy. Lake of motivation on the part of the patient can be dealt with by choosing a particular form of therapy  to deal with this, as a first stage  in detoxication treatment. Craving can be controlled with medication which gives physical and psychological comfort, and can also deal with epilepsy and delirium tremens. However, psychological reception and external influence are easily as important to the end result of treatment. Should hospitalization be semi-automatic, as this tends to obscure the direct social problem and, if long term, may increase alienation from family and personal relationships? Social assistance should be in the forefront, with structured after -care comprising coordination of effort doctor, hospital, outpatients dept. and family and above all continuity of effort, as a detoxication cure is simply a preparation for effective ambulatory therapy and is not a complete therapy in itself.
