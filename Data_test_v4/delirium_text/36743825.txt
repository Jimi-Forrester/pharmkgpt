36743825|t|Recent Treatment Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.
36743825|a|Neurotrauma has been well linked to the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Much work has been done characterizing chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but less has been done regarding the contribution to Alzheimer's Disease. This review focuses on AD and its association with neurotrauma. Emerging clinical trials are discussed as well as novel mechanisms. We then address how some of these mechanisms are shared with CTE and emerging pre-clinical studies. This paper is a user-friendly resource that summarizes the emerging findings and proposes further investigation into key areas of interest. It is intended to serve as a catalyst for both research teams and clinicians in the quest to improve effective treatment and diagnostic options.
