28874134|a|BACKGROUND: Adult neurogenesis persists through life at least in classic neurogenic niches. Neurogenesis has been previously described as reduced in neurodegenerative diseases. There is not much knowledge about is adult neurogenesis is or not modified in amyotrophy lateral sclerosis (ALS). All previous publications has studied the ALS SOD1 (superoxide dismutase) transgenic mouse model. The purpose of this study is to examine the process of adult neurogenesis in classic niches (subventricular zone [SVZ] and subgranular zone [SGZ] of the dentate gyrus) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both with (ALS-FTD) and without associated frontotemporal dementia (FTD). METHODS: We studied 9 autopsies of patients with ALS (including 2 with ALS-FTD) and 4 controls. ALS was confirmed histologically. Studies of the SVZ and SGZ were conducted using markers of proliferation (Ki-67, PCNA), of pluripotent neural progenitor cells (GFAPdelta), neuroblasts (PSA-NCAM, DCX, TUJ1), and an astrocyte marker (GFAP). Results were analyzed with non-parametric tests. We then studied correlations between the different markers and the percentage of phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43). RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant increase in proliferation in the SVZ in all patients with ALS. While this increase was more marked in ALS forms associated with dementia, the small sample size does not permit a statistical subgroup analysis. In contrast, proliferation in the SGZ was decreased in all patients. These alterations showed a positive and direct correlation with the percentage of pTDP-43 in the SVZ, and a negative, exponential correlation with that percentage in the SGZ. CONCLUSIONS: We observed alterations of the proliferation of neural progenitor in classic adult neurogenic niches in patients with ALS. The 2 neurogenic niches exhibited opposite changes such that proliferation increased in the SVZ and decreased in the SGZ.
