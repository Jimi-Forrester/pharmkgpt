37958705|t|Common and Trace Metals in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.
37958705|a|Trace elements and metals play critical roles in the normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS), and their dysregulation has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In a healthy CNS, zinc, copper, iron, and manganese play vital roles as enzyme cofactors, supporting neurotransmission, cellular metabolism, and antioxidant defense. Imbalances in these trace elements can lead to oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby contributing to neurodegeneration. In AD, copper and zinc imbalances are associated with amyloid-beta and tau pathology, impacting cognitive function. PD involves the disruption of iron and manganese levels, leading to oxidative damage and neuronal loss. Toxic metals, like lead and cadmium, impair synaptic transmission and exacerbate neuroinflammation, impacting CNS health. The role of aluminum in AD neurofibrillary tangle formation has also been noted. Understanding the roles of these elements in CNS health and disease might offer potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders. The Codex Alimentarius standards concerning the mentioned metals in foods may be one of the key legal contributions to safeguarding public health. Further research is needed to fully comprehend these complex mechanisms and develop effective interventions.
