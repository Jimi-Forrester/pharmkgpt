36553960|a|Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) is a cytologic diagnosis etiologically related to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection that leads to the release of inflammation mediators, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased levels of antioxidants in tissues, which is why antioxidants might be considered effective against SIL progression. This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) supplementation (600 mg/day) on the regression of low-grade SIL in 100 patients. Low-grade SIL was determined after the cytological screening, colposcopic examination and targeted biopsy and histological confirmation of cytological-colposcopic diagnosis. Inflammation parameters and the presence of HPV were determined by standard laboratory methods. Dietary and lifestyle habits were investigated using a standardized and validated semi-quantitative food questionnaire (FFQ). ALA supplementation significantly reduced the proportion of patients with low-grade cytological abnormalities, in comparison to placebo. Given the obtained level of significance (p < 0.001), the presented results indicate that short-term ALA supplementation shows a clinically significant effect on cervical cytology. Future studies should focus on the use of innovative formulations of ALA that might induce bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency against HPV infection and the investigation of synergistic effects of concurrent dietary/lifestyle modification and ALA supplementation in both low-grade and high-grade SIL.
