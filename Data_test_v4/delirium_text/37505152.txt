37505152|a|RATIONALE: Iodinated contrast agents are extensively employed in clinical settings, with allergic reactions and renal impairment being the most prevalent adverse events. Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) can present with heterogeneous clinical features, making diagnosis challenging. Prior studies on CIE have primarily documented rapid recovery within several days. However, this paper describes a case of CIE in a patient whose clinical symptoms took 3 months to fully abate. PATIENT CONCERNS: A female patient, aged 54 years, received drug-coated balloon therapy for stenosis in a branch of the anterior descending coronary artery. Unfortunately, the patient developed CIE, which initially manifested as visual disturbances and subsequently progressed to gastrointestinal and limb movement issues, as well as an altered mental status, all of which occurred within a 24-hour period during hospitalization. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with CIE after cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral edema was ruled out based on the history of contrast medium administration and radiographic exams. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Dexamethasone (10 mg/d), mannitol (100 mL/d), betahistine (500 mL), trazodone (25 mg), and hydration supplementation were given to treat CIE-related symptoms. Aspirin and clopidogrel were administered for the management of the cardiovascular ailment. The neurologist prescribed neurotrophic agents, namely, cytarabine and methylcobalamin, based on the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging findings. Despite the treatment, the patient's ocular symptoms, including blurry vision, diplopia, and impaired intraocular retraction, persisted. Furthermore, the patient's mental state was altered, and she continued to exhibit a depressive state during her 1-month follow-up visit. LESSONS: CIE is a comparatively infrequent ailment, and its prompt identification and management are of paramount importance. Although the treatments for CIE are primarily symptomatic, it is crucial to acknowledge that the symptoms may not always subside quickly within a short duration. In conjunction with pharmacotherapy, counseling should be offered to address patients' mental health.
