37552127|a|Hematoma-induced neuroinflammation is the cause of poor prognosis in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); therefore, promoting blood clearance and blocking overactivated inflammation are rational approaches for ICH treatment. beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) lyase-1 (BACE1) is a key molecule regulating the microglial phenotype transition in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of BACE1 in microglial phagocytosis and inflammatory features in ICH. Here, we demonstrated the unique advantages of targeting BACE1 in microglia using an autologous blood model and primary microglia hemoglobin stimulation. When BACE1 was inhibited early in ICH, fewer residual hematomas remained, consistent with an increase in genetic features that favor phagocytosis and anti-inflammation. In addition, inhibition of BACE1 enhanced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and substantially reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes, which was regulated by signal transduction and phosphorylation of activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Further pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation effectively blocked the proinflammatory and weak phagocytic phenotype of microglia due to BACE1 induction. In summary, BACE1 is the critical molecule regulating the inflammatory and phagocytic phenotypes of microglia after ICH, and targeted inhibition of the BACE1/STAT3 pathway is an important strategy for the future treatment of ICH-induced neurological injury.
