24861166|t|Conformational targeting of intracellular Abeta oligomers demonstrates their pathological oligomerization inside the endoplasmic reticulum.
24861166|a|Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) are crucially involved in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the lack of selective approaches for targeting these polymorphic Abeta assemblies represents a major hurdle in understanding their biosynthesis, traffic and actions in living cells. Here, we established a subcellularly localized conformational-selective interference (CSI) approach, based on the expression of a recombinant antibody fragment against AbetaOs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). By CSI, we can control extra- and intracellular pools of AbetaOs produced in an AD-relevant cell model, without interfering with the maturation and processing of the Abeta precursor protein. The anti-AbetaOs intrabody selectively intercepts critical AbetaO conformers in the ER, modulating their assembly and controlling their actions in pathways of cellular homeostasis and synaptic signalling. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Abeta undergoes pathological oligomerization through critical conformations formed inside the ER. This establishes intracellular AbetaOs as key targets for AD treatment and presents CSI as a potential targeting strategy.
