39300812|a|Oxidative stress plays an important role in the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies indicate a strong connection between oxidative stress, inappropriate activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Although antioxidant therapy is a valid strategy to alleviate these problems, the most important limitation of this approach is the ineffectiveness of drug administration due to the limited permeability of the BBB. Therefore, BBB-penetrating p38 MAPK modulators with proper antioxidant capacity could be useful in preventing/reducing the complications of neurodegenerative disorders. The current manuscript aims to review the therapeutic capabilities of some recently reviewed naturally occurring p38 MAPK inhibitors in the management of neurodegenerative problems such as Alzheimer's disease. In data collection, we tried to use more recent studies published in high-quality journals indexed in databases Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and so on, but no specific time frame was considered due to the nature of the study. Our evaluations indicate that natural compounds tanshinones, protoberberines, pinocembrin, osthole, rhynchophylline, oxymatrine, schisandrin, piperine, paeonol, ferulic acid, 6-gingerol, obovatol, and trolox have significant potential for use as supplements/adjuvants in the reduction of neurodegenerative-related problems. Our findings emphasize the usefulness of BBB-penetrating phytochemicals with p38 MAPK modulatory activity as potential therapeutic options against neurodegenerative disorders. Of course, the proper use of these compounds depends on considering their toxicity/safety profile and pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as the clinical conditions of users.
