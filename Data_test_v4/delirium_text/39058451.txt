39058451|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a serious complication following deep brain stimulation (DBS) but only received little attention. Its main risk factors are higher age and preoperative cognitive deficits. These are also main risk factors for long-term cognitive decline after DBS in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: To identify risk factors for POD severity after DBS surgery in PD. Methods: 57 patients underwent DBS (21 female; age 60.2+-8.2; disease duration 10.5+-5.9 years). Preoperatively, general, PD- and surgery-specific predictors were recorded. Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the neuropsychological test battery CANTAB ConnectTM were used to test domain-specific cognition. Volumes of the cholinergic basal forebrain were calculated with voxel-based morphometry. POD severity was recorded with the delirium scales Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Nursing Delirium Scale (NU-DESC). Spearman correlations were calculated for univariate analysis of predictors and POD severity and linear regression with elastic net regularization and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to fit a multivariable model. Results: 21 patients (36.8%) showed mainly mild courses of POD following DBS. Correlation between predicted and true POD severity was significant (spearman rho = 0.365, p = 0.001). Influential predictors were age (p < 0.001), deficits in attention and motor speed (p = 0.002), visual learning (p = 0.036) as well as working memory (p < 0.001), Nucleus basalis of Meynert volumes (p = 0.003) and burst suppression (p = 0.005). Conclusions: General but also PD- and surgery-specific factors were predictive of POD severity. These findings underline the multifaceted etiology of POD after DBS in PD. Valid predictive models must therefore consider general, PD- and surgery-specific factors.
