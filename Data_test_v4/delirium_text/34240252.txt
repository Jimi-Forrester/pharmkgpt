34240252|a|Searching for new drugs is still a challenge for science, mainly because of civilization development and globalization which promote the rapid spread of diseases, which is particularly dangerous in the case of infectious ones. Moreover, readily available already known antibiotics are often overused or misused, possibly contributing to the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. A consequence of this is the need for new structures of potential drugs. One of them is a benzoxazole moiety, a basic skeleton of a group of fluorescent heterocyclic compounds already widely used in chemistry, industry, and medicine, which is also present in naturally occurring biologically active compounds. Moreover, synthetic benzoxazoles are also biologically active. Considering all of that, a large group of non-proteinogenic amino acids based on 3-(2-benzoxazol-5-yl)alanine skeleton was studied in search for new antimicrobial and anticancer agents. Screening tests revealed that antibacterial potential of 41 compounds studied is not very high; however, they are selective acting only against Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis). Moreover, almost half of the studied compounds have antifungal properties, also against pathogens (C. albicans). Most of studied compounds are toxic to both normal and cancer cells. However, in a few cases, toxicity to normal cells is much lower than for cancer cells indicating these compounds as future anticancer agents. The research carried out on such a large group of compounds allowed to establish a structure-activity relationship which enables to select candidates for further modifications, necessary to improve their biological activity and obtain a new lead structure with potential for therapeutic use.
