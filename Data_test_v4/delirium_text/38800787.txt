38800787|a|BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians play an essential role in the health of older adults as they are frequently the first point of contact. Their positive attitude and knowledge influence the quality of care provided to patients with dementia and their caregivers. This study examined the attitudes of primary care physicians towards dementia care and their confidence in their own dementia-care skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 316 primary care physicians working in Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that included questions related to demographic characteristics, Dementia Care Attitude Scale (DCAS) to assess attitudes towards dementia, and Confidence in Dementia Care Skills (CDCS) Scale to measure confidence. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29; mean and standard deviation (SD) were computed for continuous and categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. Mann Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis test were used to compare attitude and confidence scores by categorical variables. RESULTS: The mean DCAS score was 36.4 +- 5.41 out of 50. On a scale ranging from 15 to 75, the mean CDCS was 51.89 +- 10.20. A statistically significant (P < 0.05) relation was found between confidence and professional rank, knowing close relatives with dementia, and number of dementia and elderly patients treated. Overall, 78.9% of physicians lacked confidence to prescribe memory medications; 32% felt that dementia management was generally more frustrating than rewarding. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians had a positive attitude toward caring for patients with dementia. However, they lacked confidence in their dementia care skills in several areas. The confidence in their diagnostic skills was higher than their management skills. Most challenging skills were recognizing and managing behavioral symptoms of dementia. Need to develop educational and training interventions that target healthcare providers to help improving dementia care in primary care settings.
