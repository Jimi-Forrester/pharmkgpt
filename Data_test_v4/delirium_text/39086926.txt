39086926|t|hnRNPs: roles in neurodevelopment and implication for brain disorders.
39086926|a|Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) constitute a family of multifunctional RNA-binding proteins able to process nuclear pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs and regulate gene expression in multiple ways. They comprise at least 20 different members in mammals, named from A (HNRNP A1) to U (HNRNP U). Many of these proteins are components of the spliceosome complex and can modulate alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner. Notably, while genes encoding hnRNPs exhibit ubiquitous expression, increasing evidence associate these proteins to various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, microcephaly, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or dementias, highlighting their crucial role in the central nervous system. This review explores the evolution of the hnRNPs family, highlighting the emergence of numerous new members within this family, and sheds light on their implications for brain development.
