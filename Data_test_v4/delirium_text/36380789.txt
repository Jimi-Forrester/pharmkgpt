36380789|t|Association between heart and dementia... keep an eye on the left atrium.
36380789|a|Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The mechanisms are not well known, but they are probably multifactorial and involve atrial myopathy, cardio-embolism, cerebral hypoperfusion, and comorbidities (systemic vascular sclerosis, disease of the small cerebral vessels, inflammation, etc.). Atrial fibrillation therapy could have a protective effect on dementia through diversified actions: (i) prevention of left atrial remodelling; (ii) prevention of cardio-embolism and silent (and not) cerebral infarcts; (iii) improvement of cardiac output and cerebral perfusion. Randomized trials will be needed to clarify the links between left atrium and dementia and to identify the most appropriate therapeutic strategies.
