35694506|t|Crosslinked Chitosan-Gelatin Biocompatible Nanocomposite as a Neuro Drug Carrier.
35694506|a|The polymers, chitosan, a polysaccharide, and gelatin, a protein, are crosslinked in different ratios without the aid of a crosslinking agent. Facile chemical reactions were followed to synthesize a chitosan/gelatin nanocomposite in three different ratios (1:1, 1:3, and 3:1). The solubility of chitosan and the stability of gelatin were improved due to the crosslinking. Both the polymers have excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, adhesion, and absorption properties in a biological environment. The properties of the composite were favorable to be used in drug delivery applications, and the drug dopamine was encapsulated in the composite for all three ratios. The properties of the chitosan/gelatin nanocomposite and dopamine-loaded chitosan/gelatin nanocomposite were examined using XRD, FTIR, SEM, UV, TGA, TEM, and DLS techniques, and the crosslinking was confirmed. Higuchi kinetic release was seen with a cumulative release of 93% within 24 h for the 1:3 nanocomposite in a neutral medium. The peaks at 9 and 20  in the XRD spectrum confirmed the encapsulation of dopamine with the increase in the crystallinity of chitosan, which is also evident from the SAED image. The dopamine functional groups were confirmed from the IR peaks between 500 and 1500 cm-1 and the wide UV absorption maxima between 250 and 290 nm. The particle size of the drug-loaded composite in the ratios 1:1, 1:3, and 3:1 were calculated to be 275, 405, and 355 nm, respectively. The nanocomposite also showed favorable DPPH antioxidant and antibacterial activity againstStaphylococcus aureus. Sustained release of dopamine in a neutral medium using crosslinked chitosan and gelatin without the presence of a crosslinker is the highlight of the work.
