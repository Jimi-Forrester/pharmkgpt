1979668|t|Tyrosine hydroxylase-like (TH) immunoreactivity in human mesolimbic system.
1979668|a|A practical methodology has been described for the use of human postmortem brain tissue in both tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in which in situ perfusion with paraformaldehyde is followed by immersion fixation in Bouin's fixative. These studies indicate that TH-like immunoreactive fibers and terminals are not uniformly distributed in the human hippocampal complex. A distinctive lesser innervation is noted for the structures that compose the perforant pathway and may be important for the predilection of these areas for pathological change particularly as occurs in Alzheimer's disease.
