27605935|a|BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is an integral part of the comprehensive care of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving oral anticoagulations (OACs) therapy. Many patients with AF are elderly and may suffer from some form of cognitive impairment. This study was conducted to investigate whether cognitive impairment affects the level of adherence to anticoagulation treatment in AF patients. METHODS: The study involved 111 AF patients (mean age, 73.5 +- 8.3 years) treated with OACs. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The level of adherence was assessed by the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Scores on the MMAS-8 range from 0 to 8, with scores < 6 reflecting low adherence, 6 to < 8 medium adherence, and 8 high adherence. RESULTS: 46.9% of AF patients had low adherence, 18.8% had moderate adherence, and 33.3% had high adherence to OACs. Patients with lower adherence were older than those with moderate or high adherence (76.6 +- 8.7 vs. 71.3 +- 6.4 vs. 71.1 +- 6.7 years) and obtained low MMSE scores, indicating cognitive disorders or dementia (MMSE = 22.3 +- 4.2). Patients with moderate or high adherence obtained high MMSE test results (27.5 +- 1.7 and 27.5 +- 3.6). According to Spearman's rank correlation, worse adherence to treatment with OACs was determined by older age (rS = -0.372) and lower MMSE scores (rS = 0.717). According to multivariate regression analysis, the level of cognitive function was a significant independent predictor of adherence (b = 1.139). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is an independent determinant of compliance with pharmacological therapy in elderly patients with AF. Lower adherence, beyond the assessment of cognitive function, is related to the age of patients.
