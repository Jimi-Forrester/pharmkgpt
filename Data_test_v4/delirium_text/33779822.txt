33779822|t|The complex interaction of genetics and delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
33779822|a|The objective is to understand genetic predisposition to delirium. Following PRISMA guidelines, we undertook a systematic review of studies involving delirium and genetics in the databases of Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO, and performed a meta-analysis when appropriate. We evaluated 111 articles, of which 25 were finally included in the analysis. The studies were assessed by two independent researchers for methodological quality using the Downs and Black Tool and for genetic analysis quality. We performed a meta-analysis of 10 studies of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, obtaining no association with the presence of delirium (LOR 0.18, 95% CI - 0.10-0.47, p = 0.21). Notably, only 5 out of 25 articles met established criteria for genetic studies (good quality) and 6 were of moderate quality. Seven studies found an association with APOE4, the dopamine transporter gene SCL6A3, dopamine receptor 2 gene, glucocorticoid receptor, melatonin receptor and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. One genome-wide association study found two suggestive long intergenic non-coding RNA genes. Five studies found no association with catechol-o-methyltransferase, melatonin receptor or several interleukins genes. The studies were heterogenous in establishing the presence of delirium. Future studies with large samples should further specify the delirium phenotype and deepen our understanding of interactions between genes and other biological factors.
