36850184|t|Astaxanthin-Loaded Pickering Emulsions Stabilized by Nanofibrillated Cellulose: Impact on Emulsion Characteristics, Digestion Behavior, and Bioaccessibility.
36850184|a|Astaxanthin (AX) is one of the major bioactives that has been found to have strong antioxidant properties. However, AX tends to degrade due to its highly unsaturated structure. To overcome this problem, a Pickering O/W emulsion using nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) as an emulsifier was investigated. NFC was used because it is renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic. The 10 wt% O/W emulsions with 0.05 wt% AX were prepared with different concentrations of NFC (0.3-0.7 wt%). After 30 days of storage, droplet size, zeta-potential values, viscosity, encapsulation efficiency (EE), and color were determined. The results show that more stable emulsions are formed with increasing NFC concentrations, which can be attributed to the formulation of the NFC network in the aqueous phase. Notably, the stability of the 0.7 wt% NFC-stabilized emulsion was high, indicating that NFC can improve the emulsion's stability. Moreover, it was found that fat digestibility and AX bioaccessibility decreased with increasing NFC concentrations, which was due to the limitation of lipase accessibility. In contrast, the stability of AX increased with increasing NFC concentrations, which was due to the formation of an NFC layer that acted as a barrier and prevented the degradation of AX during in vitro digestion. Therefore, high concentrations of NFC are useful for functional foods delivering satiety instead of oil-soluble bioactives.
