37758805|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder characterized by the ongoing decline of brain functions. Studies have revealed the detrimental effects of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein fibrils in AD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of this factor in the early-stage detection of AD conditions. We designed an electrochemical immunosensor for quantitative detection of the cis conformation of the p-tau protein (cis-p-tau) employing platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) supported on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) for modifying the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface. Under optimum conditions, the immunosensor selectively and sensitively detected cis-p-tau within the broad linear range of 1 fg mL-1 to 10 ng mL-1 and the low limit of detection (LOD) of 1 fg mL-1 with desired reproducibility and stability. Furthermore, the fabricated immunosensor's performance was examined for the cis-p-tau analysis in the serum of AD patients, indicating its accuracy and feasibility for real-sample analysis. Notably, this is the first application of Pt@ZIF-8 nanocomposite in fabricating a valid immunosensor for selective cis-p-tau detection, even in the presence of trans-p-tau. It is worth mentioning that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reference technique is not able to evaluate pico- or femtomolar concentrations of cis-p-tau, making the fabricated immunosensor superior for early-stage measurement and screening of AD.
