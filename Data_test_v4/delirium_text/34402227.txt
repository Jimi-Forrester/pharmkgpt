34402227|t|Trend of Disease Burden of North Korean Defectors in South Korea Using Disability-adjusted Life Years from 2010 to 2018.
34402227|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the disease burden of North Korean defectors in South Korea by sex, age, and disease from 2000 to 2018 and to study the changes in the disease burden over time. METHODS: Based on the incidence-based disability-adjusted life year (DALY) developed in a Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study, we calculated the years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for approximately 22,753 North Korean defectors in South Korea whose claims data were available from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). RESULTS: In 2018, the rates of YLL, YLD, and DALY for North Korean defectors per 100,000 population was 3,763 (male 8,491; female 2,404), 37,683 (male 27,742; female 40,539), and 41,446 (male 36,233; female 42,943), respectively. Major depressive disorders constituted the highest DALY, followed by cirrhosis of the liver and low back pain. The disease burden of North Korean defectors consistently decreased from 2010 to 2018. The decrease in YLD contributed to the overall decline in DALY per 100,000 population in 2018, which decreased by 25.2% compared to that in 2010. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to measure the disease burden of North Korean defectors in South Korea. Given the decreasing or substantially increasing trends in disease burden, it is necessary to establish appropriate public health policies in a timely manner, and the results of this study provide a basis for the development of customized public health and healthcare policies for North Korean defectors in South Korea.
