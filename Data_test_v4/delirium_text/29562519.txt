29562519|t|Conquering Alzheimer's Disease by Self Treatment.
29562519|a|The means are now at hand to conquer Alzheimer's disease (AD). The method is to identify those at risk for the disease before clinical signs develop. That is followed by implementing measures that can effectively prevent disease development. Since biotechnology markers have shown that AD commences at least a decade before cognitive deficits set in, there is an extended window of opportunity to successfully prevent disease development. Methods of identifying those at risk include positron electron microscopy for AD senile plaques, blood or saliva analysis for elevation of the amyloid-beta protein fragment terminating at position 42, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing a decrease in content of this protein. Of the modalities available, saliva is by far the simplest and least invasive. Once identified, those at risk can prevent disease development through self treatment by consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, adhering to a Mediterranean diet, and consuming antioxidants such as quercitin which is contained in coffee.
