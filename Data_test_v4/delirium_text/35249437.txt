35249437|a|BACKGROUND: There is currently no cure for dementia but general practitioners (GPs) have therapeutic options available to counteract the progression of mild cognitive impairment, including drug and non-drug treatment. So far, few studies have investigated treatment strategies preferred by GPs. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to gain an overview of GPs' attitudes towards influencing the progression of dementia, their involvement regarding dementia prevention and perceived effective approaches. It also elucidated the challenges experienced by GPs and desired optimisation measures towards reinforcing secondary prevention. METHODS: Between June 2020 and March 2021, 64 semi-standardised interviews amongst GPs were conducted in all federal states of Germany. Thirty interviews were carried out in person and 34 by phone. The data were analysed according to qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Many interviewees see great importance in secondary dementia prevention and believe they could make an effective contribution, some of them using non-drug approaches. GPs play a role in guiding patients and relatives towards support services. Some doctors consider drug treatment as the only option towards influencing the progression of dementia, showing low expectations on self-efficacy. Interdisciplinary collaboration is a frequent challenge, which often conflicts with a coherent treatment strategy. CONCLUSION: Many GPs feel confident about influencing the progression of dementia and believe they can intervene effectively, using various (non-drug) treatment measures and referrals to support services. GPs perceive challenges, including obstacles in interdisciplinary collaboration and negative impacts after drug administration. To improve the conditions for GP intervention, it depends on expanding interdisciplinary collaboration and care strategies.
