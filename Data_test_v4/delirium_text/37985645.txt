37985645|t|Cell replacement therapy with stem cells in multiple sclerosis, a systematic review.
37985645|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by demyelination and axonal loss. It is induced by attack of autoreactive lymphocytes on the myelin sheath and endogenous remyelination failure, eventually leading to accumulation of neurological disability. Disease-modifying agents can successfully address inflammatory relapses, but have low efficacy in progressive forms of MS, and cannot stop the progressive neurodegenerative process. Thus, the stem cell replacement therapy approach, which aims to overcome CNS cell loss and remyelination failure, is considered a promising alternative treatment. Although the mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of stem cell transplantation are not yet fully understood, neurotrophic support, immunomodulation, and cell replacement appear to play an important role, leading to a multifaceted fight against the pathology of the disease. The present systematic review is focusing on the efficacy of stem cells to migrate at the lesion sites of the CNS and develop functional oligodendrocytes remyelinating axons. While most studies confirm the improvement of neurological deficits after the administration of different stem cell types, many critical issues need to be clarified before they can be efficiently introduced into clinical practice.
