33800068|t|Cemented Dual Mobility Cup for Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty in Elder Patients with High-Risk Instability.
33800068|a|Several studies have shown that double mobility (DM) cups reduce postoperative dislocations. Does the cemented dual mobility cup reduce dislocations in a specific cohort of elder patients with a high dislocation risk? Our hypothesis is that this implant is optimal for elder patients because it reduces early dislocation. We have retrospectively reviewed elder patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) with cemented double mobility cup between March 2009 and January 2018. The inclusion criteria were patients (>75 years) who were operated on for primary THA (osteoarthritis or necrosis) with a cemented dual mobility cup and a high-risk instability (at least two patient-dependent risk factors for instability). The exclusion criteria were revision surgeries or hip fracture. In all the cases, the same surgical approach was performed with a Watson Jones modified approach in supine position. We have collected demographic data, instability risk factors. Patients were classified using the Devane's score, Merle d'Aubigne score and the patient's likelihood of falling with the Morse Fall Scale. Surgical and follow-up complications were collected from their medical history. Sixty-eight arthroplasties (68 patients) were included in the study. The median age was 81.7 years (SD 6.4), and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score showed a distribution: II 27.94%, III 63.24% and IV 8.82%. Devane's score was less than five in all of the cases. At least two patient-dependent risk factors for instability (87% had three or more) were present in each case. The median follow-up time was 49.04 months (SD 22.6). Complications observed were two cases of infection and one case of aseptic loosening at 15 months which required revision surgery. We did not observe any prosthetic dislocation. The cemented dual mobility cup is an excellent surgical option on primary total hip arthroplasties for elder patients with high-risk instability.
