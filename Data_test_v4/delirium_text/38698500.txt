38698500|t|Exploring Bimetallic Nanoparticles in Alzheimer's Therapy: A Novel Bio-Assisted Synthesis with Multitarget Potential.
38698500|a|Unlocking the potential of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedical applications represents a leading endeavor in contemporary research. Among these, gold NPs (AuNPs) and silver NPs (AgNPs) have shown promising strides in combatting complex neurodegenerative ailments like Alzheimer's disease. Yet, the unexplored realm of bimetallic Au/Ag-NP harbors immense potential, concealing undiscovered opportunities for enhanced therapeutic effectiveness through the synergistic interaction of metal ions. Nonetheless, the limitations of traditional synthesis methods have restricted the preparation, biocompatibility, and versatility of these NPs, prompting an urgent requirement for innovative approaches. Biobased synthetic methodologies have emerged as a noteworthy solution to address these challenges. Our study ventures into uncharted terrain, harnessing collagen-mimicking peptide nanofibers as a bioactive template for the synthesis of bimetallic NPs. These green NPs exhibit remarkable activity in inhibiting amyloid beta (Abeta) protein aggregation with almost 74% inhibition, surpassing the individual impacts of Au and Ag NPs, which show inhibition percentages of 66 and 43, respectively. The bimetallic Au/Ag-NPs not only demonstrate powerful inhibition of Abeta, but they also demonstrate inhibitory activity against esterase (~50%) and against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (~75%), metamorphosing into multifaceted therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. Au/Ag-NPs have proven highly beneficial in surpassing cellular barriers, as evidenced by studies on tissue penetration, 3D uptake, and endosomal escape, and these attributes also hold promise for the future treatment modalities. The findings indicate that the intrinsic traits of Au/Ag-NPs provide numerous mechanistic benefits, such as inhibiting Abeta and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and reducing stress related to ROS, in addition to their advantageous internalization properties. This research represents a notable advancement in the development of multitargeted treatments for neurodegenerative disorders using bimetallic NPs, diverging from the prevalent emphasis on AuNPs in the current literature.
