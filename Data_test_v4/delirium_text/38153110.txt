38153110|a|The Libyan Strawberry, Arbutus pavarii Pampan (ARB), is an endemic Jebel Akhdar plant used for traditional medicine. This study presents the antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties of ARB fruit-extract. ARB phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of 354.54 GAE and 36.2 RE of the phenolics and flavonoids. LC-MS analysis identified 35 compounds belonging to phenolic acids, procyanidins, and flavonoid glycosides. Gallic acid, procyanidin dimer B3, beta-type procyanidin trimer C, and quercetin-3-O-glucoside were the major constituents of the plant extract. ARB administration to paracetamol (PAR)-intoxicated rats reduced serum ALT, AST, bilirubin, hepatic tissue MDA and proinflammatory markers; TNF-alpha and IL-6 with an increase in tissue GSH level and SOD activity. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed that ARB restored the liver histology and significantly reduced the tissue expression of caspase 3, IL-1B, and NF-KB in PAR-induced liver damage. Docking analysis disclosed good binding affinities of some compounds with XO, COX-1, 5-LOX, and PI3K.
