35309254|t|An Interactive Workshop on Managing Dysphagia in Older Adults With Dementia.
35309254|a|Introduction: Nearly six million American adults live with dementia, and dysphagia is a common comorbidity impacting their nutrition and quality of life. There is a shortfall in the number of geriatricians available to care for older adults. Thus, primary care physicians should be equipped with the knowledge to adequately care for the geriatric population. Modified diets are routinely prescribed for patients with dementia despite limited evidence that they protect patients from the sequelae of dysphagia and some suggestion of poor side-effect profiles. Methods: We created a onetime, interactive, case-based session to educate medical residents on how to evaluate and treat dementia-associated dysphagia and address the discrepancy between the limited evidence for dietary modifications and their routine use. The session had a mixture of small-group discussion and didactic learning as well as a participatory component during which learners were able to sample thickened liquids. Results: The session was implemented in an established primary care curriculum. Based on survey responses, which were obtained from 15 out of 17 participants, the session significantly improved participants' knowledge of dysphagia-associated dementia and increased their comfort with caring for patients with dysphagia. Discussion: Dementia-associated dysphagia, although an increasingly common clinical problem, remains an underexamined area of medicine. We successfully implemented a session on this topic for internal medicine residents on the primary care track. Limitations included generalizability due to the small number of residents in the course and inability to gather sufficient data to see if knowledge learned was sustained over time.
