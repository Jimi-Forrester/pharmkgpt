31844496|t|Therapeutic synergism: How can psychopharmacology improve cognitive rehabilitation?
31844496|a|Despite recent advances in cognitive rehabilitation of patients with cognitive disorders, there are many major obstacles to the optimized global use of this therapeutic resource. OBJECTIVE: The authors outline the concept of 'therapeutic synergism', i.e. the concurrent use of pharmacological and cognitive rehabilitation therapies to maximize functional benefits, addressing the optimization of therapeutic approaches for cognitive disorders. METHODS: Three psychopharmacological and rehabilitation interrelationship paradigms are presented in three different clinical settings. RESULTS: Paradigm 1: Behavioral and cognitive symptoms that hinder a cognitive rehabilitation program, but can be improved with psychopharmacology. Paradigm 2: Cognitive symptoms that hinder cognitive rehabilitation, but can be improved with anticholinesterases. Paradigm 3: Behavioral symptoms that hamper the use of cognitive rehabilitation, but can be improved by psychotropic drugs. CONCLUSION: Judicious use of psychotropic drugs in cognitive disorders can benefit, directly or indirectly, cognitive functions, thereby favoring other treatment modalities for cognitive impairment, such as neuropsychological rehabilitation.
