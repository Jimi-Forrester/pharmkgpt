35465108|a|This study investigated the protective effect of extracts from flowers of Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck on type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated disorders. Three different doses of each extract (petroleum ether, ethanol, and aqueous) were administered orally for 42 days. Biochemical parameters, behavioral studies, and histological studies were measured at different periods. Mortality was found to be nil up to 2,000 mg/kg. Statistically significant (P<0.001) improvement in serum glucose level was observed in the groups receiving 400 mg/kg of petroleum ether, aqueous, or ethanol extracts compared with the negative control group. Insulin level was decreased by aqueous extracts, whereas lipid profiles were improved by aqueous and ethanol extracts. A reduction in transfer latency was observed in treatments of all three extract types. Ethanol extract treatment (400 mg/kg) showed maximum percentage inhibition in a lipid peroxidation assay. Additionally, the aqueous and ethanol extract treatments markedly reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Histological results showed that high doses of extracts alleviated the damages induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus in various organs and bones. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that B. oleracea has the potential to alleviate type 2 diabetes mellitus.
