10095028|a|We investigated immunohistochemically the localization of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) with amino-terminal aspartate (N1[D]) in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease and Down's syndrome. A monoclonal antibody, 4G8, which recognizes the middle portion of Abeta, was used as a reference antibody to label the total Abeta deposits. Double staining with anti-Abeta(N1[D]) and 4G8 revealed that Abeta deposits in the subiculum and the neocortical deep layers often lacked N1[D] immunoreactivity, indicating N-terminal truncation of Abeta in these deposits. Abeta deposits in the neocortical superficial layers and the presubicular parvopyramidal layer always contained Abeta with N1[D]. Such regional as well as laminar differences in the distribution of Abeta beginning at N1[D] suggest that some local factors influence N-terminal processing of Abeta deposited in the brain.
