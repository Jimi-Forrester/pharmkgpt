31066002|t|Computational identification of miRNA and their cross kingdom targets from expressed sequence tags of Ocimum basilicum.
31066002|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved small non coding RNAs, which are typically 22-24 nucleotides long and play an important role in post transcription regulation andin various biological processes in both animals and plants. Ocimum basilicum is an important medicinal plant having different bioactive compounds eugenol and essential oils that possess numerous therapeutic properties. However, only a few miRNAs of Ocimum basilicum and its function have been studied till date. The present study focusses on the identification of miRNA from expressed sequenced tags by carrying out computational approaches based on the homology search method. A total of 10 potential miRNAs with 8 different families were predicted in O.basilicum. Furthermore, the psRNA target server was used to predict cross kingdom target genes on human transcriptome for identification ofpotential miRNAs. Eight miRNA families were found to modulate the 87 human target genes which were associated with RAS/MAPK signalling cascade, cardiomyopathy, HIV, breast cancer, lung cancer, Alzheimer's diseases and several neurological disorders. Moreover, O.basilicum miRNAs regulate the key human target genes having significance in various diseases and important biological networks with 10 hub nodes interactions. Thus this study gives the pave for further studies to explore the potential of miRNA mediated cross kingdom regulation and treatment of various diseases including cancer.
