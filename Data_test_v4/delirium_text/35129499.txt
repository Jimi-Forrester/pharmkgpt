35129499|t|Public Opinions About Surgery in Older Adults: A Thematic Analysis.
35129499|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine public opinions of surgery in older adults. BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of older adults are undergoing surgery. National healthcare organizations recognize the increased risks of postoperative complications and mortality in the older surgical population and have made efforts to improve the care of older adults undergoing surgery through hospital-level programs. However, limited research has explored the opinions and responses of the wider U.S. public regarding surgery in older adults. METHODS: We performed a qualitative, thematic analysis of reader comments posted in response to online newspaper articles relating to surgery in older adults. Articles were published in 2019-2020 and targeted for a popular press audience. RESULTS: Nine hundred eight reader comments posted in response to 6 articles relating to surgery in older adults were identified. Articles were published in online editions of print newspapers with a digital circulation between 1.3 and 5.7 million subscribers. Three themes were identified: (1) wariness/distrust towards healthcare: including general distrust of medicine and distrust of surgery, (2) problems experienced: ineffective communication and unrealistic expectations, and (3) recommended solutions: the need for multidisciplinary teams and patient-centered communication. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the public viewed surgery in older adults with wariness/distrust due to ineffective communication and unrealistic expectations. Specialized surgical care tailored to the unique needs of older adults is needed. The public perspective suggests that U.S. health systems should strongly consider adopting programs that provide care to meet the unique needs of older adults undergoing surgery and ultimately improve both patient outcomes and their surgical experience.
