35743390|a|Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis (AS); however, postoperative delirium (POD) can worsen patient outcomes. This study aimed to examine the risk factors for POD after TAVI, including possible intervening factors. We included 87 patients (mean age: 83) who underwent TAVI between May 2014 and September 2018. POD was defined by the presence or absence of delirium on ICU admission, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Factors that showed significant differences in the univariate analysis were analyzed using a multiple logistic regression analysis. In total, 31 patients (36%) had POD after ICU admission, and 56 (64%) did not. The preoperative frailty score and aortic valve opening area (AVA) were significant risk factors for POD. The multivariate analysis also showed that both factors were independent risk factors for POD (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.805). There were no significant differences in the number of ICU days. However, postoperative hospitalization was significantly longer in the POD group (19 (17-31) days vs. 16 (13-22) days; p = 0.002). POD was associated with a narrow AVA and frailty; this suggests that frailty prevention interventions according to the AVA may be important.
