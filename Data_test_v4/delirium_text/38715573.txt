38715573|t|Characterizing Ertapenem Neurotoxicity: A Systematic Review and Experience at a Tertiary Medical Center.
38715573|a|Ertapenem-induced neurotoxicity has not been well characterized and is potentially underreported. We conducted a systematic review of the literature and included 11 additional cases from the University of Washington Medicine health system. A total of 125 individual patient cases were included in the data analysis. The mean age was 72 years, and 62% and 42% of patients had renal dysfunction and preexisting central nervous system (CNS) conditions, respectively. Only 15% of patients received inappropriately high ertapenem dosing based on kidney function. Patients developed neurological signs and symptoms after a median of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-9 days). The most common clinical features were seizures (70%), altered level of consciousness or delirium (27%), and hallucinations (17%). An estimated incidence in our health system was 1 in 102 courses of ertapenem. Ertapenem neurotoxicity should be suspected when a patient with renal dysfunction or predisposing CNS conditions develops neurological signs and symptoms, especially within several days after initiating the antibiotic. This study underscores the need for a large prospective study to assess the true incidence and outcomes of ertapenem neurotoxicity.
