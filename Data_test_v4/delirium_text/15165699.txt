15165699|t|Intronic CYP46 polymorphism along with ApoE genotype in sporadic Alzheimer Disease: from risk factors to disease modulators.
15165699|a|Increasing biological and clinical findings argue for a link between brain cholesterol turnover and Alzheimer Disease (AD), high cerebral levels of the former increasing Abeta load. Cerebral cholesterol elimination involves two mechanisms dependent on Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46). The aim of this study was to evaluate an intronic variation in CYP46 (intron 2, T --> C ) along with ApoE genotype as risk factors for AD and to establish the correlation between CYP46/ApoE polymorphism and disease progression. One-hundred and fifty-seven AD patients, who had been followed periodically through 1-year follow-up after enrollment, and 134 age- and gender-matched controls entered the study. The distribution of CYP46 genotypes was significantly different in AD compared to controls (P<0.004), being CYP*C allele higher in AD patients ( P<0.002). ApoE 4 genotype was more frequent in AD (41.4%) than in controls (15.9%, P<0.0001). The odds ratio (OR) for AD risk in CYP46*C carriers was 2.8, and in ApoE epsilon4 carriers was 4.05; the OR for having both CYP46*C and ApoE epsilon4 was 17.75, demonstrating the their synergic effect on AD risk. In AD patients, CYP46*C along with ApoE epsilon4 genotype were associated with a higher cognitive decline at 1-year follow-up (P<0.02). These findings provide direct evidence that CYP46 and ApoE polymorphisms synergically increase the risk for AD development, and influence on the rate of cognitive decline.
