35297472|t|Rationale and Design of the TARGET-EFT Trial: Multicomponent Intervention for Frail and Pre-frail Patients Hospitalized with Acute Cardiac Conditions.
35297472|a|BACKGROUND: With the aging population and rising rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cardiologists and cardiac surgeons are encountering a growing number of frail older patients that have complex cardiac and non-cardiac issues. Measuring frailty provides valuable prognostic information to help personalize treatment decisions. However, there is minimal evidence on multicomponent frailty interventions in this setting. The TARGET-EFT (The MulTicomponent Acute Intervention in FRail GEriatric PaTients with cardiovascular disease using the Essential Frailty Toolset) trial aims to target physical and non-physical frailty deficits to improve health-related quality of life and hospital-acquired disability in frail patients hospitalized with CVD. METHODS: The TARGET-EFT trial is a single-center parallel-group randomized clinical trial in frail and pre-frail older adults >=65 years admitted to the cardiovascular unit (CVU) at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec. The trial will compare usual inpatient care to a multicomponent intervention targeting physical weakness, cognitive impairment, malnutrition, and anemia. Outcomes of interest in both groups will be assessed at three time points: (1) study enrollment, (2) discharge from the CVU, and (3) 30 days after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching goal is to treat patients' frailty in parallel with their CVD, and in doing so, optimize patient functional losses while in-hospital and shortly thereafter. The results of this trial will inform best practices for patient-centered care in this vulnerable patient group.
