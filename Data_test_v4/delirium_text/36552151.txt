36552151|t|Pulse Pressure Is Associated with Rapid Cognitive Decline over 4 Years: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
36552151|a|Aiming to investigate the relationship between pulse pressure (PP) and cognitive decline, cognitively normal subjects from a community-based longitudinal cohort were followed-up for 4 years. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate global cognitive function, and a >=2-point decrease in the MMSE score from baseline was defined as cognitive decline. Restricted cubic spline, multivariable linear regression and logistic regression were used to investigate the relationship between PP and cognitive decline. A total of 1173 participants completed the follow-up, and 205 (17.5%) met the criteria for cognitive decline. Restricted cubic splines showed no nonlinear relationship between PP and DeltaMMSE (Poverall = 0.037, Pnon-linear = 0.289) or cognitive decline (Poverall = 0.003, Pnon-linear = 0.845). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that PP was positively related to DeltaMMSE (b = 0.021, p = 0.020). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that PP was positively associated with cognitive decline (OR = 1.020, p = 0.023). A stratified analysis found an association between PP and cognitive decline in participants who were aged <=65 years, male, and APOEepsilon4 noncarriers and who had school education <=6 years or hypertension. A sensitivity analysis after propensity-score matching did not alter our findings. These findings highlight that elevated PP is associated with rapid cognitive decline, particularly in males, middle-aged, low-educated, hypertensive individuals and APOEepsilon4 noncarriers.
