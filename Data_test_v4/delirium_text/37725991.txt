37725991|a|Postoperative delirium is common especially in the elderly and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions are effective in reducing the incidence and to a degree the duration of postoperative delirium and are recommended in international guidelines on postoperative delirium as first line intervention for management of delirium. Non-pharmacological management of postoperative delirium consists of strategies for risk stratification, risk reduction by non-pharmacological bundle interventions, early recognition of delirium by screening protocols and immediate therapy of underlying causes of delirium and continuation of non-pharmacological bundles. Non-pharmacological bundle interventions address common perioperative risk factors. Bundles comprise strategies for oxygenation, mobilization, hydration and nutrition, sensory and cognitive stimulation, reorientation, modifications of environmental factors such as design aspects and noise reduction, adequate analgesia, management of agitation and anxiety, protecting circadian rhythms for example by adequate light exposure during daytime, family involvement and timely reduction of unnecessary catheters and anticholinergic drugs. The article aims at providing an overview of non-pharmacological management of postoperative delirium in the hospital.
