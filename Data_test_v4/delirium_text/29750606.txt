29750606|a|Jan Voskuil is the Chief Scientific Officer at antibody manufacturer Everest Biotech in Oxfordshire, UK. After specializing in prokaryotic cell biology through his PhD program in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and a postdoctorate position at Stanford (CA, USA), he switched to the science of neurodegenerative diseases at Oxford, UK through postdoctorate positions at Dunn School of Pathology and at MRC and through a leading position at the Alzheimer drug discovery company Synaptica. He subsequently gained experience in a Good Laboratory Practice-regulatory environment in contract research organization companies both in Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire, validating assays in Flow Cytometry and ELISA platforms and writing standard operating procedures. His extensive experience with generating and characterizing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in combination with accrued knowledge on most immunoassays in academic and commercial environments made him the ideal candidate to take charge in putting Everest Biotech on the global map by ever raising the quality and size of its catalog and by delivery of adequate technical support. As a result, Everest antibodies are currently part of most globally well-known catalogs, and its products are increasingly recognized as useful alternatives to unfit monoclonal antibodies.
