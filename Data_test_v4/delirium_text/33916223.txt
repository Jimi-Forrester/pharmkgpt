33916223|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of edentulism with different chronic diseases and mental disorders in Mexicans aged 60 years and over. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from the World Health Survey for Mexico, in a probabilistic, multi-stage cluster sampling framework. Data for self-report of chronic diseases (diabetes, arthritis, angina pectoris and asthma), mental disorders (depression and schizophrenia) and edentulism were analyzed. Edentulism data were available for 20 of the 32 States of Mexico. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata 14.0 using the svy module for complex sampling (Complex nature under which individuals are sampled). RESULTS: In total 4213 subjects were included, representing a population of 7,576,057 individuals. Mean age was 70.13 +- 7.82 years (range 60 to 98); 56.2% were women. Chronic diseases' prevalence and mental disorders prevalence were as follows: diabetes 15.0% (N = 1,132,693); arthritis 13.2% (N = 1,001,667); depression 5.5% (N = 414,912); angina pectoris 4.5% (344,315); asthma 3.6% (N = 269,287); and schizophrenia 2.2% (N = 16,988). The prevalence of edentulism was 26.3%, which pertained to 1,993,463 people aged 60 years and over. Angina in women aged 60 to 69 years (p < 0.05) and depression in men aged 70 years and over (p < 0.0001) were associated with higher prevalence of edentulism. CONCLUSIONS: There was generally sparse association between edentulism on chronic diseases and mental disorders included in the study, except for women aged 60 to 69 years for angina, and in men aged 70 and over, for depression. Although our findings are misaligned with previous reports, longitudinal studies are required to test causal and temporal relationships between edentulism with chronic diseases and mental disorders.
