38439053|a|BACKGROUND: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) has been used in a range of occupational cohorts, but only recently in stone benchtop workers undergoing screening for silicosis. The aim of this study was to compare psychometric properties of the PSS-10 in stone benchtop workers amongst those born overseas or who used an interpreter. METHODS: Stone benchtop workers in Melbourne, Australia completed the PSS-10 as part of their occupational screening for silicosis. Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha for the total score and the positive and negative subscales. Validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Analysis was performed for the total group and for subgroups according to sex, interpreter use, overseas-born, and language spoken at home. RESULTS: The results of 682 workers with complete PSS-10 scores were included in analysis. Most participants were male (93%), with mean age 36.9 years (SD 11.4), with just over half (51.6%) born in Australia, 10.1% using an interpreter, and 17.5% using a language other than English at home. Cronbach's alpha for the overall group (alpha = 0.878) suggested good internal consistency. DISCUSSION: CFA analysis for validity testing suggested PSS-10 performance was good for both sexes, moderate for country of birth and language spoken at home categories, but poorer for those who used an interpreter. Whilst professional interpreters provide a range of benefits in the clinical setting, the use of translated and validated instruments are important, particularly in cohorts with large numbers of migrant workers. CONCLUSION: This study describes the psychometric properties of the PSS-10 in a population of stone benchtop workers, with good internal consistency, and mixed performance from validity testing across various subgroups.
