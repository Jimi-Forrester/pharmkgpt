37627268|t|Aggregation-Inhibiting scFv-Based Therapies Protect Mice against AAV1/2-Induced A53T-alpha-Synuclein Overexpression.
37627268|a|To date, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease (PD). There is a pressing need for anti-neurodegenerative therapeutics that can slow or halt PD progression by targeting underlying disease mechanisms. Specifically, preventing the build-up of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) and its aggregated and mutated forms is a key therapeutic target. In this study, an adeno-associated viral vector loaded with the A53T gene mutation was used to induce rapid alphaSyn-associated PD pathogenesis in C57BL/6 mice. We tested the ability of a novel therapeutic, a single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody with specificity only for pathologic forms of alphaSyn, to protect against alphaSyn-induced neurodegeneration, after unilateral viral vector injection in the substantia nigra. Additionally, polyanhydride nanoparticles, which provide sustained release of therapeutics with dose-sparing properties, were used as a delivery platform for the scFv. Through bi-weekly behavioral assessments and across multiple post-mortem immunochemical analyses, we found that the scFv-based therapies allowed the mice to recover motor activity and reduce overall alphaSyn expression in the substantia nigra. In summary, these novel scFv-based therapies, which are specific exclusively for pathological aggregates of alphaSyn, show early promise in blocking PD progression in a surrogate mouse PD model.
