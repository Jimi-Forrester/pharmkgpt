35136725|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between homocysteine levels and post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in Chinese female and male populations with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1070 participants with clinically confirmed acute minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and baseline homocysteine information from a nationwide multicenter prospective registry study in China were included in this study. Of these, 919 patients had cognitive assessments at 3-month follow-ups and 584 participants had cognitive assessments at 12-month follow-ups. The incidence of PSCI was defined as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score <=22. The differences in homocysteine levels and the incidence of PSCI were compared between female and male populations. Relationships between homocysteine levels and the incidence of PSCI in female and male populations were analyzed using multiple logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Females had lower baseline homocysteine levels than males. Compared to males, females had lower education levels, lower rates of smoking and alcohol intake, and higher rates of diabetes and hypertension. No relationship was observed between elevated homocysteine level and 3-month PSCI incidence in either females or males. After adjusting the confounders, elevated baseline homocysteine significantly increased the 12-month PSCI risk (odds ratio 3.28, 95% confidence interval 1.47-7.34, P = 0.004) in females, but not in males (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.49-1.49, P = 0.586). CONCLUSION: Elevated homocysteine levels increased the 12-month PSCI risk in females, but not in males with minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.
