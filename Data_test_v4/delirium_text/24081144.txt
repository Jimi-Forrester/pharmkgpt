24081144|t|Allelic interference: a mechanism for trans-dominant transmission of loss of function in the neurodegeneration of familial Alzheimer's disease.
24081144|a|Presenilins (PSs) are catalytic components of the gamma-secretase complexes that promote the epsilon-cleavage of cell surface proteins producing cytosolic peptides shown to function in cell signaling and gene expression. In addition, secretase cleavages at gamma-sites of amyloid precursor protein substrates produce the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides found in all people. Aggregation of Abeta peptides form the amyloid fibrils found in amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and aged individuals. A common hypothesis suggests that AD is caused by aggregated Abeta peptides, but treatments with either inhibitors of Abeta production or anti-Abeta antibodies showed no therapeutic value. Importantly, recent evidence [Marambaud et al.: Cell 2003;114:635-645] shows that PS familial AD (FAD) mutations cause a loss of gamma-secretase cleavage function at the epsilon-site of substrates manifested by a decreased production of cytosolic peptides and an accumulation of transmembrane gamma-secretase substrates. These data support the hypothesis that PS FAD mutations promote neurotoxicity by inhibiting the gamma-secretase-catalyzed epsilon-cleavage of substrates, thus reducing cell signaling while causing accumulation of membrane-bound cytotoxic peptides. Similar mechanisms may be involved in toxicities observed in clinical trials of gamma-secretase inhibitors. A model of allelic interference may explain the dominant negative transmission of neurotoxic loss of function in FAD neurodegeneration.
