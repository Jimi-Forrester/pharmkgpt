27112419|a|In Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides induce the degeneration of presynaptic cholinergic system, in which decreased activity of enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) responsible for acetylcholine synthesis is observed. Cereboost , an extract of American ginseng extract, contains a high concentration of Rb1 ginsenoside which is a well-known ingredient improving human cognitive function. We investigated the effects of Cereboost  on learning and memory function of mice challenged with an Abeta1-42 peptide and the underlying mechanisms in vitro. Cereboost  protected against Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity in F3.ChAT stem cells, and enhanced the ChAT gene expression. Abeta1-42 injection into the mouse brain impaired the cognitive function, which was recovered by oral administration of Cereboost . In addition, Cereboost  restored brain microtubule-associated protein 2 and synaptophysin as well as acetylcholine concentration. The results demonstrate that Cereboost  administration recovered the cognitive function of AD model animals by enhancing acetylcholine level via ChAT gene expression and neuroprotection.
