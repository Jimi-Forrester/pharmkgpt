29279429|a|Modern society is characterized by an explosion of lifestyle-related diseases that have, as their basis, obesity due to lack of exercise, which include the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. While exercise is known to be a definitive preventive or therapeutic measure against these diseases, it is clear that contemporary lifestyles tend to make exercise rather difficult to continue. Thus, there are mounting expectations worldwide for exercise-mimicking drugs that activate exercise-mediated signaling pathways. Therefore, this review discusses the mechanisms through which the adiponectin receptor(AdipoR)likely mimics exercise as a key molecule in lifestyle-related diseases, as well as the prospects for emerging small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds that contribute toward realization of preemptive medicine for lifestyle-related diseases.
