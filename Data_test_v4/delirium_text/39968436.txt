39968436|t|Multiple Chronic Wounds in an Immunocompetent Patient With Severe Major Depressive Disorder: A Case Report.
39968436|a|Depression is a significant comorbidity among patients with chronic wounds. It is known to delay wound healing by interfering with adherence to medical interventions and impairing physical and cognitive functioning. This case report describes a 38-year-old immunocompetent woman who presented with multiple complex chronic wounds. The patient was admitted to the medical wards and subsequently diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder. Factors contributing to depression in individuals with chronic wounds are not well understood. We employed a multidisciplinary approach to wound care to address the factors that contributed to her presentation.
