27650059|t|Fibrils of Truncated Pyroglutamyl-Modified Abeta Peptide Exhibit a Similar Structure as Wildtype Mature Abeta Fibrils.
27650059|a|Fibrillation of differently modified amyloid beta peptides and deposition as senile plaques are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. N-terminally truncated variants, where the glutamate residue 3 is converted into cyclic pyroglutamate (pGlu), form particularly toxic aggregates. We compare the molecular structure and dynamics of fibrils grown from wildtype Abeta(1-40) and pGlu3-Abeta(3-40) on the single amino acid level. Thioflavin T fluorescence, electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction reveal the general morphology of the amyloid fibrils. We found good agreement between the (13)C and (15)N NMR chemical shifts indicative for a similar secondary structure of both fibrils. A well-known interresidual contact between the two beta-strands of the Abeta fibrils could be confirmed by the detection of interresidual cross peaks in a (13)C-(13)C NMR correlation spectrum between the side chains of Phe 19 and Leu 34. Small differences in the molecular dynamics of residues in the proximity to the pyroglutamyl-modified N-terminus were observed as measured by DIPSHIFT order parameter experiments.
