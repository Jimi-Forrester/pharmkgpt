35626658|t|Possible Role of Insulin-Degrading Enzyme in the Physiopathology of Retinitis Pigmentosa.
35626658|a|Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) was named after its role as a proteolytic enzyme of insulin. However, recent findings suggest that IDE is a widely expressed, multitask protein, with both proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions. Here, we characterize the expression of IDE in the mammalian retina in both physiological and pathological conditions. We found that IDE was enriched in cone inner segments. IDE levels were downregulated in the dystrophic retina of several mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa carrying distinct mutations. In rd10 mice, a commonly studied mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa, treatment with an IDE activator (a synthetic peptide analog of preimplantation factor) delayed loss of visual function and preserved photoreceptor cells. Together, these results point to potential novel roles for IDE in retinal physiology and disease, further extending the list of diverse functions attributed to this enzyme.
