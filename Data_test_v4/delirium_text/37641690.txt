37641690|a|Aim: The goal was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol (RS) and combination therapy of RS and donepezil (DPZ), on the numerical expression of microglial cells and astrocytes, in the frontal cortex, regions of the hippocampus in colchicine-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. Methods: The study involved male albino Wistar rats of three months, age and consisted of 6 groups, with six animals each. The immunohistochemical staining with mouse monoclonal anti-human CD 68 and mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP was performed to assess the number of microglial cells and astrocytes, respectively. Results: AD group showed an increase in the number of microglia, and the numbers declined in the treatment groups, RS 10, RS 20, RS10/10 and DPZ + RS (p < 0.001). Astrocyte count was increased in the treatment groups in contrast to the AD group (p < 0.05). The DPZ + RS combination group revealed substantial elevation in the number of astrocytes and decreased microglial number among all the groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion: RS administration has diminished the microglial number and elevated the number of astrocytes. The elevated reactive astrocytes have decreased the microglial population. However, the limitation of our study is utilizing the colchicine for the induction of neurodegeneration. Using the transgenic models of AD may give a better insight into the pathogenesis and effect of RS. Another limitation of this study is the administration of RS and DPZ through different routes. The prospects of this research include studying the probiotic nature of RS and the effect of RS in other neurodegenerative disorders.
