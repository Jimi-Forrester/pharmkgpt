38564455|t|Evaluation of Delirium Among Elders in the Emergency Department: A Cross-Sectional Study.
38564455|a|BACKGROUND: Health care professionals underestimate the recognition of delirium in emergency departments (EDs). In these settings, between 57% and 83% of cases of delirium go undetected. When delirium occurs, it causes an increase in the length of hospitalization, readmissions within 30 days, and mortality. No studies were carried out in Italy to assess the prevalence of delirium among elders in EDs. OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of the risk of delirium in people 65 years and older hospitalized in the ED for a minimum of 8 hours. The study's secondary goal was to identify the variables that influenced the risk of delirium. METHOD: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 EDs. The risk of delirium was assessed using the delirium screening tool 4 A's test. One hundred patients were enrolled. Data collection took place from June 28 to August 31, 2022. RESULTS: The risk of delirium was detected in 29% of the sample, whereas the risk of cognitive impairment was 13%. The use of psychotropic drugs increased the risk of delirium by 11.8 times (odds ratio [OR], 11.80; P = .003). Bed confinement increased the risk by 4.3 times (OR, 4.31; P = .009). Being dehydrated increased the risk of onset by 4.6 times (OR, 4.62; P = .010). Having dementia increased the risk of delirium manifestation by 4.4 times (OR, 4.35; P = .021). DISCUSSION: The risk of delirium was detected in a considerable portion of the sample. The results of this study can be used by health care professionals to implement preventive measures as well as support clinical judgment and establish priorities of care for patients at risk of developing delirium.
