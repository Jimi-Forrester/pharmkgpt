31534872|t|Adverse outcomes of abrupt switch and discontinuation of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in dementia with Lewy bodies: Case report and literature review.
31534872|a|Due to the well-defined risks of abrupt discontinuation of certain psychiatric medications, such as withdrawal and worsening symptoms, guideline recommendations describe evidence-based strategies for tapering some psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants. Despite widespread use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACHEI) therapy in the management of dementia, guideline recommendations for discontinuation of these therapies are very inconsistent. Specifically, studies and evidence-based recommendations for discontinuing ACHEIs in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are severely lacking. This deficit is problematic in that emerging reports suggest several adverse outcomes, such as worsening cognition and behavioral symptoms, are associated with abrupt switching and discontinuation of ACHEI therapy in this population. A case of rapid cognitive and functional decline following both abrupt switch and discontinuation of donepezil in a patient diagnosed with DLB is presented. A literature review of outcomes following changes in ACHEI therapy in DLB is also presented.
