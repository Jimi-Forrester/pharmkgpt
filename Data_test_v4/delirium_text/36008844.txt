36008844|t|Choroid and choriocapillaris changes in early-stage Parkinson's disease: a swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography-based cross-sectional study.
36008844|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the aging population. Previous literature has reported thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, and photoreceptor layer in PD patients. However, very few studies have used swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) to study the choroid and choriocapillaris vascular changes in PD and their correlations with altered contrast sensitivity. METHODS: PD patients and controls were enrolled in the current study. We used a CSV-1000E instrument to assess contrast sensitivity and performed SS-OCT and SS-OCTA to measure outer retinal thickness, choroidal thickness, choriocapillaris flow density, choroidal vascular volume (CVV), and choroidal vascular index (CVI). RESULTS: One hundred eyes of 52 PD patients and 200 eyes of 100 healthy controls were recruited in the present study. Our study found remarkably impaired contrast sensitivity in PD patients (all P < 0.05). Significant thinning of the outer retinal layer and the choroid was appreciated in the PD group compared with the healthy controls (all P < 0.05). Choriocapillaris flow density, CVI, and CVV were significantly decreased in PD patients compared with healthy controls (all P < 0.05). Contrast sensitivity was weakly associated with outer retina thickness in the 3 mm circular area, with 3 cycles per degree being the most relevant (r = 0.535, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that there is a significant decrease in contrast sensitivity, outer retina thickness, choriocapillaris flow density, CVI, and CVV in PD patients. This research has also identified a positive correlation between outer retina thickness and contrast sensitivity.
