36906686|t|Human parasagittal dura is a potential neuroimmune interface.
36906686|a|Parasagittal dura (PSD) is located on both sides of the superior sagittal sinus and harbours arachnoid granulations and lymphatic vessels. Efflux of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to human PSD has recently been shown in vivo. Here we obtain PSD volumes from magnetic resonance images in 76 patients under evaluation for CSF disorders and correlate them to age, sex, intracranial volumes, disease category, sleep quality, and intracranial pressure. In two subgroups, we also analyze tracer dynamics and time to peak tracer level in PSD and blood. PSD volume is not explained by any single assessed variable, but tracer level in PSD is strongly associated with tracer in CSF and brain. Furthermore, peak tracer in PSD occurs far later than peak tracer in blood, implying that PSD is no major efflux route for CSF. These observations may indicate that PSD is more relevant as a neuroimmune interface than as a CSF efflux route.
