37506605|a|BACKGROUND: Since the dawn of civilization, medicinal plants have been essential in the treatment of numerous human ailments. Medicinal plants have been the reliable sources to treat various diseases. Over 25% of prescription medications on the market today are made from natural resources. In the present study the selected medicinal plant, is Adenium obesum, of family Apocynaceae. The plant contains various chemical groups, including carbohydrate, cardiac glycoside, flavonoid, polyphenols, terpenoids, pregnanes, etc. OBJECTIVE: Millions of peoples worldwide are affected with neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease & Huntingtons disease are important among them. Since ancient times, medicinal herbs have been used to treat illnesses. The objective of present study is to prepare an effective & safe drug formulation to treat neurological diseases. MATERIAL & METHODS: Methanolic extract of A. obesum (200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg) alone as well as with diacerein (100 mg/kg) is used to treat the haloperidol (1 mg/kg) & iron (10 mg/kg) induced Parkinsonism & Isotretinoin induced depression in albino wistar rats. The efficacy of plant extract as well as diacerein were measured by various behavioral models, with the help of histopathological studies & antioxidant assay like GSH, SOD, CAT, and LPO. RESULTS: A. obesum alone & with diacerein is effective to treat neurological complications like Parkinson's disease & depression which can be seen in various behavioral models like, staircase test, rotarod test, forced swim test, hole board test etc. Histopathological evidences also suggest the significance of plant extract alone & with diacerein. CONCLUSION: The findings of present research work revealed the neuroprotective effect of both A. obesum extract as well as diacerein.
