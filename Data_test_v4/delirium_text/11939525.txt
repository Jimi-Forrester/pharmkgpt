11939525|a|A speciation analysis of protein-bound elements in the cytosol of human brain was achieved by size exclusion chromatographical separation of the biomolecules and on-line detection of the metal profiles in the eluate by hyphenated inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Post-mortem samples from Alzheimer's disease brains and from brains of a control group were investigated to elucidate changes in the trace element distribution during the pathological process. Special attention was paid to the metallothioneins (MT) - cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins of low molecular weight, existing in several isoforms. The isoform MT-3 is found especially in the brain and has a growth inhibition function on neurons. The MT peaks were identified in the element profiles. For this purpose, the metal binding capability and the heat stability of MT were taken into consideration. For verification, a comparison with pure MT-3 was carried out and further biochemical and analytical methods were applied to the fractions of the chromatographical run. A comparison between Alzheimer's disease and control brains showed a significant difference concerning the MT-1/-2 and MT-3 metal levels, leading to the assumption that there were oxidative processes having taken place in the Alzheimer's brain samples.
