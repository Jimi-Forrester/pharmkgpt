34537805|a|ABSTRACT: To determine the effect of recorded maternal voice on emergence delirium (ED) in children under general anesthesia, a three-group randomized trial was conducted. A total of 102 children were randomly assigned to mother recording group (n = 34), stranger recording group (n = 34), and control group (n = 34). All subjects were assessed for ED with the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale; pain with the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale; and various recovery durations and hemodynamic parameters at six time points. One-way analysis of variance showed that the ED score was significantly lower in the mother recording group (F = 18.520, p = 0.000), and statistical significance was observed in the duration of eye opening (p = 0.001) and tracheal extubation (p = 0.002). Generalized estimating equations observed interaction effects on heart rate and blood pressure (both p = 0.000). Mothers' voice might help reduce ED in children under general anesthesia.
