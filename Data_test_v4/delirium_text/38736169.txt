38736169|t|sAPPalpha Peptide Promotes Damaged Microglia to Clear Alzheimer's Amyloid-beta via Restoring Mitochondrial Function.
38736169|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition as the main pathological feature. It's an important challenge to find new ways to clear Abeta from the brain. The soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) is a neuroprotective protein and can attenuate neuronal damage, including toxic Abeta. However, the regulatory role of sAPPalpha in non-neuronal cells, such as microglia, is less reported and controversial. Here, we showed that sAPPalpha promoted the phagocytosis and degradation of Abeta in both normal and damaged microglia. Moreover, the function of damaged microglia was improved by the sAPPalpha through normalizing mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the results of molecular docking simulation showed that sAPPalpha had a good affinity with Abeta. We preliminarily reveal that sAPPalpha is similar to antibodies and can participate in the regulation of microglia phagocytosis and degradation of Abeta after binding to Abeta. sAPPalpha is expected to be a mild and safe peptide drug or drug carrier for AD.
