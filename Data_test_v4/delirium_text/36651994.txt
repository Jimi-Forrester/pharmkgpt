36651994|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a CAG expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which leads to the production and accumulation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT). While primarily considered a disorder of the central nervous system, multiple changes have been described to occur throughout the body, including activation of the immune system. In other neurodegenerative disorders, activation of the immune system has been shown to include the production of antibodies against disease-associated pathological proteins. However, the existence of mHTT-targeted antibodies has never been reported. In this study, we assessed the presence and titer of antibodies recognizing HTT/mHTT in patients with HD (n = 66) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 66) using a combination of Western blotting and ELISA. Together, these analyses revealed that antibodies capable of recognizing HTT/mHTT were detectable in the plasma samples of all participants, including healthy controls. When antibody levels were monitored at different disease stages, it was observed that antibodies against full-length mHTT were highest in patients with severe disease while antibodies against HTTExon1 were elevated in patients with mild disease. Combined, these results suggest that antibodies detecting different forms of mHTT peak at different disease stages.
