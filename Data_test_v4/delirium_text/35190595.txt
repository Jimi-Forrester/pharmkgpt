35190595|a|Pathological microglia activation can promote neuroinflammation in many neurodegenerative diseases, and it has therefore emerged as a potential therapeutic target. Increasing evidence suggests alterations in lipid metabolism as modulators and indicators in microglia activation and its effector functions. Yet, how lipid dynamics in activated microglia is affected by inflammatory stimuli demands additional investigation to allow development of more effective therapies. Here, we report an extensive matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) whole cell fingerprinting workflow to investigate inflammation-associated lipid patterns in SIM-A9 microglial cells. By combining a platform of three synergistic MALDI MS technologies we could detect substantial differences in lipid profiles of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- stimulated and unstimulated microglia-like cells leading to the identification of 21 potential inflammation-associated lipid markers. LPS-induced lipids in SIM-A9 microglial cells include phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC), sphingolipids, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. Moreover, MALDI MS-based cell lipid fingerprinting of LPS-stimulated SIM-A9 microglial cells pre-treated with the non-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid revealed specific modulation of LPS-induced-glycerolipids and LysoPC(18:0) with a significant reduction of microglial inflammation response. Our study introduces MALDI MS as a complementary technology for fast and label-free investigation of stimulus-dependent changes in lipid patterns and their modulation by pharmaceutical agents.
