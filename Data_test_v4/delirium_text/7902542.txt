7902542|t|Non-adrenoceptor [3H]idazoxan binding sites (I2-imidazoline sites) are increased in postmortem brain from patients with Alzheimer's disease.
7902542|a|The I2-imidazoline site (a non-adrenergic mitochondrial site for which a glial location has been proposed and that is associated with the B-form of the enzyme monoamine oxidase) was evaluated in postmortem cortical membranes from 9 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 9 matched-controls by using [3H]idazoxan (0.6-30 nM) in the presence of 10(-6) M (-)-adrenaline to prevent binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In AD the density (Bmax) of I2-imidazoline sites was significantly higher (+63%) than in controls whereas no differences were apparent in affinity values (Kd). The results support the hypothesis that the I2 imidazoline site has a major location on glial (astrocyte) cells.
