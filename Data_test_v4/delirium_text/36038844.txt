36038844|a|BACKGROUND: Older patients are more vulnerable and prone to abuse and neglect in hospitals and acute care settings. The present study aimed to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a questionnaire for screening abuse in hospitalized older adults. METHODS: This study was conducted from October 2017 to September 2019 using the exploratory sequential mixed-methods research design. The participants were selected among those admitted to various wards of six teaching hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. In the qualitative phase of the study, using the inductive content analysis method, the concept of abuse in hospitalized older adults was extracted through individual in-depth semi-structured interviews with 16 older patients and 11 family caregivers. Based on qualitative findings and a review of existing literature, an initial version of the questionnaire was developed. In the quantitative phase of the study, the psychometric properties (face, content, construct, and convergent validity; internal consistency and stability) of the questionnaire were examined. RESULTS: Based on qualitative findings and literature review, a pool of 154 candidate items was defined. These items were reduced to 37 after initial refinement, qualitative and quantitative face and content validity, and item analysis. The outcome of principal component analysis further reduced the number of items to 27, which were grouped into 5 components, namely "Shortcomings in management and care facility", "Neglect of professional commitments", "Physical and psychological abuse", "Protracted treatment process", and "Invasion of privacy". The explained variance of these 5 components was 50.09% of the overall variability of the questionnaire. The convergent validity of the questionnaire was acceptable (P < 0.00, r = - 0.44). Cronbach's alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient for the entire questionnaire were 0.89 and 0.92, respectively; indicating high reliability and stability of the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The hospitalized elder abuse questionnaire (HEAQ) has acceptable psychometric properties. It is recommended to use HEAQ to screen for suspected cases of abuse of hospitalized older adults.
