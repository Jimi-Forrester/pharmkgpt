31619683|a|Comprehensive protein identification and concomitant structural probing of proteins are of great biological significance. However, this is challenging to accomplish simultaneously in one confined space. Here, we develop a nanosecond photochemical reaction (nsPCR)-based click chemistry, capable of structural probing of proteins and enhancing their identifications through on-demand removal of surrounding matrices within nanoseconds. The nsPCR is initiated using a photoactive compound, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (NBA), and is examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Benefiting from the on-demand matrix-removal effect, this nsPCR strategy enables enhanced neuropeptide identification and visualization from complex tissue samples such as mouse brain tissue. The design shows great promise for structural probing of proteins up to 155 kDa due to the exclusive accessibility of nsPCR to primary amine groups, as demonstrated by its general applicability using a series of proteins with various lysine residues from multiple sample sources, with accumulated labeling efficiencies greater than 90%.
