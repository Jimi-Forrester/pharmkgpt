36235106|t|Screening and Characteristics of Marine Bacillus velezensis Z-1 Protease and Its Application of Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Mussels to Prepare Antioxidant Active Substances.
36235106|a|Bacillus velezensis is a type of microorganism that is beneficial to humans and animals. In this work, a protease-producing B. velezensis strain Z-1 was screened from sludge in the sea area near Qingdao (deposit number CGMCC No. 25059). The response surface methodology was used to analyze protease production, and the optimal temperature was 37.09  C and pH 7.73 with the addition of 0.42% NaCl, resulting in maximum protease production of 17.64 U/mL. The optimum reaction temperature and pH of the protease of strain Z-1 were 60  C and 9.0, respectively. The protease had good temperature and pH stability, and good stability in solvents such as methanol, ethanol and Tween 80. Ammonium, NH4+,and Mn2+ significantly promoted enzyme activity, while Zn2+ significantly inhibited the enzyme activity. The protease produced by strain Z-1 was used for the enzymolysis of mussel meat. The mussel hydrolysate exhibited good antioxidant function, with a DPPH free radical removal rate of 75.3%, a hydroxyl free radical removal rate of 75.9%, and a superoxide anion removal rate of 84.4%. This study provides a reference for the application of B. velez protease and the diverse processing applications of mussel meat.
