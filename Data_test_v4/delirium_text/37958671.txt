37958671|t|Potential Modifying Effect of the APOEepsilon4 Allele on Age of Onset and Clinical Manifestations in Patients with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease with and without a Pathogenic Variant in PSEN1 in a Sample of the Mexican Population.
37958671|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the age of onset (AoO) exhibits considerable variability, spanning from 40 to 90 years. Specifically, individuals diagnosed with AD and exhibiting symptoms prior to the age of 65 are typically classified as early onset (EOAD) cases. Notably, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele represents the most extensively studied genetic risk factor associated with AD. We clinically characterized and genotyped the APOEepsilon4 allele from 101 individuals with a diagnosis of EOAD, and 69 of them were affected carriers of the autosomal dominant fully penetrant PSEN1 variant c.1292C>A (rs63750083, A431E) (PSEN1+ group), while there were 32 patients in which the genetic cause was unknown (PSEN1- group). We found a correlation between the AoO and the APOEepsilon4 allele; patients carrying at least one APOEepsilon4 allele showed delays, in AoO in patients in the PSEN1+ and PSEN1- groups, of 3.9 (p = 0.001) and 8.6 years (p = 0.012), respectively. The PSEN1+ group presented higher frequencies of gait disorders compared to PSEN1- group, and apraxia was more frequent with PSEN1+/APOE4+ than in the rest of the subgroup. This study shows what appears to be an inverse effect of APOEepsilon4 in EOAD patients, as it delays AoO and modifies clinical manifestations.
