35605187|t|One- and Two-Photon Excited Autofluorescence of Lysozyme Amyloids.
35605187|a|Autofluorescence properties of amyloid fibrils are of much interest but, to date, the attention has been given mostly to one-photon excited fluorescence (1PEF), while the two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) properties of amyloids are much less explored. We investigate 1PEF and 2PEF of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in the form of monomers and fibrils. HEWL monomers feature some autofluorescence, which is enhanced in the case of fibrils. Moreover, by varying NaCl content, we introduce changes to fibrils morphology and show how the increase of the salt concentration is linked with an increase of 1PEF and 2PEF intensities. Interestingly, we observe 2PEF emission red-shifted in comparison to 1PEF. We confirm the presence of different relaxation pathways upon one- or two-photon excitation by different lifetimes of the fluorescence decays. Finally, we correlate the changes in optical properties of HEWL fibrils and monomers with salt-mediated changes in their morphology and the secondary structure.
