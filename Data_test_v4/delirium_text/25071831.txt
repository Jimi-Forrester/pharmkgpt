25071831|t|A semi-automated motion-tracking analysis of locomotion speed in the C. elegans transgenics overexpressing beta-amyloid in neurons.
25071831|a|Multi-Worm Tracker (MWT) is a real-time computer vision system that can simultaneously quantify motional patterns of multiple worms. MWT provides several behavioral parameters, including analysis of accurate real-time locomotion speed in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we determined locomotion speed of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic strain that over-expresses human beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta) in the neurons. The MWT analysis showed that the AD strain logged a slower average speed than the wild type (WT) worms. The results may be consistent with the observation that the AD patients with dementia tend to show deficits in physical activities, including frequent falls. The AD strain showed reduced ability of the eggs to hatch and slowed hatching of the eggs. Thus, over-expression of Abeta in neurons causes negative effects on locomotion and hatchability. This study sheds light on new examples of detrimental effects that Abeta deposits can exhibit using C. elegans as a model system. The information gathered from this study indicates that the motion tracking analysis is a cost-effective, efficient way to assess the deficits of Abeta over-expression in the C. elegans system.
