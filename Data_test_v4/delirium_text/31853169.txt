31853169|t|Recurrent Encephalopathy with Transverse Myelitis: An Uncommon Presentation of Neurobrucellosis.
31853169|a|Brucellosis (malta fever) is a zoonotic infection caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus which is a facultative intracellular pathogen. It causes a chronic granulomatous infection, similar in histology to tuberculosis. Brucellosis remains a diagnostic dilemma due to misleading, nonspecific manifestations and increasing trend of unusual presentations. In brucellosis, the nervous system involvement occurs in only 5 to 7% of untreated patients, and it may manifest with encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, radiculitis, and peripheral and cranial neuropathies. Transverse myelitis is an unusual occurrence. Here, the authors are reporting an unusual case of neurobrucellosis in an elderly male patient who visited multiple hospitals with recurring febrile encephalopathy and paraparesis. The diagnosis was suspected by his occupational history of working as an abattoir worker and was confirmed by the presence of high titers of Brucella immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies in the serum. The patient was managed with injection gentamicin for 2 weeks along with oral course of doxycycline and rifampicin for 6 weeks. He made a good clinical recovery and went back to work with mild residual deficits.
