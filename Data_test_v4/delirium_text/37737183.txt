37737183|t|Identification and experimental validation of autophagy-related genes in abdominal aortic aneurysm.
37737183|a|AIM: Autophagy plays essential roles in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development and progression. The objective of this study was to verify the autophagy-related genes (ARGs) underlying AAA empirically and using bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: Two gene expression profile datasets GSE98278 and GSE57691 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and principal component analysis was performed. Following, the R software (version 4.0.0) was employed to analyze potentially differentially expressed genes related with AAA and autophagy. Subsequently, the candidate genes were screened using protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the RNA expression levels of the top five selected abnormal ARGs in clinical samples obtained from the normal and AAA patients. RESULTS: According to the information contained (97 AAA patients and 10 healthy controls) in the two datasets, a total of 44 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (6 up-regulated genes and 38 down-regulated genes) were screened. GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DEARGs) demonstrated that some enrichment items were associated with inflammation, and PPI analysis indicated interaction between these genes. RT-qPCR results presented that the expression levels of IL6, PPARG, SOD1, and MAP1LC3B were in accordance with the bioinformatics prediction results acquired from the mRNA chip. CONCLUSION: Bioinformatics analysis identified 44 potential autophagy-related differentially expressed genes in AAA. Further verification by RT- qPCR presented that IL6, PPARG, SOD1, and MAP1LC3B may affect the development of AAA by regulating autophagy. These findings might help explain the pathogenesis of AAA and be helpful in its diagnosis and treatment.
