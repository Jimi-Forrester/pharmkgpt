39469604|t|Characterization of Laboratory-Confirmed Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease From 3 Ontario Tertiary Care Centers Between 2012 and 2022: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
39469604|a|Background: Globally, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) affects one in one million people annually, but there is a paucity of recent Canadian data. This study summarizes epidemiology trends and diagnostic timelines of laboratory-confirmed CJD cases in three tertiary Ontario hospitals. Method: Using laboratory information systems, we identified 30 patients with a laboratory-confirmed CJD diagnosis between 2012 and 2022 at three major tertiary hospitals in Ontario. Retrospective chart reviews were then completed. Results: Patients had a mean of 2.2 hospital visits (SD, 1.2) prior to being admitted for testing. The most common symptom presentations included loss of coordination (63.3%), behavioral changes (60%), progressive mobility loss (53.4%), memory loss (50.0%), and involuntary movements (50.0%). Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed potential CJD in 76.7% of cases, and 56.7% exhibited periodic sharp wave complexes characteristic of CJD on electroencephalogram. The mean duration from symptom onset to microbiologic testing was 91 days (SD, 90.7). End-point quaking-induced conversion (EP-QuIC) testing of cerebrospinal fluid was positive in 90.0% of patients, while 83.3% tested positive for 14-3-3 on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid 14-3-3 levels significantly correlated with shorter duration from symptom onset to death (R 2 = 0.71, F = 19.55, P = .0022). Post-diagnosis, 46.7% of patients were discharged home, 16.6% were transferred to external palliative care or hospice facilities, and 36.7% died during admission. The mean time from symptom onset to death was 121 days (SD, 120.7), and from diagnosis to death 35 days (SD, 83.9). Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of early CJD consideration and laboratory testing when appropriate neurologic symptoms are present.
