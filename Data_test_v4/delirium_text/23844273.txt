23844273|t|Isoprostanes and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal: markers or mediators of disease? Focus on Rett syndrome as a model of autism spectrum disorder.
23844273|a|Lipid peroxidation, a process known to induce oxidative damage to key cellular components, has been implicated in several diseases. Following three decades of explorations mainly on in vitro models reproducible in the laboratories, lipid peroxidation has become increasingly relevant for the interpretation of a wide range of pathophysiological mechanisms in the clinical setting. This cumulative effort has led to the identification of several lipid peroxidation end-products meeting the needs of the in vivo evaluation. Among these different molecules, isoprostanes and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal protein adducts appear to be particularly interesting. This review shows how specific oxidation products, deriving from polyunsaturated fatty acids precursors, are strictly related to the clinical manifestations and the natural history of Rett syndrome, a genetically determined neurodevelopmental pathology, currently classified among the autism spectrum disorders. In our experience, Rett syndrome offers a unique setting for physicians, biologists, and chemists to explore the borders of the lipid mediators concept.
