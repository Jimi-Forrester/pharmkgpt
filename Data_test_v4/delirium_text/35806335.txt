35806335|t|Peptidomic Approaches and Observations in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
35806335|a|Mass spectrometry (MS), with its immense technological developments over the last two decades, has emerged as an unavoidable technique in analyzing biomolecules such as proteins and peptides. Its multiplexing capability and explorative approach make it a valuable tool for analyzing complex clinical samples concerning biomarker research and investigating pathophysiological mechanisms. Peptides regulate various biological processes, and several of them play a critical role in many disease-related pathological conditions. One important example in neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. When investigating brain function and brain-related pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents the most suitable sample because of its direct contact with the brain. In this review, we evaluate publications applying peptidomics analysis to CSF samples, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the methodology of peptidomics analysis and give an overview of the achievements of CSF peptidomics over the years. Finally, publications reporting peptides regulated in AD are discussed.
