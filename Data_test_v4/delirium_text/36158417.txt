36158417|t|Frontotemporal Dementia: Dilemma in Discrimination From Similarly Presenting Neurological and Psychiatric Conditions.
36158417|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common cause of neurocognitive decline, second to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia. Its presence offers a unique challenge to physicians trying to detect cognitive deficits, as it not only arises in middle age but also can be misdiagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder. The following case describes the clinical course of a 50-year-old male with a recent history of sporadic visual and auditory hallucinations, followed by a gradual decline in cognitive function including declining memory, apathy and behavioral disinhibition, and social functioning, which are suggestive of FTD-type. Apart from the gradual decline of his cognitive function, the patient had multiple clinical encounters, during which he was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the report showcases the handful of conditions that FTD can be misdiagnosed and discusses the thorough clinical/psychological examination and investigations to be done to arrive at FTD.
