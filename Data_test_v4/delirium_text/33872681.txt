33872681|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging and is a major burden for patients, caregivers, and the overall health care system. The complexity of AD pathophysiology and the lack of deep understanding of disease mechanisms impeded the development of AD therapy. Currently approved treatments for AD only modestly improve cognitive function but do not modify disease course. The lack of pharmacological approaches has led to the consideration of alternative strategies to prevent or to slow down the progression of AD. There has been a growing interest in the scientific community regarding the impact of diet and nutrition on AD. Grape derived nutraceuticals and phytochemical compounds have demonstrated anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic properties and present as potential novel strategies for AD treatment. In this review, we summarize promising grape derived polyphenols that have been shown to modulate AD pathophysiology including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation, AD-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction.
