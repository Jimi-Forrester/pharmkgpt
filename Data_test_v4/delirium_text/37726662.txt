37726662|t|Usability and feasibility of a tablet-based e-coach for older adults in rehabilitation units to improve nutrition and physical activity: a prospective pilot study.
37726662|a|BACKGROUND: For older adults (>= 70 years), it is often challenging to maintain new nutrition and physical activity behaviours learned in rehabilitation. To minimize the risk of negative health consequences when returning home, an e-coach can be helpful. Aligning the program with an established concept such as the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change (TTM) and guidance from healthcare professionals can optimize behaviour change. OBJECTIVE: This prospective single-arm pilot study aimed to assess the usability and feasibility of a nutrition and mobility e-coach for older adults during and after rehabilitation for a period of 9 weeks. In addition, we examined the change in the TTM phase as an indicator of the participant's readiness to change or the changes made. METHODS: Older adults (>= 70 years) with nutrition deficits and/ or mobility limitations were recruited in a rehabilitation centre. Participants' phases of behaviour change in the TTM were identified by comparing current nutrition and physical activity habits via self-report with age-specific nutrition and physical activity recommendations. They received a tablet with the e-coach containing educational and interactive elements on the topics of nutrition and physical activity in older age. Participants used the e-coach and received support from healthcare professionals. The TTM phases were assessed at five times; the e-coach content was adjusted accordingly. Usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS, Score range: 0-100). Timestamps were used to evaluate how frequently participants used the e-coach: high (>= 67% of the days), medium (66 - 33% of the days), and low (< 33% of the days). RESULTS: Approximately 140 patients were approached and n = 30 recruited. Complete data sets of n = 21 persons were analysed (38% female, mean age 79.0 +- 6.0 years). The SUS was 78.6 points, 11 participants (42%) were classified as high users, 6 (39%) as medium users and 4 (19%) as low users. After nine weeks, 15 participants (71%) achieved the physical activity recommendations (baseline: 33%, n = 7). Nutrition recommendations were achieved by 14 participants (66%) after nine weeks (baseline: 24%, n = 5). CONCLUSION: The e-coach seems to be usable and feasible for older adults. We identified some optimization potentials for our application that can be transferred to the development of comparable e-health interventions for vulnerable older adults.
