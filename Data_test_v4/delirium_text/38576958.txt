38576958|a|Introduction: Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) has attracted consistently increasing attention worldwide. However, there are few bibliometric studies that systematically evaluate this field. This study aimed to visualize the knowledge structure and research trends in PND through bibliometrics to help understand the future development of basic and clinical research. Methods: Literature related to PND in Web of Science and PubMed from 1990 to 2022 were collected through keywords retrospectively. Additionally, the source information, citation information, etc. of these publications were extracted. Finally, bibliometric analysis was performed by visualization software and statistical software. Results: There were 2837 articles and reviews in total. An exponential rise in PND-related publications was observed. China had the most publication, followed by the US and Germany. The institution with the most output and citations was Harvard University (149 papers, 8966 citations). The most prominent author was Marcantonio Edward R with 66 publications and 5721 citations. The journal with the highest productivity for PND research was Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience followed by Anesthesia and Analgesia. Keywords were identified as six topics, including postoperative delirium, postoperative neurocognitive disorder, cardiac surgery, anaesthesia, orthopedic surgery, and dementia. According to keyword analysis, the most recent popular keywords in PND research were prevention, older patients, emergence delirium, orthopedic surgery, and dexmedetomidine. Conclusions: Publications on PND are increasing at an alarming rate from 1990 to 2022. Current research and future trends will concentrate on the prevention and treatment of PND, as well as PND associated with orthopedic surgery in older adults.
