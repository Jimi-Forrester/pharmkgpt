8267612|t|FT-IR spectroscopy indicates that Ca(2+)-binding to phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of the midsized neurofilament protein subunit results in beta-sheet formation and beta-aggregation.
8267612|a|The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra in trifluoroethanol (TFE) of phosphorylated peptides, NF-M17(Ser6P) and NF-M17(Ser11P) representing the C-terminal repeating domain of the midsized neurofilament protein subunit (NF-M) have been measured. In the absence of Ca2+ ions both phosphopeptides adopt predominantly aperiodic conformation with minor amounts of beta-turns, 3(10) helix or beta-pleated sheet. Addition of Ca(ClO4)2 results in opaque solutions, and in the case of the Ser6P peptide, precipitation. The infrared spectra of the supernatants reflect the presence of unordered and beta-sheet structure. The infrared spectrum of the solid Ca(2+)-complex of NF-M17 (Ser6P) in a KBr pellet shows amide component bands at 1654 (alpha-helix or loops) and 1626.5 cm-1 (beta-sheet). The high intensity of the beta-sheet component suggests extensive beta-aggregation. The data reported herein give an infrared spectroscopic support to our previous findings that upon Ca2+ binding, phosphorylated NF-M fragments undergo a marked conformational change which gives rise to partial beta-sheet formation and beta-aggregation. This observation may have relevance to the molecular events which lead to the accumulation of abnormal proteineous structures in Alzheimer's disease.
