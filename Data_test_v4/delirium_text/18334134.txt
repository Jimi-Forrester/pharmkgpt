18334134|t|Sedation in the neurologic intensive care unit.
18334134|a|Providing adequate sedation in the neurologic intensive care unit (ICU) depends on determination of proper goals for sedation, adequate assessment of the level of sedation, and appropriate choice of drug based on the patient's physiology. The management of sedation in the ICU will influence long-term outcome. Delirium, anxiety, and pain must be identified and treated separately. The use of protocols can improve compliance with published evidence-based recommendations. Propofol and dexmedetomidine may be used for rapidly titratable sedation, benzodiazepines for anxiolysis, neuroleptics for treatment of delirium, and opiates for analgesia. Unique aspects of patients with acute brain disease, such as elevated intracranial pressure or status epilepticus, require adaptation of sedative regimens. Processed EEG monitoring and volatile anesthetic agents have not yet proven beneficial or practical for use in the ICU.
