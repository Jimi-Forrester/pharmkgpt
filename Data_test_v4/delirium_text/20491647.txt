20491647|t|Huntingtons Disease: The Value of Transcranial Meganetic Stimulation
20491647|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative process whose etiology is based on a localized disturbance in the short arm of chromosome 4 that encodes the huntingtin protein (Htt). The elongation of triple CAG for glutamine characterizes this change. Mutated Htt (mHtt) causes the appearance of intracellular aggregates inducing alterations in mitochondrial metabolism in the form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP depletion. The oxidative imbalance caused by mHtt leads the neurons to a state of oxidative stress resulting in damage to macromolecules and cellular death. Since the discovery of certain mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HD, several therapeutic procedures have been shown to delay or slow the evolution of the condition and have demonstrated the biochemical and molecular mechanism involved. The studies have reported that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may improve motor and other symptoms associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric processes such as major depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscle atrophy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or HD. This study focuses on the effect of TMS on oxidative stress and neurogenesis in studies and its possible usefulness in HD.
