36005615|t|Linoleate-Rich Safflower Oil Diet Increases Linoleate-Derived Bioactive Lipid Mediators in Plasma, and Brown and White Adipose Depots of Healthy Mice.
36005615|a|Polyunsaturated fats are energy substrates and precursors to the biosynthesis of lipid mediators of cellular processes. Adipose tissue not only provides energy storage, but influences whole-body energy metabolism through endocrine functions. How diet influences adipose-lipid mediator balance may have broad impacts on energy metabolism. To determine how dietary lipid sources modulate brown and white adipose tissue and plasma lipid mediators, mice were fed low-fat (15% kcal fat) isocaloric diets, containing either palm oil (POLF) or linoleate-rich safflower oil (SOLF). Baseline and post body weight, adiposity, and 2-week and post fasting blood glucose were measured and lipid mediators were profiled in plasma, and inguinal white and interscapular brown adipose tissues. We identified over 30 species of altered lipid mediators between diets and found that these changes were unique to each tissue. We identified changes to lipid mediators with known functional roles in the regulation of adipose tissue expansion and function, and found that there was a relationship between the average fold difference in lipid mediators between brown adipose tissue and plasma in mice consuming the SOLF diet. Our findings emphasize that even with a low-fat diet, dietary fat quality has a profound effect on lipid mediator profiles in adipose tissues and plasma.
