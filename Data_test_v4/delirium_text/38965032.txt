38965032|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium and multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) share numerous risk factors and have been shown individually to be associated with adverse outcomes following hospitalisation. However, the extent to which these common ageing syndromes have been studied together is unknown. This scoping review aims to summarise our knowledge to date on the interrelationship between MLTC and delirium. METHODS: Searches including terms for delirium and MLTC in adult human participants were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Psycinfo and CINAHL. Descriptive analysis was used to summarise findings, structured according to Synthesis Without Meta-analysis reporting guidelines. RESULTS: After removing duplicates, 5256 abstracts were screened for eligibility, with 313 full-texts sought along with 17 additional full-texts from references in review articles. In total, 140 met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Much of the literature explored MLTC as a risk factor for delirium (n = 125). Fewer studies explored the impact of MLTC on delirium presentation (n = 5), duration (n = 3) or outcomes (n = 6) and no studies explored how MLTC impacts the treatment of delirium or whether having delirium increases risk of developing MLTC. The most frequently used measures of MLTC and delirium were the Charlson Comorbidity Index (n = 98/140) and Confusion Assessment Method (n = 81/140), respectively. CONCLUSION: Existing literature largely evaluates MLTC as a risk factor for delirium. Major knowledge gaps identified include the impact of MLTC on delirium treatment and the effect of delirium on MLTC trajectories. Current research in this field is limited by significant heterogeneity in defining both MLTC and delirium.
