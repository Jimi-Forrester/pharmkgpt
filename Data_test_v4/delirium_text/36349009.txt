36349009|a|The broad spectrum of curcumin's beneficial properties has encouraged medicinal researchers to investigate its therapeutic efficacy against diverse diseases. The clinical potential of curcumin is, however limited due to its poor pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties (such as low solubility, pH instability, poor absorption in circulation, rapid elimination from the body and photochemical degradation). 3,5-Bis(ylidene)-4-piperidone scaffolds are considered a curcumin mimic that exhibit diverse bio-properties. The current review provides a brief overview of these mimics and highlights biological activities relevant to drug development.
