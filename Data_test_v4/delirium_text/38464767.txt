38464767|t|Catatonia: A deep dive into its unfathomable depths.
38464767|a|This editorial addresses catatonia, a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by a spectrum of psychomotor disturbances. The editorial seeks to clarify the ambiguous aspects of catatonia, integrating recent research findings, including global studies and diagnostic advancements. It discusses catatonia's clinical manifestations, prevalence, and associated psychiatric and medical conditions, with particular emphasis on its frequent co-occurrence with schizophrenia and mood disorders. The prevalence of catatonia, which varies across psychiatric populations, is illustrated by a significant study conducted in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa. This study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the Bush-Francis Screening Instrument compared to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 criteria in diagnosing catatonia. The editorial evaluates treatment approaches, primarily focusing on benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy, and discusses emerging therapeutic strategies. It underscores the importance of robust diagnostic frameworks and early intervention in managing catatonia, as recommended by the latest evidence-based consensus guideline. Furthermore, it suggests future research directions, particularly in exploring the neurobiological and genetic factors of catatonia, to enhance our understanding and improve treatment outcomes. This editorial succinctly aims to demystify catatonia and provide valuable insights for clinicians and researchers in mental health care.
