20877458|a|In the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD) we examined the effects of a number of behavioral and pharmacological manipulations aimed at rescuing the progressive loss of synaptic communication between cerebral cortex and striatum. Two cohorts of transgenic mice with ~110 and 210 CAG repeats were utilized. Exercise prevented the reduction in striatal medium-sized spiny neuron membrane capacitance but did not reestablish synaptic communication. Activation of adenosine A2A type receptors renormalized postsynaptic activity to some extent. Finally, the ampakine Cx614, which has been shown to prevent alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptor desensitization, slow deactivation, and facilitate glutamate release, induced significant increases in synaptic activity, albeit the effect was somewhat reduced in fully symptomatic, compared to control mice. With some limitations, each of these strategies can be used to delay and partially rescue phenotypic progression of HD in this model.
