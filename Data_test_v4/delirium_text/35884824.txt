35884824|t|Start Me Up: How Can Surrounding Gangliosides Affect Sodium-Potassium ATPase Activity and Steer towards Pathological Ion Imbalance in Neurons?
35884824|a|Gangliosides, amphiphilic glycosphingolipids, tend to associate laterally with other membrane constituents and undergo extensive interactions with membrane proteins in cis or trans configurations. Studies of human diseases resulting from mutations in the ganglioside biosynthesis pathway and research on transgenic mice with the same mutations implicate gangliosides in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Gangliosides are reported to affect the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase, the ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane pump responsible for the stabilization of the resting membrane potential by hyperpolarization, firing up the action potential and ion homeostasis. Impaired Na+/K+-ATPase activity has also been hypothesized to cause seizures by several mechanisms. In this review we present different epileptic phenotypes that are caused by impaired activity of Na+/K+-ATPase or changed membrane ganglioside composition. We further discuss how gangliosides may influence Na+/K+-ATPase activity by acting as lipid sorting machinery providing the optimal stage for Na+/K+-ATPase function. By establishing a distinct lipid environment, together with other membrane lipids, gangliosides possibly modulate Na+/K+-ATPase activity and aid in "starting up" and "turning off" this vital pump. Therefore, structural changes of neuronal membranes caused by altered ganglioside composition can be a contributing factor leading to aberrant Na+/K+-ATPase activity and ion imbalance priming neurons for pathological firing.
