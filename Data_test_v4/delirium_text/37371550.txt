37371550|a|Protein aggregates are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extensive studies have focused on beta-amyloid plaques and Tau tangles. Here, we illustrate a novel source of protein aggregates in AD neurons from organelle off-target proteins. Bax is a mitochondrial pore-forming pro-death protein. What happens to Bax if it fails to target mitochondria? We previously showed that a mitochondrial target-deficient alternatively spliced variant, Bax 2, formed large cytosolic protein aggregates and triggered caspase 8-mediated cell death. Bax 2 protein levels were low in most normal organs and the proteins were quickly degraded in cancer. Here, we found that 85% of AD patients had Bax 2 required alternative splicing. Increased Bax 2 proteins were mostly accumulated in neurons of AD-susceptible brain regions. Intracellularly, Bax 2 aggregates distributed independently of Tau tangles. Interestingly, Bax 2 aggregates triggered the formation of stress granules (SGs), a large protein-RNA complex involved in AD pathogenesis. Although the functional domains required for aggregation and cell death are the same as in cancer cells, Bax 2 relied on SGs, not caspase 8, for neuronal cell death. These results imply that the aggregation of organelle off-target proteins, such as Bax 2, broadens the scope of traditional AD pathogenic proteins that contribute to the neuronal stress responses and AD pathogenesis.
