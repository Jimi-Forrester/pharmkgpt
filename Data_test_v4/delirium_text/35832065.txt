35832065|t|The Big Picture of Neurodegeneration: A Meta Study to Extract the Essential Evidence on Neurodegenerative Diseases in a Network-Based Approach.
35832065|a|The common features of all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease, are the accumulation of aggregated and misfolded proteins and the progressive loss of neurons, leading to cognitive decline and locomotive dysfunction. Still, they differ in their ultimate manifestation, the affected brain region, and the kind of proteinopathy. In the last decades, a vast number of processes have been described as associated with neurodegenerative diseases, making it increasingly harder to keep an overview of the big picture forming from all those data. In this meta-study, we analyzed genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data of the aforementioned diseases using the data of 234 studies in a network-based approach to study significant general coherences but also specific processes in individual diseases or omics levels. In the analysis part, we focus on only some of the emerging findings, but trust that the meta-study provided here will be a valuable resource for various other researchers focusing on specific processes or genes contributing to the development of neurodegeneration.
