30039743|t|Development of a Model of Hemispheric Hypodensity ("Big Black Brain").
30039743|a|Subdural hematoma (SDH) is the most common finding after abusive head trauma (AHT). Hemispheric hypodensity (HH) is a radiological indicator of severe brain damage that encompasses multiple vascular territories, and may develop in the hemisphere(s) underlying the SDH. In some instances where the SDH is predominantly unilateral, the widespread damage is unilateral underlying the SDH. To date, no animal model has successfully replicated this pattern of injury. We combined escalating severities of the injuries and insults commonly associated with HH including SDH, impact, mass effect, seizures, apnea, and hypoventilation to create an experimental model of HH in piglets aged 1 week (comparable to human infants) to 1 month (comparable to human toddlers). Unilateral HH evolved over 24 h when kainic acid was applied ipsilateral to the SDH to induce seizures. Pathological examination revealed a hypoxic-ischemic injury-type pattern with vasogenic edema through much of the cortical ribbon with relative sparing of deep gray matter. The percentage of the hemisphere that was damaged was greater on the ipsilateral versus contralateral side and was positively correlated with SDH area and estimated seizure duration. Further studies are needed to parse out the pathophysiology of this injury and to determine if multiple injuries and insults act synergistically to induce a metabolic mismatch or if the mechanism of trauma induces severe seizures that drive this distinctive pattern of injury.
