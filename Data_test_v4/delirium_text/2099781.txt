2099781|t|Binding of [3H]serotonin to lymphocytes in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
2099781|a|Based on recent studies of neuroimmune networks, the lymphocyte binding of serotonin neurotransmitter was studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease, idiopathic mental retardation, and autism. The specific binding to lymphocytes of [3H]serotonin, at a single concentration of 100 nM, was significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease patients as compared to aged controls (group mean of 3.667 +/- 2.301 v 7.506 +/- 1.717 picomoles; p = 0.001), and in children with idiopathic mental retardation as compared to healthy children (group mean of 3.694 +/- 1.627 v 5.792 +/- 1.902 picomoles; p = 0.003). However, autistic children did not differ significantly from the healthy children (group mean of 5.287 +/- 1.987 v 5.792 +/- 1.902 picomoles; p = 0.475). Reduced lymphocyte binding of serotonin may be an indication of breakdown of an unknown neuroimmune pathway relevant to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and idiopathic mental retardation.
