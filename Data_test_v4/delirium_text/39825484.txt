39825484|a|INTRODUCTION: Young-onset neurocognitive symptoms result from a heterogeneous group of neurological and psychiatric disorders which present a diagnostic challenge. To identify such factors, we analysed the Biomarkers in Younger-Onset Neurocognitive Disorders cohort, a study of individuals <65 years old presenting with neurocognitive symptoms for a diagnosis and who have undergone cognitive and biomarker analyses. METHODS: Sixty-five participants (median age at assessment of 56 years, 45% female) were recruited during their index presentation to the Royal Melbourne Hospital Neuropsychiatry Centre, a tertiary specialist service in Melbourne, Australia, and categorized as either early-onset Alzheimer's disease (n = 18), non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration (n = 23) or primary psychiatric disorders (n = 24). Levels of neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated-tau 181, apolipoprotein E genotype and late-onset Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores were determined. Information-theoretic model selection identified discriminatory factors. RESULTS: Neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated-tau 181 levels were elevated in early-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with other diagnostic categories. A multi-omic model selection identified that a combination of cognitive and blood biomarkers, but not the polygenic risk score, discriminated between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and primary psychiatric disorders (area under the curve >= 0.975, 95% confidence interval: 0.825-1.000). Phosphorylated-tau 181 alone significantly discriminated between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration causes (area under the curve = 0.950, 95% confidence interval: 0.877-1.00). DISCUSSION: Discriminating between early-onset Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration and primary psychiatric disorders causes of young-onset neurocognitive symptoms is possible by combining cognitive profiles with blood biomarkers. These results support utilizing blood biomarkers for the work-up of young-onset neurocognitive symptoms and highlight the need for the development of a young-onset Alzheimer's disease-specific polygenic risk score.
