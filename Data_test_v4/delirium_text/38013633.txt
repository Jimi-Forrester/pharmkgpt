38013633|t|Cortical gray to white matter signal intensity ratio as a sign of neurodegeneration and cognition independent of beta-amyloid in dementia.
38013633|a|Cortical gray to white matter signal intensity ratio (GWR) measured from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images was associated with neurodegeneration and dementia. We characterized topological patterns of GWR during AD pathogenesis and investigated its association with cognitive decline. The study included a cross-sectional dataset and a longitudinal dataset. The cross-sectional dataset included 60 cognitively healthy controls, 61 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 63 patients with dementia. The longitudinal dataset included 26 participants who progressed from cognitively normal to dementia and 26 controls that remained cognitively normal. GWR was compared across the cross-sectional groups, adjusted for amyloid PET. The correlation between GWR and cognition performance was also evaluated. The longitudinal dataset was used to investigate GWR alteration during the AD pathogenesis. Dementia with beta-amyloid deposition group exhibited the largest area of increased GWR, followed by MCI with beta-amyloid deposition, MCI without beta-amyloid deposition, and controls. The spatial pattern of GWR-increased regions was not influenced by beta-amyloid deposits. Correlation between regional GWR alteration and cognitive decline was only detected among individuals with beta-amyloid deposition. GWR showed positive correlation with tau PET in the left supramarginal, lateral occipital gyrus, and right middle frontal cortex. The longitudinal study showed that GWR increased around the fusiform, inferior/superior temporal lobe, and entorhinal cortex in MCI and progressed to larger cortical regions after progression to AD. The spatial pattern of GWR-increased regions was independent of beta-amyloid deposits but overlapped with tauopathy. The GWR can serve as a promising biomarker of neurodegeneration in AD.
