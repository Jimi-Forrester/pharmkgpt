30242429|t|Abnormal changes in functional connectivity between the amygdala and frontal regions are associated with depression in Alzheimer's disease.
30242429|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) of Alzheimer's disease patients with depression (D-AD) based on an amygdalar seed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). METHODS: Twenty-one non-depressed AD (nD-AD) patients and 21 D-AD patients underwent rs-fMRI. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory were used to evaluate the severity of depression. The amygdala was used as the seed for FC analysis. The FC differences between the two groups were evaluated by two-sample t tests, and the correlation of FC changes with depressive severity was analyzed by Pearson correlational analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the nD-AD patients, D-AD patients had increased FC values between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex and decreased FC values among the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that abnormal amygdala-prefrontal FC may be an important characteristic of AD patients with depression.
