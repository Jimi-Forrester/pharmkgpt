21383880|a|Hyperforin (HF) is a phloroglucinol compound obtained from St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Recent studies have shown that Hyperforin can be used to improve psychopathologic symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but the mechanism is not clear. This may be partly due to the difficult in studying Hyperforin, since this chemical is unstable and is sensitive to light, oxygen, and heat. In this study, we explored the effects of acetylate hyperforin (ace-HF), a stable derivative of hyperforin, on the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1APP695sw and SH-SY5Y cells were treated with ace-HF, followed by measuring the levels of APP and sAPPalpha. Twelve hours of treatment led to an increase in extracellular sAPPalpha, but APP mRNA and protein levels were unchanged. Further studies with alpha-secretase and a pan PKC inhibitor, Calphostin C, indicated that ace-HF's effect on extracellular sAPPalpha was closely related to PKC activities and alpha-secretase activities. Our findings suggest that ace-HF can modulate alpha-secretase-mediated APP processing via a PKC signaling pathway.
