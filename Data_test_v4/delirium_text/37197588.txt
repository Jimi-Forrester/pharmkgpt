37197588|t|Older Adults' Perspectives on Screening for Cognitive Impairment Following Critical Illness: Pre-Implementation Qualitative Study.
37197588|a|Screening for cognitive impairment following ICU discharge is recommended but not part of routine care. We sought to understand older adults' perspectives on screening for cognitive impairment following an ICU admission to inform the design and delivery of a cognitive screening intervention. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. SUBJECTS: Adults 60 years and older within 3 months of discharge from an ICU in an academic health system. INTERVENTIONS: Interviews were conducted via telephone, audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. All transcripts were coded in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Codes were organized into themes and subthemes inductively. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We completed 22 interviews. The mean age of participants was 71 +- 6 years, 14 (63.6%) were men, 16 (72.7%) were White, and 6 (27.3%) were Black. Thematic analysis was organized around four themes: 1) receptivity to screening, 2) communication preferences, 3) information needs, and 4) provider involvement. Most participants were receptive to cognitive screening; this was influenced by trust in their providers and prior experience with cognitive screening and impairment. Participants preferred simple, direct, compassionate communication. They wanted to understand the screening procedure, the rationale for screening, and expectations for recovery. Participants desired input from their primary care provider to have their cognitive screening results placed in the context of their overall health, because they had a trusted relationship, and for convenience. CONCLUSIONS: Participants demonstrated limited understanding of and exposure to cognitive screening but see it as potentially beneficial following an ICU stay. Providers should use simple, straightforward language and place emphasis on expectations. Resources may be needed to assist primary care providers with capacity to provide cognitive screening and interpret results for ICU survivors. Implementation strategies can include educational materials for clinicians and patients on rationale for screening and recovery expectations.
