16732742|t|An evaluation strategy for the early detection of postoperative delirium.
16732742|a|The aim of the present study was to identify clinical signs detective of the postoperative delirium at the early stage for nursing management. A total of 66 inpatients undergoing cardiac surgery were interviewed using the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) and NEECHAM Confusion Scale (NCS) preoperatively and on days 1 and 3 postoperatively. The mean onset of delirium occurred on postoperative day 1.3. Development of delirium was detected early by cognitive impairments in the DRS subscales of perceptual disturbance, hallucination, and cognitive status, and the NCS subscales of attention, command, orientation, and verbal skill. These results suggest that assessment of cognitive status on postoperative day is an important strategy in the early detection of postoperative delirium.
