8301883|a|An autopsy case of portal systemic encephalopathy and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type coexisting in a 77-year-old man is described. The patient had suffered recurrent episodes of delirium after a subtotal gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. He died of DIC 45 months after the gastrectomy. A pathological examination revealed a vascular plexus around the liver which might have served as collateral circulation. Neuropathologically, spongy necrosis and Alzheimer type II changes of astrocytes were found in the basal ganglia and fronto-occipital cortices. In the same anatomical regions, only immunohistological staining using antibody against amyloid beta-protein and the periodic-acid methenamine silver method revealed abundant neuriticplaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and diffuse plaques. We discussed the clinicopathological findings in this case.
