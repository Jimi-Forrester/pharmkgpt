35709193|a|BACKGROUND: Disorders of mental health are known to affect cognitive functions, hence called as cognitive disorders. Impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, vitamin-D deficiency and oxidative stress are some of the key early events reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of most common cognitive disorders, which include Alzheimer's disease. Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the known contributing factors of cognitive impairment and dementia. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out in 145 subjects, who were assessed for cognitive function by modified mini mental status examination (3MS). In addition, measurement of fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, vitamin D and oxidative markers was performed. Participants were divided into different groups based on (a) vitamin D insufficiency and sufficiency; (b) diabetic and non-diabetic with and without cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The study included a total of 145 subjects; 51 males and 94 females and the mean age was 68.24+-9.70 years. Among diabetics with vitamin D insufficiency, 35 subjects (71.43%) had cognitive impairment, but, among non-diabetics with vitamin D insufficiency, 27 subjects (62.79%) had cognitive impairment. Chi square test showed no significant association between diabetes, vitamin D insufficiency and cognitive impairment. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were non-significantly lower in cognition-impaired subjects, when compared to cognition normal subjects in diabetics with vitamin D insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that cognitive impairment is more predominant in individuals with diabetes. However, our study did not find any significant relationship between T2DM, vitamin D deficiency, cognitive impairment, and oxidative stress. A significant association was found only with GPx and 3MSE score in vitamin D insufficient non-diabetics.
