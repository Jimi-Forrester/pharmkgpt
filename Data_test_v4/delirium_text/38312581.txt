38312581|a|To explore how chitosan-modified rice porous starch-loaded catechin (CT@RPS/CS) protects HT-29 cells exposed to lead ions. METHOD: The HT-29 cells were treated differently based on their grouping. The effect of CT@RPS/CS on lead-induced toxicity was evaluated using cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress index, and cytokine tests. RESULTS: CT@RPS/CS did not affect the activity, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress level, and related cytokines of HT-29 cells. After exposure to lead, CT@RPS/CS has the potential to enhance cellular activity, minimize apoptosis, and decrease the level of oxidative stress. DISCUSSION: CT@RPS/CS not only has no toxicity to cells but also adsorbs lead ions, which protects cells.
