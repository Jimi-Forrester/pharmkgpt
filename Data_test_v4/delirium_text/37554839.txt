37554839|a|Neurological diseases affect the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, nerve roots, autonomic nervous system, neuromuscular junctions, and muscles. Herbal medicine has long been used to cure these diseases. One of these plants is lavender, which is composed of various compounds, including terpenes, such as linalool, limonene, triterpenes, linalyl acetate, alcohols, ketones, polyphenols, coumarins, cineole, and flavonoids. In this review, the literature was searched using scientific search engines and databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, and PubMed) for papers published between 1982 and 2020 via keywords, including review, lavender, and neurological disorders. This plant exerts its healing effect on many diseases, such as anxiety and depression through an inhibitory effect on GABA. The anti-inflammatory effects of this plant have also been documented. It improves depression by regulating glutamate receptors and inhibiting calcium channels and serotonergic factors, such as SERT. Its antiepileptic mechanism is due to an increase in the inhibitory effect of GABA and potassium current and a decrease in sodium current. Therefore, many vegetable oils are also used in herbal medicine. In this review, the healing effect of lavender on several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety, migraine, and Alzheimer's disease was investigated. All findings strongly support the traditional uses of lavender. More clinical studies are needed to investigate the effect of the plants' pharmacological active constituents on the treatment of life-threatening diseases in humans. The limitations of this study are the low quality and the limited number of clinical studies. Different administration methods of lavender are one of the limitations of this review.
