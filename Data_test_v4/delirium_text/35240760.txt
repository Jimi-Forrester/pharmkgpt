35240760|t|Reducing the risk of infection after total joint arthroplasty: preoperative optimization.
35240760|a|Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is one of the most commonly performed procedures in orthopedic surgery, and as the demand for TJA increases over time, the number of concurrent complications such as surgical infection will also increase. There are multiple risk factors that independently increase the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after surgery. These modifiable risk factors can be identified in preoperative clinic screening visits that gives physicians the opportunity to provide specific intervention that can decrease patient infection risk. The risk factors that are known to significantly increase the risk of PJI and/or SSI include MSSA/MRSA colonization, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular and renal disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, anemia, malnutrition, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, depression, and anxiety. Patients who present with one or more of these risk factors require intervention with a multidisciplinary approach including patient education, counseling, and follow-up. Preoperative patient optimization for high risk TJA patients can significantly decrease PJI and SSI risk while improving surgical outcomes and patient care.
