16120422|a|It has been widely accepted that vascular hypoperfusion induces oxidative stress and the outcome of this misbalance is brain energy failure. This abnormality leads to neuronal death which manifests as cognitive impairment and the development of brain pathology as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been demonstrated that the AD brain is characterized by impairments in energy metabolism. We theorize that hypoperfusion induced mitochondrial failure plays a key role in the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative damage to brain cellular compartments, especially in the vascular endothelium and in selective population of neurons with high metabolic activity in the AD brain. All of these abnormalities have been found to occur before classic AD pathology inducing neuronal degeneration and amyloid deposition during the progression of AD. Therefore, expanding investigations into both the mechanisms behind amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and the possible accelerating effects of environmental factors such as chronic hypoxia/reperfusion may open a new avenue for effective treatments of AD. Future studies examining the importance of mitochondrial pathobiology in brain cellular compartments provide insight not only into the better understanding of the neurodegenerative and/or cerebrovascular disease but also provide targets for treating these conditions.
