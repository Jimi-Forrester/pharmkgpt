34841862|t|O-Glycosylation Induces Amyloid-beta To Form New Fibril Polymorphs Vulnerable for Degradation.
34841862|a|Brain accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides (resulting from a disrupted balance between biosynthesis and clearance) occurs during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta peptides have diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that variously modulate Abeta aggregation into fibrils, but understanding the mechanistic roles of PTMs in these processes remains a challenge. Here, we chemically synthesized three homogeneously modified isoforms of Abeta (1-42) peptides bearing Tyr10 O-glycosylation, an unusual PTM initially identified from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of AD patients. We discovered that O-glycans significantly affect both the aggregation and degradation of Abeta42. By combining cryo-EM and various biochemical assays, we demonstrate that a Galbeta1-3GalNAc modification redirects Abeta42 to form a new fibril polymorphic structure that is less stable and more vulnerable to Abeta-degrading enzymes (e.g., insulin-degrading enzyme). Thus, beyond showing how particular O-glycosylation modifications affect Abeta42 aggregation at the molecular level, our study provides powerful experimental tools to support further investigations about how PTMs affect Abeta42 fibril aggregation and AD-related neurotoxicity.
