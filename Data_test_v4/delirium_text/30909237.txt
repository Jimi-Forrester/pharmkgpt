We developed an online platform- healthybrainproject.org.au (Healthy Brain Project; HBP)- to recruit, assess, and monitor at-risk middle-aged adults. OBJECTIVE: Describe the HBP methodology and report baseline characteristics and adherence indices of participants. METHODS: Between February 2017 and August 2018, 4,000 community-based middle-aged Australian adults with a first or second-degree family history of dementia enrolled at our website (healthybrainproject.org.au). Participants were directed to complete five modules: "Basics", "Health History", "How You Feel", "How You Live", and "How You Think". Of these, 1,816 participants have received a saliva sampling kit for genetic analysis. RESULTS: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 55.5 (6.8) years, 11.8 (3.4) years of education, and annual personal income of AUD$68,830 ($35,044). Participants took 26.4 (49.7) days after enrolment to complete questionnaires and cognitive tests. Most participants were from Victoria (63%), followed by New South Wales (14%). Most participants (74%) were female and 76% identified as Caucasian. Approximately 36% of participants completed all modules (n = 1,450), and 56% (n = 2,221) completed 4 out of 5 modules. Most saliva kits (89%) had been returned. CONCLUSION: The HBP joins a handful of online registries worldwide that assess and monitor a large cohort of individuals at risk of AD. Our study extends on these efforts by focusing on midlife, where the earliest signs of cognitive and pathological changes will manifest.
