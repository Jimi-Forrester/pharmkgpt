33319491|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of mild hypothermia on nerve injury by establishing a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and to clarify the specific molecular mechanism of mild hypothermia in improving brain injury in ICH rats. METHODS: The rat model of ICH was established by collagenase injection. The neurological deficit score (NDS), brain tissue water detection, and Nissl staining were applied to detect the degree of brain injury. ELISA was used to analyze the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and serum nerve injury indexes. Flow cytometry and Western Blot were used to detect neuronal apoptosis. RESULTS: Mild hypothermia treatment significantly improved the brain injury of the ICH rats and down-regulated the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in the brain tissue. Moreover, mild hypothermia also effectively inhibited IRAK2/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and thus affect neuronal apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Mild hypothermia alleviates inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting IRAK2/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the ICH rats thus improving brain injury.
