29938622|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A steep rise in the incidences of neurodegenerative disorders could be the combined effect of several non-genetic factors such as increased life expectancy, environmental pollutants, lifestyle, and dietary habits, as population-level genetic change require multiple generations. Emerging evidence suggests that chronic over-nutrition induces brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation, and are individually known to promote neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Although the association of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis with the dietary habits is well known, neuronal implications of diet and nutritional factors is still in its infancy. Transcriptomics and proteomics-based studies support the view that nutraceuticals target multiple neuroprotective pathways in a slow but effective manner without causing severe adverse effects, and may represent the future of tackling neurodegenerative disorders. CONCLUSION: In this article we i) review the diet/dietary supplement connection with brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation and ii) summarize current knowledge of the effects of nutraceuticals on neurodegenerative disorders.
