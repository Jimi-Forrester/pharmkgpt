38077065|t|Tau P301L mutation promotes core 4R tauopathy fibril fold through near-surface water structuring and conformational rearrangement.
38077065|a|Tau forms toxic fibrillar aggregates in a family of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. The faithful replication of tauopathy-specific fibril structures is a critical gap for developing diagnostic and therapeutic tools. This study debuts a strategy of identifying a critical segment of tau that forms a folding motif that is characteristic of a family of tauopathies and isolating it as a standalone peptide that form seeding-competent fibrils. The 19-residue jR2R3 peptide (295-313) spanning the R2/R3 splice junction of tau, in the presence of P301L, forms seeding-competent amyloid fibrils. This tau fragment contains the hydrophobic VQIVYK hexapeptide that is part of the core of every pathological tau fibril structure solved to-date and an intramolecular counter-strand that stabilizes the strand-loop-strand (SLS) motif observed in 4R tauopathy fibrils. This study shows that P301L exhibits a duality of effects: it lowers the barrier for the peptide to adopt aggregation-prone conformations and enhances the local structuring of water around the mutation site that facilitates site-specific dewetting and in-register stacking of tau to form cross beta-sheets. We solve a 3 A cryo-EM structure of jR2R3-P301L fibrils with a pseudo 2 1 screw symmetry in which each half of the fibril's cross-section contains two jR2R3-P301L peptides. One chain adopts a SLS fold found in 4R tauopathies that is stabilized by a second chain wrapping around the SLS fold, reminiscent of the 3-fold and 4-fold structures observed in 4R tauopathies. These jR2R3-P301L fibrils are able to template full length tau in a prion-like fashion. Significance Statement: This study presents a first step towards designing a tauopathy specific aggregation pathway by engineering a minimal tau prion building block, jR2R3, that can template and propagate distinct disease folds. We present the discovery that P301L-among the widest used mutations in cell and animal models of Alzheimer's Disease-destabilizes an aggregation-prohibiting internal hairpin and enhances the local surface water structure that serves as an entropic hotspot to exert a hyper-localized effect in jR2R3. Our study suggests that P301L may be a more suitable mutation to include in modeling 4R tauopathies than for modelling Alzheimer's Disease, and that mutations are powerful tools for the purpose of designing of tau prion models as therapeutic tools.
