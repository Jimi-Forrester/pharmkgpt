36435678|a|Copper is an essential micronutrient that serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in diverse physiological processes, including mitochondrial energy generation. Copper enters cells through a dedicated copper transporter and is distributed to intracellular cuproenzymes by copper chaperones. Mitochondria are critical copper-utilizing organelles that harbor an essential cuproenzyme cytochrome c oxidase, which powers energy production. Mutations in copper transporters and chaperones that perturb mitochondrial copper homeostasis result in fatal genetic disorders. Recent studies have uncovered the therapeutic potential of elesclomol, a copper ionophore, for the treatment of copper deficiency disorders such as Menkes disease. Here we review the role of copper in mitochondrial energy metabolism in the context of human diseases and highlight the recent developments in copper therapeutics.
