36304813|t|PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCKS FOR HIP FRACTURES  : IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE.
36304813|a|Hip fractures represent a major public health issue with increasing incidence as a population ages. The aim of this review is to describe peripheral nerve block techniques (the fascia iliaca compartment block and the pericapsular nerve group block) as pain management for hip fractures in emergency medicine, and to emphasize their benefits. Hip fractures are extremely painful injuries. The pain itself is unpleasant for patients and if left untreated it can lead to multiple complications during preoperative, operative and postoperative patient management. Pain management for elderly hip fracture patients is often challenging. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended due to their side effects, the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment and platelet aggregation inhibition. Paracetamol alone is often insufficient, and opioids have many potentially harmful side effects, such as delirium development. Peripheral nerve blocks for hip fractures are safe and effective, also in emergency medicine settings. The benefits for patients are greater pain relief, especially during movement, less opioid requirements and decreased incidence of delirium. Regional analgesia should be routinely used in hip fracture pain management.
