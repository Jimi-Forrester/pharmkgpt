36345028|a|BACKGROUND: While aging is the main risk factor for Alzheimer s disease (AD), emerging evidence suggests that metabolic alterations such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) are also major contributors. Indeed, several studies have described a close relationship between AD and T2D with clinical evidence showing that both diseases coexist. A hallmark pathological event in AD is amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain as either amyloid plaques or around leptomeningeal and cortical arterioles, thus constituting cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is observed in 85-95% of autopsy cases with AD and it contributes to AD pathology by limiting perivascular drainage of Abeta. METHODS: To further explore these alterations when AD and T2D coexist, we have used in vivo multiphoton microscopy to analyze over time the Abeta deposition in the form of plaques and CAA in a relevant model of AD (APPswe/PS1dE9) combined with T2D (db/db). We have simultaneously assessed the effects of high-fat diet-induced prediabetes in AD mice. Since both plaques and CAA are implicated in oxidative-stress mediated vascular damage in the brain, as well as in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), we have also analyzed oxidative stress by Amplex Red oxidation, MMP activity by DQ  Gelatin, and vascular functionality. RESULTS: We found that prediabetes accelerates amyloid plaque and CAA deposition, suggesting that initial metabolic alterations may directly affect AD pathology. T2D significantly affects vascular pathology and CAA deposition, which is increased in AD-T2D mice, suggesting that T2D favors vascular accumulation of Abeta. Moreover, T2D synergistically contributes to increase CAA mediated oxidative stress and MMP activation, affecting red blood cell velocity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the cross-talk between metabolic disease and Abeta deposition that affects vascular integrity, ultimately contributing to AD pathology and related functional changes in the brain microvasculature.
