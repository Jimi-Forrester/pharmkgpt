METHODS: After whole-exome sequencing on peripheral blood of 6 D-T2DM patients, the consensus mutations were screen out and analyzed by a series of bioinformatics analyses. Then, we combined whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing results to find the important genes that changed at both the DNA and RNA levels. RESULTS: The results showed that a total of 265,393 mutation sites were found in D-T2DM patients compared with normal individuals, 235 of which were consensus mutations shared with D-T2DM patients. These genes significantly enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway and sphingolipid signaling pathway. At the RNA level, a total of 375 genes were identified to be differentially expressed. After the DNA-RNA joint analysis, eight genes were screened that changed at both DNA and RNA levels. Among these genes, FUS and LMNA were related to carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Subsequently, we predicted the herbs, including Qin Pi and Hei Zhi Ma, that might play a therapeutic role in D-T2DM through the SymMap database. CONCLUSION: These findings have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of D-T2DM and provide potential targets for D-T2DM diagnosis and treatment.
