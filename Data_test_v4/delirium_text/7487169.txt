7487169|t|Communicating with persons with Alzheimer's disease: experiences of family and formal caregivers.
7487169|a|The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine and compare communication processes used by family members and formal caregivers to manage behavioral problems such as fearfulness, agitation, and wandering, that commonly occur when caring for persons with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Two groups of caregivers of persons with AD (formal and family) comprised the sample for the study. Two themes emerged from the focus group interviews: environmental adjustments and reassurance. Results suggest that interventions must be individualized. Enhancing the caregiver's skills to manage disruptive behavior may prolong his or her ability to provide in-home care for the family member with AD.
