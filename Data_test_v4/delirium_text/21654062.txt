21654062|t|APOE and AbetaPP gene variation in cortical and cerebrovascular amyloid-beta pathology and Alzheimer's disease: a population-based analysis.
21654062|a|Cortical and cerebrovascular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but also occurs in elderly people not affected by dementia. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 is a major genetic modulator of Abeta deposition and AD risk. Variants of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) gene have been reported to contribute to AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We analyzed the role of APOE and AbetaPP variants in cortical and cerebrovascular Abeta deposition, and neuropathologically verified AD (based on modified NIA-RI criteria) in a population-based autopsy sample of Finns aged >= 85 years (Vantaa85 + Study; n = 282). Our updated analysis of APOE showed strong associations of the epsilon4 allele with cortical (p = 4.91 x 10-17) and cerebrovascular (p = 9.87 x 10-11) Abeta deposition as well as with NIA-RI AD (p = 1.62 x 10-8). We also analyzed 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the AbetaPP locus. In single SNP or haplotype analyses there were no statistically significant AbetaPP locus associations with cortical or cerebrovascular Abeta deposition or with NIA-RI AD. We sequenced the promoter of the AbetaPP gene in 40 subjects with very high Abeta deposition, but none of these subjects had any of the previously reported or novel AD-associated mutations. These results suggest that cortical and cerebrovascular Abeta depositions are useful quantitative traits for genetic studies, as highlighted by the strong associations with the APOE epsilon4 variant. Promoter mutations or common allelic variation in the AbetaPP gene do not have a major contribution to cortical or cerebrovascular Abeta deposition, or very late-onset AD in this Finnish population based study.
