38541324|t|From Acute Infection to Prolonged Health Consequences: Understanding Health Disparities and Economic Implications in Long COVID Worldwide.
38541324|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a growing number of patients experiencing persistent symptoms and physiological changes after recovering from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as Long COVID. Long COVID is characterized by recurring symptoms and inflammation across multiple organ systems. Diagnosis can be challenging, influenced by factors like demographics, comorbidities, and immune responses. Long COVID impacts various organ systems and can have neuropsychological effects. Health disparities, particularly related to race, contribute to a higher burden of infection and ongoing symptoms in minority populations. Managing Long COVID entails addressing a spectrum of symptoms that encompass physical, cognitive, and psychological aspects. The recovery period for patients with Long COVID can vary significantly, influenced by factors like the severity of the disease, hospitalization, comorbidities, and age. Currently, there are no universally effective treatments, although certain interventions show promise, necessitating further research. Self-management and rehabilitation programs can provide relief, but more research is needed to establish their effectiveness. Preventive measures such as vaccination and the use of antiviral medications and metformin. It is imperative to conduct further research to develop evidence-based guidelines and gain a better understanding of the long-term implications of COVID-19. Long COVID could have substantial economic impact on the labor market, productivity, healthcare expenditures, and overall economic growth. To address the challenges patients with long-term complications face, there is a focus on strategies like promoting telework and flexible work arrangements to accommodate diverse symptoms, particularly chronic fatigue and other Long COVID effects. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the multifaceted complexity of Long COVID and the ongoing need to address its potential long-term health and economic impacts.
