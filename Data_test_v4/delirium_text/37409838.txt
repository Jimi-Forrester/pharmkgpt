37409838|t|Prospective, randomised comparison of two intravenous sedation methods for magnetic resonance imaging in children.
37409838|a|BACKGROUND: Children usually need sedation or even anaesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. As there is no universally accepted method for this purpose we undertook a prospective, randomised comparison of propofol and dexmedetomidine in children aged 1 to 10 years. METHODS: After Institutional Board approval and parents' informed consent 64 ASA status I or II children scheduled for MRI scan were enrolled. Patients were premedicated with intravenous (IV) midazolam (0.1 mg kg -1 ) and ketamine (1 mg kg -1 ) and randomised to propofol (P) or dexmedetomidine (D) group. A propofol bolus of 1 mg kg -1 followed by infusion of 4 mg kg -1 h -1 , or dexmedetomidine 1 microg kg -1 followed by 2 microg kg -1 h-1 infusion were used. Heart rate, SpO 2 and non-invasive blood pressure were monitored and recorded at 5 min intervals. Results were compared by means of standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Both dexmedetomidine and propofol after premedication with ketamine and midazolam are suitable for MRI sedation, although propofol use results in shorter recovery time. Less interventions are needed when dexmedetomidine is used.
