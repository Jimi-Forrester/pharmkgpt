33498927|a|Several studies have reported neuroprotective effects by natural products. A wide range of natural compounds have been investigated, and some of these may play a beneficial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, have been implicated in AD. In particular, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are able to trigger several neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways. In this review, we summarize and discuss existing literature on natural marine and terrestrial compounds, as well as their ability to modulate MMP-2 and MMP-9, and we evaluate their potential as therapeutic compounds for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease.
