35437315|a|Age-related tooth loss impedes mastication. Epidemiological and physiological studies have reported that poor oral hygiene and occlusion are associated with cognitive decline. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism by which decreased occlusal support following bilateral extraction of the maxillary first molars affects cognitive functions in young and aged mice and examined the expression of brain-function-related genes in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. We observed decreased working memory, enhanced restlessness, and increased nocturnal activity in aged mice with molar extraction compared with that in mice with intact molars. Furthermore, in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of molar-extracted aged mice, the transcript-level expression of Bdnf, Rbfox3, and Fos decreased, while that of Cdkn2a and Aif1 increased. Thus, decreased occlusal support after maxillary first molar extraction may affect cognitive function and activity in mice by influencing aging, neural activity, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.
