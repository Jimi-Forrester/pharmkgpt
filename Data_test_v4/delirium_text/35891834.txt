35891834|t|A Comparative Analysis Between Ketamine Versus Combination of Midazolam and Haloperidol for Rapid Safe Control of Agitated Patients in Emergency Department: A Systematic Review.
35891834|a|We aim to discuss the efficacy and adverse effects of using ketamine in agitated patients in the emergency department (ED) compared with the combination therapy of haloperidol with benzodiazepine. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An electronic search from PubMed/Medline, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar was conducted from their inception to 30th April 2022. We included agitated patients in ED who were given infusion with ketamine only. Our comparative group was patients infused with combined therapy of haloperidol and benzodiazepine. We did not include letters, case reports, abstracts, conference papers, appraisals, reviews, and studies where full text was unavailable. We did not put any language restrictions. Three studies were selected in our manuscript (one cohort and two randomized controlled trials). All three studies showed that ketamine was used to achieve sedation in less time than the other group. However, two studies reported significantly more adverse effects in ketamine-infused groups. We concluded that ketamine use is superior when its primary focus is to sedate the patient as quickly as possible, but it carries some side effects that should be considered. However, we still need more studies assessing the efficacy of ketamine in agitated patients presenting in the ED.
