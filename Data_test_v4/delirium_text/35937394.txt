35937394|a|Background: Psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) expose patients to chronic inflammation as well as physical and psychological disabilities, but the impact of such alterations on cognitive function is unknown. Objective: This study is aimed at determining if CTCL and psoriasis impact cognitive functioning in relation to psychological and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) status. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in an outpatient dermatology clinic of a university teaching hospital. Thirty-nine subjects with CTCL (N = 20) or psoriasis (N = 19) who met eligibility criteria were included. The cognitive domains of memory, attention and processing speed, and executive function were assessed with standard neuropsychological tests. Subjects were assessed for depression, anxiety, and HR-QOL (using the SKINDEX-29 questionnaire). Results: Study participants were CTCL and psoriasis subjects; cognitive impairment was found in the domain of memory in 17.9% subjects with CTCL or psoriasis. Lower scores on executive function tests were predicted by higher (worse HR-QOL) SKINDEX-29 functioning scores (p = 0.01). A higher estimated baseline intellectual functioning predicted lower scores (better HR-QOL) on the symptoms and functioning domains of SKINDEX-29 (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) and a statistical trend (p = 0.07) for the emotion domain. Memory and acute anxiety were adversely impacted by shorter disease duration (p = 0.01 for both). Conclusions: Memory impairment may be associated comorbidity in CTCL and psoriasis. Subjects with stronger cognitive resources appear to cope better with health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) challenges.
