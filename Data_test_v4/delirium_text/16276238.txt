16276238|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Statins are the most used cholesterol-lowering agents worldwide. Earlier studies suggested that they may have preventive effects in Alzheimer's disease. However, prospective studies have questioned this hypothesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Statins regulate beta-amyloid metabolism and microglial activation. Pathologically, patients with Alzheimer's disease have more severe atherosclerosis in cerebral arteries than do controls. Such lesions may cause cerebral hypoperfusion, a risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline. Although most population-based studies have failed to show a beneficial effect of statins in Alzheimer's disease, two randomized controlled trials suggested that statins slow cognitive decline in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. SUMMARY: There is still some hope that statins reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and slow its progression. Large-scale randomized controlled trials of simvastatin and atorvastatin for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease are underway, which might provide more conclusive results than earlier studies.
