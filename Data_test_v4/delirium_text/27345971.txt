27345971|a|Improvement in transduction efficiency makes it possible to convert blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). In this study, we generated an iPSC line from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) donated by a patient who exhibited memory deficit at age 59; outcome of positron emission tomography scan is consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Integration-free CytoTune-iPS Sendai Reprogramming factors which include Sendai virus particles of the four Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc were introduced to PBMC to convert them to iPSCs without retention of virus. Three germ layer differentiation was induced to demonstrate the pluripotency of these iPSCs.
