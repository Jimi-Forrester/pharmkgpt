34912607|t|Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction Following the Use of Dexmedetomidine.
34912607|a|Dexmedetomidine is a preferred agent for light sedation with minimal adverse effects. We report a case of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction following dexmedetomidine use in a patient with alcohol withdrawal. He was treated with benzodiazepines first to control the withdrawal symptoms, then escalated to dexmedetomidine once delirium tremens ensued. Later on, the patient developed abdominal distension and vomiting. Imaging showed dilated bowel loops and absence of peristalsis on ultrasound. Decompression with the nasogastric (NG) tube was done, with high output from the NG tube. Dexmedetomidine infusion was used twice, and once it was stopped, the NG tube output was reduced, with the resumption of gastrointestinal motility and improvement of the abdominal distension. Recent similar reports of functional intestinal obstruction following alpha-2 (alpha2) agonist use necessitate further studies of intestinal motility following dexmedetomidine use and awareness of the possible side effect of dexmedetomidine on intestinal motility.
