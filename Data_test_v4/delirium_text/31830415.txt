31830415|a|The oligomerization of Abeta16-22 peptide, which is the hydrophobic core region of full-length Abeta1-42, causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). This progressive neurodegenerative disease affects over 44 million people worldwide. However, very few synthesized drug molecules are available to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the biological ATP molecule prevents Abeta fibrillation at the millimolar scale; however, the significance of ATP molecules on Abeta fibrillation and the mechanism behind it remain elusive. We have carried out a total of 7.5 mus extensive all-atom molecular dynamics and 8.82 mus of umbrella sampling in explicit water using AMBER14SB, AMBER99SB-ILDN, and AMBER-FB15 force fields for Abeta16-22 peptide, to investigate the role of ATP on the disruption of Abeta16-22 prefibrils. From various analyses, such as secondary structure analysis, residue-wise contact map, SASA, and interaction energies, we have observed that, in the presence of ATP, the aggregation of Abeta16-22 peptide is very unfavorable. Moreover, the biological molecule ATP interacts with the Abeta16-22 peptide via hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and NH-pi interactions which, ultimately, prevent the aggregation of Abeta16-22 peptide. Hence, we assume that the deficiency of ATP may cause Alzheimer's disease (AD).
