36927447|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between biomarkers of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, plasma triglyceride/HDL cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio, on the rate of cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. The role of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a key functional component of HDL, on cognitive decline also remains unclear among them. Here we evaluate baseline plasma TG/HDL-C ratio and CSF and plasma ApoA1 levels and their relation with cognitive decline in the MCI and Dementia stages of AD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study (156 participants; 106 MCI, 50 AD dementia) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, with an average of 4.0 (SD 2.8) years follow-up. Baseline plasma TG/HDL-C, plasma, and CSF ApoA1 and their relationship to inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) biomarkers and longitudinal cognitive outcomes were evaluated. Multivariable linear mixed effect models were used to assess the effect of baseline analytes with longitudinal changes in Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and Logical Memory delayed recall (LM) score after controlling for well-known covariates. RESULTS: A total of 156 participants included 98 women, 63%; mean age was 74.9 (SD 7.3) years. At baseline, MCI and dementia groups did not differ significantly in TG/HDL-C (Wilcoxon W statistic = 0.39, p = 0.39) and CSF ApoA1 levels (W = 3642, p = 0.29), but the dementia group had higher plasma ApoA1 than the MCI group (W = 4615, p = 0.01). Higher TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with faster decline in CDR-SB among MCI and dementia groups. Higher plasma ApoA1 was associated with faster decline in MMSE and LM among MCI, while in contrast higher CSF ApoA1 levels related to slower cognitive decline in MMSE among MCI. CSF and plasma ApoA1 also show opposite directional correlations with biomarkers of BBB integrity. CSF but not plasma levels of ApoA1 positively correlated to inflammation analytes in the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications (KEGG ID:KO04933). CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of metabolic syndrome relate to rate of cognitive decline among MCI and dementia individuals. Elevated plasma TG/HDL-C ratio and plasma ApoA1 are associated with worse cognitive outcomes in MCI and dementia participants. CSF ApoA1 and plasma ApoA1 likely have different roles in AD progression in MCI stage.
