10923991|t|Late-onset neurodegenerative diseases--the role of protein insolubility.
10923991|a|Recently, mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene were found to cause dominantly inherited Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) and alpha-synuclein was identified as a major component of the Lewy body. However, the cause of the common form of PD, with a multifactorial rather than autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remains unknown. Alpha-synuclein precipitates slowly and apparently spontaneously at high concentration in solution and the mutations that cause PD accelerate precipitation. Other dominantly inherited late-onset or adult-onset dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases are associated with precipitation of proteins. In Alzheimer disease, beta-amyloid and tau abnormalities are present and in prion disorders, prion proteins are found. In Huntington disease, a disorder with expanded CAG repeats, huntingtin precipitates occur. In dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias, also expanded CAG repeat disorders, the corresponding ataxin protein precipitates are found. In multiple system atrophy, alpha-synuclein precipitates are encountered and in progressive supranuclear palsy, tau precipitates occur. In familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a group of dominantly inherited disorders, SOD1 precipitates are found. Most of these disorders can involve the basal ganglia in some way. Since similar processes seem to affect neurons of adults or older individuals and since a relatively limited group of proteins seems to be involved, each producing a form of neurodegeneration, it is possible that certain common features are present that affect this group of proteins. Candidates include a conformational shift, as in prions, an abnormality of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, as seen in PD, an abnormality of a pathway preventing precipitation (e.g. chaperonins), or potentiation of a pathway promoting precipitation (e.g. gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase) or apoptosis. Elucidation of the pathways causing this protein insolubilisation is the first step towards approaching prevention and reversal in these late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.
