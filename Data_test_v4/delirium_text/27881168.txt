27881168|a|BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial porin, also known as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), is a multi-functional channel protein that shuttles metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol and implicated in cellular life and death decisions. The inhibition of porin under the control of neuronal Ddc-Gal4 result in short lifespan and in an age-dependent loss in locomotor function, phenotypes that are strongly associated with Drosophila models of Parkinson disease. METHODS: Loss of porin function was achieved through exploitation of RNA interference while derivative lines were generated by homologous recombination and tested by PCR. The UAS/Gal4 expression system was exploited with directed expression in neurons achieved with the use of the Dopa decarboxylase and in the developing eye with the Glass multiple reporter transgenes. Statistical analyses for ageing assay employed Log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, climbing indices were fitted with a non-linear curve and confidence intervals compared at 95%. Biometric analysis of the eye phenotypes was obtained by unpaired student T-test. RESULTS: The expression of alpha-synuclein in neuronal populations that include dopamine producing neurons under the control of Ddc-Gal4 produces a robust Parkinson disease model, and results in severely reduced lifespan and locomotor dysfunction. In addition, the porin-induced phenotypes are greatly suppressed when the pro-survival Bcl-2 homologue Buffy is overexpressed in these neurons and in the developing eye adding to the cellular advantages of altered expression of this anti-apoptotic gene. When we co-expressed alpha-synuclein along with porin, it results in a decrease in lifespan and impaired climbing ability. This enhancement of the alpha-synuclein-induced phenotypes observed in neurons was demonstrated in the neuron rich eye, where the simultaneous co-expression of porin-RNAi and alpha-synuclein resulted in an enhanced eye phenotype, marked by reduced number of ommatidia and increased disarray of the ommatidia. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of porin in dopaminergic neurons among others result in reduced lifespan and age-dependent loss in climbing ability, phenotypes that are suppressed by the overexpression of the sole pro-survival Bcl-2 homologue Buffy. The inhibition of porin phenocopies Parkinson disease phenotypes in Drosophila, while the overexpression of Buffy can counteract these phenotypes to improve the overall "healthspan" of the organism.
