30294687|a|Microglia are classified mainly into the M1 or M2 phenotypes, which evoke either proinflammatory or neuroprotective responses. Given the association of microglia with the pathogenesis of neuronal diseases, they are in focus as therapeutic targets for the treatment of such conditions. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a ligand for the c-kit receptor, one of the differentiation factors for bone marrow cells. In this study, characteristics of SCF-activated microglia and their effects on neurons were analyzed to investigate the therapeutic potential of SCF in neuronal diseases. SCF was found to induce proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis of microglia. In addition, SCF-derived microglia showed a neuroprotective phenotype expressing anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and M2 markers as compared to the phenotype shown by granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor-derived microglia expressing inflammatory cytokines and M1 markers. Furthermore, supernatant medium from SCF-activated microglia enhanced cell proliferation and protection from cell death in NSC-34 neuronal cells. We conclude that SCF modulates microglial functions and induces activation of the neuroprotective effects of microglia, which could be used for treatment of neuronal diseases.
