520153|a|296 cases of delirium tremens treated in 1958-69 were analysed retrospectively. Forty-one patients died in delirium or shortly thereafter. In 72 by now dead patients cirrhosis of the liver was the most common cause of death. Of 68 patients re-examinated, 12 were now teetotallers and six had markedly reduced there intake. Fifty patients had continued drinking and most of them had signs of liver failure, one had hypertension and one also had a polyneuropathy. Those who were abstaining, as well as the patients with a favourable course,and most of them were married. Although the acute death-rate of delirium has been markedly reduced since the introduction of clomethiazole treatment, it remains high after discharge. In almost half of those who were still drinking there had been a slide downwards in their social status. Delirium tremens is almost always precipitated by alcohol withdrawal.
