38254835|t|Influencing Factors on the Quality of Lymph Node Dissection for Stage IA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Nationwide Cohort Study.
38254835|a|Lymphadenectomy is an essential part of complete surgical operation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This retrospective, multicenter cohort study aimed to identify factors that influence the lymphadenectomy quality. Data were obtained from the Polish Lung Cancer Study Group Database. The primary endpoint was lobe-specific mediastinal lymph node dissection (L-SMLND). The study included 4271 patients who underwent VATS lobectomy for stage IA NSCLC, operated between 2007 and 2022. L-SMLND was performed in 1190 patients (27.9%). The remaining 3081 patients (72.1%) did not meet the L-SMLND criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that patients with PET-CT (OR 3.238, 95% CI: 2.315 to 4.529; p < 0.001), with larger tumors (pT1a vs. pT1b vs. pT1c) (OR 1.292; 95% CI: 1.009 to 1.653; p = 0.042), and those operated on by experienced surgeons (OR 1.959, 95% CI: 1.432 to 2.679; p < 0.001) had a higher probability of undergoing L-SMLND. The quality of lymphadenectomy decreased over time (OR 0.647, 95% CI: 0.474 to 0.884; p = 0.006). An analysis of propensity-matched groups showed that more extensive lymph node dissection was not related to in-hospital mortality, complication rates, and hospitalization duration. Actions are needed to improve the quality of lymphadenectomy for NSCLC.
