28826892|t|Incidence of Postoperative Delirium and Its Impact on Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.
28826892|a|There are limited data on the occurrence of postoperative delirium after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We sought to investigate the incidence of delirium after TAVI and its impact on clinical outcomes. A total of 148 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI were enrolled. Of these patients, 141 patients survived hospital stay. The incidence of delirium was assessed in these patients for the first 4 days after the index procedure. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of delirium. Baseline characteristics, procedural and long-term outcomes, and frailty and quality-of-life indexes were compared among the groups. Of the 141 patients analyzed, 29 patients developed delirium. The transapical access was more common in patients with delirium (51.7% vs 8.9%, p <0.001). A greater median contrast volume load in the delirium group was noted (75 vs 100 ml, p = 0.001). Significantly more patients with delirium were considered as frail before TAVI. Thirty-day and 12-month all-cause mortality rates were higher in the delirium group (0.0% vs 17.2%, p <0.001; and 3.6% vs 37.9%, p <0.001, respectively). Differences in mortality were significant even after adjustment for baseline characteristics. The quality of life at 12 months, assessed by the 3-level version of the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire, was similar in both groups. Despite a relatively minimally invasive character of TAVI as compared with surgery, some patients experience delirium after TAVI. Importantly, the occurrence of delirium after TAVI may help to identify patients with worse short- and long-term outcomes.
