32574955|a|BACKGROUND: Identifying effective drugs to suppress vascular inflammation is a promising strategy to delay the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Itaconate has a vital role in regulating inflammatory activation in various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of itaconate in the progression of AAA is unknown. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of itaconate on AAA formation and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to determine Irg1 and downstream Nrf2 expression in human and mouse AAA samples. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed to measure the abundance of itaconate. OI treatment and Irg1 knockdown were performed to study the role of OI in AAA formation. Nrf2 intervention in vivo was performed to detect the critical role of Nrf2 in the beneficial effect of OI on AAA. FINDINGS: We found that itaconate suppressed the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice, while Irg1 deficiency exerted the opposite effect. Mechanistically, itaconate inhibited vascular inflammation by enabling Nrf2 to function as a transcriptional repressor of downstream inflammatory genes via alkylation of Keap1. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency significantly aggravated inflammatory factor expression and promoted AAA formation. In addition, Keap1 overexpression significantly promoted Ang II-induced AAA formation, which was inhibited by itaconate. INTERPRETATION: Itaconate inhibited AAA formation by suppressing vascular inflammation, and therapeutic approaches to increase itaconate are potentially beneficial for preventing AAA formation.
