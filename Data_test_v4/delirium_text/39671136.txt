39671136|t|Exploring role of citrus fruits in comorbid neurodegenerative disorders associated with psoriasis.
39671136|a|A neurodegenerative illness is a disorder in which the brain and/or spinal cord's neurons, or nerve cells, gradually deteriorate and disappear. These illnesses often get worse with time and can seriously affect movement, cognition, and other neurological functions. Psoriasis is a long-term autoimmune skin condition marked by fast skin cell growth that results in red, elevated areas coated in silvery-white scales. It can affect several body parts, such as the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back, and it is not communicable. The build-up of amyloid beta [Abeta] protein is linked to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Kim et al. 2020). These ROS can trigger multiple pathways, including MAPK, NFkB, JAK/STAT, and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), ultimately playing a role in the development of neurodegenerative illnesses like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and psoriasis. People who have psoriasis are more likely to acquire AD, as psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is genetically connected. Because of the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties of citrus fruits neurodegenerative and psoriasis disease may be prevented. The neuroprotective action of bioactives in citrus fruits involves the inhibition of inflammation through the control of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory qualities, polyphenols may be able to control the immune response in psoriasis. We performed a thorough review in order to investigate for the first time to understand the role of citrus fruits in comorbid neurodegenerative disorders associated with psoriasis. For better understanding into the possible applications of citrus fruits in treating psoriasis and neurodegenerative disease would require additional studies focusing directly on the relationship between citrus fruits consumption in managing neurodegenerative and psoriasis disease.
