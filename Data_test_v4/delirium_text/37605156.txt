37605156|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more serious decline of dementia. Previous studies have shown that regular exercise can improve cognition and physical performance in older adults. Walking is a low-technology and low-cost exercise that has been proven to improve cognition and mobility in healthy elderly individuals. However, no systematic review or meta-analysis has explored whether walking can improve cognitive function in older adults with MCI. This study aimed to explore the effects of walking interventions on cognitive functions in individuals with MCI. METHODS: In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Web of Science, Airiti Library, and the National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan were searched from inception to July 2023. Independent reviewers selected randomized clinical trials (RCT) that compared the effects of walking with no intervention or other exercises in individuals with MCI. The primary outcomes were cognitive functions, and the secondary outcome was walking endurance. Three reviewers independently conducted data extraction. The risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were included in this review. The quality of evidence in these studies was rated as good to excellent. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the individuals with MCI had no significant improvement in cognitive function but had significant improvement in the 6-min walk test (Mean Difference=23.70, p=0.008) after walking interventions compared to no intervention or other exercises. CONCLUSION: Walking intervention has no significant improvement on cognitive functions in older adults with MCI. However, walking induces beneficial effects on aerobic capacity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This systematic review has the registration number CRD42021283753 on PROSPERO.
