36936324|t|Next-Generation Hydrogels as Biomaterials for Biomedical Applications: Exploring the Role of Curcumin.
36936324|a|Since the first report on the pharmacological activity of curcumin in 1949, enormous amounts of research have reported diverse activities for this natural polyphenol found in the dietary spice turmeric. However, curcumin has not yet been used for human application as an approved drug. The clinical translation of curcumin has been hampered due to its low solubility and bioavailability. The improvement in bioavailability and solubility of curcumin can be achieved by its formulation using drug delivery systems. Hydrogels with their biocompatibility and low toxicity effects have shown a substantial impact on the successful formulation of hydrophobic drugs for human clinical trials. This review focuses on hydrogel-based delivery systems for curcumin and describes its applications as anti-cancer as well as wound healing agents.
