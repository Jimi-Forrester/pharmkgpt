15277623|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and impact of comorbid psychiatric disturbances in Parkinson disease (PD) patients with psychosis. METHODS: Subject data were derived from a research database of 116 PD patients participating in standardized motor, cognitive, psychiatric, and caregiver assessments. RESULTS: There were 25 patients (22%) with psychosis manifest as hallucinations (n = 9), delusions (n = 1), or hallucinations and delusions (n = 15) and 25 patients (22%) who had no current or past psychiatric comorbidities (PDN). In the psychotic group, 44% had psychosis only (PSY), and 56% had psychosis plus at least one other comorbid psychiatric disturbance (PSY+), including depressive disorders (71%), anxiety disorders (21%), apathetic syndromes (14%), and delirium (14%). There were no differences in age, sex, education, or age onset or duration of PD among the PSY, PSY+, and PDN groups. Both psychotic groups had greater motor, functional, and frontal cognitive deficits and increased caregiver burden scores relative to PDN. PSY+ showed greater global and selective cognitive deficits compared to PDN. Psychosis was a primary predictor of caregiver burden, whereas depressive symptoms indirectly enhanced motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpsychotic psychiatric disturbances, especially affective disturbances, are common comorbidities in PD patients with psychosis and warrant clinical attention to reduce morbidity and caregiver distress.
