36475175|t|Prevalence of the Risk Factors of Delirium Among COVID-19 Patients in the Intensive Care Unit at King Abdullah Medical City, Makkah: A Single-Center Study.
36475175|a|Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at a higher risk of developing delirium. In this study, we estimated the incidence of delirium and its risk factors in ICU patients with COVID-19 at King Abdullah Medical City (KAMC), Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methodology We conducted a retrospective, analytical, cohort study of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of KAMC between May 2020 and July 2021. Data were collected from electronic medical records. Results Of the 406 examined patients with COVID-19 aged >18 years, 55 developed delirium in the ICU setting. The incidence rate was 0.59% per 100 ICU days in these 55 patients; the mean age was 62.36 +- 17.9 years, and 65.5% were men. Binary logistic regression showed that age (p = 0.027), nationality (p = 0.045), presence of infectious diseases other than COVID-19 (p = 0.047), and ICU outcome (p = 0.013) were significant risk factors for developing delirium. The clinical presentation and prognosis of patients who developed delirium were assessed using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and the mean scores were 16.13 +- 7.96 and 5.25 +- 3.48, respectively. The mean length of ICU stay was 22.2 +- 33.3 days; 39 (70.9%) patients were discharged and 16 (29.1%) died. Conclusions Older age, nationality, infections, and ICU outcomes were risk factors for developing delirium in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at KAMC. Early detection of cognitive comorbidities and delirium in these patients is important.
