36535747|t|Dexmedetomidine for adult cardiac surgery: a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.
36535747|a|The effects of dexmedetomidine in adults undergoing cardiac surgery are inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the effects of peri-operative dexmedetomidine in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane for relevant randomised controlled trials between 1 January 1990 and 1 March 2022. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology checklist to assess study quality and the GRADE approach to certainty of evidence. We assessed the sensitivity of results to false data. We used random-effects meta-analyses to analyse the primary outcomes: durations of intensive care and tracheal intubation. We included 48 trials of 6273 participants. Dexmedetomidine reduced the mean (95%CI) duration of intensive care by 5.0 (2.2-7.7) h, p = 0.001, and tracheal intubation by 1.6 (0.6-2.7) h, p = 0.003. The relative risk (95%CI) for postoperative delirium was 0.58 (0.43-0.78), p = 0.001; 0.76 (0.61-0.95) for atrial fibrillation, p = 0.015; and 0.49 (0.25-0.97) for short-term mortality, p = 0.041. Bradycardia and hypotension were not significantly affected. Trial sequential analysis was consistent with the primary meta-analysis. Adjustments for possible false data reduced the mean (95%CI) reduction in duration of intensive care and tracheal intubation by dexmedetomidine to 3.6 (1.8-5.4) h and 0.8 (0.2-1.4) h, respectively. Binary adjustment for methodological quality at a Joanna Briggs Institute score threshold of 10 did not alter the results significantly. In summary, peri-operative dexmedetomidine reduced the durations of intensive care and tracheal intubation and the incidence of short-term mortality after adult cardiac surgery. The reductions in intensive care stay and tracheal intubation may or may not be considered clinically useful, particularly after adjustment for possible false data.
