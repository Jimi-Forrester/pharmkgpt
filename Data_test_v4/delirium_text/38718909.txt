38718909|a|Neuroinflammation and accumulation of Amyloid Beta (Abeta) accompanied by deterioration of special memory are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Effective preventative and treatment options for AD are still needed. Microglia in AD brains are characterized by elevated levels of microRNA-17 (miR-17), which is accompanied by defective autophagy, Abeta accumulation, and increased inflammatory cytokine production. However, the effect of targeting miR-17 on AD pathology and memory loss is not clear. To specifically inhibit miR-17 in microglia, we generated mannose-coated lipid nanoparticles (MLNPs) enclosing miR-17 antagomir (Anti-17 MLNPs), which are targeted to mannose receptors readily expressed on microglia. We used a 5XFAD mouse model (AD) that recapitulates many AD-related phenotypes observed in humans. Our results show that Anti-17 MLNPs, delivered to 5XFAD mice by intra-cisterna magna injection, specifically deliver Anti-17 to microglia. Anti-17 MLNPs downregulated miR-17 expression in microglia but not in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Anti-17 MLNPs attenuated inflammation, improved autophagy, and reduced Abeta burdens in the brains. Additionally, Anti-17 MLNPs reduced the deterioration in spatial memory and decreased anxiety-like behavior in 5XFAD mice. Therefore, targeting miR-17 using MLNPs is a viable strategy to prevent several AD pathologies. This selective targeting strategy delivers specific agents to microglia without the adverse off-target effects on other cell types. Additionally, this approach can be used to deliver other molecules to microglia and other immune cells in other organs.
