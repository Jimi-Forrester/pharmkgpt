32843100|a|Transition metals, such as iron, copper, and zinc, play a very important role in life as the regulators of various physiochemical reactions in cells. Abnormal distribution and concentration of these metals in the body are closely associated with various diseases including ischemic seizure, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and cancer. Iron and copper are known to be mainly involved in in vivo redox reaction. Zinc controls a variety of intracellular metabolism via binding to lots of proteins in cells and altering their structure and function. Metallothionein-3 (MT3) is a representative zinc binding protein predominant in the brain. Although the role of MT3 in other organs still needs to be elucidated, many reports have suggested critical roles for the protein in the control of a variety of cellular homeostasis. Here, we review various biological functions of MT3, focusing on different cellular molecules and diseases involving MT3 in the body.
