34638812|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry important biomolecules, including metabolites, and contribute to the spread and pathogenesis of some viruses. However, to date, limited data are available on EV metabolite content that might play a crucial role during infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, this study aimed to perform untargeted metabolomics to identify key metabolites and associated pathways that are present in EVs, isolated from the serum of COVID-19 patients. The results showed the presence of antivirals and antibiotics such as Foscarnet, Indinavir, and lymecycline in EVs from patients treated with these drugs. Moreover, increased levels of anti-inflammatory metabolites such as LysoPS, 7-alpha,25-Dihydroxycholesterol, and 15-d-PGJ2 were detected in EVs from COVID-19 patients when compared with controls. Further, we found decreased levels of metabolites associated with coagulation, such as thromboxane and elaidic acid, in EVs from COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that EVs not only carry active drug molecules but also anti-inflammatory metabolites, clearly suggesting that exosomes might play a crucial role in negotiating with heightened inflammation during COVID-19 infection. These preliminary results could also pave the way for the identification of novel metabolites that might act as critical regulators of inflammatory pathways during viral infections.
