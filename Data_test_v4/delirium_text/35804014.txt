35804014|a|Heart failure (HF) is a global pandemic which affects about 26 million people. PFKM (Phosphofructokinase, Muscle), catalyzing the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, plays a very important role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of PFKM in glycolysis and HF remains to be elucidated. H9c2 rat cardiomyocyte cells were treated with doxorubicin (DOX) to establish injury models, and the cell viability, apoptosis and glycolysis were measured. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting were used for gene expression. DOX treatment significantly inhibited PFKM expression in H9c2 cells. Overexpression of PFKM inhibited DOX-induced cell apoptosis and DOX-decreased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), while silencing PFKM promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited glycolysis and OXPHOS in H9c2 cells. Moreover, PFKM regulated DOX-mediated cell viability and apoptosis through glycolysis pathway. Mechanism study showed that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) inhibited H3K27ac-induced transcription of PFKM in DOX-treated cells and regulated glycolysis. PFKM could inhibit DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by enhancing OXPHOS and glycolysis, which might benefit us in developing novel therapeutics for prevention or treatment of HF.
