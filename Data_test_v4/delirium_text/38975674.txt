38975674|t|Emergence Electroencephalography in an Unresponsiveness Geriatric Patient in the Postanesthesia Care Unit: A Case Report.
38975674|a|Incomplete neurological awakening manifested as aberrant patterns of electroencephalography (EEG) at emergence may be responsible for an unresponsive patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). We describe a case of an individual who remained unresponsive but awake in the PACU. Retrospective, intraoperative EEG analysis showed low alpha power and a sudden shift from deep delta to arousal preextubation. We explored parallels with diminished motivation disorders and anesthesia-induced sleep paralysis due to imbalances in anesthetic drug sensitivity between brain regions. Our findings highlight the relevance of end-anesthesia EEG patterns in diagnosing delayed awakening.
