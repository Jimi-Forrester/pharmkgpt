21103401|a|Dementia has become a common diagnosis in aging populations, and the numbers will increase in the forthcoming years. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, accounting for 50%-56% of cases at autopsy and in clinical series. Nowadays, the number of people affected by AD is rapidly increasing, and more than 35 million people worldwide have AD, a condition characterized by deterioration of memory and other cognitive domains, and leading to death 3-9 years after diagnosis. The number of patients with AD, the most common cause of disability in the elderly, is set to rise dramatically. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms of dementia and to note potentially modifiable risk factors and early disease markers.
