39964627|t|Clinical implication of anemia in older patients with dementia with lewy bodies.
39964627|a|AIM: This research sought to investigate the possible connection between anemia and various parameters of comprehensive geriatric assessment in elderly individuals diagnosed with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). To our knowledge, this investigation represents the first attempt to examine how anemia impacts patients suffering from DLB. METHODS: This cross-sectional study encompassed 147 DLB patients from a single geriatric outpatient clinic. The study defined anemia as hemoglobin levels under 12 g/dL for women and 13 g/dL for men. Patients' demographic information, coexisting medical conditions, and results from comprehensive geriatric evaluations were also recorded. RESULTS: Participants in the study had an average age of 85.4 +- 7.1 years. Anemia was present in 46.9% of the patients. Significant disparities were noted between individuals with and without anemia regarding the occurrence of congestive heart failure (CHF), polypharmacy, geriatric depression, and insomnia (all p < 0.05). After controlling for age, gender, and CHF in the multivariate analysis, the association between anemia and both the quantity of medications used [OR: 1.15 (95% CI:1.01-1,31)] and Geriatric Depression Scale-15 scores [OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78-0.98] remained statistically significant (p < 0.05) when comparing anemic patients to non-anemic individuals. CONCLUSION: In the present study almost one in two older patients with DLB were anemic. Anemia is associated with presence of CHF, higher number of drugs and depressive mood in DLB. It is recommended that healthcare providers should recognize the importance of anemia and its associated effects when treating older adults with DLB. This approach may lead to more effective management and treatment of this complex condition.
