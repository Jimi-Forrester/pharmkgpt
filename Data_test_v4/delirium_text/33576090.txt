33576090|t|Thiamine deficiency unrelated to alcohol consumption in high-income countries: a literature review.
33576090|a|Thiamine deficiency has been typically associated with alcoholism or as a prevalent problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) whose populations rely on staple foods with a low content of thiamine. We conducted a literature review of published and unpublished data to identify relevant adult cases with confirmed thiamine deficiency of nonalcoholic cause in developed countries. We selected 17 reports with 81 adult cases of confirmed thiamine deficiency affecting adult patients with a wide range of ages and underlying conditions (e.g., cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, heart failure, and obesity). Thiamine deficiency may have been caused by disease-related malnutrition, bariatric surgery, chronic use of diuretics, repeated vomiting, lack of thiamine in parenteral nutrition formulas, food insecurity, and reliance on monotonous or restrictive diets. Treatment with intravenous thiamine resulted in partial or complete recovery from the symptoms (cardiac, neurologic, and metabolic disorders) for most patients. The number and variety of symptomatic thiamine-deficient adults identified in this review demonstrates that thiamine deficiency is not exclusive to LMICs and, in high-income settings, is not exclusive to alcoholic patients. In developed countries, this serious but treatable condition can be expected in patients suffering from various medical conditions or following certain dietary patterns.
