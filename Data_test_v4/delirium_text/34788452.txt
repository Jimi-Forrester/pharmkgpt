34788452|a|Although the health effects of exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation have been the focus of many studies, the affected biological functions and underlying regulatory mechanisms are not well-understood. In particular, the influence of radiation exposure at doses of less than 200 mGy on the regulation of genes and pathways remains unclear. To investigate the molecular alterations induced by varying doses of low-dose radiation (LDR), transcriptomic analysis was conducted based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing following exposure to 50 and 150 mGy doses. Human peripheral blood was collected, and the samples were divided into three groups, including two treatments and one control (no radiation). A total of 876 (318 upregulated and 558 downregulated) and 486 (202 upregulated and 284 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after exposure to 50 mGy and 150 mGy, respectively. Most upregulated genes in both the 50 mGy and 150 mGy groups were associated with 'antigen processing and presentation,' which appeared to be the major targets affected by LDR exposure. Several interacting genes, including HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB5 were mapped to 'antigen processing and presentation,' 'immune system-related diseases' and the 'cytokine-mediated signaling pathway,' suggesting that these genes might drive the downstream transmission of these signal transduction pathways. Our results suggest that exposure to LDR may elicit changes in key genes and associated pathways, probably helping further explore the biological processes and molecular mechanism responsible for low-dose occupational or environmental exposures in humans.
