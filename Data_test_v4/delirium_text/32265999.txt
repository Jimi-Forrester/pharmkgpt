32265999|a|BACKGROUND: Tardive dystonia associated with antidepressant use is rare and often under-recognized. We had an experience with trazodone, which is used for delirium and insomnia prescribed in general hospital, inducing tardive dystonia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman had been treated for schizophrenia. She was moved to general hospital because of consciousness disturbance. She was prescribed trazodone (25 mg/day) for delirium and insomnia. After she was discharged, she returned to the psychiatric hospital with tardive dystonia. Her dystonia symptoms improved with 3 days of discontinuing trazodone. CONCLUSION: In the present case, long-term use of trazodone induced tardive dystonia. Discontinuing trazodone rapidly improved tardive dystonia.
