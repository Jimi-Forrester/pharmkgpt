32886926|t|Mannitol Is Associated with Less Postoperative Delirium after Aortic Valve Surgery in Patients Treated with Bretschneider Cardioplegia.
32886926|a|BACKGROUND: Heart surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) often leads to postoperative delirium (POD). This is associated with increased morbidity resulting in longer hospital stay and associated costs. The purpose of our study was to analyze the effect of intraoperative mannitol application on POD in patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement (AVR). MATERIALS AND METHOD: s In our retrospective single-center study, 259 patients underwent elective AVR, using Bretschneider cardioplegic solution for cardiac arrest, between 2014 and 2017. Patients were divided in mannitol (n = 188) and nonmannitol (n = 71) groups. POD was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (ICU). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. Incidence of POD was significantly higher in the nonmannitol group (33.8 vs. 13.8%; p = 0.001). These patients required longer ventilation time (24.1 vs. 17.1 hours; p = 0.021), higher reintubation rate (11.3 vs. 2.7%; p = 0.009), ICU readmission (12.7 vs. 4.8%; p = 0.026), prolonged ICU (112 vs. 70 hours; p = 0.040), and hospital stay (17.8 vs. 12.6 days; p < 0.001), leading to higher expenses (19,349 $ vs. 16,606 $, p < 0.001). A 30-day mortality was not affected, but nonmannitol group showed higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score (32.2 vs. 28.7; p < 0.001). Mannitol substitution was independently associated with lower incidence of POD (odds ratio: 0.40; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.89; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Treatment with mannitol during ECC was associated with decreased incidence of POD. This was accompanied by shorter ventilation time, ICU and hospital stay, and lower treatment expenses.
