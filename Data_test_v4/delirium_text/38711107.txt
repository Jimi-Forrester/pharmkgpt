38711107|t|Association between retinal microvascular abnormalities and late-life brain amyloid-beta deposition: the ARIC-PET study.
38711107|a|BACKGROUND: Retinal microvascular signs are accessible measures of early alterations in microvascular dysregulation and have been associated with dementia; it is unclear if they are associated with AD (Alzheimer's disease) pathogenesis as a potential mechanistic link. This study aimed to test the association of retinal microvascular abnormalities in mid and late life and late life cerebral amyloid. METHODS: Participants from the ARIC-PET (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Positron Emission Tomography) study with a valid retinal measure (N = 285) were included. The associations of mid- and late-life retinal signs with late-life amyloid-beta (Abeta) by florbetapir PET were tested. Two different measures of Abeta burden were included: (1) elevated amyloid (SUVR > 1.2) and (2) continuous amyloid SUVR. The retinal measures' association with Abeta burden was assessed using logistic and robust linear regression models. A newly created retinal score, incorporating multiple markers of retinal abnormalities, was also evaluated in association with greater Abeta burden. RESULTS: Retinopathy in midlife (OR (95% CI) = 0.36 (0.08, 1.40)) was not significantly associated with elevated amyloid burden. In late life, retinopathy was associated with increased continuous amyloid standardized value uptake ratio (SUVR) (beta (95%CI) = 0.16 (0.02, 0.32)) but not elevated amyloid burden (OR (95%CI) = 2.37 (0.66, 9.88)) when accounting for demographic, genetic and clinical risk factors. A high retinal score in late life, indicating a higher burden of retinal abnormalities, was also significantly associated with increased continuous amyloid SUVR (beta (95% CI) = 0.16 (0.04, 0.32)) independent of vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Retinopathy in late life may be an easily obtainable marker to help evaluate the mechanistic vascular pathway between retinal measures and dementia, perhaps acting via AD pathogenesis. Well-powered future studies with a greater number of retinal features and other microvascular signs are needed to test these findings.
