24621910|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression and Alzheimer-type dementia in the elderly will increase, they may have similar symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish between these two conditions, and both conditions may occur simultaneously in one and the same patient. This article provides an overview of symptoms and findings that may be important for distinguishing depression from Alzheimer-type dementia. METHOD: The article is based on a structured search in PubMed of a discretionary selection of studies, as well as the authors' own clinical experience. RESULTS: Depression and Alzheimer-type dementia may share a number of cognitive and affective symptoms, such as amnesia, attention deficit, impaired emotional reactions and a general lack of initiative. Mapping disease progression and daily functioning, information from next of kin, neuropsychological tests, biomarkers and diagnostic imaging of the brain may be helpful in differentiating the diagnoses. INTERPRETATION: Depression and Alzheimer-type dementia in elderly patients can be established by a GP, preferably including an assessment of disease progression, daily functioning, information-gathering from next of kin and cognitive screening. If the GP's examination fails to provide unambiguous answers, or if a young patient is involved, he or she should be referred to the specialist health services.
