37427840|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are common in neurodegenerative diseases; however, little is known about the prevalence of NPSs in Hispanic populations. METHODS: Using data from community-dwelling participants age 65 years and older enrolled in the 10/66 study (N = 11,768), we aimed to estimate the prevalence of NPSs in Hispanic populations with dementia, parkinsonism, and parkinsonism-dementia (PDD) relative to healthy aging. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to assess NPSs. RESULTS: NPSs were highly prevalent in Hispanic populations with neurodegenerative disease; approximately 34.3%, 56.1%, and 61.2% of the participants with parkinsonism, dementia, and PDD exhibited three or more NPSs, respectively. NPSs were the major contributor to caregiver burden. DISCUSSION: Clinicians involved in the care of elderly populations should proactively screen for NPSs, especially in patients with parkinsonism, dementia, and PPD, and develop intervention plans to support families and caregivers. HIGHLIGHTS Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are highly prevalent in Hispanic populations with neurodegenerative diseases. In healthy Hispanic populations, NPSs are predominantly mild and not clinically significant. The most common NPSs include depression, sleep disorders, irritability, and agitation. NPSs explain a substantial proportion of the variance in global caregiver burden.
