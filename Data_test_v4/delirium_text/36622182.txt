36622182|a|Enterococci can cause various infectious diseases, including urinary tract infection, wound infection, and life-threatening endocarditis and meningitis. The emergence and transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have presented a challenge to clinical treatment. There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to fight against this pathogen. This study investigated the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of celastrol (CEL), a natural product originating from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, against enterococci, and its adjuvant capacity of restoring the susceptibility of VRE to vancomycin in vitro and in vivo. CEL inhibited all enterococcus strains tested, with MICs ranging from 0.5 to 4 mug/mL. More than 50% of biofilm was eliminated by CEL at 16 mug/mL after 24 h of exposure. The combination of CEL and vancomycin showed a synergistic effect against all 23 strains tested in checkerboard assays. The combination of sub-MIC levels of CEL and vancomycin showed a synergistic effect in a time-kill assay and exhibited significant protective efficacy in Galleria mellonella larval infection model compared with either drug used alone. The underlying mechanisms of CEL were explored by conducting biomolecular binding interactions and an enzyme inhibition assay of CEL on bacterial cell-division protein FtsZ. CEL presented strong binding and suppression ability to FtsZ, with Kd and IC50 values of 2.454 muM and 1.04 +- 0.17 mug/mL, respectively. CEL exhibits a significant antibacterial and synergic activity against VRE in vitro and in vivo and has the potential to be a new antibacterial agent or adjuvant to vancomycin as a therapeutic option in combating VRE. IMPORTANCE The emergence and transmission of VRE pose a significant medical and public health challenge. CEL, well-known for a wide range of biological activities, has not previously been investigated for its synergistic effect with vancomycin against VRE. In the present study, CEL exhibited antibacterial activity against enterococci, including VRE strains, and restored the activity of vancomycin against VRE in vitro and in vivo. Hence, CEL has the potential to be a new antibacterial adjuvant to vancomycin and could provide a promising therapeutic option in combating VRE.
