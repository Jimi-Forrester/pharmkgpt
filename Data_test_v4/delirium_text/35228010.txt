35228010|a|This research allowed us to find the first highly potent 5-HT6/5-HT2A receptor (5-HT6/5-HT2AR) dual antagonists in a group of 1,3,5-triazine compounds as a result of an exit beyond the hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore model for 5-HT6R antagonists. Design and synthesis of the series (2-16) of new O- and S-containing ether derivatives of 1,3,5-triazines with the double-ring aromatic region have been performed. The new compounds were examined within the comprehensive pharmacological screening, including: radioligand binding assays, functional and ADMET studies in vitro as well as behavioral tests in rats. Crystallographic aspects and computer-aided structure-activity relationship were analyzed, as well. The comprehensive approach led to selection of compound 12 (4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6-(2-(naphthalen-2-ylthio)propan-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine) with the most significant dual 5-HT6/5-HT2AR antagonistic action (5-HT6R Ki = 11 nM, 5-HT2AR Ki = 39 nM). Moreover, the compound 12 has satisfactory ADMETox properties in vitro, i.e.: the high permeability through biological membranes, high metabolic stability, neither mutagenic nor hepatotoxic effects, and moderate ability to inhibit CYP3A4. Above all, 12 showed ability to reverse the pharmacologically-induced (MK-801) memory impairment at low doses (1-3 mg/kg) in Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test in rats. Our results indicate a promising potency of dual 5-HT6/5-HT2AR antagonism in the search for novel strategy to fight Alzheimer's disease, which remains an unmet clinical need.
