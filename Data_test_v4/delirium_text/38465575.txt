38465575|t|Associations of ADH1B and ALDH2 genotypes and alcohol flushing with drinking history, withdrawal symptoms, and ICD-10 criteria in Japanese alcohol-dependent men.
38465575|a|OBJECTIVES: Given the high prevalence of fast-metabolizing alcohol dehydrogenase-1B*2 (ADH1B*2) and inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase-2*2 (ALDH2*2) alleles in East Asians, we evaluated how the ADH1B/ALDH2 genotypes and alcohol flushing might affect the development of alcohol dependence (AD). METHODS: We evaluated how the ADH1B/ALDH2 genotypes and self-reported alcohol flushing affected history of drinking events and withdrawal symptoms and ICD-10 criteria in 4116 Japanese AD men. RESULTS: The ADH1B*1/*1 group and ALDH2*1/*1 group were 1-5 years younger than the ADH1B*2(+) and ALDH2*1/*2 groups, respectively, for all of the ages at onset of habitual drinking, blackouts, daytime drinking, uncontrolled drinking, withdrawal symptoms, and first treatment for AD, and the current age. Blackouts were more common in the ADH1B*1/*1 group and ALDH2*1/*1 group. Daytime drinking, uncontrolled drinking, and withdrawal symptoms, such as hand tremor, sweating, convulsions, and delirium tremens/hallucinations were more common in the ADH1B*1/*1 group. The ADH1B*1/*1 was positively associated with the ICD-10 criteria for 'tolerance' and 'withdrawal symptoms'. The ADH1B*1/*1 group and ALDH2*1/*2 group had a larger ICD-10 score. Never flushing was reported by 91.7% and 35.2% of the ALDH2*1/*1 and ALDH2*1/*2 carriers, respectively. After a 1-2-year delay in the onset of habitual drinking in the former-/current-flushing group, no differences in the ages of the aforementioned drinking milestones were found according to the flushing status. CONCLUSION: The ADH1B*1/*1 and ALDH2*1/*1 accelerated the development of drinking events and withdrawal symptoms in Japanese AD patients. ICD-10 score was larger in the ADH1B*1/*1 group and ALDH2*1/*2 group. The effects of alcohol flushing on drinking events were limited.
