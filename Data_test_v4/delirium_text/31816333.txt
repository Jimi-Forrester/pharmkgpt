31816333|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease mainly associated with cognition impairment. Studies in last more than six decades have suggested that the disease pathology primarily includes the depleted cholinergic neurons, accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and hyper phosphorylation of tau proteins. However, the disease etiology remains enigmatic and no therapy is available to modify the disease status. Studies in experimental models and in post mortem brain of AD patients have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, unfolded protein responses and apoptosis in disease pathology, yet the information is deficit to develop the disease modifying therapeutics. Owing to the need of novel effective treatment, chronic consumption of medicines with minimum side effects, recently the researchers turned towards the traditional medicines. This review is mainly focusing on the traditional herbs which have been suggested to contain disease related antidote activities and may be utilized for the effective treatment of AD patients.
