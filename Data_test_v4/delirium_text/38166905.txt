38166905|t|Short-term outcomes after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery in patients over 90 years old: a Japanese multicenter study.
38166905|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of laparoscopic surgery on short-term outcomes in colorectal cancer patients over 90 years old has remained unclear. METHODS: We reviewed 87 colorectal cancer patients aged over 90 years who underwent surgery between 2016 and 2022. Patients were divided into an open surgery group (n = 22) and a laparoscopic surgery group (n = 65). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of laparoscopic surgery on postoperative outcome in elderly colorectal cancer patients, as compared to open surgery. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (89.7%) had comorbidities. Frequency of advanced T stage was lower with laparoscopic surgery (p = 0.021). Operation time was longer (open surgery 146 min vs. laparoscopic surgery 203 min; p = 0.002) and blood loss was less (105 mL vs. 20 mL, respectively; p < 0.001) with laparoscopic surgery. Length of hospitalization was longer with open surgery (22 days vs. 18 days, respectively; p = 0.007). Frequency of infectious complications was lower with laparoscopic surgery (18.5%) than with open surgery (45.5%; p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis revealed open surgery (p = 0.026; odds ratio, 3.535; 95% confidence interval, 1.159-10.781) as an independent predictor of postoperative infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal resection for patients over 90 years old is a useful procedure that reduces postoperative infectious complications.
