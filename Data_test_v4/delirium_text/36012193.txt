36012193|a|Despite the fact that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, after many years of research regarding this disease, there is no casual treatment. Regardless of the serious public health threat it poses, only five medical treatments for Alzheimer's disease have been authorized, and they only control symptoms rather than changing the course of the disease. Numerous clinical trials of single-agent therapy did not slow the development of disease or improve symptoms when compared to placebo. Evidence indicates that the pathological alterations linked to AD start many years earlier than a manifestation of the disease. In this pre-clinical period before the neurodegenerative process is established, pharmaceutical therapy might prove invaluable. Although recent findings from the testing of drugs such as aducanumab are encouraging, they should nevertheless be interpreted cautiously. Such medications may be able to delay the onset of dementia, significantly lowering the prevalence of the disease, but are still a long way from having a clinically effective disease-modifying therapy.
