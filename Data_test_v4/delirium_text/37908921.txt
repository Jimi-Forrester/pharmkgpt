37908921|t|Optimizing Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy for the Geriatric Population: A Practical Case Study and Comprehensive Literature Review.
37908921|a|Elderly patients represent a large cohort of patients requiring gynaecological surgery for benign and malignant indications. In recent years, several conventional gynaecological procedures have shifted towards minimally invasive alternatives such as laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, and robotic surgery. A recent Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) analysis compared the outcomes of 25,000 women undergoing laparotomy versus laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy and found that laparoscopy is associated with a shorter duration of hospitalization (three days versus five days), less postoperative complications (76%), less requirement for blood transfusion, reduced operational costs, faster recovery, and an overall safer surgical experience. Although geriatric patients are affected by age-related comorbidities, physiologic changes, and altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of administered drugs, these patients benefit most from minimally invasive surgery. In this paper, we present a comprehensive account of the interdisciplinary perioperative approaches employed to accomplish a total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymph node dissection in an 82-year-old patient who was diagnosed with grade I endometrial adenocarcinoma and multiple age-related medical comorbidities.
