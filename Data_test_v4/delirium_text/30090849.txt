30090849|t|Case-finding in clinical practice: An appropriate strategy for dementia identification?
30090849|a|Earlier diagnosis of dementia is increasingly being recognized as a public health priority. As screening is not generally recommended, case-finding in clinical practice is encouraged as an alternative dementia identification strategy. The approaches of screening and case-finding are often confused, with uncertainty about what case-finding should involve and under what circumstances it is appropriate. We propose a formal definition of dementia case-finding with a clear distinction from screening. We critically examine case-finding policy and practice and propose evidence requirements for implementation in clinical practice. Finally, we present a case-finding pathway and discuss the available evidence for best practice at each stage, with recommendations for research and practice. In conclusion, dementia case-finding is a promising strategy but currently not appropriate due to the substantial gaps in the evidence base for several components of this approach.
