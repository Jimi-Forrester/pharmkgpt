38586749|a|Remimazolam is an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine that has minimal hemodynamic effects and is useful for early extubation after cardiac surgery. We present a case of an elderly patient with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR), was extubated in the operating room, and recovered quickly without postoperative delirium. An 87-year-old woman with severe AS underwent AVR under cardiopulmonary bypass. General anesthesia was induced with remimazolam 10 mg over one minute and fentanyl 100 microg, and maintained with remimazolam 0.4-0.7 mg/kg/hour, fentanyl, and remifentanil. Intraoperative hemodynamic condition was stable without vasopressors. Remimazolam was discontinued after sternum closure. She recovered consciousness five minutes after the completion of the surgery, and the tracheal tube was removed in the operating room. Remimazolam may be useful for fast-track recovery following surgical AVR in an elderly patient with severe AS.
