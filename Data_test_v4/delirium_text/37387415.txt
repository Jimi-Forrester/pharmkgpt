37387415|a|Tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) remains one of the most challenging barriers to successful cancer treatment. Several previous studies have suggested that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) may be a promising therapeutic target for overcoming cancer drug resistance. Emerging evidence has indicated that HMGB1 functions as a 'double-edged sword' that plays both pro- and anti-tumor roles in the development and progression of multiple types of cancer. HMGB1 has also been found to be a key regulator of several cell death and signaling pathways, and is involved in MDR by mediating cell autophagy and apoptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis and multiple signaling pathways. Additionally, HMGB1 is regulated by a variety of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs, long ncRNAs and circular RNAs that are involved in MDR. Thus far, studies have been conducted to identify strategies with which to overcome HMGB1-mediated MDR by the targeted silencing of HMGB1 and the targeted interference of HMGB1 expression using drugs and ncRNAs. Therefore, HMGB1 is closely associated with tumor MDR and is a promising therapeutic target.
