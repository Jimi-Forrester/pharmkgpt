19219709|t|The virtual gateway: opening doors in delirium teaching and learning.
19219709|a|Delirium is a common, serious and potentially preventable problem. It is argued here that knowledge and skills for effective assessment and treatment of delirium cannot be considered 'specialist'. Rather, delirium is a problem that requires a healthcare team approach to assessing patients, identifying risks or symptoms and reducing precipitating factors. Research from the preceding decade suggests that the clinical reality is falling short of this ideal with the result that many cases of delirium go undetected and many precipitating factors are not reduced where this is indeed possible. This presents a challenge for the education of nursing and medical students and for the development of qualified staff in practice. The current paper outlines an educational approach, e-learning, which increases access for learners, integrates knowledge and skill development and promotes active, problem-based learning.
