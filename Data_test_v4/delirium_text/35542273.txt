35542273|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, neuronal loss and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, neuroinflammatory processes are thought to contribute to AD pathophysiology. Maitake (Grifola frondosa), an edible/medicinal mushroom, exhibits high nutritional value and contains a great amount of health-beneficial, bioactive compounds. It has been reported that proteo-beta-glucan, a polysaccharide derived from Maitake (PGM), possesses strong immunomodulatory activities. However, whether PGM is responsible for the immunomodulatory and neuroprotection effects on APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice, a widely used animal model of AD, remains unclear. In the present study, the results demonstrated that PGM could improve learning and memory impairment, attenuate neuron loss and histopathological abnormalities in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, PGM treatment could activate microglia and astrocytes and promote microglial recruitment to the Abeta plaques. Also, PGM could enhance Abeta phagocytosis, and thereby alleviate Abeta burden and the pathological changes in the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, PGM showed no significant effect on mice body weight. In conclusion, these findings indicated that administration of PGM could improve memory impairment via immunomodulatory action, and dietary supplementation with PGM may provide potential benefits on brain aging related memory dysfunction.
