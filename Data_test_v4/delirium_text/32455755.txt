32455755|t|In Vitro Evaluation of Iron-Induced Salivary Lipid Oxidation Associated with Exposure to Iron Nanoparticles: Application Possibilities and Limitations for Food and Exposure Sciences.
32455755|a|Zerovalent iron nanotechnologies are widely used for groundwater remediation and increasingly considered for advance oxidation treatment in drinking water applications. Iron nanoparticles have been detected in drinking water systems and considered for food fortification; therefore, the potential for human exposure through ingestion can be a concern. This study aimed to assess whether ingestion of iron nanoparticles from drinking water could be detected through flavor perception using in vitro salivary lipid oxidation as an indicator for metallic flavor perception. Ten female subjects, aged 29-59 years, donated saliva samples for use in the in vitro experiments. Test samples consisted of 1:1 mixture of saliva and bottled drinking water (control) and three treatment solutions, spiked with ferrous sulfate, stabilized zerovalent iron nanoparticles (nZVI), and an aggregated/microsized suspension of mixed zerovalent iron and microsized suspension of iron and iron oxide metal powder, (mZVI). Upon mixing, samples were subjected to 15 min incubation at 37  C to resemble oral conditions. Salivary lipid oxidation (SLO) was measured in all samples as micromoles of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)/mg Fe. Exposure to iron in all three forms induced significant amount of SLO in all treatment samples as compared to the control (p < 0.0001). The mean SLO levels were the highest in the ferrous treatment, followed by nZVI and mZVI treatments; the differences in the mean SLO levels were significant (p < 0.05). The findings indicate that oral exposure to stabilized ZVI nanoparticles may induce sensory properties different from that of ferrous salt, likely predictive of diminished detection of metallic flavor by humans.
