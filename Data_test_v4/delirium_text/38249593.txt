38249593|a|Increasing evidence links the gut microbiome and the nervous system in health and disease. This narrative review discusses current views on the interaction between the gut microbiota, the intestinal epithelium, and the brain, and provides an overview of the communication routes and signals of the bidirectional interactions between gut microbiota and the brain, including circulatory, immunological, neuroanatomical, and neuroendocrine pathways. Similarities and differences in healthy gut microbiota in humans and mice exist that are relevant for the translational gap between non-human model systems and patients. There is an increasing spectrum of metabolites and neurotransmitters that are released and/or modulated by the gut microbiota in both homeostatic and pathological conditions. Dysbiotic disruptions occur as consequences of critical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease but also neurological, mental, and pain disorders, as well as ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Changes in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) and a concomitant imbalance in the release of mediators may be cause or consequence of diseases of the central nervous system and are increasingly emerging as critical links to the disruption of healthy physiological function, alterations in nutrition intake, exposure to hypoxic conditions and others, observed in brain disorders. Despite the generally accepted importance of the gut microbiome, the bidirectional communication routes between brain and gut are not fully understood. Elucidating these routes and signaling pathways in more detail offers novel mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology and multifaceted aspects of brain disorders.
