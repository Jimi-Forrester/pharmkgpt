35956055|t|Thyroid Hormones and Health-Related Quality of Life in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Patients before and after the Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery: A Longitudinal Study.
35956055|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3), and to correlate the hormone levels among iNPH patients with their self-reported quality of life before and three months after the surgery. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (52% women), mean age 63.5 (SD 9.5) years, were operated on by inserting a VP shunt. Patients with FT3 level <=3.34 pmol/L were diagnosed as having low T3 syndrome. RESULTS: The changes in thyroid hormones resulted in a U-shaped curve throughout the follow-up period. The significant changes occurred the next day after the surgery, including a decrease in TSH, FT3, and an increase in FT4. Additionally, the decrease occurred in mean FT3 for six patients with preoperative low T3 syndrome. Three months after the surgery, thyroid hormones were restored to their baseline and/or normal values. All six patients with preoperative low T3 syndrome had significant improvement in all SF-36 subscales (except for the role emotional and physical). Patients with preoperative normal high FT3 and low FT4 had increased FT3/FT4 ratio which was associated with deterioration in all SF-36 subscales 3 months after the surgery. CONCLUSION: Routine assessment of the FT3/FT4 ratio might be a simple and effective tool for the risk stratification of iNPH patients before VP shunt surgery.
