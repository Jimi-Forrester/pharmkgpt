37601381|a|Escherichia coli (E. coli) mutant strains have been reported to extend the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). However, the specific mechanisms through which the genes and pathways affect aging are not yet clear. In this study, we fed Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) various E. coli single-gene knockout strains to screen mutant strains with an extended lifespan. The results showed that D. melanogaster fed with E. coli purE had the longest mean lifespan, which was verified by C. elegans. We conducted RNA-sequencing and analysis of C. elegans fed with E. coli purE (a single-gene knockout mutant) to further explore the underlying molecular mechanism. We used differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, enrichment analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to screen vital genes and modules with significant changes in overall expression. Our results suggest that E. coli mutant strains may affect the host lifespan by regulating the protein synthesis rate (cfz-2) and ATP level (catp-4). To conclude, our study could provide new insights into the genetic influences of the microbiota on the life span of a host and a basis for developing anti-aging probiotics and drugs.
