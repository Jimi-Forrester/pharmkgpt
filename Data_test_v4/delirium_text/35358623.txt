35358623|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Petiveria alliacea L. is traditionally used as a folk medical herb in different regions of the world to treat different ailments including those related to the central nervous system. Previous studies have proved that extracts from P. alliacea show improvement in memory and learning process. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study extracts, fractions, subfractions and isolated compounds from P. alliacea on acetylcholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Extracts obtained with different polarity solvents and fractions from P. alliacea were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase by Ellman method. This screening allowed the selection of the methanol fraction as the most active and continued a bio-guided study. The compounds identified in methanol fraction were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Identification of (E)-Tagetone was performed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Moreover, the antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH and ABTS methods, and the cell viability was assessed by WST-1 method. RESULTS: Two extracts of different polarity were obtained from P. alliacea. The methanol extract and its fraction showed an inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase; however, methanol fraction was found to be most potent with 86.5 % AChE inhibition. The methanol fraction also showed antioxidant activity and was not toxic on SH-SY5Y cells. Different compounds including capreoside, narcissin, indane, (-)-isocaryophyllene, (-)-beta-pinene, (E)-tagetone and peonidin 3-O-sambubioside 5-O-glucoside were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first report indicating that P. alliacea methanol fraction and its subfractions bear acetylcholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity properties. This work establishes the basis for further studies in the development of new therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease.
