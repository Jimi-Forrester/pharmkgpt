21524590|a|Abnormal beta-amyloid peptide accumulation and aggregation is considered to be responsible for the formation and cerebral deposition of senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of the formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils would be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. Resveratrol and its derivatives exhibit a broad range of pharmacological properties such as protection against cardiovascular diseases and cancers, as well as promoting antiaging effects. We reported previously that epsilon-viniferin glucoside (VG), a resveratrol-derived dimer, strongly inhibits Abeta (25-35) fibril formation in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of VG on the aggregation of the full-length peptides (Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42)) and on the beta-amyloid-induced toxicity in PC12 cells. VG inhibited Abeta cytotoxicity and the non-covalent complex between VG and Abeta was observed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
