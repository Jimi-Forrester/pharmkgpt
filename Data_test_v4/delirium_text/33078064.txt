33078064|t|Technological evolution of cyclodextrins in the pharmaceutical field.
33078064|a|We herein disclose how global cyclodextrin-based pharmaceutical technologies have evolved since the early 80s through a 1998 patents dataset retrieved from Derwent Innovation Index. We used text-mining techniques based on the patents semantic content to extract the knowledge contained therein, to analyze technologies related to the principal attributes of CDs: solubility, stability, and taste-masking enhancement. The majority of CDs pharmaceutical technologies are directed toward parenteral aqueous solutions. The development of oral and ocular formulations is rapidly growing, while technologies for nasal and pulmonary routes are emerging and seem to be promising. Formulations for topical, transdermal, vaginal, and rectal routes do not account for a high number of patents, but they may be hiding a great potential, representing opportunity research areas. Certainly, the progress in materials sciences, supramolecular chemistry, and nanotechnology, will influence the trend of that, apparently neglected, research. The bottom line, CDs pharmaceutical technologies are still increasing, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. Patent monitoring allows the identification of relevant technologies and trends to prioritize research, development, and investment in both, academia and industry. We expect the scope of this approach to be applied in the pharmaceutical field beyond CDs technological applications.
