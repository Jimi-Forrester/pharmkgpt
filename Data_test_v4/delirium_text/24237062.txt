24237062|a|The immune system evolved to launch effective and specific responses against pathogens. A key feature of this defense mechanism is its ability to differentiate between self and nonself. However, in autoimmune diseases, the host's immune system fails to discriminate self versus foreign. The CNS is further protected by the blood-brain barrier. In spite of its 'immune privilege,' the brain is not protected from autoimmunity; perhaps paradoxically xenoantibodies can be used to treat neurological diseases. We describe patents covering treatment methods for CNS diseases with suspected or demonstrated autoimmune etiology. These include multiple sclerosis and, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The goal is to less invasively, yet efficiently, treat neurological diseases. Although autoimmune responses are often detrimental, recent studies have begun to harness, boost and induce immune responses as a mechanism of treatment. The patents discussed herein highlight new treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and seizure disorders.
