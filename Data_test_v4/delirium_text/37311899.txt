37311899|t|Frailty: the perioperative and anesthesia challenges of an emerging pandemic.
37311899|a|Frailty is a complex and multisystem biological process characterized by reductions in physiological reserve. It is an increasingly common phenomena in the surgical population, and significantly impacts postoperative recovery. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of frailty, as well as preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations for frailty care. We will also discuss the different models of postoperative care, including enhanced recovery pathways, as well as elective critical care admission. With discoveries of new effective interventions, and advances in healthcare information technology, optimized pathways could be developed to provide the best care possible that meets the challenges of perioperative frailty.
