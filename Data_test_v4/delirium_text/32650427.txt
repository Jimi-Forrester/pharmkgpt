32650427|t|Dysautonomia in Alzheimer's Disease.
32650427|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and its prevalence increases with age. Although there is a large amount of scientific literature focusing on Alzheimer's disease cardinal cognitive features, autonomic nervous system dysfunction remains understudied despite being common in the elderly. In this article, we reviewed the evidence for autonomic nervous system involvement in Alzheimer's disease. We identified four major potential causes for dysautonomia in Alzheimer's disease, out of which two are well-studied (comorbidities and medication) and two are rather hypothetical (Alzheimer's pathology and brain co-pathology). Although there appears to be some evidence linking Alzheimer's disease pathology to autonomic nervous system dysfunction, there is an important gap between two types of studies; histopathologic studies do not address dysautonomia manifestations, whereas clinical studies do not employ histopathologic diagnostic confirmation. Moreover, brain co-pathology is emerging as an important confounding factor. Therefore, we consider the correlation between dysautonomia and Alzheimer's disease to be an open question that needs further study. Nevertheless, given its impact on morbidity and mortality, we emphasize the importance of assessing autonomic dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer clinical syndrome.
