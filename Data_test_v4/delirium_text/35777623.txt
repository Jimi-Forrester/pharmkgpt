35777623|a|Senile plaques that is characterized as an amyloid deposition found in Alzheimer's disease are composed primarily of fibrils of an aggregated peptide, amyloid beta (Abeta). The ability to monitor senile plaque formation on a neuronal membrane under physiological conditions provides an attractive model. In this study, the growth behavior of amyloid Abeta fibrils in the presence of liposomes incorporating beta-cholesteryl-D-glucose (beta-CG) was examined using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, transmittance electron microscopy, and other spectroscopic methods. We found that beta-CG on the liposome membrane induced the spontaneous formation of spherulitic Abeta fibrillar aggregates. The beta-CG cluster formed on liposome membranes appeared to induce the accumulation of Abeta, followed by the growth of the spherulitic Abeta aggregates. In contrast, DMPC and DMPC incorporated cholesterol-induced fibrils that are laterally associated with each other. A comparison study using three types of liposomes implied that the induction of glucose contributed to the agglomeration of Abeta fibrils and liposomes. This agglomeration required the spontaneous formation of spherulitic Abeta fibrillary aggregates. This action can be regarded as a counterbalance to the growth of fibrils and their toxicity, which has great potential in the study of amyloidopathies.
