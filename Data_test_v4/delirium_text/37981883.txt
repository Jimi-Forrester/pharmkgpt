37981883|t|[Utilization of Hospice Resources in Adult Intensive Care Units: A Comparison Between Users and Non-Users].
37981883|a|BACKGROUND: The application of palliative care is limited and challenging in intensive care units (ICUs) because of complex factors such as time constraints and unpredictable disease progression. Although research results and international consensus stress the early use of palliative care, utilization remains low, resulting in increased risks of ineffective medical care and poor quality of death. Improving this situation requires a comprehensive understanding of the palliative condition in ICUs. PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the utilization of hospice resources in adult ICUs and to compare this utilization between users and non-users. METHODS: This retrospective correlation study recruited cases from the adult ICU database of a medical center in northern Taiwan between June and July 2022. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test and chi-square were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 1,181 records were analyzed, including 458 (38.8%) females and 723 (61.2%) males. Two hundred and seventeen cases (18.4%) used hospice resources. Although 124 (10.4%) of the 1181 cases were identified as "in urgent need of hospice resources" (i.e., died within 30 days of ICU admission), 25 (20.2%) did not use these resources. Significant differences between the urgent-need cases who did and did not use hospice resources were found in terms of age, disease type, degree of frailty, cardiac arrest, infection, state of consciousness, intubation and tracheostomy status, inotropic and vasopressor medication, renal replacement, ECMO placement, delirium, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Scores. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The roughly 20% of ICU patients in urgent needs of palliative care who did not utilize palliative care resources highlight the needs for continued discussion to better assist patients on palliative care decision-making. The findings show multifaceted differences between those who did and did not access palliative care. Future studies should design and test strategies to facilitate the identification of palliative care needs and ensure the effective allocation of palliative care resources in ICUs.
