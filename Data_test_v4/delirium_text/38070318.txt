38070318|a|Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are a kind of acute central nervous system syndrome, which is a common postoperative complication in cardiac elderly patients. The two most commonly used terms for PNDs are postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). POD often leads to a series of adverse clinical outcomes and even death, so its prevention and treatment has become an important part of perioperative management in elderly patients. In the past decades, research has focused on the mechanism and progress of the pathogenesis of PNDs. Nonetheless, little research has been conducted on the research trends in the relevant field.
