33546497|t|Dangerous Stops: Nonsense Mutations Can Dramatically Increase Frequency of Prion Conversion.
33546497|a|Amyloid formation is associated with many incurable diseases. For some of these, sporadic cases are much more common than familial ones. Some reports point to the role of somatic cell mosaicism in these cases via origination of amyloids in a limited number of cells, which can then spread through tissues. However, specific types of sporadic mutations responsible for such effects are unknown. In order to identify mutations capable of increasing the de novo appearance of amyloids, we searched for such mutants in the yeast prionogenic protein Sup35. We introduced to yeast cells an additional copy of the SUP35 gene with mutated amyloidogenic domain and observed that some nonsense mutations increased the incidence of prions by several orders of magnitude. This effect was related to exposure at the C-terminus of an internal amyloidogenic region of Sup35. We also discovered that SUP35 mRNA could undergo splicing, although inefficiently, causing appearance of a shortened Sup35 isoform lacking its functional domain, which was also highly prionogenic. Our data suggest that truncated forms of amyloidogenic proteins, resulting from nonsense mutations or alternative splicing in rare somatic cells, might initiate spontaneous localized formation of amyloids, which can then spread, resulting in sporadic amyloid disease.
