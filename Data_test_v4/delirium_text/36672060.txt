36672060|a|Background: The society is aging in China, and the cognitive level of elderly post-stroke patients gradually declines. Face-to-face cognitive functional training is no longer sufficient. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a promising rehabilitation training device. In this study, we developed an IVR-based puzzle game to explore its effectiveness, feasibility, and safety in elderly stroke patients with cognitive dysfunction. Methods: A total of 30 patients with mild post-stroke cognitive impairment after stroke were randomly assigned to a control or IVR group. Patients in both groups received routine rehabilitation therapy. Patients in the control group received traditional cognitive training, and those in the IVR group received IVR-based puzzle game therapy. Before and after treatment, Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA), trail-making test-A (TMT-A), digit symbol substitution test (DSST), digital span test (DST), verbal fluency test (VFT), and modified Barthel index (MBI) were evaluated in both groups. In addition, the IVR group was administered a self-report questionnaire to obtain feedback on user experience. Results: There was no significant difference in the baseline data between the two groups. After six weeks of treatment, the cognitive assessment scores were improved in both groups. Moreover, the IVR group showed more improvements than the control group in the DSST (Z = 2.203, p = 0.028 < 0.05, eta2 = 0.16); MOCA (T = 1.186, p = 0.246 > 0.05, d = 0.44), TMT-A (T = 1.791, p = 0.084 > 0.05, d = 0.65), MBI (T = 0.783, p = 0.44 > 0.05, d = 0.28), FDST (Z = 0.78, p = 0.435 > 0.05, eta2 = 0.02), BDST (Z = 0.347, p = 0.728 > 0.05, eta2 = 0.004), and VFT(Z = 1.087, p = 0.277 > 0.05, eta2 = 0.039) did not significantly improve. The significant difference in DSST represents an improvement in executive function and visual-spatial cognitive characteristics. The other assessment scores did not show such features. Therefore, we did not observe significant differences through this measure. According to the results of the self-report questionnaire, most of the patients were satisfied with the equipment stability and training content. Several individuals reported mild adverse reactions. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that IVR-based puzzle games are a promising approach to improve post-stroke cognitive function, especially executive cognitive function, and visual-spatial attention in older adults.
