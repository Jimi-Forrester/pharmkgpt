8068983|t|Vascular basement membrane components and the lesions of Alzheimer's disease: light and electron microscopic analyses.
8068983|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of several systemic and cerebral diseases that involve the abnormal deposition of fibrillar proteins called amyloids. All amyloids share conformational and staining characteristics, as well as an association with resident tissue macrophages and two extracellular matrix components [heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and amyloid P component]. Vascular, glomerular, and Schwann cell basement membrane pathologies have been documented in many forms of amyloidosis, and often amyloid fibrils fuse to and project from the basement membrane in these diseases. The present report demonstrates the vascular basement membrane (VBM) alterations in AD autopsy samples, and details the methodologies used. Electron microscopy reveals the fusion of amyloid fibrils with the VBM and the alteration of the VBM in the absence of amyloid accumulation. Double-labelling and pre-embed immuno-electron microscopy techniques demonstrate the colocalization of amyloid P component and VBM components with amyloid, and also reveal that amyloid P component is not localized to the cerebral VBM. Finally, a novel correlative light/electron microscopy technique demonstrates the association between amyloid P component and cerebral resident tissue macrophages, the microglia. Taken together, these data suggest that the physicochemical processes of amyloid formation, rather than amyloid deposition, may be responsible for VBM pathology.
