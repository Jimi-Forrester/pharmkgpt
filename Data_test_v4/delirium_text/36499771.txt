36499771|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and warrants further study as well as timely treatment. Additionally, the mechanisms of the brain's intrinsic defense against chronic injury are not yet fully understood. Herein, we examined the response of the main neurogenic niches to amyloid exposure and the associated changes in structure and synaptic activity. Flow cytometry of Nestin-, Vimentin-, Nestin/Vimentin-, NeuN-, GFAP-, NeuN/GFAP-, NSE-, BrdU-, Wnt-, BrdU/Wnt-, VEGF-, Sox14-, VEGF/Sox14-, Sox10-, Sox2-, Sox10/Sox2-, Bax-, and Bcl-xL-positive cells was performed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), hippocampus, and cerebral cortex of rat brains on 90th day after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) single injection of a fraction of beta-amyloid (Abeta) (1-42). The relative structural changes in these areas and disruptions to synaptic activity in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus circuit were also evaluated. Our flow analyses revealed a reduction in the numbers of Nestin-, Vimentin-, and Nestin/Vimentin-positive cells in neurogenic niches and the olfactory bulb. These changes were accompanied by an increased number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampus and SVZ. The latter changes were strongly correlated with changes in the numbers of VEGF- and VEGF/Sox14-positive cells. The morphological changes were characterized by significant neural loss, a characteristic shift in entorhinal cortex-hippocampus circuit activity, and decreased spontaneous alternation in a behavioral test. We conclude that although an injection of Abeta (1-42) induced stem cell proliferation and triggered neurogenesis at a certain stage, this process was incomplete and led to neural stem cell immaturity. We propose the idea of enhancing adult neurogenesis as a promising strategy for preventing dementia at healthy elderly people andpeople at high risk for developing AD, or treating patients diagnosed with AD.
