32197217|t|Amyloid beta-protein and beyond: the path forward in Alzheimer's disease.
32197217|a|Basic research on the biological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease has focused for decades on the age-related aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein and its apparent downstream effects on microglia, astrocytes and neurons, including the posttranslational modification of the tau protein that seems necessary for symptom expression. Here, we discuss the highly challenging process of developing disease-modifying therapies and highlight several key areas of current research that are progressing in exciting directions. We conclude that further deep molecular analyses of the disease, including the mechanisms of beta-amyloidosis, will enable more effective clinical trials and ultimately achieve the progress that our patients so deserve.
