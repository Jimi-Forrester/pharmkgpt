29249869|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between short-term postoperative cognitive dysfuction (POCD) and inflammtory response in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: University medical centre. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one adult patients who had undergone CRS-HIPEC and twenty control participants. MEASUREMENTS: The inflammatory marker levels in plasma and cognitive function were measured. RESULTS: Twenty (39.2%, 20/51) patients developed POCD at 1 w after CRS-HIPEC. The patients with POCD had higher serum interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), serum amyloid A (SAA), S100 calcium-binding protein beta (S-100beta), and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) levels at 1 and 24 h postoperatively than patients without POCD. There was an association between POCD and the maximum IL-1beta and S-100beta concentrations in serum, which remained following adjustment for age and FBS. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, perioperative inflammatory marker levels increase significantly after CRS-HIPEC in adult patients, and such elevations are associated with the development of short-term cognitive dysfunction after this complex surgery. These results suggested the need for a larger RCT to replicate and confirm these findings.
