1610508|t|Confrontation naming in Alzheimer's patients: relation to disease severity.
1610508|a|Reports of Alzheimer's disease patients in whom naming performance is disproportionate to other cognitive performances raise questions about the stage model, or dementia-severity level, for predicting naming performance. Thus, dementia severity as defined by Global Deterioration Scale ratings, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, and combinations of them was evaluated as a predictor of naming performance in 102 Alzheimer's patients and was found to account for approximately 1/3 of performance variability. Additional contributions from age at onset, duration, family history, and gender were negligible. Therefore, naming ability can be argued to have a subcomponent that is not subsumed by overall cognitive ability.
