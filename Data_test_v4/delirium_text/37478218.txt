37478218|t|Exploring the active components and mechanism of modified bazhen decoction in treatment of chronic cerebral circulation insufficiency based on network pharmacology and molecular docking.
37478218|a|Modified bazhen decoction (MBZD) is a classical Chinese medicine formula with potential efficacy in the treatment of chronic cerebral circulation insufficiency (CCCI), and its main components and potential mechanisms are still unclear. The study aimed to investigate the active ingredients and mechanism of action of MBZD in treating CCCI through network pharmacology combined with molecular docking. The chemical composition and targets of 11 Chinese herbs in MBZD were retrieved utilizing the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform platform, and the targets for CCCI were screened by Genecards, online mendelian inheritance in man, therapeutic target database, and comparative toxicogenomics database databases. The targets were genetically annotated with the Uniprot database. We created a compound-target network employing Cytoscape software and screened the core targets for the treatment of CCCI by CytoNCA clustering analysis; the AutoDock Vina program performed molecular docking study of crucial targets. One thousand one hundred ninety-one active compounds were obtained, 2210 corresponding targets were predicted, 4971 CCCI-related targets were obtained, and 136 intersecting genes were identified between them. The central core targets were IL6, MAPK14, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, RELA, VEGFA, CCND1, CASP3, AR, FOS, JUN, EGFR, MAPK1, AKT1, MYC, and ESR1; gene ontology functional enrichment analysis yielded 911 gene ontology items (P < .01), while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment yielded 138 signal pathways (P < .01), primarily including oxidative reactions, vascular regulation, apoptosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the core active component of MBZD had good binding with the main target. This research initially uncovered the mechanism of action of MBZD via multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway for the treatment of CCCI, providing the theoretical basis for the clinical application of MBZD.
