33477554|t|Lights and Shadows in Hepatic Encephalopathy Diagnosis.
33477554|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a form of brain dysfunction that is caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal-systemic shunting. The exact nature of HE is debated; as such, conflicting uses of the term "HE" may cause inconsistencies in its detection and management. This review highlights the meaning of the term "HE" on the basis of its historical origins and current consensus. It also provides criteria for the diagnosis of the condition based on its phenotypes and risk factors for its occurrence. The procedure for differential diagnosis from other conditions which result in similar phenotypes is considered, together with precipitants and confounders. Finally, the current multidimensional approach for the correct clinical reporting of HE episodes is discussed.
