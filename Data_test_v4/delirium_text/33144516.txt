METHODS: We used data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of community-dwelling adults. A total of 701 participants (mean age 82.7, 71.2% female) completed baseline cognitive evaluations and underwent brain autopsy to identify pathologic Alzheimer disease (AD), TDP-43 inclusions (defining limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy [LATE]), and hippocampal sclerosis. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list memory test immediate recall trials provided serial position scores, which index the proportion of words recalled from the beginning (primacy scores) and end (recency scores) of a word list. Binary and ordinal logistic regressions examined associations between serial position scores and neuropathologic outcomes. Secondary outcomes included Alzheimer dementia and mild cognitive impairment proximate to death. RESULTS: Primacy and recency scores were uncorrelated (r = 0.07). Each SD of better primacy score was associated with lower likelihood of neuropathologic changes (24% lower LATE, 31% lower pathologic AD, 37% lower hippocampal sclerosis). For pathologic AD, better baseline primacy scores were associated with a 36% lower likelihood of comorbidity with LATE or hippocampal sclerosis. Primacy scores better discriminated between clinical diagnoses proximate to death, including those with mild cognitive impairment compared to no impairment. Recency scores showed weaker or no associations. CONCLUSIONS: Primacy scores may be particularly sensitive markers of AD and related hippocampal neuropathologies. The differential predictive value of serial position scores suggests they offer complementary information about disease outcomes in addition to the routinely used total recall scores.
