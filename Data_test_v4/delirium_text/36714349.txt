36714349|t|Diagnosis of Legionnaires' Disease Assisted by Next-Generation Sequencing in a Patient with COVID-19.
36714349|a|Coinfection in COVID-19 patients is associated with worsening outcome. Among patients with COVID-19, Legionella pneumophila, a common cause of pneumonia, has been reported as a co-occurring respiratory infection. A nonspecific clinical presentation, however, makes an early diagnosis difficult. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from a patient suffering from COVID-19 and presenting with pneumonia and sent for metagenomic analysis. Differential abundance analysis was carried out by comparing each taxon reads per million between the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample and the negative control. Two replicates of metagenomic sequencing were conducted on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Within each replicated sequencing, one negative control was sequenced for comparison of taxon abundance in the BALF sample. In both replicates, Legionella pneumophila was the only taxon with significantly higher abundance when compared with the negative control. PCR of the bronchoalveolar further confirmed the presence of L. pneumophila. Several studies have estimated that the incidence of Legionnaires' disease co-infection in patients with COVID-19 infection is approximately 0% to 1.5%. There are some common characteristics of COVID-19 and co-infection with Legionnaires' disease, making it difficult to diagnose bacterial infection early. The diagnosis of these cases is important due to the different treatments used. Current diagnostic tests for Legionnaires' disease include conventional culture, urinary antigen for L. pneumophila serogroup 1, polymerase chain reaction, direct fluorescent antibody stain, and paired serology. The current study demonstrated that metagenomics is a promising approach that facilitated the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease.
