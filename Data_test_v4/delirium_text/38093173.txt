38093173|t|Predictors for quality of life in older adults: network analysis on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
38093173|a|BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) of older adults has become a pivotal concern of the public and health system. Previous studies found that both cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) can affect QoL in older adults. However, it remains unclear how these symptoms are related to each other and impact on QoL. Our aim is to investigate the complex network relationship between cognitive and NPS symptoms in older adults, and to further explore their association with QoL. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 389 older individuals with complaints of memory decline. The instruments included the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Mini Mental State Examination, and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Data was analyzed using network analysis and mediation analysis. RESULTS: We found that attention and agitation were the variables with the highest centrality in cognitive and NPS symptoms, respectively. In an exploratory mediation analysis, agitation was significantly associated with poor attention (beta = -0.214, P < 0.001) and reduced QoL (beta = -0.137, P = 0.005). The indirect effect of agitation on the QoL through attention was significant (95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.119, -0.035]). Furthermore, attention served as a mediator between agitation and QoL, accounting for 35.09% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: By elucidating the NPS-cognition-QoL relationship, the current study provides insights for developing rehabilitation programs among older adults to ensure their QoL.
