29675329|t|Decreased resting-state brain signal complexity in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a multiscale entropy analysis.
29675329|a|Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis is a novel entropy-based analysis method for quantifying the complexity of dynamic neural signals and physiological systems across multiple temporal scales. This approach may assist in elucidating the pathophysiologic mechanisms of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using resting-state fNIRS imaging, we recorded spontaneous brain activity from 31 healthy controls (HC), 27 patients with aMCI, and 24 patients with AD. The quantitative analysis of MSE revealed that reduced brain signal complexity in AD patients in several networks, namely, the default, frontoparietal, ventral and dorsal attention networks. For the default and ventral attention networks, the MSE values also showed significant positive correlations with cognitive performances. These findings demonstrated that the MSE-based analysis method could serve as a novel tool for fNIRS study in characterizing and understanding the complexity of abnormal cortical signals in AD cohorts.
