39337449|t|1-L Transcription in Prion Diseases.
39337449|a|Understanding the pathogenesis and mechanisms of prion diseases can significantly expand our knowledge in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Prion biology is increasingly recognized as being relevant to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, both of which affect millions of people each year. This bioinformatics study used a theoretical protein-RNA recognition code (1-L transcription) to reveal the post-transcriptional regulation of the prion protein (PrPC). The principle for this method is directly elucidated on PrPC, in which an octa-repeat can be 1-L transcribed into a GGA triplet repeat RNA aptamer known to reduce the misfolding of normal PrPC into abnormal PrPSc. The identified genes/proteins are associated with mitochondria, cancer, COVID-19 and ER-stress, and approximately half are directly or indirectly associated with prion diseases. For example, the octa-repeat supports CD44, and regions of the brain with astrocytic prion accumulation also display high levels of CD44.
