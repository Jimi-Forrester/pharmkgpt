37037158|t|Acetylated tau exacerbates learning and memory impairment by disturbing with mitochondrial homeostasis.
37037158|a|Increased tau acetylation at K274 and K281 has been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal models, and mitochondrial dysfunction are noticeable and early features of AD. However, the effect of acetylated tau on mitochondria has been unclear until now. Here, we constructed three type of tau forms, acetylated tau mutant by mutating its K274/K281 into Glutamine (TauKQ) to mimic disease-associated lysine acetylation, the non-acetylation tau mutant by mutating its K274/K281 into Arginine (TauKR) and the wild-type human full-length tau (TauWT). By overexpression of these tau forms in vivo and in vitro, we found that, TauKQ induced more severe cognitive deficits with neuronal loss, dendritic plasticity damage and mitochondrial dysfunctions than TauWT. Unlike TauWT induced mitochondria fusion, TauKQ not only induced mitochondria fission by decreasing mitofusion proteins, but also inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis via reduction of PGC-1a/Nrf1/Tfam levels. TauKR had no significant difference in the cognitive and mitochondrial abnormalities compared with TauWT. Treatment with BGP-15 rescued impaired learning and memory by attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal loss and dendritic complexity damage, which caused by TauKQ. Our data suggested that, acetylation at K274/281 was an important post translational modification site for tau neurotoxicity, and BGP-15 is a potential therapeutic drug for AD.
