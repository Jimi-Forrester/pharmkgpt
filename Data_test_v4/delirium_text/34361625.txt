34361625|t|Bioactive Components, Volatile Profile and In Vitro Antioxidative Properties of Taxus baccata L. Red Arils.
34361625|a|This study aimed at assessing the composition of bioactive compounds, including ascorbic acid, carotenoids and polyphenols, the volatile compound profile and the antioxidant activity of red arils (RAs) of Taxus baccata L. grown in diverse locations in Poland. Among the carotenoids assayed in high quantities (3.3-5.42 mug/g), the lycopene content (2.55-4.1 mug/g) was remarkably higher than that in many cultivated fruits. Samples collected from three sites were distinguished by higher amounts of ascorbic acid (125 mg/100 g, on average) than those found in many cultivated berries. Phenylpropanoids quantitatively dominated among the four groups of phenolic compounds. Chromatographic separation enabled the detection of two phenylpropanoid acids: ferulic and p-coumaric. Irrespectively of the growth site, RAs contained substantial amounts of (-)-epicatechin (1080 mug/100 g, on average). A higher ability to scavenge DPPH  and ABTS + radicals was found in the hydrophilic fraction of RAs from two sites (Warsaw and Koszalin) compared with the other two sites. The volatile compound profile of RAs was dominated by alcohols, followed by ketones, esters and aldehydes. The presence of some volatiles was exclusively related to the specific growth site, which may be regarded as a valuable indicator. The combination of bioactive and volatile compounds and the fairly good antioxidant potential of RAs render them an attractive source for preparing functional foods.
