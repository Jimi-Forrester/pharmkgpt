34599793|a|One of the most valuable medicinal plants is milk thistle (Silybum marianum) or martighal. An annual or biennial plant of the Asteraceae family and English name Milk thistle, a Matte green colour and prickly plant with a standing stem that can be thick, simple, or slightly branched (ramified). Its seeds contain about 70%-80% of the flavonolignans of silymarin and about 20%-30% of polymeric and oxidized polyphenolic compounds (such as tannins). Traditionally, the plant has been used to increase milk secretion, relieve menstrual cramps, lessen depression, decrease gallstones, and jaundice as well as improve functions of the liver, spleen, and kidney. This review reviews studies on the effects of adding milk thistle to quail diet. Consumption (0.5% and 1%) of milk thistle powder in the diet of Japanese quail significantly increased feed intake, body weight, and improved carcass components. Blood constituents including total protein and albumin were improved along with decreased HDL, ALT, and AST. The use of milk thistle levels (0.5% and 1.5%) significantly improved the antioxidant total of plasma. Consumption of silymarin in quail diet increased the number of white blood cells, calcium, vitamin D3, and albumin. Silymarin also decreased the relative weights of bursa of Fabricius and spleen. This review indicates that milk thistle can improve growth performance, feed conversion ratio, and immune system in quail.
