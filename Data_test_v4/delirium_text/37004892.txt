37004892|t|Brain disorders: Impact of mild SARS-CoV-2 may shrink several parts of the brain.
37004892|a|Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory infection discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As a result of the pandemic, several individuals have experienced life-threatening diseases, the loss of loved ones, lockdowns, isolation, an increase in unemployment, and household conflict. Moreover, COVID-19 may cause direct brain injury via encephalopathy. The long-term impacts of this virus on mental health and brain function need to be analysed by researchers in the coming years. This article aims to describe the prolonged neurological clinical consequences related to brain changes in people with mild COVID-19 infection. When compared to a control group, people those who tested positive for COVID-19 had more brain shrinkage, grey matter shrinkage, and tissue damage. The damage occurs predominantly in areas of the brain that are associated with odour, ambiguity, strokes, reduced attention, headaches, sensory abnormalities, depression, and mental abilities for few months after the first infection. Therefore, in patients after a severe clinical condition of COVID-19, a deepening of persistent neurological signs is necessary.
