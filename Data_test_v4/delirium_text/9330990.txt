9330990|a|Despite recognition that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a polygenic and heterogeneous dementing neurodegenerative disorder, there is continued merit in defining the AD phenotype by the presence of progressive cognitive impairments and the pathological brain lesions (senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles) as originally formulated by Alois Alzheimer. This position paper discusses the rationale for emphasizing the detection of both beta amyloid-rich plaques and tau-rich tangles in the next iteration of the neuropathological criteria for the postmortem diagnosis of AD that has been recommended by the Working Group on Consensus Criteria for the Postmortem Diagnosis of AD. Further, it also underlines the need to exploit continuing advances in understanding the pathobiology of plaques and tangles in subsequent iterations of these criteria. It is expected that such efforts, now and in the future, will hasten the development of strategies for the early and accurate antemortem diagnosis of AD as well as the discovery of effective treatments for this common dementing illness of the elderly.
