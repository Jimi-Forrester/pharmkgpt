29142152|t|Indirect Proton MR Imaging and Kinetic Analysis of 17O-Labeled Water Tracer in the Brain.
29142152|a|PURPOSE: The feasibility of steady-state sequences for 17O imaging was evaluated based on a kinetic analysis of the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this prospective study with written informed consent. Dynamic 2D or 3D steady-state sequences were performed in five and nine participants, respectively, with different parameters using a 3T scanner. During two consecutive dynamic scans, saline was intravenously administered for control purposes in the first scan, and 20% 17O-labeled water (1 mL/Kg) was administered in the second scan. Signal changes relative to the baseline were calculated, and kinetic analyses of the curves were conducted for all voxels. Region of interest analysis was performed in the brain parenchyma, choroid plexus, and CSF spaces. RESULTS: Average signal drops were significantly larger in the 17O group than in the controls for most of the imaging parameters. Different kinetic parameters were observed between the brain parenchyma and CSF spaces. Average and maximum signal drops were significantly larger in the CSF spaces and choroid plexus than in the brain parenchyma. Bolus arrival, time to peak, and the first moment of dynamic curves of 17O in the CSF space were delayed compared to that in the brain parenchyma. Significant differences between the ventricle and subarachnoid space were also noted. CONCLUSION: Steady-state sequences are feasible for indirect 17O imaging with reasonable temporal resolution; this result is potentially important for the analysis of water kinetics and aquaporin function for several disorders.
