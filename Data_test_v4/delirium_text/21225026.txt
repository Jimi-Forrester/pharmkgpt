21225026|a|What comes to mind when thinking of Hawaii and Honolulu are beaches, sun, sand, blue water, palm trees... But thinking and imagining may be altered in patients with cognitive impairments, and as in the brain of subjects with dementia, thunderstorms are also a reality on tropical islands. Honolulu has much more to offer, from restaurants and nightlife, to a modern convention center that was the site of the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders this year. Attendees to the meeting struggled to combine science with recreation, but many interesting, highly relevant educational activities and high-impact news discussed during the conference focused attention on the former, with updated information on how to prevent and manage cognitive disorders in clinical practice.
