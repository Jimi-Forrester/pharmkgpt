35178780|a|OBJECTIVES: Understanding the biological changes that occur prior to onset of late-life depression (LLD) is key to its prevention. To investigate potential predictors of LLD, we assessed cognitive scores and neurodegenerative and vascular biomarkers in healthy older adults who later developed depression. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative of 241 cognitively unimpaired and non-depressed older adults aged 56-90 at baseline with at least 4 years of follow-up were included. Participants were classified based on whether they developed an incident depression (n = 96) or not (n = 145). Cognitive measures of memory, executive functioning, and language, and biomarkers proposed to be related to LLD: hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), and cortical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta levels, were compared between the incident depression and the never-depressed groups at four time points: at baseline, the visit prior to onset, at onset, and after the onset of depression. RESULTS: In the incident depression group, there was a mild decline in cognitive scores from baseline to the visit before depression onset compared with the never-depressed group. The cognitive differences between the groups became more marked after depression onset. Baseline cortical amyloid burden, CSF amyloid beta levels, and WMH were significant predictors of incident depression. Compared to the non-depressed group, hippocampal volume was not reduced before onset, but was reduced following depression. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid pathology and WMH can predict future development of LLD in cognitively unimpaired individuals and may be involved in precipitating vulnerability for depression in older adults.
