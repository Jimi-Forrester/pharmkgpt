34444688|a|Propolis is produced by honeybees from materials collected from plants they visit. It is a resinous material having mixtures of wax and bee enzymes. Propolis is also known as bee glue and used by bees as a building material in their hives, for blocking holes and cracks, repairing the combs and strengthening their thin borders. It has been extensively used since ancient times for different purposes in traditional human healthcare practices. The quality and composition of propolis depend on its geographic location, climatic zone and local flora. The New Zealand and Brazilian green propolis are the two main kinds that have been extensively studied in recent years. Their bioactive components have been found to possess a variety of therapeutic potentials. It was found that Brazilian green propolis improves the cognitive functions of mild cognitive impairments in patients living at high altitude and protects them from neurodegenerative damage through its antioxidant properties. It possesses artepillin C (ARC) as the key component, also known to possess anticancer potential. The New Zealand propolis contains caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as the main bioactive with multiple therapeutic potentials. Our lab performed in vitro and in vivo assays on the extracts prepared from New Zealand and Brazilian propolis and their active ingredients. We provided experimental evidence that these extracts possess anticancer, antistress and hypoxia-modulating activities. Furthermore, their conjugation with gammaCD proved to be more effective. In the present review, we portray the experimental evidence showing that propolis has the potential to be a candidate drug for different ailments and improve the quality of life.
