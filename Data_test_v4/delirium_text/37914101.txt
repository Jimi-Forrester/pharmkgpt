37914101|a|Chronic stress is linked to increased anxiety. Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes anxiety that is dependent on activated neurons, reactive microglia, and accumulation of monocytes in the brain. This response requires interactions between the immune system and central nervous system (CNS). Neuronal activation within threat appraisal regions is a key response to RSD, however, it is unclear how microglia become activated. One potential explanation is that microglia express a purinergic non-selective ligand gated adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) receptor 7 (P2X7). Activation of P2X7 promotes the release of chemokines and cytokines, and recruitment of monocytes to the brain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if a novel P2X7 antagonist blocked neuronal and microglia interactions and the corresponding anxiety following RSD. Male mice were administered (i.p.) a P2X7 antagonist, JNJ-54471300, prior to each cycle of RSD. Fourteen hours after RSD, behavioral deficits including social avoidance and anxiety-like were determined. Moreover, several immune parameters were assessed. RSD caused neuronal activation in stress-responsive regions, monocyte production and release, splenomegaly, and social avoidance. These parameters were unaffected by P2X7 antagonism. RSD-associated proportional area of Iba-1 + microglia, monocyte accumulation in the brain, IL-1beta mRNA expression in enriched myeloid cells, plasma IL-6, and anxiety-like behavior were ameliorated by P2X7 antagonism. Gene expression analysis in the hippocampus and amygdala showed regional specific responses to RSD and some were reversed with P2X7 antagonism. Overall, blocking P2X7 activation attenuated RSD-induced microglia reactivity with corresponding reduction in neuroinflammation, monocyte accumulation, and anxiety-like behavior in male mice.
