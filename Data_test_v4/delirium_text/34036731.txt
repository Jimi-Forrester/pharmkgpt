34036731|a|Novel pyridine-containing sultones were synthesized and evaluated for their cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory activity. Most of compounds showed selective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) showed: (i) the fused pyridine-containing sultones increase AChE inhibition, series B>series A; (ii) for series A, the effect of the 4-substituent on AChE activity, p->m- or o-; (iii) for series B, a halophenyl group increase activity. Compound B4 (4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dioxide-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1,2-oxathiino[5,6-h]quinoline) was identified as a selective AChE inhibitor (IC50 =8.93 muM), and molecular docking studies revealed a good fit into TcAChE via hydrogen interactions between the delta-pyridylsultone scaffold with Asp72, Ser122, Phe288, Phe290 and Trp84. Compound B4 showed reversible and non-competitive (Ki =7.67 muM) AChE inhibition, nontoxicity and neuroprotective activity. In vivo studies confirmed that compound B4 could ameliorate the cognitive performance of scopolamine-treated C57BL/6 J mice, suggesting a significant benefit of AChE inhibition for a disease-modifying treatment of AD.
