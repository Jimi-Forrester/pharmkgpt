36672736|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the etiology of PD is still unclear, the death of dopaminergic neurons during PD progression was revealed to be associated with abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein, elevation of oxidative stress, dysfunction of mitochondrial functions, and increased neuroinflammation. In this study, the effects of Licochalcone D (LCD) on MG132-induced neurotoxicity in primitive neural stem cells (pNSCs) derived from reprogrammed iPSCs were investigated. A cell viability assay showed that LCD had anti-apoptotic properties in MG132-induced oxidative-stressed pNSCs. It was confirmed that apoptosis was reduced in pNSCs treated with LCD through 7-AAD/Annexin V staining and cleaved caspase3. These effects of LCD were mediated through an interaction with JunD and through the EGFR/AKT and JNK signaling pathways. These findings suggest that LCD could be a potential antioxidant reagent for preventing disease-related pathological phenotypes of PD.
