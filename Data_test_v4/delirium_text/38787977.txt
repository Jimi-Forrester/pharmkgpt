38787977|a|Circadian rhythms synchronize all biological functions, enabling humans to foresee and respond better to periodic environmental changes. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown regulations significantly changed the lighting conditions in pregnant women, leading to chronological disruption. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 on the circadian rhythm of cesarean deliveries. We investigated whether the circadian rhythm of cesarean section deliveries changed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary hospital in Van Province, eastern Turkey. We analyzed the distribution of birth times for 1476 cesarean deliveries performed between March 01, 2020 and January 20, 2021 (1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic) and compared this information with data from 1194 cesarean deliveries performed during a similar period in the previous year. The primary outcome was the change in the circadian rhythm of cesarean deliveries. Secondary outcomes included cesarean section (CS) delivery rates, indications for CS, 1st and 5th minutes Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex irritability), Activity (muscle tone), and Respiration scores, and anesthesia technique use rates. Regarding the time distribution of CS deliveries in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the maximum number of cesarean deliveries (n = 234, 16%) occurred between 14:00 and 16:00 (P = .112). Cesarean deliveries in pre-COVID-19 group were most frequently performed between 10:00 and 12:00, at a rate of 18% (n = 216) (P = .001). In both groups, the time point at which CS deliveries were the least performed was 04:00 to 06:00, and the rates were different (n = 35, 2% and n = 14, 1%, respectively) (P = .022). A 4-hour phase shift was detected at the peak of the birth time in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous year. These results suggest that the circadian rhythm of cesarean deliveries is affected by the pandemic.
