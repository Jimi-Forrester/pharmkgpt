32229686|a|Mitochondria perform a plethora of functions in various cells of different tissues. Their architecture differs remarkably, for instance in neurons versus steroidogenic cells. Furthermore, aberrant mitochondrial architecture results in mitochondrial dysfunction. This indicates strongly that mitochondrial architecture and function are intimately linked. Therefore, a deep knowledge about the determinants of mitochondrial architecture and their function on a molecular level is of utmost importance. In the past decades, various proteins and protein complexes essential for formation of mitochondrial architecture have been identified. Here we will review the current knowledge of the MICOS complex, one of the major structural elements of mitochondria. MICOS is a multi-subunit complex present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Multiple interaction partners in the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane point to participation in a multitude of important processes, such as generation of mitochondrial architecture, lipid metabolism, and protein import into mitochondria. Since the MICOS complex is highly conserved in form and function throughout evolution, we will highlight the importance of MICOS for mammals. We will emphasize in particular the current knowledge of the association of MICOS with severe human diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
