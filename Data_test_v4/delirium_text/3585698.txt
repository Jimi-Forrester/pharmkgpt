3585698|t|Depressive thinking and depression: relations with personality and social resources.
3585698|a|The mechanisms by which social supports and personality variables may buffer against psychopathology are not well understood. We studied depression, depressive cognitions, social supports, and self-esteem in a sample of 68 spouse-caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease in an attempt to identify possible buffering mechanisms of the latter two variables. Specifically, we hypothesized that the well-known relation of depressive cognitions to depression would vary as a function of satisfaction with social supports and with level of self-esteem. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses conducted to predict depression revealed significant and independent main effects for depressive cognitions (p less than .01), social supports (p less than .025), and self-esteem (p less than .001), with depressive cognitions associated with higher depression and the other two variables associated with reduced depression (R2 = .53 for the three main effects). In addition, the relation of depressive cognitions with depression varied substantially depending on the level of social supports (p less than .01); caregivers with high levels of depressive cognitions had high levels of depression only if social supports were low (R2 = .61 including interaction). Self-esteem and depressive cognitions showed a similar interaction, but it failed to reach significance. Analyses to determine whether self-esteem and social supports were directly associated with lower depressive cognitive activity yielded a main effect for self-esteem only (p less than .03). Thus, whereas social supports and self-esteem were directly associated with lower depression, only the social supports variable was further associated with reduced depression because it apparently buffered the impact of depressive thinking. Self-esteem was also indirectly associated with lower depression via its relation with lower depressive thinking. Implications of our results for cognitive theories of depression and for the psychosocial mechanisms of stress buffering are discussed.
