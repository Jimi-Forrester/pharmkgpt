38741725|t|Intranasal CEPO-FC prevents attention deficits in streptozotocin-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease: Focus on synaptic plasticity-related factors.
38741725|a|Alzheimer's disease remains an issue of great controversy due to its pathology. It is characterized by cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The FDA approved medications for this disease, can only mitigate the symptoms. One reason for the lack of effective medications is the inaccessibility of the brain which is encompassed by the blood-brain barrier, making intranasal (IN) route of administration potentially advantageous. Male Wistar rats underwent stereotaxic surgery to induce an Alzheimer's disease model via intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin injection, and Carbamylated Erythropoietin-Fc (CEPO-FC), a derivative of Erythropoietin without its harmful characteristics, was administered intranasally for ten consecutive days. Cognition performance for memory and attention was assessed using the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Object-Based Attention Test respectively. Depression like behavior was evaluated using the Forced Swim Test. Western blotting was done on the extracted hippocampus to quantify STIM proteins. Calbindin, PSD-95, Neuroplastin, Synaptophysin and GAP-43 genes were assessed by Realtime PCR. Behavioral tests demonstrated that IN CEPO-FC could halt cognition deficits and molecular investigations showed that, STIM proteins were decreased in Alzheimer's model, and increased after IN CEPO-FC treatment. Calbindin and PSD-95 were downregulated in our disease model and upregulated when treated with IN CEPO-FC. While Neuroplastin, and GAP-43 expressions remained unchanged. This study suggests that IN CEPO-FC in low doses could be promising for improving cognition and synaptic plasticity deficits in Alzheimer's disease and since IN route of administration is a convenient way, choosing IN CEPO-FC for clinical trial might worth consideration.
