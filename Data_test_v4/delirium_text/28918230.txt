28918230|t|Biosensing methods for determination of triglycerides: A review.
28918230|a|Triglycerides (TGs) are the major transporters of dietary fats throughout the bloodstream. Besides transporting fat, TGs also act as stored fat in adipose tissue, which is utilized during insufficient carbohydrates supply. TG level is below 150mg/dL in healthy persons. Elevated TGs level in blood over 500mg/dL is a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer disease, pancreatitis and diabetes. Numerous methods are accessible for recognition of TGs, among them, most are cumbersome, time-consuming, require sample pre-treatment, high cost instrumental set-up and experienced personnel to operate. Biosensing approach overcomes these disadvantages, as these are highly specific, fast, easy, cost effective, and highly sensitive. This review article describes the classification, operating principles, merits and demerits of TG biosensors, specifically nanomaterials based biosensors. TG biosensors work ideally within 2.5-2700s, in pH range, 6.0-11.0, temperature 25-39.5 C and TG concentration range, 0.001-100mM, the detection limits being in the range, 0.1nM to 0.56mM, with working potential - 0.02 to 1.2V. These biosensors measured TG level in fruit juices, beverages, sera and urine samples and reused upto 200 times over a period of 7-240 days, while stored dry at 4 C. Future perspective for further improvement and commercialization of TG biosensors are discussed.
