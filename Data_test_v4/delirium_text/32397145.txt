32397145|a|It has been thought that caloric restriction favors longevity and healthy aging where autophagy plays a vital role. However, autophagy decreases during aging and that can lead to the development of aging-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, etc. It was shown that autophagy can be induced by mechanical or chemical stress. In this regard, various pharmacological compounds were proposed, including natural polyphenols. Apart from the ability to induce autophagy, polyphenols, such as resveratrol, are capable of modulating the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, neutralizing free radical species, affecting mitochondrial functions, chelating redox-active transition metal ions, and preventing protein aggregation. Moreover, polyphenols have advantages compared to chemical inducers of autophagy due to their intrinsic natural bio-compatibility and safety. In this context, polyphenols can be considered as a potential therapeutic tool for healthy aging either as a part of a diet or as separate compounds (supplements). This review discusses the epigenetic aspect and the underlying molecular mechanism of polyphenols as an anti-aging remedy. In addition, the recent advances of studies on NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) regulation of autophagy, the role of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in cells senescence and their regulation by polyphenols have been highlighted as well. Apart from that, the review also revised the latest information on how polyphenols can help to improve mitochondrial function and modulate apoptosis (programmed cell death).
