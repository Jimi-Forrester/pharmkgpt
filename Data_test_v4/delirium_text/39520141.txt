39520141|a|Post-mortem investigations indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC) is the initial site of hyperphosphorylated pretangle tau, a precursor to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of pretangle tau and NFTs correlates with AD progression and symptomatology. LC neuron integrity and quantity are linked to cognitive performance, with degeneration strongly associated with AD. Despite their importance, the mechanisms of pretangle tau-induced LC degeneration are unclear. This study examined the transcriptomic and mitochondrial profiles of LC noradrenergic neurons after transduction with pseudophosphorylated human tau. Tau hyperphosphorylation increased the somatic expression of the L-type calcium channel (LTCC), impaired mitochondrial health, and led to deficits in spatial and olfactory learning. Sex-dependent alterations in gene expression were observed in rats transduced with pretangle tau. Chronic LTCC blockade prevented behavioral deficits and altered mitochondrial mRNA expression, suggesting a potential link between LTCC hyperactivity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our research provides insights into the consequences of tau pathology in the originating structure of AD.
