36143177|t|Effectiveness of Cement Augmentation on Early Postoperative Mobility in Patients Treated for Trochanteric Fractures with Cephalomedullary Nailing: A Prospective Cohort Study.
36143177|a|Fixation using cephalomedullary nails (CMNs) with additional cement augmentation (CA) was developed as a novel treatment option for the osteosynthesis of osteoporotic trochanteric fractures, though the effectiveness of CA on early postoperative mobility remains uncertain. This multicenter prospective cohort study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of CA on early postoperative mobility in patients with trochanteric fractures. We enrolled patients with femoral trochanteric fractures aged >60 years who were able to walk independently before the injury. The primary outcome was the postoperative 3-day cumulated ambulation score (CAS); the secondary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score at rest and during movement on postoperative days 1-3. The outcomes of the patients treated using CMNs with or without CA were compared. Sixty-three eligible patients were categorized into CA (n = 32) and control (n = 31) groups. In univariate analysis, the CA group had significantly higher CAS values, lower VAS scores at rest on day 1 postoperatively, and lower VAS scores during movement on day 3. In multivariable linear regression analyses, the CA group had significantly higher CAS values (beta, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 3.6; p = 0.01). The CA group had a negative adjusted beta value in their VAS scores during movement. This study indicated that CA was associated with a high CAS value in patients with geriatric trochanteric fractures. However, CA was not associated with pain reduction at rest and during movement during the initial postoperative days.
