38094118|a|Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of strokes are produced by cardioembolisms, and half of cardioembolic strokes are triggered by Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common type of arrhythmia. A more recent cause of cardioembolisms is Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacements (TAVRs), which may onset post-procedural adverse events such as stroke and Silent Brain Infarcts (SBIs), for which no definitive treatment exists, and which will only get worse as TAVRs are implanted in younger and lower risk patients. It is well known that some specific characteristics of elderly patients may lower the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation therapy, making it a real urgency to find alternative therapies. We propose a device consisting of a strut structure placed at the base of the treated artery to model the potential risk of cerebral embolisms caused by dislodged debris of varying sizes. This work analyzes a design based on a patented medical device, intended to block cardioembolisms from entering the cerebrovascular system, with a particular focus on AF, and potentially TAVR patients. The study has been carried out in two stages. Both of them based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking method. The first stage of the work evaluates a variety of strut thicknesses and inter-strut spacings, contrasting with the device-free baseline geometry. The analysis is carried out by imposing flowrate waveforms characteristic of both healthy and AF patients. Boundary conditions are calibrated to reproduce physiological flowrates and pressures in a patient's aortic arch. In the second stage, the optimal geometric design from the first stage was employed, with the addition of lateral struts to prevent the filtration of particles and electronegatively charged strut surfaces, studying the effect of electrical forces on the clots if they are considered charged. Flowrate boundary conditions were used to emulate both healthy and AF conditions. Results from numerical simulations coming form the first stage indicate that the device blocks particles of sizes larger than the inter-strut spacing. It was found that lateral strut space had the highest impact on efficacy. Based on the results of the second stage, deploying the electronegatively charged device in all three aortic arch arteries, the number of particles entering these arteries was reduced on average by 62.6% and 51.2%, for the healthy and diseased models respectively, matching or surpassing current oral anticoagulant efficacy. In conclusion, the device demonstrated a two-fold mechanism for filtering emboli: while the smallest particles are deflected by electrostatic repulsion, avoiding microembolisms, which could lead to cognitive impairment, the largest ones are mechanically filtered since they cannot fit in between the struts, effectively blocking the full range of particle sizes analyzed in this study. The device presented in this manuscript offers an anticoagulant-free method to prevent stroke and SBIs, imperative given the growing population of AF and elderly patients.
