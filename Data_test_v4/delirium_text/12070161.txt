12070161|a|Although amyloid beta-protein (A beta) has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, little is known about the mechanism by which A beta causes dementia. A beta leads to neuronal cell death in vivo and in vitro, but recent evidence suggests that the property of the amnesic characteristic of Alzheimer's disease can be explained by a malfunction of synapses rather than a loss of neurons. Here we show that prolonged treatment with A beta augments the glutamate clearance ability of cultured astrocytes and induces a dramatic decrease in glutamatergic synaptic activity of neurons cocultured with the astrocytes. Biotinylation assay revealed that the enhancement of glutamate uptake activity was associated with an increase in cell-surface expression of GLAST, a subtype of glial glutamate transporters, without apparent changes in the total amount of GLAST. This phenomenon was blocked efficiently by actin-disrupting agents. Thus, A beta-induced actin-dependent GLAST redistribution and relevant synaptic malfunction may be a cellular basis for the amnesia of Alzheimer's disease.
