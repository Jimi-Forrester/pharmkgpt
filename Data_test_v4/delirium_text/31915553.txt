31915553|t|Survival Following Extreme Hypernatraemia Associated with Severe Dehydration and Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus.
31915553|a|We report a case of a previously well 58-year-old man, who presented with delirium and low GCS, and was found to have extreme hypernatraemia (Na+ = 191 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (glucose = 31 mmol/L). This resulted in a corrected serum sodium of 202 mmol/L. He was treated with fluid and electrolyte replacement in the intensive care unit, and had returned to essentially normal function by hospital discharge. The aetiology was believed to be due to severe dehydration and a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Extreme hypernatraemia (serum sodium level greater than 190 mmol/L) is rare and associated with a high mortality. The mainstay of treatment is careful fluid and electrolyte management. Most recommendations advise to reduce the serum sodium by 0.5 mmol/L/hour, due to concerns over cerebral oedema; however, there are reports that slower correction is associated with higher mortality. In this case, the initial corrected sodium of 202 mmol/L was steadily corrected to 160 mmol/L over 91 hours, at a rate of 0.46 mmol/L/hour. This demonstrates the safety of the recommended approach.
