38162631|a|Nephropathy injury is a prevalent complication observed in individuals with diabetes, serving as a prominent contributor to end-stage renal disease, and the advanced glycation products (AGEs) are important factors that induce kidney injury in patients with diabetes. Addressing this condition remains a challenging aspect in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NKK20 strain (NKK20) which protects against diabetic kidney disease (DKD) based on animal and cell models. The results showed that the NKK20 can significantly reduce renal inflammatory response, serum oxidative stress response, and AGE concentration in diabetic mice. After treatment with NKK20, the kidney damage of diabetic mice was significantly improved, and more importantly, the concentration of butyrate, a specific anti-inflammatory metabolite of intestinal flora in the stool of diabetic mice, was significantly increased. In addition, nontargeted metabolomics analysis showed a significant difference between the metabolites in the mouse serum contents of the NKK20 administration group and those in the nephropathy injury group, in which a total of 24 different metabolites that were significantly affected by NKK20 were observed, and these metabolites were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. Also, the administration of butyrate to human kidney- (HK-) 2 cells that were stimulated by AGEs resulted in a significant upregulation of ZO-1, Occludin, and E-cadherin gene expressions and downregulation of alpha-SMA gene expression. This means that butyrate can maintain the tight junction structure of HK-2 cells and inhibit fibrosis. Butyrate also significantly inhibited the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. These results indicate that NKK20 can treat kidney injury in diabetic mice by reducing blood glucose and AGE concentration and increasing butyrate production in the intestine. By inhibiting PI3K pathway activation in HK-2 cells, butyrate maintains a tight junction structure of renal tubule epithelial cells and inhibits renal tissue fibrosis. These results suggest that NKK20 is helpful to prevent and treat the occurrence and aggravation of diabetic kidney injury.
