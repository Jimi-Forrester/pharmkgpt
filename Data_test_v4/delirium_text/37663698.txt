37663698|a|Introduction: Preexisting anticoagulation is common among geriatric trauma patients. Geriatric trauma patients have a higher risk of mortality compared to younger patients. We sought to evaluate the association of preexisting anticoagulation with mortality in a group of geriatric trauma patients. Methods: A retrospective review of geriatric trauma patients was conducted for those admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from January 2018 to December 2020. Vital signs, demographics, injury characteristics, laboratory data, and mortality were all collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed for the association of preexisting anticoagulation and a primary endpoint of all-cause mortality. These groups were controlled for preexisting comorbidities, injury severity scores, and systolic blood pressure in the emergency department. Results: Four thousand four hundred thirty-two geriatric patients were admitted during the study period. This cohort was made up of 36.9% men and 63.1% women. Three thousand eight hundred fifty-nine (87.2%) were white; the average age was 81+-8.5 years, and the median injury severity score (ISS) was 5. The mean systolic blood pressure was 150+-32 mmHg, mean heart rate was 81+-16 bpm, mean lactate was 2.3+-1.3, mean hematocrit was 37.3+-8.8, and mean international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.7+-10.3. One thousand five hundred ninety-two (35.9%) patients were on anticoagulation (AC) upon presentation. One hundred and sixty-five (3.7%) mortalities were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis results show that preexisting anticoagulation [ odds ratio (OR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.36-2.72] was independently predictive of death. The analysis was adjusted for systolic BP in the emergency department less than90 mmHg (OR 5.55, 95% CI 2.83-10.9), having more than 1 comorbidity (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.57-3.38) and ISS (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.10-1.15). Conclusion: Our study indicates that preexisting anticoagulation is associated with mortality among geriatric trauma patients.
