33642980|t|Decreased Plasma Levels of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Among Patients With Bipolar Disorder.
33642980|a|BACKGROUND: Dysfunctions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of several mental illness, including schizophrenia and mood disorders. We carried out a cross-sectional study assessing the levels of RAS-related molecules among bipolar disorder (BD) patients compared to healthy controls. METHODS: our sample consisted of 30 outpatients with BD type 1 (10 males, 20 females, age = 35.53 +- 10.59 years, 14 euthymic, 16 experiencing mood episodes) and 30 healthy controls (10 males, 20 females, age = 34.83 +- 11.49 years). Plasma levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-II (Ang II), and angiotensin (1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: BD patients experiencing ongoing mood episodes had significantly lower ACE levels compared to controls (median: 459.00 vs. 514.10, p < 0.05). There was no association between the levels of these biomarkers and clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the involvement of RAS dysfunction in the pathophysiology of BD. Considering the potential therapeutic implications linked to a better understanding of the role of RAS dysfunction in BD, studies allowing a better characterization of RAS-related molecules level and activity across different mood states are of high interest.
