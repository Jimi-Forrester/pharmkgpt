22651996|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), persistent microglial activation as sign of chronic neuroinflammation contributes to disease progression. Our study aimed to in vivo visualize and quantify microglial activation in 13- to 15-month-old AD mice using [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195 and positron emission tomography (PET). We attempted to modulate neuroinflammation by subjecting the animals to an anti-inflammatory treatment with pioglitazone (5-weeks' treatment, 5-week wash-out period). [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195 distribution volume values in AD mice were significantly higher compared with control mice after the wash-out period at 15 months, which was supported by immunohistochemistry data. However, [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195 muPET could not demonstrate genotype- or treatment-dependent differences in the 13- to 14-month-old animals, suggesting that microglial activation in AD mice at this age and disease stage is too mild to be detected by this imaging method.
