36827351|t|Apolipoprotein E4 allele is genetically associated with risk of the short- and medium-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction: A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.
36827351|a|The aim of systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate whether APOE4 was associated with postoperative neurologic dysfunction occurrence in short- or medium-term among surgical patients and to study the potential genetic association among these two entities. We searched electronic databases for reserch studies to evaluate the association of APOE4 with postoperative delirium (POD) or short- and medium term postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Twenty-two trials (16 prospective and six retrospective) with 6734 patients were included. APOE4 alleles was shown significantly associated with POCD within 1 week (odds ratio, OR, 1.89, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.36 to 2.6278, p < 0.01) in the random-effects model. A significant association was also noted between APOE4 and POCD in medium-term, 1-3 months, after surgery (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.003-2.839, p = 0.049). However, APOE4 was not significantly associated with POCD 1 year after surgery (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.57-1.70, p = 0.9449) and POD (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.85-1.91, p = 0.23). In conclusion, APOE4 alleles was genetically associated with short- and medium-term postoperative neurological dysfunction and future screening or preventive strategies derived is highly potential to improve outcomes.
