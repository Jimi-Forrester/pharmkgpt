38101797|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is clinically severe, with a high mortality rate and rare neuropsychiatric symptoms. In the course of diagnosis and treatment, it is necessary to actively determine whether the neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients are caused by neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) or macrophage activation syndrome. This paper retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 2 cases of SLE associated MAS with neuropsychiatric lesions, Case 1: A 30-year-old female had obvious alopecia in 2019, accompanied by emaciation, fatigue and dry mouth. In March 2021, she felt weak legs and fell down, followed by fever and chills without obvious causes. After completing relevant examinations, she was diagnosed with SLE and given symptomatic treatments such as hormones and anti-infection, but the patient still had fever. The relevant examinations showed moderate anemia, elevated ferritin, elevated triglycerides, decreased NK cell activity, and a perforin positivity rate of 4.27%, which led to the diagnosis of "pre-hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS)". In May 2021, the patient showed mental trance and babble, and was diagnosed with "SLE-associated MAS"after completing relevant examinations. After treatment with methylprednisolone, anti-infection and psychotropic drugs, the patient's temperature was normal and mental symptoms improved. Case 2: A 30-year-old female patient developed butterfly erythema on both sides of the nose on her face and several erythema on her neck in June 2019, accompanied by alopecia, oral ulcers, and fever. She was diagnosed with "SLE" after completing relevant examinations, and her condition was relieved after treatment with methylprednisolone and human immunoglobulin. In October 2019, the patient showed apathy, no lethargy, and fever again, accompanied by dizziness and vomiting. The relevant examination indicated moderate anemia, decreased NK cell activity, elevated triglycerides, and elevated ferritin. The patient was considered to be diagnosed with "SLE, NPSLE, and SLE-associated MAS". After treatment with hormones, human immunoglobulin, anti-infection, rituximab (Mabthera), the patient's condition improved and was discharged from the hospital. After discharge, the patient regularly took methylprednisolone tablets (Medrol), and her psychiatric symptoms were still intermittent. In November 2019, she developed symptoms of fever, mania, and delirium, and later turned to an apathetic state, and was given methylprednisolone intravenous drip and olanzapine tablets (Zyprexa) orally. After the mental symptoms improved, she was treated with rituximab (Mabthera). Later, due to repeated infections, she was replaced with Belizumab (Benlysta), and she was recovered from her psychiatric anomalies in March 2021. Through the analysis of clinical symptoms, imaging examination, laboratory examination, treatment course and effect, it is speculated that the neuropsychiatric symptoms of case 1 are more likely to be caused by MAS, and that of case 2 is more likely to be caused by SLE. At present, there is no direct laboratory basis for the identification of the two neuropsychiatric symptoms. The etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms can be determined by clinical manifestations, imaging manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid detection, and the patient's response to treatment. Early diagnosis is of great significance for guiding clinical treatment, monitoring the condition and judging the prognosis. The good prognosis of the two cases in this paper is closely related to the early diagnosis, treatment and intervention of the disease.
