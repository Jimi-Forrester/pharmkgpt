36983059|t|Impaired Autophagy in Krabbe Disease: The Role of BCL2 and Beclin-1 Phosphorylation.
36983059|a|Autophagic impairment was identified in many lysosomal storage diseases and adult neurodegenerative diseases. It seems that this defect could be directly related to the appearance of a neurodegenerative phenotype and could contribute to worsen metabolite accumulation and lysosomal distress. Thus, autophagy is becoming a promising target for supportive therapies. Autophagy alterations were recently identified also in Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease is characterized by extensive demyelination and dysmyelination and it is due to the genetic loss of function of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC). This enzyme leads to the accumulation of galactosylceramide, psychosine, and secondary substrates such as lactosylceramide. In this paper, we induced autophagy through starvation and examined the cellular response occurring in fibroblasts isolated from patients. We demonstrated that the inhibitory AKT-mediated phosphorylation of beclin-1 and the BCL2-beclin-1 complex concur to reduce autophagosomes formation in response to starvation. These events were not dependent on the accumulation of psychosine, which was previously identified as a possible player in autophagic impairment in Krabbe disease. We believe that these data could better elucidate the capability of response to autophagic stimuli in Krabbe disease, in order to identify possible molecules able to stimulate the process.
