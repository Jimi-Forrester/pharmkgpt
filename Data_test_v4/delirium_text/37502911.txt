37502911|t|Integrative determination of the atomic structure of mutant huntingtin exon 1 fibrils from Huntington's disease.
37502911|a|Neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is accompanied by the aggregation of fragments of the mutant huntingtin protein, a biomarker of disease progression. A particular pathogenic role has been attributed to the aggregation-prone huntingtin exon 1 (HttEx1) fragment, whose polyglutamine (polyQ) segment is expanded. Unlike amyloid fibrils from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the atomic-level structure of HttEx1 fibrils has remained unknown, limiting diagnostic and treatment efforts. We present and analyze the structure of fibrils formed by polyQ peptides and polyQ-expanded HttEx1. Atomic-resolution perspectives are enabled by an integrative analysis and unrestrained all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating experimental data from electron microscopy (EM), solid-state NMR, and other techniques. Visualizing the HttEx1 subdomains in atomic detail helps explaining the biological properties of these protein aggregates, as well as paves the way for targeting them for detection and degradation.
