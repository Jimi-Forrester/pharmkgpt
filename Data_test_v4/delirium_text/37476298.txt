37476298|t|Histological Study on the Thickness of Gray Matter at the Summit and Bottom of Folium in Different Age Groups of Bangladeshi People.
37476298|a|Context The cerebellum is a part of the hindbrain and consists of cortical gray matter (GM) at the surface and a medullary core of white matter (WM). The GM contains a cell body of neurons that helps process and transmit any command type through nerve fibers found in the WM. The main functions of GM in the central nervous system empower persons to control motor activity, recollection, and passion. So, this research aims to assess the thickness of GM at the summit and bottom of folia by histologically studying the cerebellum cortex. Methods The collection of data was a descriptive type of cross-sectional study. The method was the purposive type. This study was conducted from August 2016 to March 2017, and the research was carried out at Mymensingh Medical College's Department of Anatomy, Bangladesh. Specimens containing cerebellum were preserved from Bangladeshi cadavers according to sexes and ages ranging in years. We chose fresh specimens from people who died within the last 12 hours and preserved them in 10% formol saline. The size of the tissue that was collected for the histological study was not more than 2 cm2 and not more than 4-5 mm thick. Then the tissue was placed in 10% formol saline. This fluid was used for quick fixation and partial dehydration of the tissue. After dehydration, each tissue segment is processed for infiltration and embedding separately. Every section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) before being coated with dibutyl phthalate polystyrene xylene (DPX) coverslips on slides. Result The mean (+-SD) thickness of GM at the summit of folium was 886.2+-29.7microm in Group A, 925.2+-25.9microm in Group B, 912.7+-22.3microm in Group C, and 839.9+-40.7microm in Group D. Mean (+-SD) GM thickness at the bottom of the fissure was 395.6+-12.2 microm, 403.9+-26.0microm, 380.4+-23.4 microm, and 375.8+-28.8 microm in Groups A, B, C, and D respectively. Conclusion The thickness of the cortex is an essential factor in the normal development process, and it was similar in the current study. Normal aging, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias cause reduced GM which makes the cortical sheet thin. Huntington's disease, corticobasal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and schizophrenia are all examples of neurological disorders. Cortical thinning is typically locally localized, and the progression of atrophy can thus disclose much about a disease's history and causal variables. The present study correspondingly found that GM was reduced after the age of 50 years onward. Furthermore, longitudinal investigations of cortical atrophy have the potential to be extremely useful in measuring the efficacy of a wide range of treatments.
