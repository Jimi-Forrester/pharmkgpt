38107204|a|Objective: To investigate current practices among orthopaedic trauma surgeons in treating geriatric distal femur fractures and evaluate current postoperative weight-bearing recommendations. Methods: A 26-question survey was emailed to Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium surgeon members to characterize current practice with different fixation methods for distal femur fractures and the surgeon-directed postoperative weight-bearing recommendations for each approach. Results: Surveys were completed by 123 orthopaedic trauma surgeons with a response rate of 37% (123/332). Retrograde intramedullary nailing (IMN) was commonly performed by 88% of surgeons, and lateral locked plate was commonly performed by 74% of surgeons. Retrograde IMN with a lateral plate was commonly performed by 51% of surgeons. Dual femoral plating was commonly performed by 18% of surgeons and sometimes performed by 39% of surgeons. Surgeons were significantly more likely to allow immediate postoperative weight-bearing for retrograde IMN (P < 0.001), retrograde IMN with lateral plate (P < 0.001), and dual plate (P < 0.001) as compared with locked lateral plate. Most surgeons (79%) would be interested in participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating single implant versus dual implant for distal femur fractures and believe that a trial incorporating immediate weight-bearing is important. Conclusion: A variety of implants are commonly used to treat geriatric distal femur fractures. Patients with distal femur fracture commonly have weight-bearing restrictions in the immediate postoperative period. A large proportion of orthopaedic trauma surgeons have clinical equipoise for an RCT to investigate the impact of surgical construct and weight-bearing on geriatric distal femur fracture patient recovery.
