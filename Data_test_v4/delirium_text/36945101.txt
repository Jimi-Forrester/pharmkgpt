36945101|a|Objectives: In this pilot study, we focused on the health benefits of a nature-based virtual reality (VR) intervention for older adults with dementia, primarily Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Our main objective was to assess pre-post changes in the emotional health and quality of life of older adults with AD after participating in a 5-week nature-based VR program. Methods: Using in-depth interviews with VR participants and facility staff, we explored the health outcomes of participants as well as challenges to their participation. We recruited 11 participants. Results: We found an increase in participants' mean scores for pleasure and alertness and a decrease in mean scores for anxiety, sadness, and anger. In addition, we found that the quality-of-life mean scores significantly increased after program participation. In qualitative findings, we identified 3 main themes as possible mental health outcomes of the nature-based VR program: (1) enjoyment, (2) novel experience, and (3) reminiscence. On the other hand, participants experienced some challenges related to the VR gear and manipulating the VR controllers and goggles while engaged in the program. Conclusion: The nature-based VR program was instrumental in promoting emotional health and quality of life among older adults with AD.
