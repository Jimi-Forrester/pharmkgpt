39113920|t|Cerebrolysin Concentrate: Therapeutic Potential for Severe Oral Apraxia After Stroke: A Case Report.
39113920|a|Cerebrolysin concentrate is a medication whose main active ingredient is brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It has been reported to help in the restoration of cognitive function and overall physical function after brain injuries. We present the case of a 72-year-old man with severe oral apraxia due to a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke involving the left insular cortex. He was being tube fed due to severe oral apraxia with cognitive decline that made it difficult for him to even imitate simple oral movements. The patient initially had impaired consciousness and cognitive function. He also had limited physical activity due to acute stroke complications, such as hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral infarction, and required bed rest until 23 days after onset. The patient received intravenous cerebrolysin concentrate in addition to intensive rehabilitation therapy from 23 days after onset. After rehabilitation and administration of cerebrolysin concentrate, there was a marked recovery within a short period of time to the point where oral intake of a regular diet was possible, indicating a significant improvement in oral apraxia. It is a notable example of the potential therapeutic effect of cerebrolysin concentrate for post-stroke oral apraxia.
