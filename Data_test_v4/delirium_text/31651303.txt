31651303|t|Association between plasma adipsin level and mild cognitive impairment in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study.
31651303|a|BACKGROUND: The adipokine adipsin contributes to insulin resistance (IR), inflammation, and obesity, which are all regarded as high-risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This research aimed to uncover the role of adipsin in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population with early cognitive dysfunction and determine whether adipsin contributes to diabetic MCI caused by IR. METHODS: In our study, 126 patients with T2DM were enrolled. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive impairment. Demographic data and neuropsychological test results were evaluated. Plasma adipsin level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The MCI group (n = 57) presented higher plasma adipsin levels compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.018). After adjustment for educational attainment, and age, begative correlations were found between plasma adipsin levels and MoCA, Mini Mental State Exam, and Verbal Fluency Test scores(r = - 0.640, p < 0.001; r = - 0.612, p < 0.001; r = - 0.288, p = 0.035; respectively). Correlation analysis demonstrated that adipsin levels were significantly positively correlated with fasting C-peptide; homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.368, p < 0.001; r = 0.494, p < 0.001; respectively). Multivariable regression analysis further indicated that high plasma adipsin level was a significant independent determinant of MCI in the Chinese population withT2DM (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma adipsin level was associated with MCI in Chinese T2DM patients. Further large-scale studies should be designed to determine whether adipsin is linked to IR-associated susceptibility to early cognitive decline in T2DM patients.
