35184665|t|Alzheimer cafe: toward bridging the gap between cure and care in patients with dementia.
35184665|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of degenerative dementia, whose symptoms usually appear in the pre-senile age. In the early stages, patients present social difficulties due to the general cognitive decline in memory, language and executive domains. These problems also affect patients' quality of life, emotions, and mood, leading to social isolation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Alzheimer's Cafe (AC) on the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of AD patients. METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with AD, who attended the Cognitive and Behavioral Rehabilitation Laboratory of the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi 'Bonino-Pulejo' of Messina, Italy, from December 2017 to December 2018, were enrolled in this study. As these patients belonged to the experimental group (EG: n = 20), they received specific cognitive-behavior training using the AC modality. The patients were assessed by a neuropsychological evaluation at the beginning and at the end of the program. Their outcomes were compared to a matched group of patients with neurodegenerative dementia (CG: 20) receiving conventional cognitive training. RESULTS: The pre-post comparisons showed that both CG and EG had a significant improvement in global cognitive functioning (MoCA p < 0.001) and in perceived quality of life (<0.001). However, only in the EG, we observed a significant increase in social functioning (SASS p < 0.00), the perception of mental well-being (SF-12 Mental p < 0.00), and a reduction in the depressive state (GDS p < 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests the importance of AC for patients with AD and the potential effect on psychological and social well-being.
