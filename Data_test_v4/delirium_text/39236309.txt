39236309|t|Risk of aspiration pneumonia and hospital mortality in Parkinson disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
39236309|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to conduct a meta-analysis on the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia (AP) and hospital mortality in Parkinson disease (PD) as well as the risk of AP in PD patients compared to controls. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 19 March 2024 to identify cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies comparing the frequency of AP and hospital mortality in PD patients. We computed risk ratios (RRs) with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study and pooled the results using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 781 studies were initially screened, and 13 studies involving 541,785,587 patients were included. Patients with PD had >3 times higher risk of AP compared to controls (RR = 3.30, 95% CI = 1.82-6.00, p < 0.0001). This increased risk was similar in both cohort studies (RR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.10-8.24, p = 0.03) and case-control studies (RR = 3.86, 95% CI = 3.84-3.87, p < 0.00001). The prevalence of AP in 12 studies was 2.74% (95% CI = 1.69-4.41), and hospital mortality was 10% in six studies (10.0%, 95% CI = 5.32-18.0). Prevalence of AP was higher in studies with smaller sample size (5.26%, 95% CI = 3.08-8.83 vs. 2.06%, 95% CI = 1.19-3.55, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that patients with PD had >3 times higher risk of AP, with an average 2.74% prevalence and 10.0% hospital mortality. Early recognition and treatment of AP in PD patients will help reduce morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary holistic approach is needed to address the multifactorial causes of AP.
