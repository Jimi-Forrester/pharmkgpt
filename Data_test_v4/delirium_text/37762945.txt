37762945|t|Predictors of 30-Day Postoperative Outcome after Elective Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: A Tertiary Referral Center Experience.
37762945|a|BACKGROUND: We evaluated the 30-day postoperative outcome after elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the possible predictors for the 30-day postoperative outcome. MATERIALS: Demographics, medical history, laboratory values, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day complications classified as major (major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), acute kidney injury (AKI) and death of any cause) and minor (postimplantation syndrome (PIS), postoperative delirium (POD), urinary tract infection (UTI) and technical graft failure) were documented (March 2016 to February 2019). RESULTS: We included 322 patients. The majority were managed under general anesthesia (83%) with femoral cutdown (98.1%). Overall, 121 (37.5%) complications, mostly minor (n = 103, 31.9%), were recorded. In total, 11 patients (3.4%) developed MACEs, 5 (1.6%) experienced AKI and 2 (0.6%) died in the ICU. Moreover, 77 patients (23.9%) suffered from PIS, 11 from POD, 11 from UTI and 4 from technical graft failure. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that aneurysm diameter (p = 0.01) and past smoking (p = 0.003) were predictors for complications. PAD was an independent predictor of MACEs (p = 0.003), preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of AKI (p = 0.003) and past smoking of PIS (p = 0.008), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the 30-day morbidity after EVAR exceeded 35%. However, the majority of complications were minor, and the associated mortality was low. Aneurysm diameter and past smoking were independent predictors for postoperative outcome.
