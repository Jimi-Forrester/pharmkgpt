12532784|t|[Research on the mechanism of neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease and the effects of tetrohydroberberine on the apoptosis].
12532784|a|Apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease(AD) was studied by the techniques of immunohistochemistry, neuronal culture and patch clamp. The hippocampal neuronal apoptosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide (beta-AP) and its ionic mechanism were also observed. The results showed that neuronal apoptosis did exist in AD brains and beta-AP might induce the apoptosis by blocking the voltage-dependent K+ and Na+ channels, which were enhanced by nitric oxide(NO). In addition, tetrohydroberbine could protect against the apoptosis induced by beta-AP by reducing hippocampal neuronal intracellar free Ca2+.
