37496289|t|Pharmacomodulation of brain neuromedin U signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy.
37496289|a|Neuromedin U (NMU) belongs to a family of multifunctional neuropeptides that modulate the activity of several neural networks of the brain. Acting via metabotropic receptor NMUR2, NMU plays a role in the regulation of multiple systems, including energy homeostasis, stress responses, circadian rhythms, and endocrine signaling. The involvement of NMU signaling in the central regulation of important neurophysiological processes and its disturbances is a potential target for pharmacological modulation. Number of preclinical studies have proven that both modified NMU analogues such as PASR8-NMU or F4R8-NMU and designed NMUR2 agonists, for example, CPN-116, CPN-124 exhibit a distinct pharmacological activity especially when delivered transnasally. Their application can potentially be useful in the more convenient and safe treatment of obesity, eating disorders, Alzheimer's disease-related memory impairment, alcohol addiction, and sleep disturbances. Accumulating findings suggest that pharmacomodulation of the central NMU signaling may be a promising strategy in the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders.
