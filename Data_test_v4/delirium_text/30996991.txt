30996991|a|Several lines of evidence point to a compromised proteostasis associated with a reduction of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) activity in patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and suggest that the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is an important player in the game. Inspired also by many reports, underlining the presence of ubiquitin (Ub) in the amyloid plaques of AD brains, here we set out to test whether Ub may bind the Abeta peptide and have any effect on its clearance pathways. By using an integrated array of MALDI-TOF/UPLC-HRMS, fluorescence, NMR, SPR, Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and molecular dynamics studies, we consistently demonstrated that Abeta40 binds Ub with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and K d in the high micromolar range. In particular, we show that the N-terminal domain of the Abeta peptide (through residues D1, E3 and R5) interacts with the C-terminal tail of Ub (involving residues K63 and E64), inducing the central region of Abeta (14HQKLVFFAEDVGSNK28) to adopt a mixed alpha-helix/beta-turn structure. ELISA assays, carried out in neuroblastoma cell lysates, suggest that Abeta competitively binds Ub also in the presence of the entire pool of cytosolic Ub binding proteins. Ub-bound Abeta has a lower tendency to aggregate into amyloid-like fibrils and is more slowly degraded by the Insulin Degrading Enzyme (IDE). Finally, we observe that the water soluble fragment Abeta1-16 significantly inhibits Ub chain growth reactions. These results evidence how the non-covalent interaction between Abeta peptides and Ub may have relevant effects on the regulation of the upstream events of the UPS and pave the way to future in vivo studies addressing the role played by Abeta peptide in the malfunction of proteome maintenance occurring in AD.
