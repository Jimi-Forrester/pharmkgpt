36788800|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), a major cerebral complication of sepsis, occurs in 70% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This condition can cause serious impairment of consciousness and is associated with a high mortality rate. Thus far, several experimental screenings and radiological techniques (e.g., electroencephalography) have been used for the non-invasive assessment of the structure and function of the brain in patients with SAE. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of SAE is complicated and remains unclear. In the present article, we reviewed the currently available literature on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology, diagnosis, and management of SAE. However, currently, there is no ideal pharmacological treatment for SAE. Treatment targeting mitochondrial dysfunction may be useful in the management of SAE.
