30680020|t|Contrast of diagnostic value between IL-17 combined with IL-18 and CT angiography in carotid atherosclerosis.
30680020|a|Diagnostic value between IL-17 combined with IL-18 and CT angiography in carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated. A total of 158 patients with suspected carotid artery stenosis in People's Hospital of Dongying from March 2014 to April 2017 were selected as the subjects. One hundred and two patients with carotid atherosclerosis were selected as the atherosclerosis group, the other 56 patients with no obvious carotid artery abnormalities were selected as the disease control group. In addition, there were 100 healthy subjects selected as the healthy control group. The level of IL-17 and IL-18 in peripheral blood of all the subjects was detected by ELISA. The ROC curve was used to analyze the diagnostic value of IL-17 combined with IL-18 and CT angiography in atherosclerosis. The levels of IL-17 and IL-18 in the three groups were different (P<0.05). The level of IL-17 and IL-18 in the atherosclerosis and disease control groups was higher than that in the healthy control group, and the level of IL-17 and IL-18 in the atherosclerosis was higher than that in the disease control group. The sensitivity of IL-17 or IL-18 was less than the coincidence rate and sensitivity of IL-17 combined with IL-18 as diagnostic criteria, and AUC was also less than AUC of IL-17 combined with IL-18. The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of IL-17 combined with IL-18 in the diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis were not significantly different from CT angiography (P>0.05), but the specificity was obviously lower than CT angiography (P<0.05). The diagnosis of atherosclerosis of IL-17 combined with IL-18 was more accurate, it can improve the diagnostic efficiency of atherosclerosis and be used as a routine method for screening the atherosclerosis.
