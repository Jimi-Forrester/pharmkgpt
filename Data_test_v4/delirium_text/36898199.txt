36898199|t|Polypharmacy in Older Adults: A Case Study.
36898199|a|Polypharmacy is defined as concurrent use of multiple drugs for one or more conditions. The occurrence of polypharmacy in vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly, is frequent. Increased incidents of adverse drug reactions and drug-drug interactions plus high costs are not offset by a noticeable improvement in outcome. The practice of polypharmacy persists despite frequent adverse outcomes and reduced effectiveness. We present a case in which an elderly woman presented with falls and delirium. She was taking multiple medications for anxiety and depression in addition to several psychoactive medications for pain, restless leg syndrome, muscle spasms, blood pressure and many nonpsychoactive medications for other conditions. In total, she was taking 24 medications, many of which were likely contributing to her presenting problems.
