35370858|t|OGDHL Variant rs2293239: A Potential Genetic Driver of Chinese Familial Depressive Disorder.
35370858|a|Depressive disorders are a severe psychiatric and social problem that affect more than 4% of the global population. Depressive disorders have explicit hereditary characteristics; however, the precise driving genetic force behind these disorders has not yet been clearly illustrated. In the present study, we recruited a three-generation Chinese pedigree in which 5 of 17 members had long-term depression. We conducted whole-exome sequencing to identify the genetic mutation profiles of the family, and a list of susceptible genetic variations that were highly associated with depression onset was revealed via multiple omics analysis. In particular, a non-synonymous single nucleotide variation in the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL) gene, rs2293239 (p.Asn725Ser), was identified as one of the major driving genetic forces for depression onset in the family. This variant causes an important conformational change in the transketolase domain of OGDHL, thus reducing its binding affinity with the cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate and eventually resulting in the abnormal accumulation of glutamate in the brain. Brain imaging analysis further linked the rs2293239 variant with an enlarged amygdala and cerebellum in depressive family members. In summary, the present study enhances the current genetic understanding of depressive disorders. It also provides new options for prioritizing better clinical therapeutic regimens, as well as identifying a new protein target for the design of highly specific drugs to treat depressive disorders.
