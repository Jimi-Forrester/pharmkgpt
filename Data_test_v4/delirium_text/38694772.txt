38694772|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common postoperative neurological complication that can lead to a variety of postoperative complications. At present, the pathogenesis of POD is unclear. This study aims to explore the relationship between serum prealbumin and serum albumin and POD and whether serum prealbumin and serum albumin influence POD through POD core pathology. Objective: We enrolled 500 Chinese Han patients between September 2020 to January 2023. We analyzed the risk and protective factors of POD using the multivariate logistic regression. We also assessed the predictive power of serum prealbumin, serum albumin, and both in combination with CSF POD biomarkers. We used Stata MP16.0. to examine whether the association between serum prealbumin and serum albumin and POD was mediated by CSF POD biomarkers, and conducted an internal validation study to verify the accuracy of the combination of serum prealbumin + serum albumin + CSF POD biomarkers for predicting POD. The model was visualized using ROC curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). DynNom and Shiny packages were used to create an online calculator. Ten patients who had POD occurring from February 2023 to October 2023 were selected for internal verification. Results: Finally, a total of 364 patients were included in our study. Levels of serum prealbumin, serum albumin in the POD group were lower than those in the NPOD group. The lever of serum prealbumin, serum albumin were protective factors for POD. The relationship between serum prealbumin, serum albumin and POD was partially mediated by T-tau (12.28%) and P-tau (20.61%). The model combining serum prealbumin and serum albumin and POD biomarkers exhibited a relatively better discriminatory ability to predict POD. DCA also showed that the combination of serum prealbumin and serum albumin and POD biomarkers brought high predictive benefits to patients. The dynamic online calculator can accurately predict the occurrence of POD in the internal validation study. Conclusion: Preoperative low serum prealbumin and serum albumin levels were the preoperative risk factors for POD, which is partly mediated by T-tau and P-tau. The model combining serum prealbumin and serum albumin and CSF POD biomarkers can accurately predict the occurrence of POD.
