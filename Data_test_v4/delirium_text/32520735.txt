32520735|t|Comparison of Amyloid in Cerebrospinal Fluid, Brain Imaging, and Autopsy in a Case of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
32520735|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) are the 2 main Alzheimer disease amyloid biomarkers that have been validated in neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease cases. Although many studies have shown concordance of amyloid positivity or negativity between CSF Abeta1-42 and amyloid PET, several studies also reported discrepancies between these 2 Abeta biomarkers. We conducted a comparison of CSF Abeta1-42 level, amyloid PET, and autopsy findings in a case with progressive supranuclear palsy in which biomarker acquisition and postmortem pathologic examination were conducted almost at the same time. Our case with antemortem CSF Abeta1-42 (+)/amyloid PET (-) who was pathologically confirmed with Abeta pathology in the cerebral cortex may indicate CSF Abeta1-42 is more sensitive for assessing in vivo Abeta than amyloid PET.
