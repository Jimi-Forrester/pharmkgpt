9333984|t|[Differential diagnosis and therapy of delirium].
9333984|a|Delirium (i.e., acute confusional state) is a frequent syndrome due to different exogenous (physical, chemical or biological) factors. The prevalence of delirium increases with higher age (e.g., signs indicative of dementia) and particularly in those patients with severe somatic illness. Symptoms of delirium are considerably uniform irrespective of different etiological causes. However, delirium is frequently underrecognised which may lead to several complications. The article summarizes data on symptomatology, aetiology and pathogenesis of delirium. In addition syndromes sharing phenomenology similar with delirium are discussed and treatment recommended.
