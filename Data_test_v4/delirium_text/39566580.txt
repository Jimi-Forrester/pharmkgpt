39566580|t|Calcium Balance through Mutual Orchestrated Inter-organelle Communication: A Pleiotropic Target for Combating Alzheimer's Disease.
39566580|a|Dysfunctional intraneuronal organelles in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) propel aberrant calcium handling, triggering molecular miscommunication within organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. This disruption in organelle function not only impairs cellular homeostasis but also exacerbates neurodegenerative processes involving the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau, amplifying the disease's vicious cycle. In this review, the concept of Mutual Orchestrated Inter-organelle Communication (MOIC) proposes potential therapeutic avenues for restoring Ca2+ homeostasis in AD, offering a theoretical framework for developing disease-modifying treatments. The intricate nature of AD necessitates a shift towards combination therapies targeting MOIC-associated pathways, presenting a more effective approach than monotherapy.
