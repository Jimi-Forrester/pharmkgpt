37303425|t|Late-Onset Intracranial Hemorrhage Presenting as Refractory Hyponatremia: A Case Report.
37303425|a|Here, we report a case of refractory hyponatremia and delayed intracranial hemorrhage following a head injury. A 70-year-old male patient was admitted with complaints of left chest pain and light-headedness after a fall. Hyponatremia recurred despite the correction with intravenous saline. Head computed tomography revealed a chronic subdural hematoma. The subsequent introduction of tolvaptan improved hyponatremia and disorientation. Delayed intracranial hemorrhage is a differential cause of refractory hyponatremia after head contusion. This case is clinically relevant because (i) the diagnostic delay of late-onset intracranial hemorrhage is common but fatal, and (ii) refractory hyponatremia can be a hint of late-onset intracranial hemorrhage.
