3984611|t|[Acoasmatic hallucinosis in tardive schizophrenia].
3984611|a|A study of late schizophrenia manifested in the syndrome of involutional paranoid has allowed the identification of the clinical variant of such psychoses (44 observations) differing from the classical forms in that the clinical picture was predominated by elementary acoustic hallucinations (acoasms). The phenomenological analysis has established that the formation of the clinical picture is determined by acoasms and also the resulting delirium of imagination and delirious interpretations. Two major variants of such psychoses have been specified and described ("the syndrome of acoasmatic hallucinosis" and "the hallucinational-delirious syndrome with the predominance of acoasms"). It has been established that each of these syndromal variants may determine the picture of the disease throughout its course or be one of the sequential stages of its development.
