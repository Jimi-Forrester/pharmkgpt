1624710|t|The dynamics of caregiving for a demented elder among black and white families.
1624710|a|Caregiving dynamics were studied in a sample of 157 Black caregivers of elders suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By comparison with White caregivers (N = 472), there were fewer spouses and more nonspouse-nonchild caregivers among Blacks. With control exercised on background and socioeconomic variables, race differences in caregiving appraisal were found. Blacks showed more favorable scores on indices of traditional caregiving ideology, caregiving as intrusion, caregiving satisfaction, and caregiving burden. Interactions between race and background factors increased explained variance in caregiving appraisal only slightly. A cultural explanation of the more favorable appraisals of Blacks was sought in the caregiving ideology factor, but this dimension was not associated with caregiving outcomes. The overall hypothesized two-factor model was generally consistent with the observed covariance structures of both Black and White caregivers. Within both White and Black groups, caregivers who provided more care showed simultaneously more satisfaction and more burden.
