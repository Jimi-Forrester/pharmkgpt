9045995|t|Hippocampus in delay eyeblink classical conditioning: essential for nefiracetam amelioration of learning in older rabbits.
9045995|a|Rabbits acquire conditioned responses (CRs) normally with bilateral removal of the hippocampus, but alterations of the intact hippocampus can affect the rate of acquisition. The cognition-enhancing drug, nefiracetam ameliorated the acquisition of CRs in older rabbits, protected membrane dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 neurons following oxygen and glucose deprivation, and promoted the release of diverse neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine. Because the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system is demonstrated to be involved in eyeblink conditioning, this experiment was undertaken to explore whether nefiracetam ameliorates conditioning via the hippocampus. Data from 53 rabbits of a mean age of 28 months were tested under two drug conditions (10 or 0 mg/kg nefiracetam) and 4 lesion conditions (bilateral hippocampectomy, bilateral neocortical removal, sham surgery, no surgery). The three groups of nefiracetam-treated rabbits with intact hippocampus acquired CRs more rapidly than the vehicle-treated groups, but rabbits with bilateral hippocampectomy treated with nefiracetam learned like vehicle-treated rabbits. Results suggest that nefiracetam ameliorates learning via the hippocampus. Because of the parallels between conditioning in rabbits with disrupted hippocampal cholinergic systems and conditioning in Alzheimer's disease (AD), these results suggest that nefiracetam may ameliorate conditioning in AD as it ameliorates conditioning in older rabbits.
