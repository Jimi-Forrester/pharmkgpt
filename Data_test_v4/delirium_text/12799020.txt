12799020|a|Neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to involve direct toxicity of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and excitotoxicity involving NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and altered Ca(2+) dynamics. Inflammation agents produced by microglia or astrocytes and associated with senile plaques such as the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) could also contribute. To investigate this possibility, neuronal damage (lactate dehydrogenase assay, LDH, assay) was measured in cultures of rodent cortical neurons chronically treated with IL-6, Abeta or Abeta plus IL-6 and acutely treated with NMDA. Both Abeta and NMDA produced neuronal damage and this effect was larger with combined treatment. IL-6 did not produce significant neuronal damage but the largest neuronal damage was observed in cultures exposed to all three factors. IL-6 and Abeta enhanced Ca(2+) responses to NMDA and combined treatment produced the largest effect. These results are consistent with a role for interactions between Abeta, NMDA and IL-6 in the neuronal loss in AD.
