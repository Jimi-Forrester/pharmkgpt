35379177|t|Cognitive impairment and edentulism among older adults: an observational study using claims data.
35379177|a|BACKGROUND: The scientific link between mastication strength and cognitive function has not yet been strongly corroborated in population studies. Utilizing large-scale claims, we aim to investigate the association between edentulism and cognitive impairment in older American adults. METHODS: Using de-identified claims from a commercial insurer from 2015-2019, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using multilevel regression models to evaluate the association between denture status and clinically diagnosed cognitive impairment. Secondary analysis included symptomatic cognitive impairment in the outcome. RESULTS: Adjusting for individual-level risk factors, denture status was significantly associated with clinical cognitive impairment with odds ratios of 1.13 (95%CI: 1.02-1.25) and 1.26, (95%CI: 1.09-1.45) for complete dentures on one or both jaws, respectively. Including symptomatic cognitive impairment in the analysis did not substantially change our fundamental findings. CONCLUSION: Prevention and treatment of oral diseases should be considered a key component in preserving the overall wellness of older adults.
