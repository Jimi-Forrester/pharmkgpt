30770466|a|The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit is one of the earliest sites of cortical pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visuospatial memory paradigms that are mediated by the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit may offer a means to detect memory impairment during the early stages of AD. In this study, we developed a 4-min visuospatial memory paradigm called VisMET (Visuospatial Memory Eye-Tracking Task) that passively assesses memory using eye movements rather than explicit memory judgements. We had 296 control or memory-impaired participants view a set of images followed by a modified version of the images with either an object removed, or a new object added. Healthy controls spent significantly more time viewing these manipulations compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD. Using a logistic regression model, the amount of time that individuals viewed these manipulations could predict cognitive impairment and disease status with an out of sample area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.85. Based on these results, VisMET offers a passive, sensitive, and efficient memory paradigm capable of detecting objective memory impairment and predicting cognitive and disease status.
