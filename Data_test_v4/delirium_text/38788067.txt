38788067|t|A Scoping Review of Alzheimers Disease Hypotheses: An Array of Uni- and Multi-Factorial Theories.
38788067|a|Background: There is a common agreement that Alzheimers disease (AD) is inherently complex; otherwise, a general disagreement remains on its etiological underpinning, with numerous alternative hypotheses having been proposed. Objective: To perform a scoping review of original manuscripts describing hypotheses and theories of AD published in the past decades. Results: We reviewed 131 original manuscripts that fulfilled our inclusion criteria out of more than 13,807 references extracted from open databases. Each entry was characterized as having a single or multifactorial focus and assigned to one of 15 theoretical groupings. Impact was tracked using open citation tools. Results: Three stages can be discerned in terms of hypotheses generation, with three quarter of studies proposing a hypothesis characterized as being single-focus. The most important theoretical groupings were the Amyloid group, followed by Metabolism and Mitochondrial dysfunction, then Infections and Cerebrovascular. Lately, evidence towards Genetics and especially Gut/Brain interactions came to the fore. Conclusions: When viewed together, these multi-faceted reports reinforce the notion that AD affects multiple sub-cellular, cellular, anatomical, and physiological systems at the same time but at varying degree between individuals. The challenge of providing a comprehensive view of all systems and their interactions remains, alongside ways to manage this inherent complexity.
