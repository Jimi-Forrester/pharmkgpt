30606220|a|BACKGROUND: For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver resection is a classical curative modality, despite its technical complexity. The incidence of HCC in the oldest old people (aged >= 85 years) is rising along with the global increase in life expectancy. Currently, no report has addressed liver resection for HCC in this aged population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 1889 patients receiving curative liver resection for newly diagnosed HCC from 1992 to 2016. At the time of operation, 1858 of them were aged < 85 years (group A), and 31 were aged >= 85 years (group B). Another 18 oldest old patients, whose HCC was considered resectable but were not operated on due to the patient's refusal, served as the control group (group C). The clinicopathological characteristics and early and long-term outcomes were compared between groups A and B. All associated co-morbidities of the patients were well-treated before liver resection. The overall survival (OS) rates were also compared between groups B and C. RESULT: Group B had a significantly higher incidence of associated co-morbidities and hepatitis C infection. Postoperative complication rates and 90-day mortality rates after liver resection did not differ between groups A and B (p = 0.834 and p = 1.000, respectively), though group B had a longer postoperative stay (p = 0.001). In groups A and B, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 29.7% and 22.6% (p = 0.163), respectively, and their overall survival rates were 43.5% and 35.5% (p = 0.086). The overall survival rate of group B was significantly different from group C (35.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite a longer postoperative recovery period, liver resection for HCC in the oldest old patients may be justified if co-morbidities are well controlled.
