36624852|t|Analysis of Cases with Cerebrospinal Fluid Characteristics Similar to Tuberculous Meningitis.
36624852|a|Purpose: The diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is difficult and relies on the patient's clinical presentation and initial cerebrospinal fluid testing. Treatment outcomes for some patients with early consideration of TBM meningitis are often poor. Patients and Methods. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 24 non-TBM patients whose early changes of cerebrospinal fluid were similar to those of TBM through the second-generation cerebrospinal fluid sequencing technology. Results: All patients included in this study had an acute onset, including 5 patients with a history of upper respiratory tract infection, 9 patients with fever, 6 patients with headache, 5 patients with psychiatric symptoms, 6 patients with cognitive impairment, 9 patients with signs of meningeal irritation, and 6 patients with seizures. Sixteen patients presented with altered content and level of consciousness during their admission. The leukocyte counts (median, 124.0 x 106/L) and total protein concentrations (median, 1300 mg/L) were higher than normal reference values in all patients, whereas glucose (median, 1.345 mmol/L) and chloride concentration values (average, 111.7 +- 5.2 mmol/L) were lower than normal reference values. The patients included 2 cases of Liszt's meningitis, 2 cases of Brucella infection in the CNS, 4 cases of Varicella zoster virus encephalitis, 2 cases of human herpes simplex virus type 1, 2 cases of lupus encephalopathy, 2 cases of anti-NMDAR receptor encephalitis, 2 cases of meningeal carcinomatosis, 5 cases of cryptococcal meningitis, 2 cases of CNS sarcoidosis, and a case of invasive Rhizopus oryzae infection. All patients were tested for NGS in cerebrospinal fluid. Eight patients were diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, meningeal carcinomatosis, lupus encephalopathy, and CNS sarcoidosis. Nine patients experienced death; 15 patients had a good prognosis and left no significant sequelae. Conclusion: The analysis of patients with TBM-like cerebrospinal fluid changes will help improve the diagnostic accuracy of the disease and reduce misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.
