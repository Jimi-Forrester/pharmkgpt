35889221|t|In Vitro and In Silico Investigation of Diterpenoid Alkaloids Isolated from Delphinium chitralense.
35889221|a|This study reports the isolation of three new C20 diterpenoid alkaloids, Chitralinine A-C (1-3) from the aerial parts of Delphinium chitralense. Their structures were established on the basis of latest spectral techniques and single crystal X-rays crystallographic studies of chitralinine A described basic skeleton of these compounds. All the isolated Compounds (1-3) showed strong, competitive type inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in comparison to standard allanzanthane and galanthamine however, chitralinine-C remained the most potent with IC50 value of 11.64 +- 0.08 muM against AChE, and 24.31 +- 0.33 muM against BChE, respectively. The molecular docking reflected a binding free energy of -16.400 K Cal-mol-1 for chitralinine-C, having strong interactions with active site residues, TYR334, ASP72, SER122, and SER200. The overall findings suggest that these new diterpenoid alkaloids could serve as lead drugs against dementia-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease.
