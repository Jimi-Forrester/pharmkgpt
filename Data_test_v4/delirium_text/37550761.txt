37550761|t|Impacts of baseline biomarkers on cognitive trajectories in subjective cognitive decline: the CoSCo prospective cohort study.
37550761|a|BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the rates of cognitive decline are variable according to underlying pathologies and biomarker status. We conducted an observational study and aimed to investigate baseline characteristics and biomarkers related with cognitive declines in SCD. Our study also assessed whether SCD participants showed different cognitive and biomarker trajectories according to baseline amyloid deposition. METHODS: This study is a part of a longitudinal cohort study conducted in multi-centers in South Korea between 2018 and 2021. Individuals (>= 60 years old) with persistent cognitive complaint despite of normal cognitive functions were eligible for the study. All participants underwent neuropsychological tests, florbetaben PET scans, plasma amyloid markers, and brain MRI scans. Annual follow-up evaluations included neuropsychological tests and assessments for clinical progressions. Regional brain volumetry and amyloid burden represented by PET-based standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were measured. We compared cognitive and brain atrophic changes over 24 months between amyloid positive-SCD (Abeta + SCD) and amyloid negative-SCD (Abeta-SCD) groups. Baseline factors associated with cognitive outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 120 participants with SCD were enrolled and 107 completed follow-up evaluations. Abeta + SCD participants (n = 20, 18.5%) were older and more frequently APOE4 carriers compared with Abeta-SCD participants (n = 87). Baseline cognitive scores were not different between the two groups, except the Seoul Verbal Learning Test (SVLT) scores showing lower scores in the Abeta + SCD group. After 24 months, plasma amyloid markers were higher, and regional volumes (entorhinal, hippocampal, and pallidum) were smaller in the Abeta + SCD participants compared with Abeta-SCD participants adjusted by age, sex, and baseline volumes. SVLT delayed recall and controlled oral word association test (COWAT) scores indicated more declines in Abeta + SCD participants. Baseline left entorhinal volumes were related to verbal memory decline, while baseline frontal volumes and global SUVR values were related to frontal functional decline. CONCLUSION: Abeta + SCD participants showed more cognitive decline and medial temporal atrophic changes during 24 months. Baseline neurodegeneration and amyloid burden were related with future cognitive trajectories in SCD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered at CRIS (KCT0003397).
