39004677|t|Early oxidative stress and DNA damage in Abeta-burdened hippocampal neurons in an Alzheimer's-like transgenic rat model.
39004677|a|Oxidative stress is a key contributor to AD pathology. However, the earliest role of pre-plaque neuronal oxidative stress, remains elusive. Using laser microdissected hippocampal neurons extracted from McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rats we found that intraneuronal amyloid beta (iAbeta)-burdened neurons had increased expression of genes related to oxidative stress and DNA damage responses including Ercc2, Fancc, Sod2, Gsr, and Idh1. DNA damage was further evidenced by increased neuronal levels of XPD (Ercc2) and gammaH2AX foci, indicative of DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs), and by increased expression of Ercc6, Rad51, and Fen1, and decreased Sirt6 in hippocampal homogenates. We also found increased expression of synaptic plasticity genes (Grin2b (NR2B), CamkIIalpha, Bdnf, c-fos, and Homer1A) and increased protein levels of TOP2beta. Our findings indicate that early accumulation of iAbeta, prior to Abeta plaques, is accompanied by incipient oxidative stress and DSBs that may arise directly from oxidative stress or from maladaptive synaptic plasticity.
