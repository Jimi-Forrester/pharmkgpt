34676803|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is prevalent among hospitalised patients, especially in critically ill patients. Preventing delirium by recognising its modifiable risk factors could improve life quality, decrease mortality and restrain its devastating consequences. METHOD: We investigated 50 patients who had been hospitalised in the general ICU and monitored them for developing delirium. We employed CAM and CAM-ICU Scales to assess delirium, RASS score to determine the consciousness level, HADS questionnaire for anxiety and depression, and the demographic data questionnaire. RESULTS: We found that 20% of ICU patients developed delirium and found a meaningful correlation between the incident delirium, older ages, visual impairment, and higher anxiety and depression scores (HADS) of first and second days of hospitalisation. By utilising logistic regression, we found that older ages, visual impairment, higher anxiety and depression scores (HADS) of the first day of hospitalisation were statistically significant to predict the risk model of developing delirium. CONCLUSION: Depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with higher odds of transitioning to delirium; so, at the admission time, it may be useful to screen patients for the symptoms of affective disorders, particularly, who are at higher risks for developing delirium.
