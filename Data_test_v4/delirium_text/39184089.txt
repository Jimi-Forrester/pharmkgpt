39184089|a|Although human cerebellum is known to be neuropathologically impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD), the cell type-specific transcriptional and epigenomic changes that contribute to this pathology are not well understood. Here, we report single-nucleus multiome (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) analysis of 103,861 nuclei isolated from cerebellum from 9 human cases of AD/ADRD and 8 controls, and with frontal cortex of 6 AD donors for additional comparison. Using peak-to-gene linkage analysis, we identified 431,834 significant linkages between gene expression and cell subtype-specific chromatin accessibility regions enriched for candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs). These cCREs were associated with AD/ADRD-specific transcriptomic changes and disease-related gene regulatory networks, especially for RAR Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA) and E74 Like ETS Transcription Factor 1 (ELF1) in cerebellar Purkinje cells and granule cells, respectively. Trajectory analysis of granule cell populations further identified disease-relevant transcription factors, such as RORA, and their regulatory targets. Finally, we prioritized two likely causal genes, including Seizure Related 6 Homolog Like 2 (SEZ6L2) in Purkinje cells and KAT8 Regulatory NSL Complex Subunit 1 (KANSL1) in granule cells, through integrative analysis of cCREs derived from snATAC-seq, genome-wide AD/ADRD loci, and Hi-C looping data. This first cell subtype-specific regulatory landscape in the human cerebellum identified here offer novel genomic and epigenomic insights into the neuropathology and pathobiology of AD/ADRD and other neurological disorders if broadly applied.
