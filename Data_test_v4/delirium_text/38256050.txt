38256050|a|Over the past 20 years, stem cell therapy has been considered a promising option for treating numerous disorders, in particular, neurodegenerative disorders. Stem cells exert neuroprotective and neurodegenerative benefits through different mechanisms, such as the secretion of neurotrophic factors, cell replacement, the activation of endogenous stem cells, and decreased neuroinflammation. Several sources of stem cells have been proposed for transplantation and the restoration of damaged tissue. Over recent decades, intensive research has focused on gestational stem cells considered a novel resource for cell transplantation therapy. The present review provides an update on the recent preclinical/clinical applications of gestational stem cells for the treatment of protein-misfolding diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, further studies should be encouraged to translate this promising therapeutic approach into the clinical setting.
