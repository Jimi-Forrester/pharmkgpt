37577527|t|Alzheimer's disease linked Abeta42 exerts product feedback inhibition on gamma-secretase impairing downstream cell signaling.
37577527|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Abeta42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for gamma-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in Abeta42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on gamma-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events. We show that human Abeta42 peptides, but neither murine Abeta42 nor human Abeta17-42 (p3), inhibit gamma-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, Abeta42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems. Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in Abeta42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the gamma-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address Abeta toxicity in the context of gamma-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.
