38992700|a|BACKGROUND: Despite extensive studies on the neurobiological correlates of traumatic brain injury (TBI), little is known about its molecular determinants on long-term consequences, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Here, we carried out behavioural studies and an extensive biomolecular analysis, including inflammatory cytokines, gene expression and the combination of LC-HRMS and MALDI-MS Imaging to elucidate the targeted metabolomics and lipidomics spatiotemporal alterations of brains from wild-type and APP-SWE mice, a genetic model of AD, at the presymptomatic stage, subjected to mild TBI. RESULTS: We found that brain injury does not affect cognitive performance in APP-SWE mice. However, we detected an increase of key hallmarks of AD, including Abeta1-42 levels and BACE1 expression, in the cortices of traumatized transgenic mice. Moreover, significant changes in the expanded endocannabinoid (eCB) system, or endocannabinoidome (eCBome), occurred, including increased levels of the endocannabinoid 2-AG in APP-SWE mice in both the cortex and hippocampus, and N-acylserotonins, detected for the first time in the brain. The gene expression of enzymes for the biosynthesis and inactivation of eCBs and eCB-like mediators, and some of their main molecular targets, also underwent significant changes. We also identified the formation of heteromers between cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and serotonergic 2A (5HT2A) receptors, whose levels increased in the cortex of APP-SWE mTBI mice, possibly contributing to the exacerbated pathophysiology of AD induced by the trauma. CONCLUSIONS: Mild TBI induces biochemical changes in AD genetically predisposed mice and the eCBome may play a role in the pathogenetic link between brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders also by interacting with the serotonergic system.
