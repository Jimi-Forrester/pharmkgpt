36210084|t|Polypharmacy in the Homebound Population.
36210084|a|The number of homebound elders has risen dramatically in the past decade and was accelerated by the Sars-Cov-2 COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals generally have 5 or more chronic conditions, take 6 or more medications, and are at elevated risk for functional decline. Polypharmacy constitutes a major burden for these individuals, putting them at risk for medication nonadherence, medication errors, medication interactions, and reduced quality of life. A team-based approach may help these elders manage medications more effectively.
