15554751|t|Rivastigmine in frontotemporal dementia: an open-label study.
15554751|a|OBJECTIVE: This preliminary open-label study aims to investigate the effects of rivastigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), in 20 patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study subjects were men and women 60-75 years of age diagnosed with probable FTD. The rivastigmine group received doses of 3-9 mg/day. The control group included matched patients receiving antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and selegiline (deprenyl). All patients completed a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Rivastigmine treatment was well tolerated. At 12 months, there was a general amelioration of behavioural changes as demonstrated by reductions in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (p<0.001 vs baseline and control), Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (p<0.001 vs baseline and control) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia scores (p<0.05 vs baseline, p<0.001 vs control) in the rivastigmine group. Caregiver burden was reduced, as shown by reduced Relative Stress Scale scores (p<0.001 vs baseline and control). Mean scores on outcome measures evaluating executive function stabilised in the rivastigmine group (p<0.05 vs controls). Rivastigmine did not prevent the disease-related deterioration of cognition as assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. CONCLUSION: In this open-label study, rivastigmine-treated patients were less behaviourally impaired, and caregiver burden was reduced, at 12 months, compared with baseline. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors in FTD warrants further research.
