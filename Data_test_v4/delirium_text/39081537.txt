39081537|t|Polyoxometalates: metallodrug agents for combating amyloid aggregation.
39081537|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects ~50 million people globally. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, a predominant pathological feature of AD, plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis. In this respect, Abeta has been regarded as a highly promising therapeutic target for AD treatment. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a novel class of metallodrugs being developed as modulators of Abeta aggregation, owing to their negative charge, polarity, and three-dimensional structure. Unlike traditional discrete inorganic complexes, POMs contain tens to hundreds of metal atoms, showcasing remarkable tunability and diversity in nuclearities, sizes, and shapes. The easily adjustable and structurally variable nature of POMs allows for their favorable interactions with Abeta. This mini-review presents a balanced overview of recent progress in using POMs to mitigate amyloidosis. Clear correlations between anti-amyloid activities and structural features of POMs are also elaborated in detail. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects of POMs in combating AD.
