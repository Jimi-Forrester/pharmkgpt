36809742|t|Axonal and presynaptic FMRP: Localization, signal, and functional implications.
36809742|a|Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) binds a selected set of mRNAs and proteins to guide neural circuit assembly and regulate synaptic plasticity. Loss of FMRP is responsible for Fragile X syndrome, a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized with auditory processing problems and social difficulty. FMRP actions in synaptic formation, maturation, and plasticity are site-specific among the four compartments of a synapse: presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, astrocytes, and extracellular matrix. This review summarizes advancements in understanding FMRP localization, signals, and functional roles in axons and presynaptic terminals.
