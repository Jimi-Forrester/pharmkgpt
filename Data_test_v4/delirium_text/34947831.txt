34947831|a|NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO) is an antioxidant flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of highly reactive quinone metabolites by employing NAD(P)H as an electron donor. There are two NQO enzymes-NQO1 and NQO2-in mammalian systems. In particular, NQO1 exerts many biological activities, including antioxidant activities, anti-inflammatory effects, and interactions with tumor suppressors. Moreover, several recent studies have revealed the promising roles of NQO1 in protecting against cardiovascular damage and related diseases, such as dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the molecular regulation and biochemical properties of NQO1, and describe the potential beneficial roles of NQO1 in diseases associated with oxidative stress.
