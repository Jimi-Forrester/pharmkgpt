35584632|t|Quantification and targeting of elusive neurotoxic amyloid oligomers.
35584632|a|A study by Kass et al.1 aims to understand the size distribution of amyloid beta oligomers in postmortem brain tissues from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD mouse models. Moreover, they show a dose-dependent oligomer elimination by the RD2 compound.
