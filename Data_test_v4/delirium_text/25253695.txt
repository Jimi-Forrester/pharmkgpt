25253695|t|The Alzheimer disease protective mutation A2T modulates kinetic and thermodynamic properties of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation.
25253695|a|Missense mutations in alanine 673 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which corresponds to the second alanine of the amyloid beta (Abeta) sequence, have dramatic impact on the risk for Alzheimer disease; A2V is causative, and A2T is protective. Assuming a crucial role of amyloid-Abeta in neurodegeneration, we hypothesized that both A2V and A2T mutations cause distinct changes in Abeta properties that may at least partially explain these completely different phenotypes. Using human APP-overexpressing primary neurons, we observed significantly decreased Abeta production in the A2T mutant along with an enhanced Abeta generation in the A2V mutant confirming earlier data from non-neuronal cell lines. More importantly, thioflavin T fluorescence assays revealed that the mutations, while having little effect on Abeta42 peptide aggregation, dramatically change the properties of the Abeta40 pool with A2V accelerating and A2T delaying aggregation of the Abeta peptides. In line with the kinetic data, Abeta A2T demonstrated an increase in the solubility at equilibrium, an effect that was also observed in all mixtures of the A2T mutant with the wild type Abeta40. We propose that in addition to the reduced beta-secretase cleavage of APP, the impaired propensity to aggregate may be part of the protective effect conferred by A2T substitution. The interpretation of the protective effect of this mutation is thus much more complicated than proposed previously.
