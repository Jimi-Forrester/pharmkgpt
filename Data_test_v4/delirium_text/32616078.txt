32616078|a|BACKGROUND: The hippocampus reportedly plays a crucial role in memory. However, examining individual human hippocampal-subfield function remains challenging because of their small sizes and convoluted structures. Here, we identified hippocampal subregions involved in memory types (implicit and explicit memory) and stages (encoding and retrieval). METHODS: We modified the serial reaction time task to examine four memory types, i.e. implicit encoding, explicit encoding, implicit retrieval, and explicit retrieval. During this task, 7-T functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare brain activity evoked by these memory types. RESULTS: We found hippocampal activation according to all memory types and stages and identified that the hippocampus subserves both implicit and explicit memory processing. Moreover, we confirmed that cornu ammonis (CA) regions 1-3 were implicated in both memory encoding and retrieval, whereas the subiculum was implicated only in memory retrieval. We also found that CA 1-3 was activated more for explicit than implicit memory. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate human hippocampal-subfield functioning underlying memory and may support future investigations into hippocampal-subfield functioning in health and neurodegenerative disease.
