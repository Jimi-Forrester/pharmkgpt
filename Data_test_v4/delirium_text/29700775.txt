29700775|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impaired clearance of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) due to disrupted tight junction and transporter proteins is the prominent cause of disease progression. Somatostatin (SST) blocks the aggregation of Abeta and inflammation whereas reduction of SST levels in the CSF and brain tissue is associated with impaired cognitive function and memory loss. However, the role of SST in preservation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and functionality in Abeta-induced toxicity is not known. In the present study using human CMEC/D3 cells, we demonstrate that SST prevents Abeta-induced BBB permeability by regulating LRP1 and RAGE expression and improving the disrupted tight junction proteins. Furthermore, SST abrogates Abeta-induced JNK phosphorylation and expression of MMP2. Taken together, results presented here suggest that SST might serve as a therapeutic intervention in AD via targeting multiple pathways responsible for neurotoxicity, impaired BBB function, and disease progression.
