36796942|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common disorder associated with cognitive impairment. Recent observations emphasize the pathogenic role of multiple factors inside and outside the central nervous system, supporting the notion that AD is a syndrome of many etiologies rather than a "heterogeneous" but ultimately unifying disease entity. Moreover, the defining pathology of amyloid and tau coexists with many others, such as alpha-synuclein, TDP-43, and others, as a rule, not an exception. Thus, an effort to shift our AD paradigm as an amyloidopathy must be reconsidered. Along with amyloid accumulation in its insoluble state, beta-amyloid is becoming depleted in its soluble, normal states, as a result of biological, toxic, and infectious triggers, requiring a shift from convergence to divergence in our approach to neurodegeneration. These aspects are reflected-in vivo-by biomarkers, which have become increasingly strategic in dementia. Similarly, synucleinopathies are primarily characterized by abnormal deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein in neurons and glial cells and, in the process, depleting the levels of the normal, soluble alpha-synuclein that the brain needs for many physiological functions. The soluble to insoluble conversion also affects other normal brain proteins, such as TDP-43 and tau, accumulating in their insoluble states in both AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The two diseases have been distinguished by the differential burden and distribution of insoluble proteins, with neocortical phosphorylated tau deposition more typical of AD and neocortical alpha-synuclein deposition peculiar to DLB. We propose a reappraisal of the diagnostic approach to cognitive impairment from convergence (based on clinicopathologic criteria) to divergence (based on what differs across individuals affected) as a necessary step for the launch of precision medicine.
