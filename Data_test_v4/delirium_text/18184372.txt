18184372|a|Intracerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition is considered to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease and is designated as a principal therapeutic target. The relationship between brain Abeta levels and clinical deficits remains, however, unclear, both in human patients and in animal models of the disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate, in a transgenic mouse model of brain amyloidosis, the consequences of Abeta deposition on basic neurological functions using a longitudinal approach. Animals were phenotyped at different ages corresponding to graded neuropathological stages (from no extracellular Abeta deposition to high amyloid loads). Sensory functions were evaluated by assessing visual and olfactory abilities and did not show any effects of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene. Motor functions were assessed using multiple experimental paradigms. Results showed that motor strength was considerably reduced in APP transgenic mice compared with control animals. No deficit was noted in a motor coordination test although APP transgenic mice displayed decreased locomotion on a stationary beam. Hypolocomotion was also observed in the standard open-field test. Measures of anxiety obtained in the elevated plus-maze show some evidence of hyperanxiety in 15-month-old transgenic mice. Some of the neurological impairments showed by APP mice had an early onset and worsened with progressive aging, in parallel to gradual accumulation of Abeta in brain parenchyma. Relationships between neuropathologically assessed amyloid loads and behavioral deficits were further explored, and it was observed that motor strength deficits were correlated with cortical amyloid burden.
