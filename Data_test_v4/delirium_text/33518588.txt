33518588|a|In this study, we developed an analytical method using LC-MS/MS for the simultaneous determination of five bile acids (BAs) that have been recently reported as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD related factors in the brain. The measurement of BAs in the brains of healthy mice led to the determination of candidate diagnostic markers for AD, such as cholic acid and deoxycholic acid, and other bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholic acid noted for the ameliorating effect on the symptoms of AD. Significant positive correlations were observed between the brain and plasma concentrations of four BAs in healthy young mice. These results indicate that the BA level in the brain may be estimated by the corresponding BA level in the plasma. Thus, our study suggested that the proposed method for the analysis of the five bile acids would aid in the diagnosis of AD or in studies that use AD model mice.
