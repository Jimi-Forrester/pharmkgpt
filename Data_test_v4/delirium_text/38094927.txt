38094927|t|Association Between Pain and Fall Worry Among Community-Dwelling Older People With Cognitive Impairment in the United States.
38094927|a|Background and Objectives: Previous studies have found that pain is associated with fall worry among community-dwelling older people. However, both pain and fall worry are poorly understood and underaddressed among community-dwelling older people with cognitive impairment (CI). It is essential to examine the association between pain and fall worry, and how sociodemographic and health characteristics may shape fall worry among this subgroup. Research Design and Methods: We used data from the 2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study (analytic sample: n = 1150 community-dwelling older people with CI; were self-interviewed; mean age: 81; age range: 65-107). The number of pain sites in the prior month was assessed by presenting a card listing common pain sites (eg, back, knees). Two questions assessed past-month fall worry, "did you worry about falling down" and "did this worry ever limit your activities." Following descriptive statistics, we fit multinomial logistic regression models to examine the associations between different pain characteristics (number of sites, severity, location) and non-activity-limiting and activity-limiting fall worry. Results: Non-activity-limiting fall worry was endorsed by 21.1% and activity-limiting fall worry by 13.6% of community-dwelling older people with CI. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and fall-worry-related covariates, multinomial logistic regression analysis found that a greater number of pain sites (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.22, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] = 1.12-1.33, p <.001) and severe pain (RRR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.12-3.75, p = .020) was associated with activity-limiting fall worry. Both lower body (knee, foot, and leg) and upper body (hand, wrist, shoulder, neck, and stomach) pain were found to be associated with a high risk of activity-limiting fall worry. Discussion and Implications: These findings suggest pain and fall worry are common among community-dwelling older people with CI and can be elicited directly from those who are communicative. Fall prevention for this population should prioritize pain management to mitigate activity-limiting fall worry because activity limitation increases the risk of falls.
