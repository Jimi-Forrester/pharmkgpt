23946654|t|Decreased Serum Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) in Individuals with Bipolar Disorder Normalizes after Zinc and Anti-oxidant Therapy.
23946654|a|AIM: To assess serum HGF concentration in individuals with bipolar disorder and investigate the efficacy of zinc therapy on these levels. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum from 35 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 19 age and gender similar controls were tested for HGF concentration using ELISAs, and copper and zinc plasma levels using inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: HGF serum levels of individuals with bipolar disorder were significantly lower than age and gender similar controls (P = 0.0021). HGF serum concentration was significantly lower in Bipolar patients pre-therapy (P = 0.0009) and HGF levels normalized post-therapy. Zinc levels in these same individuals also normalized (P = 0.0046) and patient's perceived severity of Bipolar symptoms significantly decreased after therapy (P = 0.0003). We also found a significant direct correlation between Zinc and HGF serum concentration in the bipolar patients (P = 0.04). DISCUSSION: These results suggest an association between low HGF levels and bipolar disorder and also demonstrate that zinc therapy may be associated with the normalization of HGF levels and decrease in severity of disease.
