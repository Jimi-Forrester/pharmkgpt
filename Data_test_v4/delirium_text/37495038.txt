37495038|a|In recent years, a new target closely linked to a variety of diseases has appeared in the researchers' vision, which is the NLRP3 inflammasome. With the deepening of the study of NLRP3 inflammasome, it was found that it plays an extremely important role in a variety of physiological pathological processes, and NLRP3 inflammasome was also found to be associated with some age-related diseases. It is associated with the development of insulin resistance, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, cardiovascular aging, hearing and vision loss. At present, the only clinical approach to the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases is to use anti-IL-1beta antibodies, but NLRP3-specific inhibitors may be better than the IL-1beta antibodies. This article reviews the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome and aging diseases: summarizes some of the relevant experimental results reported in recent years, and introduces the biological signals or pathways closely related to the NLRP3 inflammasome in a variety of aging diseases, and also introduces some promising small molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome for clinical treatment, such as: ZYIL1, DFV890 and OLT1177, they have excellent pharmacological effects and good pharmacokinetics.
