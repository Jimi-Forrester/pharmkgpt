36830577|a|BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is present in up to 30-50% of patients with COVID-19. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced diarrhea remains unclear. We hypothesized that enterocyte-enteric neuron interactions were important in SARS-CoV-2-induced diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in enterocytes causing the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The DAMPs then stimulate the release of enteric neurotransmitters that disrupt gut electrolyte homeostasis. METHODS: Primary mouse enteric neurons (EN) were exposed to a conditioned medium from ACE2-expressing Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or treated with tunicamycin (ER stress inducer). Vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP) expression and secretion by EN were assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Membrane expression of NHE3 was determined by surface biotinylation. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection led to increased expression of BiP/GRP78, a marker and key regulator for ER stress in Caco-2 cells. Infected cells secreted the DAMP protein, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), into the culture media, as revealed by proteomic and Western analyses. The expression of VIP mRNA in EN was up-regulated after treatment with a conditioned medium of SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco-2 cells. CD91, a receptor for HSP70, is abundantly expressed in the cultured mouse EN. Tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, also induced the release of HSP70 and Xbp1s, mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-treatment of Caco-2 with tunicamycin (apical) and VIP (basolateral) induced a synergistic decrease in membrane expression of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3), an important transporter that mediates intestinal Na+/fluid absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enterocyte infection leads to ER stress and the release of DAMPs that up-regulates the expression and release of VIP by EN. VIP in turn inhibits fluid absorption through the downregulation of brush-border membrane expression of NHE3 in enterocytes. These data highlight the role of epithelial-enteric neuronal crosstalk in COVID-19-related diarrhea.
