19104921|t|A fluorescent probe for diacetyl detection.
19104921|a|A water-soluble fluorescent probe, rhodamine B hydrazide (RBH), was prepared and its properties for recognition of diacetyl were studied. The method employs the reaction of diacetyl with RBH, a colorless and non-fluorescent rhodamine B spiro form derivative to give a pink-colored fluorescent substance. In weakly acidic media, RBH reacts more selectively with diacetyl than with other carbonyls, causing a large increase in fluorescence intensity and thereby providing an easy assay for the determination of diacetyl.
