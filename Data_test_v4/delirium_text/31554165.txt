31554165|t|A New Kid on the Block? Carbonic Anhydrases as Possible New Targets in Alzheimer's Disease.
31554165|a|The increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is a consequence of the world's population aging but unfortunately, existing treatments are only effective at delaying some of the symptoms and for a limited time. Despite huge efforts by both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies, no disease-modifying drugs have been brought to the market in the last decades. Recently, several studies shed light on Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) as possible new targets for AD treatment. In the present review we summarized preclinical and clinical findings regarding the role of CAs and their inhibitors/activators on cognition, aging and neurodegeneration and we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the field.
