38155489|t|Postpartum Psychosis: A Review of Risk Factors, Clinical Picture, Management, Prevention, and Psychosocial Determinants.
38155489|a|Postpartum psychosis is rare, but is a serious clinical and social problem. On its own, it is not included in DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) as a disease entity, and current diagnostic criteria equate it with other psychoses. This poses a serious legal problem and makes it difficult to classify. The disorder is caused by a complex combination of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of postpartum psychosis remain very poorly understood. There is a need for further research and increased knowledge of the medical sector in the prevention and early detection of psychosis to prevent stigmatization of female patients during a psychiatric episode. It is necessary to regulate its position in the DSM5 and ICD-10. Attention should be paid to the social education of expectant mothers and their families. This article aims to review the current status of risk factors, prevention, and management of postpartum psychosis.
