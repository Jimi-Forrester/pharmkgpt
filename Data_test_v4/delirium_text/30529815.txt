30529815|t|Interactions between polyoxometalates and biological systems: from drug design to artificial enzymes.
30529815|a|Polyoxometalates have long been studied in a variety of biological applications. Interactions between the highly charged POM molecules and biological molecules frequently occur through hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions. Tellurium-centred Anderson-Evans POMs show exceptional promise as crystallization agents, while acidic and metal-substituted POMs may provide interesting alternatives to enzymes in proteomics applications. While POMs also show interesting results in a number of medicinal applications, for example as anti-amyloid agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and as anti-tumoral agents, their use is often impeded by their toxicity. Many recent studies have therefore focussed on POM-functionalization to reduce toxicity and increase activity by addition of biological targeting molecules.
