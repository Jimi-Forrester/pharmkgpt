39064465|t|Intraoperative Dexmedetomidine Use for Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) in Cardiac Surgery-Single Center Retrospective Observational Cohort Study.
39064465|a|Background and Objectives: Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, is used as an adjunct to anesthesia in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs. One of its advantages is the opioid-sparing effect which can facilitate early extubation and recovery. When the ERAS cardiac society was set in 2017, our facility was already using the ERAS program, in which the "fast-track Anesthesia" was facilitated by the intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine. Our objective is to share our experience and investigate the potential impact of intraoperative dexmedetomidine use as a part of the ERAS program on patient outcomes in elective cardiac surgery. Materials and Methods: An observational retrospective cohort study was conducted at a university hospital in Switzerland. The patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between 1 June 2017 and 31 August 2018 were included in this analysis (n = 327). Regardless of the surgery type, all the patients received a standardized fast-track anesthesia protocol inclusive of dexmedetomidine infusion, reduced opioid dose, and parasternal nerve block. The primary outcome was the postoperative time when the criteria for extubation were met. Three groups were identified: group 0-(extubated in the operating room), group < 6 (extubated in less than 6 h), and group > 6 (extubated in >6 h). The secondary outcomes were adverse events, length of stay in ICU and in hospital, and total hospitalization costs. Results: Dexmedetomidine was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse events reported. Early extubation was performed in 187 patients (57%). Group 3 had a significantly longer length of stay in the ICU (median: 70 h vs. 25 h) and in hospital (17 vs. 12 days), and consequently higher total hospitalization costs (CHF 62,551 vs. 38,433) compared to the net data from the other two groups (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that dexmedetomidine can be safely used as part of the opioid-sparing anesthesia protocol in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass with the potential to facilitate early extubation, shorter ICU and hospital stays, and reduced hospitalization costs.
