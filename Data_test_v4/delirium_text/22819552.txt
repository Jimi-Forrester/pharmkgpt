22819552|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Impairment of glucose utilization contributes to neuronal degeneration of Alzheimer's disease patients. Cellular glucose utilization can be regulated by calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Resveratrol (RSV) is a plant-derived polyphenol with multiple beneficial effects, including neuroprotection and metabolic improvement. Here, we investigated the effect of RSV on neuronal calcium signal and glucose utilization. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS: Primary culture of cortical neurons, calcium imaging, 2-NBDG assay and western blotting were employed to investigate RSV-mediated effects on neuronal calcium signal and glucose utilization. RESULTS: RSV elevated intracellular calcium in cortical neurons via modulation of secondary messenger system including nitrous oxide, cGMP and cAMP. Secondarily, a calcium-dependent enhancement of neuronal glucose utilization after RSV treatment was observed. The effects on neuronal glucose utilization are largely dependent on RSV-induced calcium-dependent AMP-activated protein kinase activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that activation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways by RSV may convey improvements of neuronal glucose utilization.
