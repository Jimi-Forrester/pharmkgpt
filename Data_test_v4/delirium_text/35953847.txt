Recently, gliotransmission has been identified as a novel target for neurological diseases. However, using the properties of nanomaterials to modulate gliotransmission has not been uncovered. RESULTS: We prepared non-invasive CNT platforms for cells with different nanotopography and properties such as hydrophilicity and conductivity. Using CNT platforms, we investigated the effect of CNT on astrocyte functions participating in synaptic transmission by releasing gliotransmitters. Astrocytes on CNT platforms showed improved cell adhesion and proliferation with upregulated integrin and GFAP expression. In addition, intracellular GABA and glutamate in astrocytes were augmented on CNT platforms. We also demonstrated that gliotransmitters in brain slices were increased by ex vivo incubation with CNT. Additionally, intracellular resting Ca2+ level, which is important for gliotransmission, was also increased via TRPV1 on CNT platforms. CONCLUSION: CNT can improve astrocyte function including adhesion, proliferation and gliotransmission by increasing resting Ca2+ level. Therefore, our study suggests that CNT would be utilized as a new therapeutic platform for central nervous system diseases by modulating gliotransmission.
