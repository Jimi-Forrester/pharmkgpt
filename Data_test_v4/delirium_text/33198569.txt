33198569|a|Dementia is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in older adults, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most common cause. AD has a significant impact on economic and psychosocial status. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are currently the mainstay in the management of AD. Rivastigmine is the only ChEI that inhibits both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes in the brain. This dual inhibition makes it potentially more effective for AD patients. Its availability as both a transdermal formulation and oral capsule, may improve adherence rates and care giver satisfaction compared with other ChEIs. To date, the data from randomized clinical trials and post marketing observational studies have shown evidence for an impact on cognitive functions in AD with good safety and tolerability.
