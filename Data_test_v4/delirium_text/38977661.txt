38977661|a|Cellular senescence is characterized by a decrease in protein synthesis, although the underlying processes are mostly unclear. Chemical modifications to transfer RNAs (tRNAs) frequently influence tRNA activity, which is crucial for translation. We describe how tRNA N7-methylguanosine (m7G46) methylation, catalyzed by METTL1-WDR4, regulates translation and influences senescence phenotypes. Mettl1/Wdr4 and m7G gradually diminish with senescence and aging. A decrease in METTL1 causes a reduction in tRNAs, especially those with the m7G modification, via the rapid tRNA degradation (RTD) pathway. The decreases cause ribosomes to stall at certain codons, impeding the translation of mRNA that is essential in pathways such as Wnt signaling and ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, chronic ribosome stalling stimulates the ribotoxic and integrative stress responses, which induce senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Moreover, restoring eEF1A protein mitigates senescence phenotypes caused by METTL1 deficiency by reducing RTD. Our findings demonstrate that tRNA m7G modification is essential for preventing premature senescence and aging by enabling efficient mRNA translation.
