18568125|t|MRI parameters of Alzheimer's disease in an Arab population of Wadi Ara, Israel.
18568125|a|Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are reported from 15 individuals in an Arab-Israeli community who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The quantitative parameters that were used for MRI analyses included gradings (0-3) and linear measurements of different brain structures. Generalized tissue loss was assessed by combined measurements of the ventricles (ventricular score, VS) and sulcal grading and width (SG, SW, respectively). Loss of brain tissue in specific regions of interest, eg, temporal lobes, basal ganglia, and midbrain, was evaluated by precise measurements. We observed abnormal tissue characteristics, expressed as high intensity foci in white matter on T2W sequences, as well as tissue loss, both generalized and focal. Most notable were changes involving the head of the caudate nuclei, the midbrain, and to a lesser degree, medial temporal structures.
