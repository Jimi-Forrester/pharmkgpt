32315694|t|Orexins role in neurodegenerative diseases: From pathogenesis to treatment.
32315694|a|Orexin is a neurotransmitter that mainly regulates sleep/wake cycle. In addition to its sleep cycle regulatory role, it is involved in regulation of attention, energy homeostasis, neurogenesis and cognition. Several evidences has shown the involvement of orexin in narcolepsy, but there are also growing evidences that shows the disturbance in orexin system in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Epilepsy, Huntington's diseases and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of these disorders can be partly attributed from orexin system imbalance. However, there are controversial reports on the exact relationship between orexin and these neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the current evidences regarding the role of orexin in these neurodegenerative diseases.
