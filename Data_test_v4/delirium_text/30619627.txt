30619627|t|Regulatory Roles of the Caspase-11 Non-Canonical Inflammasome in Inflammatory Diseases.
30619627|a|Inflammation is an immune response mediated by innate immune cells of tissues, against invading microbes and cellular stress. The hallmark of inflammatory responses is the activation of inflammasomes - multiprotein oligomers comprising intracellular pattern recognition receptors and inflammatory effectors - such as ASC and pro-cysteine-aspartic protease (pro-caspase)-1. Inflammasomes can be classified as canonical or non-canonical, and their activation in response to various ligands commonly induces caspase-1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) processing, leading to caspase-1-mediated maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18, and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis through pore generation in cell membranes. Although inflammation protects the host from harmful stimuli, chronic inflammation is a critical risk factor for inflammatory diseases, and several studies have investigated the role of canonical inflammasomes in inflammatory responses and diseases, with emerging studies focusing on the role of non-canonical inflammasomes. This review discusses recent studies on the regulatory roles of the caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Additionally, it provides an insight into the development of novel therapeutics based on targeting caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome and its downstream effectors to prevent and treat human inflammatory conditions.
