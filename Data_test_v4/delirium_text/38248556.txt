38248556|t|Recovery Barrier Characterizations by Hospitalized Patients with Substance Use Disorders: Results from a Randomized Clinical Study on Inpatient Peer Recovery Coaching.
38248556|a|Patients hospitalized with medical complications from substance use disorder (SUD) encounter unique health problems that may complicate their recovery. Recovery barriers are not well understood in this population. The study objective is to characterize recovery barriers in this patient population. Participants (n = 96) in this six-month longitudinal study were randomized to a peer recovery coaching intervention or standard of care. The primary outcome measures were qualitative, open-ended questions addressing factors interfering with participants' recovery. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Themes were identified a priori using past research on recovery capital domains; these seven barriers were (1) psychological health difficulties, (2) physical health challenges, (3) lack of social support, (4) insufficient treatment or recovery support to maintain sobriety, (5) environmental and housing concerns, (6) deficits in coping skills, and (7) lack of meaningful activities. At baseline, the most common recovery barriers were in the environment and housing (28.1%), psychological health (27.1%), and social support (22.9%) domains. At six-month follow-up, participants were asked to describe barriers they felt they had made improvement in over the last six months. The primary themes that participants reported improvements in were treatment and recovery support to maintain sobriety (52.1%), coping skills (35.4%), and social support (27.1%). Hospitalization and participation in a randomized controlled trial may be a turning point in which to address recovery barriers for patients hospitalized with complications from SUD.
