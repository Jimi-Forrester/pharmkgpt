33801153|a|During the last years, accumulating evidence has suggested that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases via the gut-brain axis. Moreover, current research has helped to elucidate different communication pathways between the gut microbiota and neural tissues (e.g., the vagus nerve, tryptophan production, extrinsic enteric-associated neurons, and short chain fatty acids). On the other hand, altering the composition of gut microbiota promotes a state known as dysbiosis, where the balance between helpful and pathogenic bacteria is disrupted, usually stimulating the last ones. Herein, we summarize selected findings of the recent literature concerning the gut microbiome on the onset and progression of neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorders, and the strategies to modulate its composition in the search for therapeutical approaches, focusing mainly on animal models studies. Readers are advised that this is a young field, based on early studies, that is rapidly growing and being updated as the field advances.
