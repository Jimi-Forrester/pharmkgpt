38337456|t|A Contemporary Review of the Use of Extracorporeal CytoSorb  Hemoadsorption Therapy in Patients with Infective Endocarditis.
38337456|a|Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. Cardiac surgery plays a major role in the contemporary clinical management of IE patients. During cardiac surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass significantly contributes to an increased risk of organ dysfunction and mortality by inducing an acute inflammatory response, vascular endothelial cell injury, impairment of the coagulation cascade, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. During the past decade, the use of extracorporeal hemoadsorption therapy with the CytoSorb  hemoadsorber (CytoSorbents Europe GmbH, Berlin, Germany) has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy to mediate inflammatory responses in IE patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, there is currently no systematic evaluation of the effect of CytoSorb  hemoadsorption on clinical outcomes such as hemodynamics, organ dysfunction, and mortality in patients with IE. Therefore, in this review, we exclusively discuss contemporary findings concerning the rationale, clinical evidence, and future perspectives for CytoSorb  hemoadsorption therapy in IE patients.
