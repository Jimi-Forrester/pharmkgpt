33849122|a|BACKGROUND: To analyze the levels of S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cyclophilin A (CypA) in the serum of patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with delirium and multiple injuries transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU), and their prognostic value. METHODS: The data of 98 patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with delirium and multiple injuries admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to May 2019 were retrospectively analyzed as the study group. The differences in serum S100B, NSE, and CypA levels in each group were compared, and the deaths of the study group during follow-up were counted. RESULTS: The levels of S100B, NSE, and CypA in the study group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). The mortality rate of the 98 patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with delirium and multiple injuries transferred from the ICU was 37.76%. Furthermore, the levels of S100B, NSE, and CypA in the death group were higher than those in the survival group (P<0.05). Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) score <=5 points, Injury Severity Score (ISS) score >25 points, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and increased levels of S100B, NSE, and CypA were independent risk factors that affected the prognosis of patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with delirium and multiple injuries transferred from the ICU (P<0.05). The average survival times of the high S100B level group, the high NSE level group, and the high CypA level group were shorter than those of the low-level groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The levels of S100B, NSE, and CypA in serum were closely related to the prognosis of patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with delirium and multiple injuries transferred from the ICU. They can be used as molecular markers for predicting the prognosis of patients, and may serve as potential targets for treatment.
