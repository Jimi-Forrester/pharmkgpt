39223276|a|Normal brain functioning relies on high aerobic energy production provided by mitochondria. Failure to supply a sufficient amount of energy, seen in different brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), may have a significant negative impact on brain development and support of different brain functions. Mitochondrial dysfunction, manifested in the abnormal activities of the electron transport chain and impaired energy metabolism, greatly contributes to ASD. The aberrant functioning of this organelle is of such high importance that ASD has been proposed as a mitochondrial disease. It should be noted that aerobic energy production is not the only function of the mitochondria. In particular, these organelles are involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, different mechanisms of programmed cell death, autophagy, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) production. Several syndromes originated from mitochondria-related mutations display ASD phenotype. Abnormalities in Ca2+ handling and ATP production in the brain mitochondria affect synaptic transmission, plasticity, and synaptic development, contributing to ASD. ROS and Ca2+ regulate the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The prolonged opening of this pore affects the redox state of the mitochondria, impairs oxidative phosphorylation, and activates apoptosis, ultimately leading to cell death. A dysregulation between the enhanced mitochondria-related processes of apoptosis and the inhibited autophagy leads to the accumulation of toxic products in the brains of individuals with ASD. Although many mitochondria-related mechanisms still have to be investigated, and whether they are the cause or consequence of this disorder is still unknown, the accumulating data show that the breakdown of any of the mitochondrial functions may contribute to abnormal brain development leading to ASD. In this review, we discuss the multifaceted role of mitochondria in ASD from the various aspects of neuroscience.
