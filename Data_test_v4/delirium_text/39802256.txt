39802256|a|Introduction: Delirium is a syndrome commonly seen in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is characterized by acute changes in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Due to its higher prevalence in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, it is crucial to recognize it early and implement standardized evidence-based protocols for preventing it in regular practice. Objectives: To identify the benefits and effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for preventing delirium among critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement guidelines were followed. Two independent authors searched electronic and grey literature for systematic review and meta-analysis in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar. Results: This umbrella review included 12 studies on delirium prevention interventions, excluding reviews, abstracts, case studies, and pharmacological interventions. Our finding shows that multicomponent strategies are the most promising intervention for preventing delirium. Inclusion of family participation is the most vital part, with flexible visitation to be included in delirium care protocols. Multidisciplinary approaches raise workloads among healthcare professionals through increased coordination, assessments, and documentation. Conclusions: Multicomponent interventions are regarded as the most effective among all nonpharmacological interventions for reducing and preventing delirium. Highlights: Delirium syndrome is preventable among mechanically ventilated patients. The study aims to identify the benefits and effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for preventing delirium among critically ill patients admitted to the ICU.
