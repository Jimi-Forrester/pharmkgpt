39886562|a|Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical, radiological, and neuropathological heterogeneity of corticobasal syndrome (CBS), which can complicate the determination of underlying etiology and lead to inaccurate treatment decisions. Though the most common diagnosis is corticobasal degeneration (CBD), the spectrum of underlying pathologies expands beyond CBD and can overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases and even the neuroimmunology field. We will review possible clinical presentations and cues that can point towards the etiology. We will also discuss the most recent available biomarkers to facilitate a more accurate diagnosis. Additionally, we will examine current and future potential therapeutic options. Recent findings: The range of available fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers is increasing and some are already being used in clinical practice. While the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is largely aimed at managing symptoms, early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for initiating early management and enrollment in clinical trials. The recent approval of a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised hopes for the development of more therapeutic options for other proteinopathies. Several candidates are currently being studied in clinical trial pipelines, particularly those targeting tau pathology. Summary: Recent advancements in understanding the genetic and neuropathological diversity of CBS, along with the promising development of fluid and imaging biomarkers, are driving clinical trial research forward, instilling optimism for creating more effective disease-modifying treatments for brain proteinopathies.
