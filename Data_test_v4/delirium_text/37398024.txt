37398024|t|Identification of PS1/gamma-secretase and glutamate transporter GLT-1 interaction sites.
37398024|a|The recently discovered interaction between Presenilin 1 (PS1), a catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase responsible for generating amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, and GLT-1, a major glutamate transporter in the brain (EAAT2) provides a mechanistic link between these two key factors involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Modulating this interaction can be crucial to understand the consequence of such crosstalk in AD context and beyond. However, the interaction sites between these two proteins are unknown. Herein, we utilized an alanine scanning approach coupled with FRET-based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to identify the interaction sites between PS1 and GLT-1 in their native environment within intact cells. We found that GLT-1 residues at position 276 to 279 (TM5) and PS1 residues at position 249 to 252 (TM6) are crucial for GLT-1/PS1 interaction. These results have been cross validated using AlphaFold Multimer prediction. To further investigate whether this interaction of endogenously expressed GLT-1 and PS1 can be prevented in primary neurons, we designed PS1/GLT-1 cell-permeable peptides (CPPs) targeting the PS1 or GLT-1 binding site. We used HIV TAT domain to allow for cell penetration which was assayed in neurons. First, we assessed the toxicity and penetration of CPPs by confocal microscopy. Next, to ensure the efficiency of CPPs, we monitored the modulation of GLT-1/PS1 interaction in intact neurons by FLIM. We saw significantly less interaction between PS1 and GLT-1 with both CPPs. Our study establishes a new tool to study the functional aspect of GLT-1/PS1 interaction and its relevance in normal physiology and AD models.
