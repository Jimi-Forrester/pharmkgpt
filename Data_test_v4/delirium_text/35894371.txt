METHODS: Retrospective study carried out between March 2020 and March 2021 with patients submitted to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing and chest computed tomography. Patients were divided into two groups: supine or supine and lateral decubitus imaging. Standardized reporting systems of computed tomographic findings in COVID-19 and chest computed tomography score were used. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen patients were enrolled. Moderate to substantial inter-rater reliability was observed for standardized reporting systems (weighted kappa, 0.553-0.764; p<0.001). Inter-rater reliability for the chest computed tomography score was substantial (weighted kappa, 0.620-0.670; p<0.001). Standardized reporting systems failed to predict COVID-19 in children, regardless of additional lateral decubitus imaging (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.491-0.608). Chest computed tomography scores assigned to lateral decubitus images were significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Additional lateral decubitus imaging does not improve the accuracy of standardized reporting systems of computed tomographic findings in COVID-19 but may provide a more accurate estimation of lung involvement in uncooperative patients.
