33584812|t|Prioritization and Evaluation of Flooding Tolerance Genes in Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.].
33584812|a|Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is one of the most important legume crops abundant in edible protein and oil in the world. In recent years there has been increasingly more drastic weather caused by climate change, with flooding, drought, and unevenly distributed rainfall gradually increasing in terms of the frequency and intensity worldwide. Severe flooding has caused extensive losses to soybean production and there is an urgent need to breed strong soybean seeds with high flooding tolerance. The present study demonstrates bioinformatics big data mining and integration, meta-analysis, gene mapping, gene prioritization, and systems biology for identifying prioritized genes of flooding tolerance in soybean. A total of 83 flooding tolerance genes (FTgenes), according to the appropriate cut-off point, were prioritized from 36,705 test genes collected from multidimensional genomic features linking to soybean flooding tolerance. Several validation results using independent samples from SoyNet, genome-wide association study, SoyBase, GO database, and transcriptome databases all exhibited excellent agreement, suggesting these 83 FTgenes were significantly superior to others. These results provide valuable information and contribution to research on the varieties selection of soybean.
