24121963|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been shown to be associated with shrinkage of the corpus callosum mid-sagittal cross-sectional area (CCA). OBJECTIVE: To study temporal rates of corpus callosum atrophy not previously reported for early AD. METHODS: We used longitudinal MRI scans to study the rates of change of CCA and circularity (CIR), a measure of its shape, in normal controls (NC, n = 75), patients with very mild AD (AD-VM, n = 51), and mild AD (AD-M, n = 21). RESULTS: There were significant reduction rates in CCA and CIR in all three groups. While CCA reduction rates were not statistically different between groups, the CIR declined faster in AD-VM (p < 0.03) and AD-M (p < 0.0001) relative to NC, and in AD-M relative to AD-VM (p < 0.0004). CONCLUSION: CIR declines at an accelerated rate with AD severity. Its rate of change is more closely associated with AD progression than CCA or any of its sub-regions. CIR may be a useful group biomarker for objective assessment of treatments that aim to slow AD progression.
