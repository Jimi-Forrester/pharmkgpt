26497891|a|Our goal was to investigate whether three-dimensional (3D) double inversion recovery (DIR) images can show alterations of gray matter volume (GMV) between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and nondemented controls and to compare alterations of GMV between groups using DIR images and those using 3D T1-weighted (T1W) images. We included 25 subjects with mild or probable AD, 25 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 25 elderly cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Group differences in GMV among CN, MCI, and AD patients were tested by voxel-wise, one-way ANOVA. Additional region-of-interest-based comparisons of GMV differences among the three groups for DIR and T1WI were performed using ANCOVA. Finally, ROC curve analysis was performed. In the AD group compared with the CN and MCI groups, GMV was decreased in both DIR and T1W images. However, the areas showing GMV loss were larger in DIR images compared to those in T1W images. Amygdala had the highest area under curve value for both DIR and T1W images. DIR images were sensitive for identifying GMV loss in patients with AD compared with MCI and CN subjects and areas showing GMV loss identified with DIR were extended to more brain areas than those identified with T1W. With DIR, amygdala GMV is the most sensitive in differentiating between subject groups.
