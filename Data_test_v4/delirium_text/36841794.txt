36841794|t|Esketamine combined with pregabalin on acute postoperative pain in patients undergoing resection of spinal neoplasms: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
36841794|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative pain management is one of the most challenging issues for patients with spinal neoplasms. Inadequate postoperative analgesia usually leads to severe postsurgical pain, which could cause patients to suffer from many other related complications. Meanwhile, there is no appropriate analgesic strategy for patients with spinal neoplasms. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a protocol for a randomized double-blind controlled trial to evaluate the effect of esketamine combined with pregabalin on postsurgical pain in spinal surgery. Patients aged 18 to 65 years scheduled for spinal neoplasm resection will be randomly allocated into the combined and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. In the combined group, esketamine will be given during the during the surgery procedure until 48-h postoperative period, and pregabalin will be taken from 2 h before the surgery to 2 weeks postoperatively. The control group will receive normal saline and placebo capsules at the same time points. Both groups received a background analgesic regimen by using patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (containing 100 mug sufentanil and 16 mg ondansetron) until 2 days after surgery. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of this trial, all the researchers and patients will be blinded until the completion of this study. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with acute moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain (visual analog scale, VAS >= 40, range: 0-100, with 0, no pain; 100, the worst pain) during the 48-h postoperative period. The secondary outcomes will include the maximal VAS scores (when the patients felt the most intense pain over the last 24 h before being interviewed) at 0-2 h, 2-24 h, 24-48 h, and 48-72 h after leaving the operating room and 24 h before discharge; the incidence of acute moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain at each other time point; chronic postsurgical pain assessment; neuropathic pain assessment; and the incidence of drug-related adverse events and other postoperative complications, such as postoperative delirium and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). DISCUSSION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of esketamine combined with pregabalin on acute postsurgical pain in patients undergoing resection of spinal neoplasms. The safety of this perioperative pain management strategy will also be examined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05096468. Registered on October 27, 2021.
