39080336|a|The mechanisms underlying lipid metabolic disorders in Parkinson's diseases (PD) remain unclear. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify PD-related modular genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) were extracted from Molecular Signatures Database. Candidate genes were assessed with overlapping modular genes, DEGs, and LMRGs for the purpose of building protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Then, biomarkers were generated by machine learning and Backpropagation Neural Network development according to candidate genes. Biomarker-based enrichment and network modulation analyses were executed to investigate related signaling pathways. Following dimensionality reduction clustering and annotation, scRNA-seq was submitted to cellular interactions and trajectory analysis to analyze regulatory mechanisms of critical cells. Finally, qRT-PCR was conducted to confirm the expression of biomarkers in PD patients. Four biomarkers (MSMO1, ELOVL6, AACS, and CERS2) were obtained and highly predictive after analysis mentioned above. Then, OPC, Oli, and Neu cells were the primary expression sites for biomarkers according to scRNA-seq studies. Finally, we confirmed mRNA of MSMO1, ELOVL6 and AACS were downregulated in PD patients comparing with control, while CERS2 was upregulated. In conclusion, MSMO1, ELOVL6, AACS, and CERS2 related to LMRGs could be new biomarkers for diagnosing and treating PD.
