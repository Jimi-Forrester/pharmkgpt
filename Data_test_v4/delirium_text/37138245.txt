The aim of this study was to explore the availability of geriatric-friendly protocols, equipment and physical environment criteria in EDs and to identify related improvement opportunities. METHODS: The head nurse of 63 EDs in Flanders and Brussels Capital Region was invited to complete a survey in collaboration with the chief physician of the ED. The questionnaire was inspired by the American College of Emergency Physicians Geriatric ED Accreditation Program and explored the availability, relevance and feasibility of geriatric-friendly protocols, equipment and physical environment. Descriptive analyses were performed. A region-wide improvement opportunity was defined as a resource that was never to occasionally (0-50%) available on Flemish EDs and was scored (rather or very) relevant by at least 75% of respondents. RESULTS: A total of 32 questionnaires were analysed. The response rate was 50.8%. All surveyed resources were available in at least one ED. Eighteen out of 52 resources (34.6%) were available in more than half of EDs. Ten region-wide improvement opportunities were identified. These comprised seven protocols and three physical environment characteristics: 1) a geriatric approach initiated from physical triage, 2) elder abuse, 3) discharge to residential facility, 4) frequent geriatric pathologies, 5) access to geriatric specific follow-up clinics, 6) medication reconciliation, 7) minimising 'nihil per os' designation, 8) a large-face, analogue clock in each patient room, 9) raised toilet seats and 10) non-slip floors. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available resources supporting optimal ED care for older patients in Flanders are very heterogeneous. Researchers, clinicians and policy makers need to define which geriatric-friendly protocols, equipment and physical environment criteria should become region-wide minimum operational standards. Findings of this study are relevant to facilitate the development process of this endeavour.
