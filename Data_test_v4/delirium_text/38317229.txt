38317229|a|The gradual aging of the global population has led to a surge in age-related diseases, which seriously threaten human health. Researchers are dedicated to understanding and coping with the complexities of aging, constantly uncovering the substances and mechanism related to aging like chronic low-grade inflammation. The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), a key regulator of the innate immune response, recognizes molecular patterns associated with pathogens and injury, initiating an intrinsic inflammatory immune response. Dysfunctional NLRP3 is linked to the onset of related diseases, particularly in the context of aging. Therefore, a profound comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in aging-related diseases holds the potential to enhance treatment strategies for these conditions. In this article, we review the significance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the initiation and progression of diverse aging-related diseases. Furthermore, we explore preventive and therapeutic strategies for aging and related diseases by manipulating the NLRP3 inflammasome, along with its upstream and downstream mechanisms.
