34051404|t|Pilot Assessment of Patient and Provider Characteristics Associated With Satisfactory Consultation-Liaison Telepsychiatry Encounters.
34051404|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to attempt remote consultation, but there are limited data on the use of telepsychiatry in general, and almost none about the experience of telepsychiatry in a consultation-liaison context. OBJECTIVE: We looked for attributes that correlated with satisfactory tele-encounters. METHODS: Eleven consultation-liaison attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March to June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS: A vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty in using the platform was less common for female patients (odds ratio = 0.239, P = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 9.059, P < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 0.189, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry has previously been limited to outpatient use and, generally, for providers and patients who specifically preferred it. However, abrupt transition to the use of telepsychiatry to limit contagion risk was mostly satisfactory in our center; identifying for which patient encounters it is most and least appropriate will help guide future use.
