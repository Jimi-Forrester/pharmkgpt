21368720|a|Luteolin, a 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone, is a plant flavonoid and pharmacologically active agent that has been isolated from several plant species. In the present study, the effects of luteolin obtained from the medicinal plant Elsholtzia rugulosa and the related mechanisms were examined in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cell model. In this model, copper was used to exacerbate the neurotoxicity in beta-amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation stably overexpressed SH-SY5Y cells (named "APPsw cells" for short). Based on this model, we demonstrated that luteolin increased cell viability, reduced intracellular ROS generation, enhanced the activity of SOD and reversed mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. Inhibition of caspase-related apoptosis was consistently involved in the neuroprotection afforded by luteolin. Furthermore, it down-regulated the expression of AbetaPP and lowered the secretion of Abeta1-42. These results indicated that luteolin from the Elsholtzia rugulosa exerted neroprotective effects through mechanisms that decrease AbetaPP expression, lower Abeta secretion, regulate the redox imbalance, preserve mitochondrial function, and depress the caspase family-related apoptosis.
