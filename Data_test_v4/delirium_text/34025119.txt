34025119|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the agreement between the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and foveal thickness (FT) measurements among three different spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) instruments in a sample of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and a healthy age-matched control group. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study with three groups: healthy subjects and MS patients w/w a previous clinical diagnosis of optic neuritis (ON) was conducted. The pRNFL and FT were measured using three different SD-OCT instruments (OCT PRIMUS 200 and OCT CIRRUS 500 SD-OCT [Carl Zeiss Meditec] and OCT 3D 2000 [Topcon]). RESULTS: Twenty eyes from 10 healthy subjects matched in age with MS patients without a previous history of eye disease and 62 MS eyes from 31 MS patients (29 eyes without history of ON and 33 eyes with history of ON) were enrolled. Healthy subjects and MS patients without ON did not show differences between the pRNFL and FT thickness (P>0.99) with any of the instruments. However, MS eyes with a previous episode of ON showed thinner pRNFL and FT (P<0.01). PRIMUS and CIRRUS OCT showed better agreement of the pRNLF and FT in both healthy and MS eyes. However, 3D OCT showed less agreement in the pRNFL measurement with CIRRUS in both healthy and MS eyes. INTERPRETATION: Although OCT is a valuable technology to improve MS patient assessment, differences between devices must be taken into account. It is necessary to create an international group that standardizes the measurement conditions and above all that provides reference bases for normal subjects.
