39202226|t|PrecivityAD2  Blood Test: Analytical Validation of an LC-MS/MS Assay for Quantifying Plasma Phospho-tau217 and Non-Phospho-tau217 Peptide Concentrations That Are Used with Plasma Amyloid-beta42/40 in a Multianalyte Assay with Algorithmic Analysis for Detecting Brain Amyloid Pathology.
39202226|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that represents a major global public health concern. Traditionally, AD is diagnosed using cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis or brain imaging modalities. Recently, less burdensome, more widely available blood biomarker (BBM) assays for amyloid-beta (Abeta42/40) and phosphorylated-tau concentrations have been found to accurately identify the presence/absence of brain amyloid plaques and tau tangles and have helped to streamline AD diagnosis. However, few BBMs have been rigorously analytically validated. Herein, we report the analytical validation of a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) multiplex method for quantifying plasma phosphorylated-tau217 (p-tau217) and non-phosphorylated-tau217 (np-tau217) peptide concentrations. We combined the p-tau217/np-tau217 concentrations ratio (%p-tau217) and the previously validated LC-MS/MS multiplex assay for plasma Abeta42/40 into a new multianalyte assay with algorithmic analysis (MAAA; PrecivityAD2  test) that identifies brain amyloid status based on brain amyloid positron emission tomography. We found (a) the %p-tau217 assay is precise, accurate, sensitive, and linear over a wide analytical measurement range, and free from carryover and interference; (b) the pre-analytical specimen collection, processing, storage, and shipping conditions that maintain plasma tau peptide stability; and (c) using the measured analytical imprecision for plasma Abeta42/40 and p-tau217/np-tau217 levels in a worst-case scenario model, the PrecivityAD2 test algorithm for amyloid pathology classification changed for only 3.5% of participants from brain amyloid positive to negative, or from negative to positive. The plasma sample preparation and LC-MS/MS methods underlying the PrecivityAD2 test are suitable for use in the clinical laboratory and valid for the test's intended purpose: to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of individuals aged 55 and older with signs or symptoms of mild cognitive impairment or dementia.
