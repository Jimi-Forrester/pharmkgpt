21868378|t|Lysine 624 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a critical determinant of amyloid beta peptide length: support for a sequential model of gamma-secretase intramembrane proteolysis and regulation by the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) juxtamembrane region.
21868378|a|gamma-Secretase is a multiprotein intramembrane cleaving aspartyl protease (I-CLiP) that catalyzes the final cleavage of the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Abeta is the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its mechanism of production has been studied intensely. gamma-Secretase executes multiple cleavages within the transmembrane domain of APP, with cleavages producing Abeta and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), referred to as gamma and epsilon, respectively. The heterogeneous nature of the gamma cleavage that produces various Abeta peptides is highly relevant to AD, as increased production of Abeta 1-42 is genetically and biochemically linked to the development of AD. We have identified an amino acid in the juxtamembrane region of APP, lysine 624, on the basis of APP695 numbering (position 28 relative to Abeta) that plays a critical role in determining the final length of Abeta peptides released by gamma-secretase. Mutation of this lysine to alanine (K28A) shifts the primary site of gamma-secretase cleavage from 1-40 to 1-33 without significant changes to epsilon cleavage. These results further support a model where epsilon cleavage occurs first, followed by sequential proteolysis of the remaining transmembrane fragment, but extend these observations by demonstrating that charged residues at the luminal boundary of the APP transmembrane domain limit processivity of gamma-secretase.
