Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing CI, both in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD prior to dementia. Methods: In this preliminary study, we investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity and dynamic network properties between 23 individual with CI due to AD based on clinical assessment and 15 healthy controls (HC) using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Dominant-Coactivation Pattern (d-CAP) analysis. The cognitive status of the two groups was also compared, and correlations between cognitive scores and d-CAP switching probability were examined. Results: Results showed comparable numbers of d-CAPs in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Executive Control Network (ECN), and Frontoparietal Network (FPN) between HC and CI groups. However, the Visual Network (VN) exhibited fewer d-CAPs in the CI group, suggesting altered dynamic properties of this network for the CI group. Additionally, ICA revealed significant connectivity differences for all networks. Spatial maps and effect size analyses indicated increased coactivation and more synchronized activity within the DMN in HC compared to CI. Furthermore, reduced switching probabilities were observed for the CI group in DMN, VN, and FPN networks, indicating less dynamic and flexible functional interactions. Discussion: The findings highlight altered connectivity patterns within the DMN, VN, ECN, and FPN, suggesting the involvement of multiple functional networks in CI. Understanding these brain processes may contribute to developing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CI due to AD.
