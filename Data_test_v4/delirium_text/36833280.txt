36833280|t|Common Genetic Factors and Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease and Ischemic Stroke: Evidences from GWAS.
36833280|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and ischemic stroke (IS) are common neurological disorders, and the comorbidity of these two brain diseases is often seen. Although AD and IS were regarded as two distinct disease entities, in terms of different etiologies and clinical presentation, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) revealed that there were common risk genes between AD and IS, indicating common molecular pathways and their common pathophysiology. In this review, we summarize AD and IS risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their representative genes from the GWAS Catalog database, and find thirteen common risk genes, but no common risk SNPs. Furthermore, the common molecular pathways associated with these risk gene products are summarized from the GeneCards database and clustered into inflammation and immunity, G protein-coupled receptor, and signal transduction. At least seven of these thirteen genes can be regulated by 23 microRNAs identified from the TargetScan database. Taken together, the imbalance of these molecular pathways may give rise to these two common brain disorders. This review sheds light on the pathogenesis of comorbidity of AD and IS, and provides molecular targets for disease prevention, manipulation, and brain health maintenance.
