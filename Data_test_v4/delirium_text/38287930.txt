38287930|a|Numerous anti-amyloid therapies have seen recent clinical development and approval, such as the monoclonal antibodies aducanumab and lecanemab. However, in Alzheimer's disease patients, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are found embedded in the extracellular matrix and surrounded by collagens, which might hinder these antibodies from targeting the plaques. We reasoned that various different nutraceutical and pharmaceutical agents might induce collagen and extracellular matrix turnover and removal of these collagen-embedded amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. To address this idea, here, we used a transgenic C. elegans strain, LSD2104 , expressing fluorescent human Abeta 1-42 as an in-vivo model for secreted amyloid aggregation in the extracellular matrix. We performed a screen of various nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals along with different combinations, and we found that quercetin 350 microM and rifampicin 75 microM successfully cleared the extracellular amyloid plaque burden compared to the 0.2% DMSO control group, with a combination of the two agents producing the maximum effect compared to either drug alone. These results may implicate the exploration of combination therapeutics of nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals in the clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
