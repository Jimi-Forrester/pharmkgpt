37504751|t|Nutritional Assessment of Lactarius drassinus and L. controversus from the Cold Desert Region of the Northwest Himalayas for Their Potential as Food Supplements.
37504751|a|Kargil is a cold desert with hostile ecological conditions such as low temperature and precipitation, as well as difficult terrains. However, several wild mushrooms thrive well under such an extreme environment. Despite their abundance, the chemical composition of indigenous mushrooms has not been explored. This study aimed to assess the potential of two wild edible mushrooms from Kargil, Lactarius drassinus and Lactarius controversus, as food supplements by evaluating their nutritional and nutraceutical properties. Nutritional attributes such as total protein, available carbohydrates, soluble sugars, and vitamins were found to be high in the mushroom species. Furthermore, high mineral accumulation and relatively lower antinutrient concentrations resulted in higher bioavailabilities of Zn, Fe, Ca, and Mg. Gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-based metabolite profiling revealed that although the two mushroom species showed similar metabolite compositions, their relative concentrations differed. Sugars were the predominant compounds identified in both the species, with sugar alcohols being the major contributor. The second most abundant class of compound in L. drassinus was amino acids, with 5-oxoproline as the major contributor. On the other hand, fatty acids were the second most abundant compounds in L. controversus, with high oleic and linoleic acid concentrations. In the ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography-based quantification of phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid was found to be highest in in terms of its concentration in both the mushrooms studied, followed by quercetin dihydrate and gallic acid in L. drassinus and L. controversus, respectively. Moreover, high antioxidant activities attributable to their high phenol, flavonoid, and carotenoid concentrations were observed. Overall, the two mushrooms offer well-balanced sources of nutritional and nutraceutical compounds, making them healthy foods.
