30662512|t|The Prophylactic and Therapeutic Effects of Fermented Cordyceps sinensis Powder, Cs-C-Q80, on Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Dementia in Mice.
30662512|a|Corbrin Capsule, a preparation of Cordyceps sinensis analogue, is a pleiotropic traditional Chinese patent medicine with the main component of fermentative cordyceps fungus powder (Cs-C-Q80). The neuroprotective effects of Cs-C-Q80, as a substitution of Cordyceps sinensis, have not been fully identified. The objectives of this study were to explore the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of Cs-C-Q80 in vascular dementia mice model. The efficacy of Cs-C-Q80 was investigated in a molecular level as well. The subcortical ischemic vascular dementia was modelled by permanent right unilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (rUCCAO) in adult male mice. The animals were randomly divided and treated by gavage with vehicle (1% CMC-Na solution) (rUCCAO model) or Cs-C-Q80 powder at 0.2 g/kg or 1.0 g/kg, respectively. Preventive treatment was administrated by gavage daily for 7 days before rUCCAO, while therapeutic treatment was administrated continuously from 28 days after rUCCAO. Object recognition test and Morris water maze test were performed to evaluate the learning and working memory. The luxol fast blue stain (Kluver-Barrera method) and immunohistochemistry for myelin basic protein (MBP) were employed to determine the severity of white matter damage. Both preventive and therapeutic treatment with Cs-C-Q80 protected against the rUCCAO-induced memory impair in mice as determined by object recognition and Morris water maze tests. The histopathological analyses revealed significant white matter rarefaction and reduction of MBP expression in corpus callosum after rUCCAO, which could be counteracted by either preventive or therapeutic treatment with Cs-C-Q80. Moreover, the Cs-C-Q80 treatments inhibited rUCCAO-induced astrocytes activation and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta expression, indicating the anti-inflammatory roles of Cs-C-Q80 against subcortical ischemia. Cs-C-Q80 is a potential preparation for the prophylaxis and treatment of subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. The underlying pharmacological efficacy might be associated with suppression of myelin degeneration, glia activation, and inflammatory cytokines release.
