38076818|t|Allosteric Competition and Inhibition in AMPA Receptors.
38076818|a|Excitatory neurotransmission is principally mediated by AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Dysregulation of AMPARs is the cause of many neurological disorders and how therapeutic candidates such as negative allosteric modulators inhibit AMPARs is unclear. Here, we show that non-competitive inhibition desensitizes AMPARs to activation and prevents positive allosteric modulation. We dissected the noncompetitive inhibition mechanism of action by capturing AMPARs bound to glutamate and the prototypical negative allosteric modulator, GYKI-52466, with cryo-electron microscopy. Noncompetitive inhibition by GYKI-52466, which binds in the transmembrane collar region surrounding the ion channel, negatively modulates AMPARs by decoupling glutamate binding in the ligand binding domain from the ion channel. Furthermore, during allosteric competition between negative and positive modulators, negative allosteric modulation by GKYI-52466 outcompetes positive allosteric modulators to control AMPAR function. Our data provide a new framework for understanding allostery of AMPARs and foundations for rational design of therapeutics targeting AMPARs in neurological diseases.
