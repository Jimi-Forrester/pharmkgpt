10743522|t|Association between delirium and death in AIDS patients.
10743522|a|The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between delirium and death in AIDS patients. Forty-one patients admitted to a combination skilled nursing and assisted-living facility in 1994 were included in the retrospective chart review. Patients were grouped according to the presence versus absence of delirium during the first week of admission. Demographic characteristics and medical morbidity of the two groups were compared using the Chi-square statistic. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate survival functions during the study period for the delirious and nondelirious groups. Nine patients (22%) were found to have an episode of delirium in the first week of admission. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics or medical morbidity between the delirious and nondelirious groups. Median days from admission to death for those with delirium (10 days) versus those without delirium (135 days) was significantly different (log rank = 19.03; p < 0.0001). Authors concluded that delirium is a marker for decreased survival in this sample of AIDS patients. Future research needs to demonstrate whether improved care of AIDS patients can prevent delirium or limit adverse outcomes associated with it.
