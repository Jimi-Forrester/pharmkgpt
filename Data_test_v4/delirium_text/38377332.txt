38377332|t|Phenibut:an Illegal Food Supplement With Psychotropic Effects and Health Risks.
38377332|a|BACKGROUND: Phenibut (beta-phenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an analog of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Like gabapentin and pregabalin, it inhibits alpha2-delta-subunits of voltage-dependent presynaptic calcium channels. The potential harm resulting from the use of these gabapentinoids is currently a matter of debate. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search and on cases reported to the Giftinformationszentrum-Nord (GIZ-Nord), a poison information center at the University of Gottingen, Germany. RESULTS: Phenibut is a prescription drug in Russia but its production, possession, use, trafficking, or administration is illegal in Germany. The phenibut toxicity syndrome resembles that of gabapentinoids and GABA mimetics: benzodiazepine-like withdrawal symptoms including epileptic seizures, delirium and paradoxical activation have been described, as have cases of abuse and dependence. A few cases of use in the setting of multidrug abuse, and of phenibut-related death, have been described to date in the USA. The GIZ-Nord received 17 inquiries about phenibut, 55 about gabapentin, and 126 about pregabalin over the period 2008-2022. Over the same period, the GIZ-Nord was informed of 1207 cases involving Z substances and 4324 involving benzodiazepines. In the majority of the registered intoxications, including those with phenibut, the symptoms were mild. Overdoses of phenibut (2-100 g) were reported in 15 of the 17 cases; 8 of the persons who had taken an overdose were somnolent. In such cases, observation in intensive care was recommended. Respiratory depression or coma was not encountered in any case, not even in the patient who had taken 100 g of phenibut. CONCLUSION: Phenibut causes symptoms resembling those of gabapentinoid and benzodiazepine use. There have been reports of phenibut use in combination with other psychotropic drugs; in particular, its use together with opiates could increase the risk of coma and respiratory depression. No deaths due to phenibut intoxication have been published in Germany or elsewhere in Western Europe, although such cases may have been overlooked, as this drug is still largely unknown to Western medicine.
