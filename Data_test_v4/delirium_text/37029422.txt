37029422|a|BACKGROUND: Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) injury refers to an obstruction in the retinal blood supply followed by reperfusion. Although the molecular mechanism underlying the ischemic pathological cascade is not fully understood, neuroinflammation plays a crucial part in the mortality of retinal ganglion cells. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), molecular docking, and transfection assay were used to explore the effectiveness and pathogenesis of N,N-dimethyl-3beta-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA)-treated mice with RIR injury and DMHCA-treated microglia after oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). RESULTS: DMHCA could suppress inflammatory gene expression and attenuate neuronal lesions, restoring the retinal structure in vivo. Using scRNA-seq on the retina of DMHCA-treated mice, we provided novel insights into RIR immunity and demonstrated nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin1/Ninj 1) as a promising treatment target for RIR. Moreover, the expression of Ninj1, which was increased in RIR injury and OGD/R-treated microglia, was downregulated in the DMHCA-treated group. DMHCA suppressed the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathways induced by OGD/R, which was undermined by the NF-kappaB pathway agonist betulinic acid. Overexpressed Ninj1 reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic function of DMHCA. Molecular docking indicated that for Ninj1, DMHCA had a low binding energy of - 6.6 kcal/mol, suggesting highly stable binding. CONCLUSION: Ninj1 may play a pivotal role in microglia-mediated inflammation, while DMHCA could be a potential treatment strategy against RIR injury.
