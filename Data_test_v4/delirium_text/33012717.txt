33012717|a|We present a case of COVID-19 in an immunocompetent patient with risk factors for severe disease who recovered after prolonged swab positivity of 61 days postsymptom onset without significant respiratory and organ dysfunction. We discuss the reasons behind her prolonged swab positivity in the context of current SARS-CoV-2 knowledge, document the trend in her inflammatory response and swab results, and discuss the implications swab positivity had on her isolation and recovery.
