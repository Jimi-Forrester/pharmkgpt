30400093|a|BACKGROUND: Although inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the effects of systemic inflammation on brain amyloid deposition remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association of midlife and late-life systemic inflammation with late-life brain amyloid levels in a community sample of non-demented older adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) - PET Study. METHODS: 339 non-demented participants (age: 75 [SD 5]) were recruited from the ARIC Study to undergo florbetapir PET (amyloid) imaging. Blood levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, were measured 22 years (Visit 2), 16 years (Visit 4), and up to 2 years before PET imaging (Visit 5). Elevated brain amyloid deposition (standardized uptake value ratio >1.2) was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Our primary analyses found no association of midlife and late-life CRP with late-life brain amyloid levels. However, in secondary stratified analyses, we found that higher midlife (Visit 2) CRP was associated with elevated amyloid among males (OR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.13-2.42), and among white (OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.75), but not African American, participants (p-interactions<0.05). Among male participants, those who maintained high CRP levels (>=3 mg/L) throughout mid- and late-life were most likely to have elevated brain amyloid (OR, 8.81; 95% CI: 1.23, 62.91). CONCLUSIONS: Although our primary analysis does not support an association between systemic inflammation and brain amyloid deposition, we found evidence for sex- and race-dependent associations. However, findings from subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution.
