15534454|a|The use of haloperidol to induce sedation and control agitation in the acutely ill adult patient has been well documented. There are few reports, however, of the use of this neuroleptic agent to control the severe delirium and agitation that may occur in critically ill pediatric patients or acute pediatric patients suffering from burn wounds. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of the use of haloperidol by completing a retrospective chart review of 855 acutely ill children treated consecutively during the period from April 1999 to May 2002, during which time 26 children received haloperidol. The safe use of haloperidol was assessed by documenting any adverse effects or reactions observed after the administration of the drug. Of patients given haloperidol, 23% had adverse effects. This result suggests that the use of haloperidol to treat the acutely agitated and delirious pediatric burn patients is fraught with a number of difficulties and is not completely safe and effective.
