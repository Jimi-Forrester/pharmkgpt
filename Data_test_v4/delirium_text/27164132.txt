27164132|a|Selenium (Se) status varies worldwide as a result of natural variation of Se content in soils, dietary pattern, and the presence of SNPs. Further, Se status in Brazilians and its relationship between genetic variation and Se biomarkers is unknown. This work investigated the association between SNPs in glutathione peroxidase genes and biomarkers of Se status in healthy Brazilians. The study was conducted in 116 healthy adults in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Plasma and erythrocyte Se were measured by HGFAAS. Erythrocyte GPx (eGPx) activity was measured spectrometrically in a biochemical analyzer. Genotypes were determined by real-time PCR using Taqman( ) Assays. eGPx activity was higher in females compared with males. Lower erythrocyte Se concentrations were found in heterozygous GC carriers for GPX1 rs8179169. eGPx activity was higher in females with the common genotypes, except for rs8179169. GC carriers for rs8179169 had lower erythrocyte Se in both genders, and only male carriers of the variant alleles of both rs1050450 and rs1800668 had higher eGPx activity. In conclusion, the genotype for SNPs in GPX1 and gender affected biomarkers of Se status in this pilot study with healthy Brazilians.
