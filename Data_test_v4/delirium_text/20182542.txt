20182542|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a 34.2 kDa glycosylated protein characterized by its wide tissue distribution and multiple functions. ApoE has been widely studied in lipid metabolism, cardiocerebrovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, and so forth. Recently, a growing body of evidence has pointed to nonlipid related properties of apoE, including suppression of T cell proliferation, regulation of macrophage function, facilitation of lipid antigen presentation by CD1 molecules to natural killer T (NKT) cells, and modulation of inflammation and oxidation. By these properties, apoE impacts physiology and pathophysiology at multiple levels. The present paper summarizes updated studies on the immunoregulatory function of apoE, with special focus on isoform-specific effects of apoE on Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN).
