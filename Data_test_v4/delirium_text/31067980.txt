31067980|t|Structural Brain Changes in Delirium: An Integrative Review.
31067980|a|Delirium is a serious complication of acute illness. Little is known, however, regarding the neurobiology of delirium, largely due to challenges in studying the complex inpatient population. Neuroimaging is one noninvasive method that can be used to study structural and functional brain abnormalities associated with delirium. The purpose of this integrative literature review was to examine the content and quality of current structural neuroimaging evidence in delirium. After meeting inclusion criteria, 11 articles were included in the review. Commonly noted structural abnormalities were impaired white matter integrity, brain atrophy, ischemic lesions, edema, and inflammation. Findings demonstrated widespread alterations in several brain structures. Limitations of the studies in this review included small sample sizes, inappropriate or questionable delirium measurements, and failure to consider confounding variables. This review provides insight into possible structural changes responsible for the signs and symptoms seen in patients with delirium, but more high-quality studies are needed.
