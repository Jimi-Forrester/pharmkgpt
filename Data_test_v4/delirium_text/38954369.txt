38954369|a|BACKGROUND: Whether there is a sex difference in the outcome of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains controversial, and clarifying the role of women in postoperative cerebral ischemic events can help us to understand its relationship with poor prognosis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the three aspects of sex differences, postoperative cerebral ischemia, and poor prognosis after aSAH. METHODS: A total of 472 patients admitted within 72 h after aSAH between January 2018 and December 2022 were included. We systematically analyzed the characteristics of sex differences in aSAH and explored the relationship between delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), surgery-related cerebral infarction (SRCI), and poor prognosis (modified Rankin Scale > 2). RESULTS: Compared with women, men were in worse condition and had more intracerebral hematoma (p = 0.001) on admission, whereas women were older (p < 0.001) and had more multiple aneurysms (p = 0.002). During hospitalization, men were more likely to experience emergency intubation (p = 0.036) and tracheotomy (p = 0.013). Women achieved functional independence at discharge at a similar rate to men (p = 0.394). Among postoperative complications, the incidence of DCI (22% vs. 12%, p = 0.01) and urinary tract infection (p = 0.022) was significantly higher in women. After adjusting for age, multivariable regression analysis showed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.139, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.027-4.457), preoperative rerupture (OR 12.240, 95% CI 1.491-100.458), pulmonary infection (OR 2.297, 95% CI 1.070-4.930), external ventricular drainage placement (OR 4.382, 95% CI 1.550-12.390), bacteremia (OR 14.943, 95% CI 1.412-158.117), SRCI (OR 8.588, 95% CI 4.092-18.023), venous thrombosis (OR 5.283, 95% CI 1.859-15.013), higher modified Fisher grades (p = 0.003), and Hunt-Hess grades (p = 0.035) were associated with poor prognosis, whereas DCI (OR 1.394, 95% CI 0.591-3.292) was not an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. The proportion of patients who fully recovered from cerebral ischemia was higher in the DCI group (p < 0.001) compared with the SRCI group, and more patients were discharged with modified Rankin Scale > 2 in the SRCI group (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Women have a higher incidence of DCI, but there is no sex difference in outcomes after aSAH, and poor prognosis is associated with worse admission condition and perioperative complications. SRCI is a strong independent risk factor for poor prognosis, whereas DCI is not.
