31057237|t|A comparison of oral dexmedetomidine and oral midazolam as premedicants in children.
31057237|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Midazolam has been the most popular oral premedicant in children despite its side effects. Dexmedetomidine with its favorable clinical profile is a suitable alternative, but with limited research. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine and midazolam as oral premedicants in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty children of the American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I scheduled for elective herniotomy were included in this prospective randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine 4 mug/kg (Group A, n = 40) or midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (Group B, n = 40) orally 40 min before induction. Pre-operative sedation, response to parental separation and venepuncture, emergence agitation, recovery nurse satisfaction, and side effects were compared between the two groups. Quantitative data were compared using unpaired Student's t-test and categorical variables with Chi-square test. RESULTS: Pre-operative sedation and response to parental separation and venepuncture were similar between the two groups. Group A had a significantly lower incidence and severity of emergence agitation (P = 0.000). Recovery nurse satisfaction was significantly higher in Group A (P = 0.002). However, incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was found to be more in Group A (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Premedication with oral dexmedetomidine is as effective as oral midazolam in providing sedation and anxiolysis in children. Dexmedetomidine in addition reduces the incidence and severity of emergence agitation.
