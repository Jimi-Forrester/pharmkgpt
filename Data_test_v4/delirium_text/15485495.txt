15485495|t|Detecting bioactive amyloid beta peptide species in Alzheimer's disease.
15485495|a|Amyloid beta peptide (A beta) is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the form of A beta that induces neurodegeneration in AD, defined here as bioactive A beta, is not clear. Preventing the formation of bioactive A beta or inactivating previously formed bioactive A beta should be a promising approach to treat AD. We have previously developed a cell-based assay for the detection of bioactive A beta species. The assay is based upon the correlation between the ability of an A beta sample to induce a unique form of cellular MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] formazan exocytosis, and its ability to activate glia and induce neurotoxicity. Here, we show that this cell-based assay is not only useful for a cellular model of A beta amyloidogenesis but is also able to detect bioactive A beta species in a transgenic mouse model of AD, as well as in post-mortem cortex samples from AD patients. There is a good correlation between the extent of glia activation and the level of bioactive A beta species in the mouse brain. A promising deuteroporphyrin that can inactivate bioactive A beta species was also identified using this assay. These novel insights and findings should have important implications for the treatment of AD.
