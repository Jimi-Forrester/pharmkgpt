31293845|a|INTRODUCTION: Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is a major contributing factor to increased mortality, length of stay, and cost of care. Psychotropic medications may often require extensive tapering to prevent withdrawal symptoms; during ICU admission, home psychotropics are frequently held which may precipitate acute drug withdrawal and subsequent delirium. METHODS: This is a single-center, observational, retrospective chart review. The primary endpoint was the total number of new-start antipsychotics used to treat ICU delirium. Secondary endpoints included use of restraints, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 2334 charts were reviewed for inclusion; 55 patients were categorized into each group. There was no statistically significant difference in the requirement for new-start antipsychotics (P = 1.0), restraint use (P = .057), or ICU length of stay (P = .71). There was a statistically significant decrease in hospital length of stay (P = .048). DISCUSSION: Early reinitiation was associated with a decrease in hospital length of stay but was not associated with a decrease in the number of new-start antipsychotics, use of restraints, or ICU length of stay.
