37807599|t|H - 13 Examining the Cultural Sensitivity of a Novel Neuropsychological Assessment in Distinguishing between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) in Hispanic Older Adults.
37807599|a|OBJECTIVE: Common neuropsychological measures are not sensitive in capturing early cognitive changes associated with prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (ad) and vary across cultural groups. The Cognitive Stress Test (CST) is a novel assessment with high levels of sensitivity and specificity that measures maximum learning, proactive interference (PSI), retroactive interference, and the ability to recover from PSI (FrPSI). Authors evaluated the utility of the CST in distinguishing between aMCI versus CU Hispanic older adults. METHOD: 18 aMCI and 15 CU older adults (mean age = 73.06; SD = 7.94, 42.4% male) were compared using the CST. Participants were categorized into the aforementioned groups using the Clinical Dementia Rating and results of neuropsychological evaluation. CST was not used in categorization to avoid circularity. CST includes the presentation of 18 target words from two semantically related wordlists (occupations, household items, and transportation) and assesses FrPSI over repeated trials. RESULTS: Data was analyzed utilizing an ROC curve to measure differences between CU and aMCI. The ROC curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.92, indicating that PSI was significant in differentiating participants. Findings suggest that PSI may be an early feature of aMCI groups who are at higher risk of progression to clinical ad. CONCLUSIONS: The CST was deemed to be an effective and culturally sensitive memory measurement tool among Hispanic older adults. In future studies, this paradigm may be particularly useful in deconstructing cognitive processes that can be compared to structural and functional MRI, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and emerging plasma biomarkers of ad.
