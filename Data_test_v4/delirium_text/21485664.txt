21485664|a|Melatonin is a substance chiefly produced by the pineal gland and has a key role in the sleep-wake cycle. It also has an important antioxidant role. Exogenous melatonin has a short half-life and is available in a range of preparations. Newer analogues targeted for the recently discovered melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors have also been developed. Exogenous melatonin is used as a resynchronisation agent in jet lag and for other sleep disturbances. Perioperatively, melatonin has been used as a premedicant, sedative and analgesic. It decreases paediatric emergence delirium. The antioxidant properties of melatonin are being investigated for use in sepsis and reperfusion injuries. It would appear that patients on melatonin supplements should continue taking them perioperatively because there may be benefits. Melatonin and its analogues will be increasingly encountered in the perioperative setting.
