29253717|a|Recent reports in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research suggest that alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression are associated with disease pathology. Our previous studies suggest that A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) expression is important in AD and could be modulated by an extended regulatory region that includes the 3' untranslated region. In this study, we have investigated the role of trans-acting factors in ADAM10 gene regulation. Our study shows that miRNA-140-5p has enhanced expression in the AD postmortem brain hippocampus using high-throughput miRNA arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, we have also seen that miRNA-140-5p seed sequence is present on 3' untranslated region of both ADAM10 and its transcription factor SOX2. The specific interaction of miRNA-140-5p with both ADAM10 and SOX2 signifies high regulatory importance of this miRNA in controlling ADAM10 expression. Thus, this investigation unravels mechanisms underlying ADAM10 downregulation by miR-140-5p and suggests that dysfunctional regulation of ADAM10 expression is exacerbated by AD-related neurotoxic effects. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact of trans-acting factors in the modulation of AD pathophysiology.
