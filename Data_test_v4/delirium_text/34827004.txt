34827004|t|Assessment of the lamina cribrosa in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
34827004|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of the lamina cribrosa thickness (LCT) and lamina cribrosa depth (LCD) in adolescence with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and compare with those receiving methylphenidate (MPH) and healthy controls. METHODS: Fifty-five children with ADHD (9.23 +- 1.92 years, mean +- standard deviation), 41 children with ADHD given MPH (9.24 +- 1.84 years), and 86 healthy controls (9.95 +- 2.16 years) were recruited for the study. All subjects were subjected to a complete eye exam and optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to assess LCT and LCD. The severity of ADHD symptoms was evaluated by using parent-report measures, including Conners's Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R: S) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: Parent Form (SDQ: P). RESULTS: The study showed a significant finding between the research groups with regard to LCT. LCT was shown to be significantly increased in ADHD subjects given MPH compared with the controls. However, LCD was not significantly different between cohorts. Also, a significant inverse correlation was found between the SDQ: P-Emotional Problems Subscale and LCT (r = -0.253; P = 0.030) in ADHD patients. CONCLUSION: Changes in lamina cribrosa (LC) in ADHD children receiving MPH suggest that the mechanism of action for MPH may target developing LC structures. More studies to define the relationship between MPH medications and the LC variations are defensible.
