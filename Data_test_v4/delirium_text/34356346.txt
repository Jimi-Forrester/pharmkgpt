34356346|t|Activation of Adenosine A1 Receptor in Ischemic Stroke: Neuroprotection by Tetrahydroxy Stilbene Glycoside as an Agonist.
34356346|a|Ischemic stroke is the main cause of death/disability, posing a great menace to human health. Though efforts to search for therapeutic drugs are ongoing, few of them have succeeded. Adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) activation could ameliorate ischemic injury, representing a very tempting target for stroke treatment. Tetrahydroxy stilbene glycoside (TSG), a potent antioxidant from the well-known Chinese herb Polygonum multiflorum Thunb., has been reported to have notable neuroprotective activities but the underlying mechanisms are elusive. This study investigated the mechanism of TSG focusing on A1R. TSG markedly decreased mortality, neurological deficit score, cerebral infarct size and brain water content of MCAO rats, and ameliorated the disorders in purine metabolism, energy metabolism and antioxidative defense system. TSG helped the survival of SH-SY5Y cells in OGD/R by alleviating oxidative stress and glutamate release, and by maintaining calcium homeostasis. TSG effects were abolished by A1R antagonist DPCPX. Docking and binding assays confirmed the binding of TSG with A1R. In addition, TSG upregulated the A1R level lowered by MCAO and OGD/R. The downstream signals of A1R activation, ERK1/2, HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB contributed to the neuroprotection of TSG. Moreover, void of "well-known" cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists, TSG showcased its great potential for stroke treatment.
