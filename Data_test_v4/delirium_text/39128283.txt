39128283|t|An optimized UPLC-MS/MS method for human plasma amyloid-beta 42 and 40 measurement and application in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
39128283|a|Critical events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) involve an imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides from the brain. The ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 in plasma was useful for evaluating AD, but quantification is limited by factors including preanalytical analyte loss and insufficient sensitivity. The availability of a targeted UPLC-MS/MS method with adequate analytical sensitivity and accurate values traceable to the SI units is essential for implementing a strategy for assay standardization. A targeted UPLC-MS/MS method for plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 quantification was developed based on selected characteristic peptides spiked by 15N-labeled Abeta. The calibrator was assigned using an amino acid analysis reference method trace to SI units. UPLC-MS/MS conditions and sample preparation procedures were assessed. 59 plasma samples comparison were used to evaluate immunoassays. Additionally, two clinical cohorts were selected for diagnostic performance evaluation. The LOQ of Abeta42 and Abeta40 is 10 pg mL-1 and 20 pg mL-1, respectively. The linear range was 10-500 pg mL-1 for Abeta42 and 20-1000 pg mL-1 for Abeta40, recoveries between 95.3 % and 108.2 % for Abeta42, 93.2 % and 104.1 % for Abeta40, imprecisions were <7 %. The accuracy of method was validated by analysis of a certified reference material. Clinical cohorts for diagnostic performance evaluation shown that the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 to differentiate between AD and CN were 0.767 and 0.799, respectively. A robust UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and demonstrated that suitable for a wide range of plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40. Applied to the investigation of clinically discrepant results, this method can act as an arbiter of the concentration of plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 present.
