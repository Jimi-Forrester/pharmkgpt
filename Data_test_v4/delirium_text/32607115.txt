32607115|a|BACKGROUND: Continuing medical education (CME) is an integral part of nursing professionalization, which can be effective in the development of nursing behavior. E-learning can play an important role in CME programs. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an E-learning program in increasing the nurses' knowledge and behavior regarding care for venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred nurses were selected via convenience sampling method and divided into E-learning and traditional education groups. All nurses had access to the Internet, as well as adequate Internet literacy. Each nurse in the E-learning group received three didactic files during the intervention (four weeks), which focused on the VTE risk assessment, methods of prophylaxis, prophylaxis guidelines, diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, and patient education. On the other hand, nurses in the traditional education group were taught traditionally by an expert lecturer, who used audiovisual materials for teaching. A pretest-posttest analysis and a checklist were used to evaluate the impact of interventions in the groups. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were also used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The comparison of knowledge level between the groups showed that E-learning is not superior to traditional learning methods. The mean changes in the nurses' behavior was 3.16+-1.49 in the E-learning group and 2.77+-1.26 in the conventional education group. Statistical analysis showed a significant relationship between the score changes and E-learning. CONCLUSION: Integration of E-learning in CME programs, besides attendance of traditional courses, can be an effective learning method. We suggest that future studies compare the effects of these methods.
