36281665|a|BACKGROUND: Screening data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies provide a unique opportunity to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in cognitively unimpaired elderly with and without elevated cerebral amyloid. OBJECTIVES: To compare screening MRI findings, such as ARIA, in the cognitively unimpaired potential participants of a clinical trial with and without elevated cerebral amyloid. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of structural MRI findings in screening data from the A4 and LEARN studies. SETTING: The A4 Study is a multi-center international clinical trial. The LEARN Study is a multi center observational study in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Clinically normal older adults (65-85 years) with elevated cerebral amyloid (Abeta+; n = 1250, A4) and without elevated cerebral amyloid (Abeta-; n = 538, LEARN). MEASUREMENTS: Participants underwent florbetapir positron emission tomography for Abeta+/- classification. A centrally read 3T MRI to assess for study eligibility was conducted on study qualified MRI scanners. RESULTS: No ARIA-effusions (ARIA-E) was detected on screening MRI in the Abeta+ or Abeta- cohorts. At least one ARIA-H (microhemorrhages [MCH] or superficial siderosis [SS]) was present in 18% of the Abeta+ cohort compared with 8% in Abeta- (P < 0.001). In the Abeta+ cohort, approximately 2% of screening MRIs demonstrated MCH >=4 compared with 0% in Abeta-. The presence of two apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOEepsilon4) alleles (vs no epsilon4 alleles) in the Abeta+ cohort increased the odds for presence of MCH (odds ratio [OR] = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.23 to 3.27, P = 0.004). Cortical infarctions (4% vs 0%) and subcortical infarctions (10% vs 1%) were observed at statistically significantly higher prevalence in the Abeta+ cohort compared with Abeta- (P < 0.001). Females showed reduced odds of MCH in the Abeta+ cohort by a factor of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: ARIA-E is rare in cognitively unimpaired Abeta+ and Abeta- populations prior to anti-amyloid drug intervention. ARIA-H in Abeta+ was greater than in Abeta- populations.
