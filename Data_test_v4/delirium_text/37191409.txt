37191409|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the global healthcare system, with the elderly population being particularly vulnerable. This comprehensive review synthesizes the findings from publications in "Aging and Disease", highlighting the unique challenges older adults encountered during the pandemic and providing solutions thereof. These studies provide invaluable insights into the elderly population's vulnerabilities and needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The susceptibility to the virus in older individuals remains debatable, and research on the clinical picture of COVID-19 in older populations has yielded insights into clinical features, molecular mechanisms, and potential therapeutic strategies. This review intends to shed light on the need of sustaining physical and mental well-being among older adults during the periods of lockdown by extensively exploring these concerns and emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and support systems for this population. Ultimately, the findings of these studies contribute to developing more effective and comprehensive approaches to managing and mitigating the risks posed by the pandemic to the elderly.
