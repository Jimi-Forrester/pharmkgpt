38952381|t|Two novel nomograms predict 30-day mortality after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
38952381|a|Background: With the development of surgical techniques and medical equipment, the mortality rate of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been declining year by year, but there is a lack of convenient and accurate predictive models. This study aims to use two nomograms to predict 30-day mortality after off-pump CABG. Methods: Patients with isolated off-pump CABG from January 2016 to January 2021 were consecutively enrolled. Potential predictive factors were first screened by lasso regression, and then predictive models were constructed by multivariate logistic regression. To earlier identify high-risk patients, two nomograms were constructed for predicting mortality risk before and after surgery. Results: A total of 1840 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 30-day mortality was 3.97 % (73/1840) in this cohort. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that age, BMI<18.5 kg/m2, surgical time, creatinine, LVEF, history of previous stroke, and major adverse intraoperative events (including conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass or implantation of intra-aortic balloon pump) were independently associated with 30-day mortality. Model 1 contained preoperative and intraoperative variables, and the AUC was 0.836 (p < 0.001). The AUC of the K-fold validation was 0.819. Model 2 was only constructed by preoperative information. The AUC was 0.745 (p < 0.001). The AUC of the K-fold validation was 0.729. The predictive power of Model 1 was significantly higher than the SinoScore (DeLong's test p < 0.001). Conclusions: The two novel nomograms could be conveniently and accurately used to predict the risk of 30-day mortality after isolated off-pump CABG.
