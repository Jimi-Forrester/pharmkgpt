33294126|t|Posttranslational Modifications in Ferroptosis.
33294126|a|Ferroptosis was first coined in 2012 to describe the form of regulated cell death (RCD) characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. To date, ferroptosis has been implicated in many diseases, such as carcinogenesis, degenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases), ischemia-reperfusion injury, and cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have identified numerous targets involved in ferroptosis; for example, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and p53 induce while glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2 (AIFM2, also known as FSP1) inhibit ferroptosis. At least three major pathways (the glutathione-GPX4, FSP1-coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and GTP cyclohydrolase-1- (GCH1-) tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathways) have been identified to participate in ferroptosis regulation. Recent advances have also highlighted the crucial roles of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins in ferroptosis. Here, we summarize the recently discovered knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, particularly the roles of PTMs in ferroptosis regulation.
