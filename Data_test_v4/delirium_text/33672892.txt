33672892|t|Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ABU) in Elderly: Prevalence, Virulence, Phylogeny, Antibiotic Resistance and Complement C3 in Urine.
33672892|a|Background: The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) increases with age and is most common for persons 80 years of age and above and in elderly living in nursing homes. The distinction between ABU and urinary tract infection (UTI) is often difficult, especially in individuals, who are unable to communicate their symptoms, and there is a lack of objective methods to distinguish between the two entities. This can lead to overuse of antibiotics, which results in the selection and dissemination of antibiotic resistant isolates. Materials and methods: From voided midstream urine samples of 211 participants >=60 years old from nursing homes, an activity center and a general practitioners clinic, we collected 19 ABU, 16 UTI and 22 control urine samples and compared them with respect to levels of complement component C3 in urine as determined by an ELISA assay relative to creatinine levels in the same urine samples, as measured by a creatinine assay. Further, we studied all Escherichia coli isolates for selected virulence genes by multiplex PCR, and by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for genotypes and phylogenetic clustering. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by microtiter broth dilution. Results: We identified a prevalence of ABU of 18.9% in nursing home residents, whereas ABU was only found in 4% of elderly living in the community (p < 0.001). E. coli from ABU patients were significantly more antibiotic resistant than E. coli from UTIs (p = 0.01). Prevalence of classical virulence genes, detected by multiplex PCR, was similar in E. coli isolates from ABU and UTI patients. Whole-genome sequencing of the E. coli isolates showed no specific clustering of ABU isolates compared to UTI isolates. Three isolates from three different individuals from one of the nursing homes showed signs of transmission. We demonstrated a significantly increased level of C3/creatinine ratio in ABU and UTI samples compared to healthy controls; however, there was no significant difference between the ABU and UTI group with respect to C3 level, or virulence factor genes. Conclusion: ABU was significantly more prevalent in the elderly residing in nursing homes than in the elderly living at home. Antibiotic resistance was more prevalent in E. coli from nursing homes than in UTI isolates, but there was no difference in prevalence of virulence associated genes between the two groups and no phylogenetic clustering, as determined by WGS relative to the two types of E. coli bacteriuria. The similar complement C3 response in ABU and UTI patients may indicate that ABU should be reconsidered as an infection albeit without symptoms.
