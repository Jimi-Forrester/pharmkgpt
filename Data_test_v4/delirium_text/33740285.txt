33740285|t|Berberine ameliorates neuronal AD-like change via activating Pi3k/PGCepsilon pathway.
33740285|a|IR (insulin resistance) in diabetic brain gave rise to the generation of toxic factor Abeta42 and axon collapse which were the marker of AD (Alzheimer's disease)-like lesions in the circumstance of diabetes mellitus. But the underling molecular mechanism was not clear. Chronic HGHI (high glucose and high insulin) exposure accelerates IR has been reported in type II diabetes models. Berberine has been shown to promising effect for IR in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates the protective effect and the underlying mechanism of berberine on HGHI-induced IR. HGHI-induced cells were used to mimic the hyperinsulinemia resulting in IR. Berberine was used to uncover the mechanisms for the treatment of hyperinsulinemia in IR model. Morris water maze (MWM), PET imaging, CCK8 assay, ELISA assay, glucose kits, microscopy, and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the protective effects of berberine. Berberine-improved HGHI-induced IR was correlated with the increase of glucose application in neurons. Meanwhile, the expressions of Pi3K, as well as GLUT3, PKCepsilon, and APP were downregulated in the model, while p-IRS Ser307 was upregulated compared with Normal group. Fortunately, these scenes were reversed by berberine administration. Furthermore, berberine decreased GSK3beta Y216 expressions, inhibited the production of oligomer Abeta42 and extended neuronal axon. The monomeric berberine treatment improves IR that may be involved in glucose effective application, rectifying the related proteins of the aberrant insulin pathway. Additionally, it suppressed the generation of Abeta42 and ameliorated neuron axon damage. Finally, berberine improves DM (diabetes mellitus)-induced cognitive impairment.
