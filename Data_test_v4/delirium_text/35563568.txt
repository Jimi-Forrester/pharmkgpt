35563568|t|The Potential Benefits of Dietary Polyphenols for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.
35563568|a|Peripheral nerves are frequently affected by lesions caused by trauma (work accidents, car incidents, combat injuries) and following surgical procedures (for instance cancer resection), resulting in loss of motor and sensory function with lifelong impairments. Irrespective of the intrinsic capability of the peripheral nervous system for regeneration, spontaneous or surgically supported regeneration is often unsatisfactory with the limited functional success of nerve repair. For this reason, many efforts have been made to improve the regeneration process. Beyond innovative microsurgical methods that, in certain cases, are necessary to repair nerve injuries, different nonsurgical treatment approaches and adjunctive therapies have been investigated to enhance nerve regeneration. One possibility could be taking advantage of a healthy diet or lifestyle and their relation with proper body functions. Over the years, scientific evidence has been obtained on the benefits of the intake of polyphenols or polyphenol-rich foods in humans, highlighting the neuroprotective effects of these compounds in many neurodegenerative diseases. In order to improve the available knowledge about the potential beneficial role of polyphenols in the process of peripheral nerve regeneration, this review assessed the biological effects of polyphenol administration in supporting and promoting the regenerative process after peripheral nerve injury.
