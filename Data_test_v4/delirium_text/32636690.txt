32636690|t|Neuro-ophthalmic Manifestations of Wernicke Encephalopathy.
32636690|a|Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a life-threatening but reversible syndrome resulting from acute thiamine deficiency that is frequently overlooked and underdiagnosed. It is classically characterized by a triad of ocular dysfunction, ataxia, and altered mental status. However, less than 1/3 patients have the complete triad, so it is crucial to have a high index of suspicion. Awareness of the early signs of WE is essential to prevent clinical progression, as patients with the full triad already have a profoundly thiamine-deficient state. This review highlights the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of WE to guide the clinician in identifying the condition. In addition, we provide an update regarding the clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, neuroimaging and laboratory findings, treatment options, and prognosis of WE.
