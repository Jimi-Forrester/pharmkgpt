28229638|a|Recently, insulin has been used as a pro-cognitive agent for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), because of its ability to cross the brain-blood barrier (BBB) by a saturable transport system. This study has been designed to evaluate the effects of intranasal insulin regimen, as a bypass system of BBB, on spatial memory in amyloid-beta (Abeta) model of AD in rat. Unilateral infusion of Abeta25-35 (10 nmol/2 microl/rat) into the lateral ventricular region of brain was used to produce a rat model of AD. After a 24-h recovery period, rats received insulin or vehicle via intraperitoneal or intranasal route (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 IU) for 14 days. Memory function in rats was assessed by Morris water maze test, with 5 days of training and consequent probe test protocol. Different doses of intraperitoneal insulin did not have a significant effect on learning and memory in AD rats. However, intranasal insulin at doses of 0.2 and 0.3 IU improved the learning and memory in Abeta-received rats. In conclusion, intranasal insulin as a non-invasive strategy improves spatial learning and memory in AD model.
