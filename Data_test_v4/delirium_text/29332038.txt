29332038|t|Sex Influences the Accuracy of Subjective Memory Complaint Reporting in Older Adults.
29332038|a|Subjective memory complaints (SMC) are required when diagnosing amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), although their relationship with objective memory performance and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains unclear. We investigated whether the sex of the patient/participant moderates these associations. Participants were 940 normal control (NC) and aMCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. SMC were assessed via the memory scale of the Everyday Cognition questionnaire. Discrepancy scores were calculated between self- and informant-reports and categorized into "overestimates," "comparable estimates", and "underestimates" of SMC. We conducted linear and logistic regressions to examine the interaction of sex with self- and informant-reported SMC and discrepancy group on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) Immediate and Delayed Recall and on PET measures of amyloid-beta (Abeta) positivity. Diagnosis-stratified analyses were also conducted. Overall, there were sex by self- and informant-reported SMC interactions for Immediate and Delayed Recall. Despite a higher proportion of "overestimates" in women, greater self- and informant-reported SMC showed a stronger relationship to poorer RAVLT scores in women versus men. Diagnosis-stratified analyses revealed that results were driven by aMCI participants. Conversely, overall, greater self- and informant-reported SMC related to greater odds of Abeta positivity regardless of sex. In diagnosis-stratified analyses, only informant-reported SMC related to Abeta positivity in aMCI. Relative to "comparable estimates," "underestimates" of SMC were associated with poorer RAVLT scores across sexes in the overall sample and in aMCI. The predictive utility of self-report SMC may be limited to women in aMCI. Sex differences should be considered when evaluating SMC.
