The current study aimed to investigate the influence of new tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives on in vitro model of neuroinflammation and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: The potential anti-inflammatory effect of new tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives (TP1, TP4, TP5, TP6, TP7, TP8, TP9, TP10) was assessed in SH-SY5Y cells differentiated to the neuron-like phenotype incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (5 or 50 mug/ml) or THP-1 microglial cell culture supernatant using MTT, DCF-DA, Griess, and fast halo (FHA) assays. Additionally, for cultures preincubated with 50 microg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cyclooxygenase (COX) activity assay was performed. Finally, the potential ability of tested compounds to cross the BBB was evaluated by computational studies. Molecular docking was performed with the TLR4/MD-2 complex to assess the possibility of binding the tested compounds in the LPS binding pocket. Prediction of ADMET parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) was also conducted. RESULTS: The unfavorable effect of LPS and co-culture with THP-1 cells on neuronal cell viability was counteracted with TP1 and TP4 in all tested concentrations. Tested compounds reduced the oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by both LPS and microglia activation and also reduced DNA damage. Furthermore, new derivatives inhibited total COX activity. Additionally, new compounds would cross the BBB with high probability and reach concentrations in the brain not lower than in the serum. The binding affinity at the TLR4/MD-2 complex binding site of TP4 and TP8 compounds is similar to that of the drug donepezil used in Alzheimer's disease. The ADMET analysis showed that the tested compounds should not be toxic and should show high intestinal absorption. CONCLUSIONS: New tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives exert a neuroregenerative effect in the neuroinflammation model, presumably via their inhibitory influence on COX activity and reduction of oxidative and nitrosative stress.
