37107161|a|Excessive hydrogen peroxide causes oxidative stress in cells. The oxidation of two tyrosine residues in proteins can generate o,o'-dityrosine, a putative biomarker for protein oxidation, which plays critical roles in a variety of organisms. Thus far, few studies have investigated dityrosine crosslinking under endogenous or exogenous oxidative conditions at the proteome level, and its physiological function remains largely unknown. In this study, to investigate qualitative and quantitative dityrosine crosslinking, two mutant Escherichia coli strains and one mutant strain supplemented with H2O2 were used as models for endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress, respectively. By integrating high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analysis, we created the largest dityrosine crosslinking dataset in E. coli to date, identifying 71 dityrosine crosslinks and 410 dityrosine loop links on 352 proteins. The dityrosine-linked proteins are mainly involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, citrate cycle, glyoxylate, dicarboxylate metabolism, carbon metabolism, etc., suggesting that dityrosine crosslinking may play a critical role in regulating the metabolic pathways in response to oxidative stress. In conclusion, we have reported the most comprehensive dityrosine crosslinking in E. coli for the first time, which is of great significance in revealing its function in oxidative stress.
