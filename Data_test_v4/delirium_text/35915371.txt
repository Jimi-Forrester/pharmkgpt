35915371|t|Transcriptomic Profile Identifies Hippocampal Sgk1 as the Key Mediator of Ovarian Estrogenic Regulation on Spatial Learning and Memory and Abeta Accumulation.
35915371|a|Previous studies have shown that ovarian estrogens are involved in the occurrence and pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through regulation on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory; however, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated at the genomic scale. In this study, we established the postmenopausal estrogen-deficient model by ovariectomy (OVX). Then, we used high-throughput Affymetrix Clariom transcriptomics and found 143 differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of OVX mice with the absolute fold change >= 1.5 and P < 0.05. GO analysis showed that the highest enrichment was seen in long-term memory. Combined with the response to steroid hormone enrichment and GeneMANIA network prediction, the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 gene (Sgk1) was found to be the most potent candidate for ovarian estrogenic regulation. Sgk1 overexpression viral vectors (oSgk1) were then constructed and injected into the hippocampus of OVX mice. Morris water maze test revealed that the impaired spatial learning and memory induced by OVX was rescued by Sgk1 overexpression. Additionally, the altered expression of synaptic proteins and actin remodeling proteins and changes in CA1 spine density and synapse density induced by OVX were also significantly reversed by oSgk1. Moreover, the OVX-induced increase in Abeta-producing BACE1 and Abeta and the decrease in insulin degrading enzyme were significantly reversed by oSgk1. The above results show that multiple pathways and genes are involved in ovarian estrogenic regulation of the function of the hippocampus, among which Sgk1 may be a novel potent target against estrogen-sensitive hippocampal dysfunctions, such as Abeta-initiated AD.
