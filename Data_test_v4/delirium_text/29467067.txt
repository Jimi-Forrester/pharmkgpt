29467067|t|A Brief Review of Caprylidene (Axona) and Coconut Oil as Alternative Fuels in the Fight Against Alzheimer's Disease.
29467067|a|Type 3 diabetes mellitus has been coined to describe an alternative pathologic pathway of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling seen on positron-emission tomography scans in the brain of those affected by AD support this disease hypothesis. Two products-the medical food caprylidene (Axona) and coconut oil-seek to target the underlying pathology of type 3 diabetes mellitus by providing an alternative fuel source in the brain. Rather than improving glucose utilization, these two products seek to supply ketone bodies in sufficient quantities to pass through the blood-brain barrier and provide an alternative energy source to glucose. This review will provide an overview of the research behind these two modalities, as well as information necessary to ensure the safe use of these supplements.
