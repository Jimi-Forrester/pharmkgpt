38999445|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Epilepsy: Exploring Shared Pathways and Promising Biomarkers for Future Treatments.
38999445|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy represent two complex neurological disorders with distinct clinical manifestations, yet recent research has highlighted their intricate interplay. This review examines the association between AD and epilepsy, with particular emphasis on late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology, increasingly acknowledged as a prodrome of AD. It delves into epidemiology, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical features, diagnostic characteristics, treatment strategies, and emerging biomarkers to provide a comprehensive understanding of this relationship. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted, identifying 128 relevant articles published between 2018 and 2024. Results: Findings underscore a bidirectional relationship between AD and epilepsy, indicating shared pathogenic pathways that extend beyond traditional amyloid-beta and Tau protein pathology. These pathways encompass neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, structural and network alterations, as well as molecular mechanisms. Notably, epileptic activity in AD patients may exacerbate cognitive decline, necessitating prompt detection and treatment. Novel biomarkers, such as subclinical epileptiform activity detected via advanced electroencephalographic techniques, offer promise for early diagnosis and targeted interventions. Furthermore, emerging therapeutic approaches targeting shared pathogenic mechanisms hold potential for disease modification in both AD and epilepsy. Conclusions: This review highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between AD and epilepsy, providing insights into future research directions. Clinical data and diagnostic methods are also reviewed, enabling clinicians to implement more effective treatment strategies.
