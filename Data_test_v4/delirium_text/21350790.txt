21350790|t|Zinc-induced dimerization of the amyloid-beta metal-binding domain 1-16 is mediated by residues 11-14.
21350790|a|Analysis of complex formation between amyloid-beta fragments using surface plasmon resonance biosensing and electrospray mass spectrometry reveals that region 11-14 mediates zinc-induced dimerization of amyloid-beta and may serve as a potential drug target for preventing development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.
