32121483|t|Current and Future Aspects of Multimodal Imaging, Diagnostic, and Treatment Strategies in Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Associated Aortopathies.
32121483|a|Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most frequent congenital cardiac abnormality leading to premature aortic valve apparatus dysfunction and is often associated with aortopathy. Therefore, current guidelines recommend a surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), even if many patients are deemed inoperable owing to their comorbidities and require alternatives such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, BAV variations remain challenging for procedural success. Therefore, the latest development in different imaging modalities (echocardiography, multislice-computertomographie, cardiovascular magnetic resonance) allows in-depth analysis for preprocedural risk stratification, follow up, and patient selection. Furthermore, we shed light on the latest developments in pre- and periprocedural fusion imaging as well as on current and future treatment options.
