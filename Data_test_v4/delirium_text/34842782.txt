34842782|t|Effect of the Intake of Brown Rice for Six Months on the Cognitive Function in Healthy Elderly Persons: A Study Protocol for a Pilot, Non-Randomized Controlled Trial.
34842782|a|The nutritional components of brown rice have been reported to be effective against diabetes mellitus. Recent animal studies have suggested that it is also effective in maintaining cognitive function. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect of a brown rice diet on cognitive function in individuals aged over 60 years. The study participants were recruited from a pool of individuals aged >=60 years who were using elderly care facilities. The participants were provided with four servings of brown or white rice per week for 6 months, and their cognitive function was measured before and after the intervention period. Prior to the intervention, participants tasted the white and brown rice to determine which type they would like to be offered over the 6-month period. Since rice is the staple food of the participants in this study, they were allowed to decide whether they wanted to eat white or brown rice.
