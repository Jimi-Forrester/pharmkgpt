37836657|a|Osteoarthritis is a substantial burden for patients with the disease. The known medications for the disease target the mitigation of the disease's symptoms. So, drug development for the management of osteoarthritis represents an important challenge in the medical field. This work is based on the development of a new benzofuran-pyrazole-pyridine-based compound 8 with potential anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoarthritis properties. Microanalytical and spectral data confirmed the chemical structure of compound 8. The biological assays indicated that compound 8 produces multifunctional activity as an anti-osteoarthritic candidate via inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators, including RANTES, CRP, COMP, CK, and LPO in OA rats. Histopathological and pharmacokinetic studies confirmed the safety profile of the latter molecule. Accordingly, compound 8 is considered a promising anti-osteoarthritis agent and deserves deeper investigation in future trials.
