32499112|a|Tau protein regulates, maintains and stabilizes microtubule assembly under normal physiological conditions. In certain pathological circumstances, tau is post-translationally modified predominantly via phosphorylation and glycosylation. Hyper-phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) resulted in aggregated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation. Unfortunately, absence of tau 3D structure makes difficult to understand exact mechanism involved in tau pathology. Here by using ab-initio modelling, we predicted a tau 3D structure that not only explains its binding with microtubules but also elucidates NFTs formation. O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-beta-GlcNAc) is thought to regulate tau phosphorylation on single or proximal Ser/Thr residues (called as Yin-Yang sites). In this study, we not only validate the previously described three-serine residues (208, 238 and 400) as Yin-Yang sites but also predicted 22 more possible Ser/Thr O-glycosylation sites. Among them seventeen residues were predicted as possible Yin-Yang sites and are proposed to mediate NFT formation in AD. These predicted Yin-Yang sites may act as attractive therapeutic targets for the drug development in AD. Predicted 3D structure of tau441 was highly accessible for phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation, and showed higher surface accessibility for interplay between O-beta-GlcNAc and phosphorylation modifications. Kinases and phosphatases involved in tau phosphorylation are conserved in human and other organisms. Homology modelling revealed conserved catalytic domain for both human and C. elegans O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), suggesting that transgenic C. elegans expressing human tau may be a suitable model system to study these modifications.
