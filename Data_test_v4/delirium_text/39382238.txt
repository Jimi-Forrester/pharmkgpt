39382238|t|A spectroscopic study on the Amyloid-beta interaction with clicked peptide-porphyrin conjugates: a vision toward the detection of Abeta peptides in aqueous solution.
39382238|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial form of dementia mainly affecting people in the elderly, but no effective cure is available. According to the amyloid hypothesis the aggregation of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) into oligomeric toxic species is believed to concur with the onset and progression of the disease heavily. By using a click chemistry approach, we conjugated a suitable designed peptide sequence to a metalloporphyrin moiety to obtain three hybrid peptide systems to be studied for their interact ion with Amyloid-beta peptides. The aim is to get new tools for the diagnosis and therapy in AD. The results described in this study, which were obtained through spectroscopic techniques (UV-Vis, CD, Bis-Ans and intrinsic porphyrin Fluorescence), Microfluidics (GCI) and cell biology (MTT, Live cell imaging and flow cytometry), reveal interesting features about the structure-activity relationships connecting these conjugates with the interaction with Abeta, as well as on their potential use as sensing systems. In our opinion the data reported in this paper make the porphyrin-peptide conjugates highly compelling for further exploration as spectroscopic probes to detect Abeta biomarkers in biological fluids.
