11802356|t|Influenza. How to prevent and control nursing home outbreaks.
11802356|a|Influenza is an important cause of acute respiratory illness among older adults in general and within the nursing home in particular. Epidemics typically are reported in the late fall and throughout the winter. In the nursing home, vaccination may not prevent clinical illness but can reduce the risk of pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. Atypical presentations, including delirium and nonspecific functional changes, are common in older patients. Rapid diagnosis is imperative, as early antiviral treatment and prophylaxis can control a nursing home outbreak.
