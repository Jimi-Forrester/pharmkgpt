34075783|a|Background Disrupted nighttime sleep has been associated with heart failure (HF). However, the relationship between daytime napping, an important aspect of sleep behavior commonly seen in older adults, and HF remains unclear. We sought to investigate the association of objectively assessed daytime napping and risk of incident HF during follow-up. Methods and Results We studied 1140 older adults (age, 80.7+-7.4 [SD] years; female sex, 867 [76.1%]) in the Rush Memory and Aging Project who had no HF at baseline and were followed annually for up to 14 years. Motor activity (ie, actigraphy) was recorded for  10 days at baseline. We assessed daytime napping episodes between 9 am and 7 pm objectively from actigraphy using a previously published algorithm for sleep detection. Cox proportional hazards models examined associations of daily napping duration and frequency with incident HF. Eighty-six participants developed incident HF, and the mean onset time was 5.7 years (SD, 3.4; range, 1-14). Participants who napped longer than 44.4 minutes (ie, the median daily napping duration) showed a 1.73-fold higher risk of developing incident HF than participants who napped <44.4 minutes. Consistently, participants who napped >1.7 times/day (ie, the median daily napping frequency) showed a 2.20-fold increase compared with participants who napped <1.7 times/day. These associations persisted after adjustment for covariates, including nighttime sleep, comorbidities, and cardiovascular disease/risk factors. Conclusions Longer and more frequent objective napping predicted elevated future risk of developing incident HF. Future studies are needed to establish underlying mechanisms.
