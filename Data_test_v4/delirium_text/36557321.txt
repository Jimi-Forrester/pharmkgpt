36557321|t|Urinary Metabolomics in Young Soccer Players after Winter Training Season.
36557321|a|During the off-season, soccer players in Korea attend the winter training season (WTS) to build running stamina for the next season. For young soccer players, proper recovery time is needed to prevent injury or muscle damage. In this study, urinary metabolites in young players after 1, 5, and 10 days of the WTS were analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) combined with multivariate analysis to suggest appropriate recovery times for improving their soccer skills. After NMR analysis of the urine samples obtained from young players, 79 metabolites were identified, and each group (1, 5, or 10 days after WTS) was separated from the before the WTS group in the target profiling analysis using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Of these, 15 metabolites, including 1-methylnicotinamide, 3-indoxylsulfate, galactarate, glutamate, glycerol, histamine, methylmalonate, maltose, N-phenylacetylglycine, trimethylamine, urea, 2-hydroxybutyrate, adenine, alanine, and lactate, were significantly different than those from before the WTS and were mainly involved in the urea, purine nucleotide, and glucose-alanine cycles. In this study, most selected metabolites increased 1 day after the WTS and then returned to normal levels. However, 4 metabolites, adenine, 2-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, and lactate, increased during the 5 days of recovery time following the WTS. Based on excess ammonia, adenine, and lactate levels in the urine, at least 5 days of recovery time can be considered appropriate.
