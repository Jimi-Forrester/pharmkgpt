31892934|a|BACKGROUND: Expression of mitochondrial proteins is reduced within hibernating myocardium (HM). It is unclear whether dietary supplementation with CoQ10 can increase expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and antioxidant proteins within this tissue. In a swine model of HM, we tested whether dietary administration of CoQ10 for four weeks enhances the expression of ETC and antioxidant proteins within the mitochondria via increased PGC1alpha signaling. METHODS: 12 swine were instrumented with a fixed constrictor around the LAD artery to induce gradual stenosis. At three months, transthoracic ECHO was performed to confirm the presence of a wall motion abnormality in the anterior wall. Animals were then randomly assigned to receive daily dietary supplements of either CoQ10 (10 mg/kg/day) or placebo for four weeks. At this time, animals underwent a final ECHO and terminal procedure. Expression of nuclear-bound PGC1alpha (Western blots) and mitochondrial proteins (Tandem Mass Tag) were determined. RESULTS: Mitochondrial and nuclear membranes were isolated from the LAD region. Nuclear-bound PGC1alpha levels were > 200-fold higher with administration of four weeks of CoQ10 treatment (p = 0.016). Expression of ETC proteins was increased in those animals that received CoQ10. Compared with mitochondria in the LAD region from placebo-treated pigs, CoQ10-treated pigs had higher levels of Complex I (p = 0.03), Complex IV (p = 0.04) and Complex V (p = 0.028) peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Four weeks of dietary CoQ10 in HM pigs enhances active, nuclear-bound PGC1alpha and increases the expression of ETC proteins within mitochondria of HM tissue.
