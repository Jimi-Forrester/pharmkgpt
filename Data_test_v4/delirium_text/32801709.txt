32801709|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive ability of regional volume information provided by fully automated brain segmentation software for cerebral amyloid positivity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: This study included 130 subjects with amnestic MCI who participated in the Korean brain aging study of early diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease, an ongoing prospective cohort. All participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessment as well as 11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound PET/MRI scans. The predictive ability of volumetric results provided by automated brain segmentation software was evaluated using binary logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Subjects were divided into two groups: one with Abeta deposition (58 subjects) and one without Abeta deposition (72 subjects). Among the varied volumetric information provided, the hippocampal volume percentage of intracranial volume (%HC/ICV), normative percentiles of hippocampal volume (HCnorm), and gray matter volume were associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) positivity (all P < 0.01). Multivariate analyses revealed that both %HC/ICV and HCnorm were independent significant predictors of Abeta positivity (all P < 0.001). In addition, prediction scores derived from %HC/ICV with age and HCnorm showed moderate accuracy in predicting Abeta positivity in MCI subjects (the areas under the curve: 0.739 and 0.723, respectively). CONCLUSION: Relative hippocampal volume measures provided by automated brain segmentation software can be useful for screening cerebral Abeta positivity in clinical practice for patients with amnestic MCI. The information may also help clinicians interpret structural MRI to predict outcomes and determine early intervention for delaying the progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia.
