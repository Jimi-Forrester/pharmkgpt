37222157|a|German Shorthaired Pointer (GSHP) dogs with a UNC93B1 gene mutation develop exfoliative cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ECLE) and kidney disease resembling lupus nephritis in humans. The objective of this study was to characterize the kidney disease by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy in a population of GSHP dogs with ECLE. Medical records were reviewed, and light microscopy of kidneys from 7 GSHP dogs with a previous histologic diagnosis of ECLE was performed. Immunofluorescence of fresh-frozen kidney from 1 dog and transmission electron microscopy of kidney from that dog and 2 additional dogs were performed. Five of 7 dogs had proteinuria diagnosed by urinalysis or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Two of 7 dogs were intermittently hypoalbuminemic, and none were azotemic. Histologic findings included early (2 dogs) to late (5 dogs) membranous glomerulonephropathy characterized by mild-to-severe glomerular capillary loop thickening and tubular proteinosis. In all 7 cases, trichrome staining revealed red granular immune deposits on the subepithelial surface of the glomerular basement membrane. Immunofluorescence revealed strong granular labeling for immunoglobulins and complement protein C3. Electron microscopy demonstrated subepithelial electron-dense immune deposits encircled by the remodeled glomerular basement membrane. These findings are diagnostic of immune-complex membranous glomerulonephropathy and are similar to class V lupus in humans. This cohort of GSHP dogs with ECLE developed immune-complex membranous glomerulonephropathy, which we hypothesize is a manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. GSHP dogs with ECLE should undergo clinical evaluation of renal function for early identification and treatment.
