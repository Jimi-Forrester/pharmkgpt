36060671|t|Conjugation of a Blood Brain Barrier Peptide Shuttle to an Fc Domain for Brain Delivery of Therapeutic Biomolecules.
36060671|a|The frequency of brain disease has increased significantly in the past years. After diagnosis, therapeutic options are usually limited, which demands the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is promising but highly limited by the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To overcome the impermeability of this barrier, antibody fragments can be engineered and conjugated to BBB peptide shuttles (BBBpS), which are capable of brain penetration. Herein, we linked the highly efficient BBBpS, PepH3, to the IgG fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain using the streamlined expressed protein ligation (SEPL) method. With this strategy, we obtained an Fc-PepH3 scaffold that can carry different payloads. Fc-PepH3 was shown to be nontoxic, capable of crossing an in vitro cellular BBB model, and able to bind to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for antibody long half-life (t 1/2). Overall, we demonstrated the potential of Fc-PepH3 as a versatile platform readily adaptable to diverse drugs of therapeutic value to treat different brain conditions.
