30906383|t|Neural Stem Cell Death Mechanisms Induced by Amyloid Beta.
30906383|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid beta (Abeta) is the main component of amyloid plaques, which are deposited in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biochemical and animal studies support the central role of Abeta in AD pathogenesis. Despite several investigations focused on the pathogenic mechanisms of Abeta, it is still unclear how Abeta accumulates in the central nervous system and subsequently initiates the disease at the cellular level. In this study, we investigated the pathogenic mechanisms of Abeta using proteomics and antibody microarrays. METHODS: To evaluate the effect of Abeta on neural stem cells (NSCs), we treated primary cultured cortical NSCs with several doses of Abeta for 48 h. A 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, trypan blue staining, and bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation assay were performed. We detected several intracellular proteins that may be associated with Abeta by proteomics and Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Various viability tests showed that Abeta decreased NSCs viability and cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Abeta treatment significantly decreased lactate dehydrogenase B, high-mobility group box 1, aldolase C, Ezrin, and survival signals including phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that several factors determined by proteomics and Western blot hold the clue to Abeta pathogenesis. Further studies are required to investigate the role of these factors.
