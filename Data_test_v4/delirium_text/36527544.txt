36527544|t|A Basic Survey on the Learning Needs of Nurses Caring for Patients with Intractable Cancer in Japan Based on Conceptual Education Integrating Oncology and Palliative Care.
36527544|a|This small-sample pilot study sought to uncover the role of palliative care education for general nurses providing care to patients with intractable cancer. While nurses serve as total care coordinators in patient recuperation, most general nurses in Japan dealing with such patients must independently update their knowledge. A questionnaire was developed comprising 28 items from the five supportive care need categories according to the Integrating Oncology and Palliative Care (IOP) model and 22 items from the Nurses' Difficulties in Cancer Care (NDCC) scale. General nurses who had worked in cancer care for over 5 years were recruited using snowball sampling. Based on the results, we planned a lecture and free study session on IOP using information and communication technology (ICT). Four lectures were delivered to 108 nurses from Hokkaido to Okinawa and remote islands. Overall, 90% of the participants were female nurses. They were categorized into two groups based on the number of times they attended the lectures (Group 1 [G1, attended once or twice]: 45; Group 2 [G2, attended three or four times]: 63). Comparing G1 and G2 showed that the practical ability of the participants in G2 increased for the items "Patient/Family Communication" and "Knowledge and Skills." Continued education using ICT may improve the practical skills of general nurses caring for patients with intractable cancer.
