39961535|t|Multicentre cohort study on the prevalence of postoperative delirium 48 hours after surgery: "DELPO study" protocol.
39961535|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium (POD) is characterized by an acute, fluctuating change in the patient's cognitive capacity, including altered perceptions and inappropriate behavioural changes. Incidence ranges from 4% to 62%, depending on the population and the study. POD has been linked to an increase in morbidity and mortality and a decrease in quality of life. METHODS: We will perform a multicentre, observational, cross-sectional nationwide study in various Anaesthesiology, Resuscitation, and Pain Therapy units in Spain. Patients undergoing non-ambulatory surgery will be tested for the presence of delirium 48 hours after surgery using the 4AT scale in the case of discharged patients, the CAM scale in hospitalised patients, and the CAM-ICU scale for patients in an Intensive Care Unit. We will also collect several variables associated with the risk of postoperative delirium. The relationship between preoperative nutritional status and POD will be assessed in the DELPO-NUT sub-study. The quality of life and survival of surgical patients one year after surgery will be evaluated in the DELPO-LIFE sub-study. RESULTS: Data collection will take place on two consecutive Tuesdays (14 and 21November 2023), and results are expected during the first or second quarter of 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Our objective is to determine the overall prevalence of POD in Spanish hospitals and the different risk factors that contribute to its appearance.
