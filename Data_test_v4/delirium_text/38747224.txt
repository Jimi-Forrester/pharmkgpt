38747224|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), an inexorable neurodegenerative ailment marked by cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric manifestations, stands as the foremost prevailing form of dementia in the geriatric population. Its pathological signs include the aggregation of amyloid proteins, hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, and the consequential loss of neural cells. The etiology of AD has prompted the formulation of numerous conjectures, each endeavoring to elucidate its pathogenesis. While a subset of therapeutic agents has displayed clinical efficacy in AD patients, a significant proportion has encountered disappointment. Notably, the extent of neural cell depletion bears a direct correlation with the disease's progressive severity. However, the absence of efficacious therapeutic remedies for neurodegenerative afflictions engenders a substantial societal burden and exerts a notable economic toll. In the past two decades, the realm of regenerative cell therapy, referred to as stem cell therapy, has unfolded as an avenue for the exploration of profoundly innovative approaches to treat neurodegenerative conditions. This promise is underpinned by the remarkable capacity of stem cells to remediate compromised neural tissue by means of cell replacement, to cultivate an environment conducive to regeneration, and to shield extant healthy neuronal and glial components from further degradation. Thus, this review aims to delve into the current knowledge of stem cell-based therapies and future possibilities in this domain.
