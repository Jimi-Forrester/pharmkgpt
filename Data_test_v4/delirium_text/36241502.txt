36241502|t|Using Music for the Prevention of Delirium in Patients After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
36241502|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effect of music on preventing delirium after coronary artery bypass grafting, to analyze vital signs and blood gas parameters, and to determine risk factors affecting delirium. DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial. SETTING: A single-center, tertiary hospital. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 200 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery from April 2020 to April 2021. INTERVENTIONS: A one-hour session of new-age music was administered twice a day postoperatively for 7 days using a headphone. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit before and after each session. Vital signs and blood gas parameters were compared to evaluate the effect of music. All assessments were conducted blindly by a different researcher. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twelve participants who were delirium-positive were in the control group, and there were 3 in the case group, which suggested a statistically significant effect of music in preventing delirium (p = 0.016). The mean age of patients was 64.7 +- 7.9 years old in the control group and 62.2 +- 7.5 years old in the case group. There was a significant difference among the control and case groups in terms of the surgery time; surgery time in the control group was significantly lower than in the case group (242.4 +- 42.3 v 261.6 +- 48.9, respectively; p = 0.03 < 0.05). Blood pressure and heart rate in the case group were lower, similar to the respiratory rate and venous blood gas parameters; Blood pressure differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05); CONCLUSION: Relaxation music, including bird, water, and wind, significantly prevents delirium after coronary artery bypass grafting.
