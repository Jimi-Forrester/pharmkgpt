39599842|a|Many vector-borne viruses are re-emerging as public health threats, yet our understanding of the virus-host interactions critical for productive infection remains limited. The ubiquitination of proteins, including host- and pathogen-derived proteins is a highly prominent and consistent post-translational modification that regulates protein function through signaling and degradation. Viral proteins are documented to hijack the host ubiquitination machinery to modulate multiple host processes including antiviral defense mechanisms. The engagement of the host ubiquitination machinery in the post-translational modification of viral proteins to support aspects of the viral life cycle including assembly and egress is also well documented. Exploring the role ubiquitination plays in the life cycle of vector-transmitted viral pathogens will increase the knowledge base pertinent to the impact of host-enabled ubiquitination of viral and host proteins and the consequences on viral pathogenesis. In this review, we explore E3 ligase-regulated ubiquitination pathways functioning as proviral and viral restriction factors in the context of acutely infectious, vector-transmitted viral pathogens and the potential for therapeutically targeting them for countermeasures development.
