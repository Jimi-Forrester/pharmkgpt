38678582|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and is a major health threat globally. Its prevalence is forecasted to exponentially increase during the next 30 years due to the global aging population. Currently, approved drugs are merely symptomatic, being ineffective in delaying or blocking the relentless disease advance. Intensive AD research describes this disease as a highly complex multifactorial disease. Disclosure of novel pathological pathways and their interconnections has had a major impact on medicinal chemistry drug development for AD over the last two decades. The complex network of pathological events involved in the onset of the disease has prompted the development of multitarget drugs. These chemical entities combine pharmacological activities toward two or more drug targets of interest. These multitarget-directed ligands are proposed to modify different nodes in the pathological network aiming to delay or even stop disease progression. Here, we review the multitarget drug development strategy for AD during the last decade.
