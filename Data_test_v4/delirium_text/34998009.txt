34998009|t|[Experimental studies of geroprotective and anti-aging effects of chemical compounds of Portulaca oleracea L. (review).]
34998009|a|The analysis presented in the review of publications shows that extract of Portulaca oleracea L. or its individual components (polysaccharides, oleracea, alkaloids tetrahydroisoquinoline operatein E) is able to increase the lifespan of laboratory animals to activate telomerase and increase telomere length, and provide antioxidant and antistaatiline impact. Various neuroprotective effects (improvement of memory and learning ability, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, protection of dopaminergic neurons, improvement of motor functions, etc.) are of interest for the prevention of syndromes associated with age - related degradation of the nervous system - Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition, regular consumption of vegetable portulaca in food leads to a decrease in the percentage of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which also directly affects the increase in the average life expectancy of the population.
