36474581|t|Effect of Pudendal Nerve Block on the Prevention of Postoperative Bladder Spasm and Catheter-Related Bladder Discomfort in Male Patients Undergoing Transurethral Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.
36474581|a|Purpose: Bladder spasm (BS) and catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) are complications after transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). The pudendal nerve (PN) innervates the perineum. Therefore, we evaluated whether PN block (PNB) can reduce the incidence of BS and CRBD in patients undergoing HoLEP. Methods: In this randomized, parallel, single-blind prospective study, we enrolled 110 patients who were scheduled to undergo HoLEP under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to the PNB group (ultrasound-guided PNB at the entrance of the pudendal [Alcock's] canal bilaterally; n = 55) or the control group (general anesthesia only; n = 55). The primary outcome was the incidence of BS and CRBD at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The CRBD severity, postoperative pain, and analgesic drug use were also assessed. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A significantly lower incidence of BS (P = 0.023) and CRBD (P < 0.001) was reported within the first 24 hours postoperatively in the PNB group. The incidence of CRBD above a moderate grade at 0.5 (P < 0.001), 1 (P < 0.001), 2 (P < 0.001), and 4 (P = 0.019) hours postoperatively was significantly lower in the PNB group. Additionally, postoperative pain scores and analgesic drug use were significantly lower in the PNB group. No PNB-related complications were observed. Conclusion: PNB at the entrance of the pudendal canal bilaterally resulted in a lower incidence of BS and CRBD, less postoperative pain, and less analgesic drug use in patients undergoing HoLEP without PNB-related side effects. Implication Statement: Bladder spasm and catheter-related bladder discomfort can occur in older individuals undergoing transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. They often result in severe pain and prolonging the hospital stay. We performed a bilateral ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve block at the entrance of the pudendal (Alcock's) canal and found that the block reduced bladder spasm, catheter-related bladder discomfort, postoperative pain, and use of anesthetics. Besides, pudendal nerve block also decreased the severity of catheter-related bladder discomfort and helped older individuals achieve rapid recovery.
