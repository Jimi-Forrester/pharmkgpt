25943983|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common, associated with poor outcome, but its pathophysiology remains obscure. The aim of the present study was to study a possible role of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the development of delirium. FINDINGS: A prospective cohort of 19 hip fracture patients (median age 83 years) were screened for delirium daily by validated methods. MCP-1 was measured on arrival and postoperatively. The number of patients with a raise in MCP-1 was statistically significantly higher in the group with delirium in the postoperative phase compared to the no-delirium group (5/6 vs. 1/7, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: MCP-1 might play a role in the development of delirium.
