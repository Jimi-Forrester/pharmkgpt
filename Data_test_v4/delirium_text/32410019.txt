32410019|t|Do patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke harboring prestroke disability benefit from thrombectomy?
32410019|a|OBJECTIVES: Evidence of endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke in patients harboring substantial prestroke disability is lacking due to their exclusion from randomized trials. Here, we used routine care observational data to compare outcomes in patients with and without prestroke disability receiving EVT for LVO ischemic stroke. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing EVT for acute LVO ischemic stroke at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital from January 1st, 2015 to March 31st, 2018 were registered in the Sahlgrenska Stroke Recanalization Registry. Pre- and poststroke functional levels were assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Outcomes were recanalization rate (mTICI = 2b/3), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [sICH], complications during hospital stay, and return to prestroke functional level and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS: Among 591 patients, 90 had prestroke disability (mRS >= 3). The latter group were older, more often female, had more comorbidities and higher NIHSS scores before intervention compared to patients without prestroke disability. Recanalization rates (80.0% vs 85.0%, p = 0.211), sICH (2.2% vs 6.3% p = 0.086) and the proportion of patients returning to prestroke functional level (22.7% vs 14.8% p = 0.062) did not significantly differ between those with and without prestroke disability. Patients with prestroke disability had higher complication rates during hospital stay (55.2% vs 40.1% p < 0.01) and mortality at 3 months (48.9% vs 24.3% p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: One of five with prestroke disability treated with thrombectomy for a LVO ischemic stroke returned to their prestroke functional level. However, compared to patients without prestroke disability, mortality at 3 months was higher.
