36431318|t|The Learning Curve for Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy in Gastric Cancer Patients.
36431318|a|(1) Background: Hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for patients with gastric cancer (GC) has been established as the standard surgical treatment at our center. This study aims to quantify the learning curve for surgeons performing minimally invasive total gastrectomy at a high-volume single center. (2) Methods: One hundred and eighteen consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive total gastrectomy between January 2014 and December 2020 at a single high-volume center were included and reviewed retrospectively. Risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis (RA-CUSUM) was used to monitor the surgical outcomes for patients with different risks of postoperative mortality using varying-coefficient logistic regression models. Patients were ordered by the sequential number of the procedure performed and divided into two groups according to the degree of surgeon proficiency as determined by RA-CUSUM analysis (group A: 45; group B: 73 patients). Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), tumor location, pathology, and comorbidities were compared while primary endpoints comprised surgical parameters, postoperative course, and survival outcomes. (3) Results: Forty-four cases were required for the completion of the learning curve. During this time, the mean operating time decreased. Hand-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy performed after a learning curve was associated with a shorter median operating time (OT) (360 min vs. 289 min, <0.001), and a reduced length of stay (A = 18.0 vs. B = 14.0 days) (p = 0.154), while there was a trend toward less major complications (Clavien-Dindo (CD) 3-5 within 90 days (12 (26.67%) vs. 10 (13.70%) p = 0.079). Our results showed no difference in anastomotic leakage between the two groups (group A vs. group B, 3 (6.67%) vs. 4 (5.48%) p = 0.99). Similarly, 30-day (0 (0%) vs. 1 (1.7%), p = 0.365) and 90-day mortality (1 (2.08%) vs. 2 (3.39%), p = 0.684) were comparable. Following multivariate analysis, the level of surgical proficiency was not a significant prognostic factor for overall survival. (4) Conclusions: A minimum of 44 cases are required for experienced laparoscopic surgeons to achieve technical competence for performing LTG. While operation time decreased after completion of the learning curve, quality criteria such as achievement of R0 resection, anastomotic leakage, and perioperative mortality remained unaltered. Of note, the level of surgical training showed no significant impact on the 2 year OS or DFS.
