28852237|t|A Study of Patterns of Platelet Counts in Alcohol Withdrawal.
28852237|a|AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the patterns of platelet counts during the course of alcohol withdrawal and its relationship if any with liver enzymes. METHODOLOGY: Forty consecutive patients, with alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition, Text Revision criteria, willing for a 10-day inpatient detoxification program and presenting within 12 h of the last consumption of alcohol were recruited in the study. Details about the diagnosis and alcohol consumption patterns were assessed with a detailed psychiatric interview. After admission, routine investigations (complete blood counts [CBCs] and liver function tests) were sent and records were kept. CBC was sent for platelet counts on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and the 10th day of alcohol withdrawal. RESULTS: Nearly 40% of the patients developed delirium tremens (DT group) and rest had an uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal (ND group). Platelet counts at baseline and all the 4 days of collection were significantly lower in DT group than the ND group. Platelet counts increased gradually from baseline till 10th day of alcohol withdrawal, mean increase in platelet counts being 88.61 +- 11.60% (median: 61.11%, range [23.41-391.23%]). Platelet counts in 63% of the patients showed a drop on the 4th day of withdrawal before rising till the 10th day of alcohol withdrawal. Platelet counts were not affected by liver enzymes or other alcohol consumption patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Transient thrombocytopenia and reverse thrombocytosis during alcohol withdrawal are associated with an initial drop in platelet counts. The synchrony between the drop and the onset of DT needs to be evaluated.
