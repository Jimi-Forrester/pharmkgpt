39407940|t|Post-Intensive Care Syndrome as a Burden for Patients and Their Caregivers: A Narrative Review.
39407940|a|Millions of critically ill patients are discharged from intensive care units (ICUs) every year. These ICU survivors may suffer from a condition known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) which includes a wide range of cognitive, psychological, and physical impairments. This article will provide an extensive review of PICS. ICU survivors may experience cognitive deficits in memory and attention, with a slow-down of mental processing and problem-solving. From psychological perspectives, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder are the most common issues suffered after ICU discharge. These psycho-cognitive impairments might be coupled with ICU-acquired weakness (polyneuropathy and/or myopathy), further reducing the quality of life, the ability to return to work, and other daily activities. The burden of ICU survivors extends to families too, leading to the so-called PICS-family (or PICS-F), which entails the psychological impairments suffered by the family and, in particular, by the caregiver of the ICU survivor. The development of PICS (and PICS-F) is likely multifactorial, and both patient- and ICU-related factors may influence it. Whilst the prevention of PICS is complex, it is important to identify the patients at higher risk of PICS, and clinicians should be aware of the tools available for diagnosis. Stakeholders should implement strategies to achieve PICS prevention and to support its effective treatment during the recovery phase with dedicated pathways and supporting care.
