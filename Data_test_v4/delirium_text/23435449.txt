23435449|t|Conformationally restricted short peptides inhibit human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) fibrillization.
23435449|a|hIAPP fibrillization implicated in Type 2 diabetes pathology involves formation of oligomers toxic to insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells. We report design, synthesis, 3D structure and functional characterization of dehydrophenylalanine (DeltaF) containing peptides which inhibit hIAPP fibrillization. The inhibitor protects beta-cells from hIAPP induced toxicity.
