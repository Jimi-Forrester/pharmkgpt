36451231|a|BACKGROUND: Brain metabolic alterations and neuroinflammation have been reported in several peripheral inflammatory conditions and present significant potential for targeting with new diagnostic approaches and treatments. However, non-invasive evaluation of these alterations remains a challenge. METHODS: Here, we studied the utility of a micro positron emission tomography (microPET) dual tracer ([11C]PBR28 - for microglial activation and [18F]FDG for energy metabolism) approach to assess brain dysfunction, including neuroinflammation in murine endotoxemia. MicroPET imaging data were subjected to advanced conjunction and individual analyses, followed by post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: There were significant increases in [11C]PBR28 and [18F]FDG uptake in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 J mice 6 h following LPS (2 mg/kg) intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration compared with saline administration. These results confirmed previous postmortem observations. In addition, patterns of significant simultaneous activation were demonstrated in the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus in parallel with other tracer-specific and region-specific alterations. These changes were observed in the presence of robust systemic inflammatory responses manifested by significantly increased serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings demonstrate the applicability of [11C]PBR28 - [18F]FDG dual tracer microPET imaging for assessing neuroinflammation and brain metabolic alterations in conditions "classically" characterized by peripheral inflammatory and metabolic pathogenesis.
