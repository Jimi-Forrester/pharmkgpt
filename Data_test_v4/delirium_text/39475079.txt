39475079|t|Considerations on Multimorbidity and Frailty in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
39475079|a|There are growing numbers of older people with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD]. These older patients are more likely to have other comorbidities and polypharmacy, which can make recognizing and treating IBD complex. Frailty is a newer concept in the IBD field, and we are beginning to recognize the importance of this as a marker of biological age and its association with risk of adverse IBD-related outcomes. In this review article we aim to provide practical insight into the specific challenges facing older patients and their clinicians at each stage of the patient journey. We also discuss the latest understanding of the impact of frailty for these patients with IBD and highlight areas for future research.
