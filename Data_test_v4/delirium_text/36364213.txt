36364213|t|Crosstalk between Depression and Breast Cancer via Hepatic Epoxide Metabolism: A Central Comorbidity Mechanism.
36364213|a|Breast cancer (BC) is a serious global challenge, and depression is one of the risk factors and comorbidities of BC. Recently, the research on the comorbidity of BC and depression has focused on the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the persistent stimulation of the inflammatory response. However, the further mechanisms for comorbidity remain unclear. Epoxide metabolism has been shown to have a regulatory function in the comorbid mechanism with scattered reports. Hence, this article reviews the role of epoxide metabolism in depression and BC. The comprehensive review discloses the imbalance in epoxide metabolism and its downstream effect shared by BC and depression, including overexpression of inflammation, upregulation of toxic diols, and disturbed lipid metabolism. These downstream effects are mainly involved in the construction of the breast malignancy microenvironment through liver regulation. This finding provides new clues on the mechanism of BC and depression comorbidity, suggesting in particular a potential relationship between the liver and BC, and provides potential evidence of comorbidity for subsequent studies on the pathological mechanism.
