34096610|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and risk factors for readmission after inpatient rehabilitation in stroke survivors, in a developed multi-ethnic Southeast Asian country. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1,235 stroke survivors who completed inpatient rehabilitation in a tertiary rehabilitation centre. RESULTS: A total of 296 (24.0%) patients with stroke were readmitted within the first year, and 87 (7.0%) patients were readmitted 1-3 years after stroke. Significant risk factors for readmission of patients in the first year post-stroke were older age (p = 0.027), lower admission Functional Independence Measure (FIM) motor (p = 0.001) and cognition scores (p = 0.025), a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) >=1 (p < 0.001) and the presence of at least 1 medical complication during initial hospitalization (p < 0.001), while FIM gain was found to be protective (p < 0.001). Looking at readmission after 1 year post-stroke, a CCI>=1 (p < 0.001) and the presence of medical complications during initial hospitalization (p < 0.001) were risk factors for readmission, while FIM gain (p = 0.001) was protective. Common causes for readmission include recurrent stroke and falls. CONCLUSION: There is a high readmission rate in stroke survivors, even after the first year post-stroke. Interventions, such as fall risk assessments, vaccinations, meticulous catheter care, intensified secondary risk factors interventions and continued post-discharge rehabilitation, may hold promise for reducing readmission rates.
