In this study we evaluated the number of views of the Italian Wikipedia articles related to multiple sclerosis (MS) and its treatment. METHODS: Using Pageviews Analysis we assessed the total views, and mean monthly and daily views of the Italian Wikipedia articles on MS and its treatments from 1 January 2015 to 31 October 2017. We compared the views of the article on MS with those for Alzheimer s disease, epilepsy, migraine and stroke, and adjusted results for crude disease prevalence. RESULTS: The total views of the Italian Wikipedia article on MS was 929,983 (mean monthly views: 33,214; mean daily views: 1089). The adjusted views for the Italian Wikipedia article on MS were higher than those for the other neurological disorders. The normalized views for the MS article were 16, 7, 145 and 11 times higher than those of the articles on Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, migraine and stroke, respectively. Peaks were temporally related to famous people with MS talking about their disease in talk shows on television or to news on novel treatments for MS. CONCLUSION: Wikipedia searches do not reliably reflect its actual epidemiology. Celebrities with MS acting as testimonials might effectively increase public knowledge on MS.
