39335395|a|The role of mitochondria in neurodegenerative diseases is crucial, and recent developments have highlighted its significance in cell therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's diseases. Understanding the impact of mitochondrial biology on these conditions can provide valuable insights for developing targeted cell therapies. This mini-review refocuses on mitochondria and emphasizes the potential of therapies leveraging mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, stem cell-derived secretions, and extracellular vesicles. Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated mitochondria transfer is highlighted for restoring mitochondrial health in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Additionally, attention is paid to gene-editing techniques such as mito-CRISPR, mitoTALENs, mito-ZNFs, and DdCBEs to ensure the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatments. Challenges and future directions are also discussed, including the possible tumorigenic effects of stem cells, off-target effects, disease targeting, immune rejection, and ethical issues.
