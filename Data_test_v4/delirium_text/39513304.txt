39513304|t|Unraveling Neurological Drug Delivery: Polymeric Nanocarriers for Enhanced Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration.
39513304|a|Treating neurological illnesses is challenging because the blood-brain barrier hinders therapeutic medications from reaching the brain. Recent advances in polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs), which improve medication permeability across the blood-brain barrier, may influence therapy strategies for neurological diseases. PNCs have several ways to deliver medications to the nervous system. This review article provides a summary of the parts and manufacturing methods involved in making PNCs. Additionally, it highlights the elements that result in PNCs having enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration. A combination of passive and active targeting strategies is used by PNCs intended to overcome the blood-brain barrier. Among these are micellar structures, nanogels, nanoparticles, cubosomes, and dendrimers. These nanocarriers, which are functionalized with certain ligands that target BBB transporters, enable the direct delivery of drugs to the brain. Mainly, the BBB prevents medications from entering the brain. Understanding the BBB's physiological and anatomical characteristics is necessary to get over this obstacle. Preclinical and clinical research demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of these PNCs, and their potential use in the treatment of neurological illnesses, including brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, is discussed. Concerns that PNCs may have about their biocompatibility and possible toxicity are also covered in this review article. This study examines the revolutionary potential of PNCs in CNS drug delivery, potential roadblocks, ongoing research, and future opportunities for PNC design progress. PNCs open the door to more focused and efficient treatment for neurological illnesses by comprehending the subtleties of BBB penetration.
