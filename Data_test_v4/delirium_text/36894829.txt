36894829|t|TR-FRET-Based Immunoassay to Measure Ataxin-2 as a Target Engagement Marker in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2.
36894829|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease, which belongs to the trinucleotide repeat disease group with a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the ATXN2 gene resulting in an ataxin-2 protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-stretch. The disease is late manifesting leading to early death. Today, therapeutic interventions to cure the disease or even to decelerate disease progression are not available yet. Furthermore, primary readout parameter for disease progression and therapeutic intervention studies are limited. Thus, there is an urgent need for quantifiable molecular biomarkers such as ataxin-2 becoming even more important due to numerous potential protein-lowering therapeutic intervention strategies. The aim of this study was to establish a sensitive technique to measure the amount of soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biofluids to evaluate ataxin-2 protein levels as prognostic and/or therapeutic biomarker in SCA2. Time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) was used to establish a polyQ-expanded ataxin-2-specific immunoassay. Two different ataxin-2 antibodies and two different polyQ-binding antibodies were validated in three different concentrations and tested in cellular and animal tissue as well as in human cell lines, comparing different buffer conditions to evaluate the best assay conditions. We established a TR-FRET-based immunoassay for soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 and validated measurements in human cell lines including iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Additionally, our immunoassay was sensitive enough to monitor small ataxin-2 expression changes by siRNA or starvation treatment. We successfully established the first sensitive ataxin-2 immunoassay to measure specifically soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biomaterials.
