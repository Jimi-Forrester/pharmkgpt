22172527|t|Time sequence of oxidative stress in the brain from transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease related to the amyloid-beta cascade.
22172527|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Rare early-onset forms of AD are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene, presenilin 1 gene, or presenilin 2 gene. The late-onset form of the disease (LOAD) is the most common form. The causes of LOAD are not yet clarified, but several environmental and genetic risk factors have been identified. Numerous studies have highlighted a role for free radical-mediated injury to brain regions of this illness. In addition, studies from mild cognitive impairment patients suggest that oxidative stress is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. The associations between these markers of free radical damage and the pathogenic cascades involved in AD are complex. Over the past 2 decades, a number of mouse models have been created to recapitulate the major neuropathological hallmarks of AD, namely amyloid plaques and NFTs. These mice recapitulate many, although not all, of the key features of AD. Some strains of transgenic mice develop amyloid plaques, some accumulate NFTs, and some do both. Here we review the evidence for increased free radical-mediated damage to the brain with particular attention to the stage of the disease in various transgenic models of AD related to the amyloid-beta cascade.
