37900369|t|Characteristics of Nationwide Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Visits by Age and Type II Diabetes Status in Women.
37900369|a|Background Through a national database search of office visits, we studied the contribution of two known risk factors for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women: age and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methodology The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) database was queried for visits including a UTI diagnosis and a urine culture order. Data were included for all visits involving adult women for available years, 2014-2016 and 2018. Data on demographics, reason for visit, T2DM status, UTI workup, and UTI treatment were collected. Patients with Alzheimer's disease or chronic kidney disease were excluded. Descriptive statistics were displayed as weighted means with standard errors for continuous variables. The effect of age was compared based on a 65-year-old cutoff. Results One hundred sixty-seven surveyed visits were analyzed for the years 2014-2016 and 2018, representing an estimated 7.4 million visits nationwide. Women >=65 years were more likely to be white, non-Hispanic/non-Latino, from the Midwest or West, from metropolitan areas, and on Medicare/Medicaid than their younger counterparts. T2DM and urinalysis rates did not significantly vary between the two age groups (7.7% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.3; 78% vs. 76%, P = 0.9, respectively). For urinalysis rates between patients with and without T2DM, there was no significant difference in the <65-year-old group (80% vs. 78%, P = 0.9) or the >=65-year-old group (93% vs. 73%, P = 0.12). Antibiotic prescription rates were also similar for T2DM and non-T2DM patients (67% vs. 75%, P = 0.7). Conclusions Through a national database analysis, we reported the demographic and visit differences aged <65 years and >=65 years who sought care for UTIs in the United States over a four-year period. T2DM rates and urinalysis did not vary between age groups, and urinalysis rates and antibiotic prescription rates did not vary between T2DM and non-T2DM groups in an age-dependent matter. More research is needed to understand the demographic makeup and risk factors of UTI patients across the nation.
