21327416|t|Frequency, risk factors, and prognosis of prolonged delirium in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery.
21327416|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery is believed to be a transient event, although it frequently lasts for more than 4 weeks. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined the incidence, risk factors, morbidity, and mortality of prolonged delirium in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 232 elderly patients (older than 65 years) (232 hips) who underwent hip fracture surgery for the development and duration of delirium and categorized them into three groups; nondelirium group, transient (<= 4 weeks) delirium group, and prolonged (> 4 weeks) delirium group. Patients underwent a global geriatric evaluation, which included postoperative complications, mortality, and functional and mental status evaluations. The three groups were compared with respect to these variables. RESULTS: Seventy patients (30.2%) had delirium develop, and among these, 14 (20%) had prolonged delirium with a total incidence of 6%. Multivariate analysis showed preinjury dementia was a risk factor of prolonged delirium. At the final followup, five (62.5%) of the eight patients who were ambulatory outdoors in the prolonged delirium group became housebound, whereas only 18 (16.4%) of the 110 patients who were ambulatory outdoors in the nondelirium group became housebound. Survival at 40 months was 81.0% (95% confidence interval, 72.6%-89.3%) in the nondelirium group and 63.6% (95% confidence interval, 35.2%-92.1%) in the prolonged delirium group. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged delirium was found to be associated with a poor functional outcome and increased mortality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.
