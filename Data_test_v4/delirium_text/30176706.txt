30176706|a|OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the natural course of pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI) and predictors to MCI. We followedup individuals with pre-MCI and cognitively normal (CN) elders to identify neuropsychological predictors for rapid conversion to MCI. METHODS: Seventy-seven individuals with pre-MCI and 180 CN elders were recruited from the pool of individuals registered at the National Research Center for Dementia in Gwangju, Korea. We followed-up with them after a mean of 14+-2.29 months. All participants underwent comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment. Logistic regression analysis examined the ability of neuropsychological tests to predict conversions to MCI. RESULTS: Of 257 participants, 142 (55.3%) were eligible for the follow-up study (102 CN, 40 pre-MCI). Logistic regression revealed that spatial delayed recall significantly predicted the conversion from pre-MCI to MCI. In CN, copy for a complex figure significantly predicted the conversion to pre-MCI or MCI. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that spatial delayed recall was associated with rapid conversion from pre-MCI to MCI. Spatial organization and planning, measured by complex figure reproduction, were associated with rapid conversion from CN to pre-MCI or MCI. Our study suggests that inclusion of visuospatial reproduction and memory using a complex figure further facilitates early detection of MCI.
