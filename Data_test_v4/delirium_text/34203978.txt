34203978|t|CK1delta-Derived Peptides as Novel Tools Inhibiting the Interactions between CK1delta and APP695 to Modulate the Pathogenic Metabolism of APP.
34203978|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia, and affected individuals suffer from severe cognitive, mental, and functional impairment. Histologically, AD brains are basically characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Previous reports demonstrated that protein kinase CK1delta influences the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by inducing the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), finally contributing to the formation of amyloid plaques and neuronal cell death. We therefore considered CK1delta as a promising therapeutic target and suggested an innovative strategy for the treatment of AD based on peptide therapeutics specifically modulating the interaction between CK1delta and APP. Initially, CK1delta-derived peptides manipulating the interactions between CK1delta and APP695 were identified by interaction and phosphorylation analysis in vitro. Selected peptides subsequently proved their potential to penetrate cells without inducing cytotoxic effects. Finally, for at least two of the tested CK1delta-derived peptides, a reduction in Abeta levels and amyloid plaque formation could be successfully demonstrated in a complex cell culture model for AD. Consequently, the presented results provide new insights into the interactions of CK1delta and APP695 while also serving as a promising starting point for further development of novel and highly innovative pharmacological tools for the treatment of AD.
