32545770|a|Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the world, and the most common type of lung cancer is non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 85% of lung cancer. Patients with NSCLC, when detected, are mostly in a metastatic stage, and over half of patients diagnosed with NSCLC die within one year after diagnosis; the 5-year survival rate is 24%. However, in patients with metastatic NSCLC, the 5-year survival rate is 6%. Therefore, development of a new therapeutic agent or strategy is urgent for NSCLCs. Berberine has been illustrated to be a therapeutic agent of NSCLC. In the present study, we synthesized six derivatives of berberine, and the anti-NSCLC activity of these agents was examined. Some of them exert increasing proliferation inhibition comparing with berberine. Further studies demonstrated that two of the most effective agents, 9-O-decylberberrubine bromide (B6) and 9-O-dodecylberberrubine bromide (B7), performed cell cycle regulation, in-vitro tumorigenesis inhibition and autophagic flux blocking, but not induction of cellular apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Moreover, B6 and B7 were determined to be green fluorescent and could be penetrated and localized in cellular mitochondria. Herein, B6 and B7, the berberine derivatives we synthesized, revealed better anti-NSCLC activity with berberine and may be used as therapeutic candidates for the treatment of NSCLCs.
