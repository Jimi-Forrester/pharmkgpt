30770760|a|BACKGROUND: Signs of inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rheumatoid arthritis patients correlate positively with fatigue, a central nervous system (CNS)-related symptom that can be partially suppressed by TNF blockade. This suggests a possible role for CNS inflammation in arthritis that may be affected by TNF blockade. We therefore investigated the effects of TNF blockade on the arthritis CSF proteome and how candidate proteins related to clinical measures of disease activity and inflammation. METHODS: Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed on CSF from seven polyarthritis patients before and during infliximab treatment. Treatment-associated proteins were identified using univariate (Wilcoxon signed rank test) and multivariate (partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)) strategies. Relations between selected candidate proteins and clinical measures were investigated using the Spearman correlations. Additionally, selected proteins were cross-referenced to other studies investigating human CSF in a thorough literature search to ensure feasibility of our results. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of arthritis CSF proteome revealed a decrease of 35 proteins, predominantly involved in inflammatory processes, following TNF blockade. Seven candidate proteins, Contactin-1 (CNTN1), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), hemopexin (HPX), cell adhesion molecule-3 (CADM3), alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG), complement factor B (CFB), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), were selected for further studies based on identification by both univariate and multivariate analyses and reported detection in human CSF and known associations to arthritis. Decreased levels of FGG and CFB in CSF after treatment showed strong correlations with both erythrocyte sedimentation rate and disability scores, while CNTN1 and CADM3 were associated with pain. CONCLUSION: Several immune-related proteins in the CSF of arthritis patients decreased during TNF blockade, including FGG and CFB that both correlated strongly with systemic inflammation. Our findings stress that also intrathecal inflammatory pathways are related to arthritis symptoms and may be affected by TNF blockade.
