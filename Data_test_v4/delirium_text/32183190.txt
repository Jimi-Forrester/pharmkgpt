32183190|t|Heat Stress Impairs the Physiological Responses and Regulates Genes Coding for Extracellular Exosomal Proteins in Rat.
32183190|a|Heat stress (HS) is challenging in humans and animals as it is a complicated regulatory mechanism. This prompted us to characterize the physiological and molecular responses of a HS-animal model. In this study, a rat model system was developed by using three temperature treatments (40 C, 42 C, and 43 C) and sixteen biochemical indicators in blood at 42 C for 30 min (H30), 60 min (H60), and 120 min (H120). In addition, transcriptomic profiling was carried out in H120-rats' blood, liver, and adrenal gland samples for detection of the genes of interest. Our findings demonstrated that the adrenocorticotropic hormone, catalase, prolactin, growth hormone, and lactic acid have significant spatiotemporal variation in the H120-rats as compared with the control. Furthermore, through transcriptomic screening, we documented a high ratio of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adrenal glands, liver, and blood, respectively. Among them, Nup153, Plxnb2, Stx7, Hspa9, Chordc1, Pde4d, Gm2alpha, and Rnf125 were associated with the regulation of HS and immune response processes. Notably, 36 and 314 of DEGs in blood and adrenal glands were detected in the composition of the extracellular exosome, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation analysis between gene transcripts and biochemical indicator levels identified the Lgals3, S1006, Fn1,F2, and Kng1l1 as key candidate genes for HS encoding extracellular exosomal proteins. On the basis of our results, it was concluded that the current rat model provides a molecular basis for future research in HS resistance in humans and livestock.
