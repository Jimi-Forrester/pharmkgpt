The prime focus of this paper is on the involvement and interplay of neurons and glial cells in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we explore the specific contributions of microglia and astrocytes and analyzes multiple pathways implicated in neuroinflammation and disturbances in excitatory and inhibitory processes. Firstly, we elucidate the mechanisms through which toxic protein accumulation in AD results in synaptic dysfunction and deregulation of the immune system and examines the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and hereditary factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. Secondly, we focus on ASD and the involvement of glial cells in the development of the nervous system and the formation of connections between neurons and investigates the genetic connections associated with these processes. Lastly, we also address the participation of glial cells in epilepsy and MS, providing insights into their pivotal functions in both conditions. We also tried to give an overview of seven different pathways like toll-like receptor signalling pathway, MyD88-dependent and independent pathway, etc and its relevance in the context with these neurological disorders. In this review, we also explore the role of activated glial cells in AD, ASD, epilepsy, and MS which lead to neuroinflammation. Even we focus on excitatory and inhibitory imbalance in all four neurological disorders as imbalance affect the proper functioning of neuronal circuits. Finally, this review concludes that there is necessity for additional investigation on glial cells and their involvement in neurological illnesses.
