39443410|t|Identification of nitric oxide-mediated necroptosis as the predominant death route in Parkinson's disease.
39443410|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) involves multiple forms of neuronal cell death, but the dominant pathway involved in disease progression remains unclear. This study employed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of brain tissue to explore gene expression patterns across different stages of PD. Using the Scaden deep learning algorithm, we predicted neurocyte subtypes and modelled dynamic interactions for five classic cell death pathways to identify the predominant routes of neuronal death during PD progression. Our cell type-specific analysis revealed an increasing shift towards necroptosis, which was strongly correlated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression across most neuronal subtypes. In vitro experiments confirmed that nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator of necroptosis, leading to nuclear shrinkage and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential via phosphorylation of the PIP1/PIP3/MLKL signalling cascade. Importantly, specific necroptosis inhibitors significantly mitigated neuronal damage in both in vitro and in vivo PD models. Further analysis revealed that NO-mediated necroptosis is prevalent in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and across multiple brain regions but not in brain tumours. Our findings suggest that NO-mediated necroptosis is a critical pathway in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders, providing potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
