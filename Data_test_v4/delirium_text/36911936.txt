36911936|a|BACKGROUND: Many transversal mechanisms act synergistically at different time-points in the cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD), since amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation influence each other. OBJECTIVE: We explored the contributions of microglia and astrocytes in patients with symptomatic sporadic AD stratified according to AT(N) system and APOE genotype. METHODS: We compared the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM-2 and markers of astrocytic activation (GFAP; beta-S100) from 71 patients with AD (23 A+T-,48 A+T+; 38 APOEe3, 33 APOEe4) and 30 healthy controls (HC). With multivariate analyses we investigated associations between glial biomarkers, Abeta42, and p-tau in all subgroups. RESULTS: CSF sTREM-2 was higher in A+T+ [1.437 (0.264)] and A+T- [1.355 (0.213)] than in HC [1.042 (0.198); both p < 0.001]; GFAP and beta-S100 were comparable across groups. Considering all patients, sTREM-2 positively associated with Abeta 42 (p = 0.04) and p-tau (=0.016), with the first being present only in the A+T- subgroup (p = 0.023). GFAP positively associated with Abeta 42 in all patients (p = 0.020) and in the A+T+ subgroup (p = 0.04). Stratifying by APOE, a positive association of sTREM-2 and p-tau was confirmed selectively in carriers of e4 (p = 0.018). Finally, sTREM-2 positively correlated with beta-S100 in all subgroups, and with GFAP in A+T+ (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the increase of CSF sTREM-2 in AD, which associates with reduced amyloidopathy in A+T- patients. Moreover, microglial activation seems to increase CSF tau levels in carriers of APOEe4, is associated with astrocytic reactivity (GFAP) in A+T+, and likely leads the acquisition of a more neurotoxic astrocytic phenotype (beta-S100).
