35636905|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant mortality in the United States with more than 800,000 deaths in 2020 and 2021. The proportion of patients with COVID-19 who develop severe disease varies but is decreasing over time with growing population immunity and improved therapeutic options. Patients who are 65 years and older represent the largest proportion of deaths from COVID-19. Additional risk factors include immunosuppression and chronic medical conditions. Vaccination dramatically reduces the risk of severe COVID-19. Although critical illness from COVID-19 is mostly driven by respiratory disease, critical illness can manifest in several ways and affect several organ systems.
