25528883|t|Molecular imaging biomarkers for dementia with Lewy bodies: an update.
25528883|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy body (DLB) is considered to be the second most common form of neurodegenerative disorders after Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting as many as 100,000 people in the UK and up to 1.3 million in the USA. However, nearly half of patients with DLB remain undiagnosed thus depriving many of them from an early and adequate treatment of their distressing symptoms. Accurate and early diagnosis of DLB is important for both patients and their caregivers, since the neuropsychiatric symptoms require specific management. METHODS: In the current study, we review the most recent developments in the field of molecular nuclear imaging to diagnose DLB. RESULTS: The review addresses, the neurotransmitter based (dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic) nuclear imaging techniques, role of the autonomic dysfunction and its visualization in DLB with myocardial sympathetic imaging and vesicular catecholamine uptake, as well as the use of amyloid polypeptides and glial markers as molecular imaging probes in the clinical diagnosis of DLB. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the above nuclear imaging methods are restricted to highly specialized clinical centers, and thus not applicable to a large number of patients requiring dementia (e.g. DLB) diagnosis in routine clinical setting. Validating them against more readily accessible peripheral biomarkers, e.g. CSF and blood biomarkers linked to the DLB process, may facilitate their use in wider clinical settings.
