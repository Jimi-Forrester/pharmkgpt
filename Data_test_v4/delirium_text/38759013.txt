38759013|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegeneration disease. Physical activity is one of the most promising modifiable lifestyles that can be effective in slowing down the progression of AD at an early stage. Objective: Explore the molecular processes impaired in AD that were conversely preserved and enhanced by physical activity. Methods: Integrated transcriptomic analyses were performed in datasets that contain AD patients and elders with different degrees of physical activity. The changes of the hub genes were validated through analyzing another two datasets. The expression of the hub genes was further detected in the hippocampus and cortexes of APP/PS1 transgenic mice with or without physical activity by Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: Cross-comparison highlighted 195 DEGs displaying opposed regulation patterns between AD and high physical activity (HPA). The common DEGs were predominantly involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and synaptic transmission, largely downregulated in AD patients but upregulated in the elders with HPA. Two key modules and four hub genes that were related to synaptic vesicle turnover were obtained from the PPI network. The expression of these hub genes (SYT1, SYT4, SH3GL2, and AP2M1) was significantly decreased in AD transgenic mice and was reversed by HPA training. Conclusions: HPA may reverse AD pathology by upregulating a range of synaptic vesicle transport related proteins which might improve the efficiency of synaptic vesicle turnover and facilitate inter-neuronal information transfer. The study provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlining the protective effects of HPA on AD.
