24300264|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) versus Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Patients fulfilling the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4(th) edition (DSM-IV) dementia diagnosis criteria were recruited into this case-control study. AD patients were diagnosed with the criteria of National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) while PDD was based upon the standards of Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force. According to clinical dementia rating (CDR) score, they were divided into mild dementia (CDR score = 0.5/1) and moderate-to-severe dementia groups (CDR score = 2/3). World Health Organization-University of California, Los Angeles, auditory verbal learning test (WHO-UCLA AVLT), clock drawing test (CDT) and neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) were performed. RESULTS: No significant difference in immediate memory, delayed memory or long-delayed recognition score was observed between PDD and AD patients (P > 0.05). CDT score was significantly lower in PDD patients (mild dementia group: 0.9 +- 0.9; moderate-to-severe dementia group: 0.6 +- 0.9) than that of AD patients (mild dementia group: 1.5 +- 0.7, P < 0.001; moderate-to-severe dementia group: 1.1 +- 0.6, P = 0.027) and this difference was more significant in mild dementia group. More than 70% of PDD patients reported at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. And also, in mild dementia group, compared with AD patients (frequency: 43.2% (16/37), NPI score = 5.7 +- 11.9), a higher frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms and higher NPI scores were observed in PDD patients (frequency: 71.40% (25/35), NPI score = 8.4 +- 9.8). CONCLUSION: More severe impairment in visuospatial ability and executive function was present in PDD patients compared with AD patients. And neuropsychiatric symptoms were more common and severe in PDD patients.
