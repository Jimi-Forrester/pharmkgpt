39314589|a|Introduction Elderly people may experience a deterioration in cognitive function as part of natural aging, which impacts their ability to function independently. Dementia is often experienced by the elderly; their cognitive and memory deficits can limit independence and productivity. Metacognitive skills training can facilitate self-awareness and strategy use and may improve cognitive skills.  Aims and objectives  The article aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of prospective memory and metacognitive skills training in improving cognitive skills and quality of life for elderly persons with dementia.  Methods This was a quasi-experimental study that took place in Chennai city, India. Based on the criteria, a total of fifty (n = 50) elderly participants were selected and divided into control (n = 25) and experimental (n = 25) groups. The control group underwent conventional occupational therapy, whereas the experimental group underwent prospective memory and metacognitive skills training (PM and MST) over 36 sessions (three times/week, for 12 weeks). Outcome measures used were the mini mental status examination (MMSE) and quality of life - Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD). Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results The results revealed that there were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) differences between control and experimental groups. When compared to the control group, the experimental group had greater significant improvement in cognitive skills (MMSE, the control group's mean score was 20.94 and the experimental group's mean score was 30.94, p-value = 0.026), and quality of life (QOL-AD, the control group's mean score was 13.54 and the experimental group's mean score was 37.46, p-value = 0.000) after the implementation of a 12-week therapy program.  Conclusion This study concludes that PM and MST can be used as an effective intervention as it improves cognitive skills and quality of life among elderly persons with dementia.
