39475088|t|Cumulative Socioeconomic Status Risk is Associated with Greater Increase in Serum Neurofilament Light Chain Levels Among Middle-Aged Black Adults.
39475088|a|BACKGROUND: This study examined the longitudinal relationship between cumulative socioeconomic status (SES) risk and serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels to better understand the association between social factors and a biomarker of neurodegeneration. METHODS: We used data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), collecting psychosocial and blood data at two waves (2008) and (2019) from 254 Black Americans (43 males and 211 females). Blood samples were analyzed at each wave for serum NfL concentrations. Regression analysis and mixed-effect modeling examined relationships between cumulative SES risk and serum NfL, controlling for covariates and assessing time effects. RESULTS: Utilizing 11-year longitudinal data, serum NfL levels increased with age. Higher cumulative SES risk at baseline correlated with elevated serum NfL at the 11-year follow-up and predicted a greater increase in NfL levels. Clinically, NfL is a sensitive biomarker for axonal injury and neurodegeneration, commonly used to detect early and preclinical stages of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure to cumulative SES risk among Black adults may contribute to elevated levels of NfL, indicating potential early neurodegeneration. Given the established role of NfL in detecting neurodegenerative processes, these findings underscore the importance of interventions that bolster social safety nets and social connectedness to enhance brain health and mitigate neurodegenerative risks.
