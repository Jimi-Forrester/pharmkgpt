9559988|t|Alzheimer's disease: patterns of cognitive impairment at different levels of disease severity.
9559988|a|The aim of this study was to establish the presence and the consistency of different cognitive profiles in AD patients taking into consideration the severity of mental impairment. Therefore we stratified 679 neuropsychological observations on 119 probable AD patients followed longitudinally on the basis of overall degree of cognitive impairment. To compare performance on tests with different score ranges we transformed raw test scores into coefficients; to summarize our results in terms of language versus visuo-spatial performance we computed indices of prevalent impairment of performance (IPIP) by subtracting the coefficients for constructional praxis from coefficients for language-related tests. Finally, we converted these indices into z-scores for each level of mental decline to identify patients with generalized, language (L) or visuo-spatial (V) prevalent impairment. The latter, 30% of the sample, can be detected at all stages of dementia. There was a higher percentage of males among language impaired patients (P<0.05). Approximately half of patients with L/V prevalent impairment continued to show such a focality when followed longitudinally. The groups did not differ in the annual rate of cognitive decline.
