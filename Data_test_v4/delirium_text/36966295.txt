36966295|t|Microglial aryl hydrocarbon receptor enhances phagocytic function via SYK and promotes remyelination in the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination.
36966295|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although studies have demonstrated that microglia facilitate remyelination in demyelinating diseases, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully characterized. We found that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an environment sensor, was upregulated within the corpus callosum in the cuprizone model of CNS demyelination, and upregulated AhR was mainly confined to microglia. Deletion of AhR in adult microglia inhibited efficient remyelination. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq revealed that AhR-deficient microglia displayed impaired gene expression signatures associated with lysosome and phagocytotic pathways. Furthermore, AhR-deficient microglia showed impaired clearance of myelin debris and defected phagocytic capacity. Further investigation of target genes of AhR revealed that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is the downstream effector of AhR and mediated the phagocytic capacity of microglia. Additionally, AhR deficiency in microglia aggravated CNS inflammation during demyelination. Altogether, our study highlights an essential role for AhR in microglial phagocytic function and suggests the therapeutic potential of AhR in demyelinating diseases.
