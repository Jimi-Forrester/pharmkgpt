35435343|a|Background & objectives: Working memory impairments in the subjects of opioid addiction may stem from an aberrant cortical activity in the executive areas, and may help in early identification of individuals with addictive tendencies and may also be used as a neurofeedback mechanism in adjunct to the existing therapeutics. Methods: Electrical neuroimaging via 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recording was done in 15 male subjects with opioid addiction (29.45+-5.6 yr) during the performance of Sternberg Working Memory Task. EEG data were acquired and analyzed for cortical sources during task as compared to resting (baseline) condition. Results: Working memory deficits were manifested as decrease in accuracy percentage in the subjects with opioid addiction, while no significant difference was seen in reaction time, on comparison with laboratory-acquired matched controls. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)-based EEG source analysis revealed higher cortical activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior, middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule and precuneus, whereas significant lower activity was seen in superior and middle frontal gyri, parietal lobule, cingulate cortex and pre- and postcentral gyri when the task was compared to baseline in the subjects with opioid addiction. Further, a negative correlation was seen between the accuracy of task performance and activation ratio for the significant gyri in the subjects with opioid addiction. Interpretation & conclusions: EEG cortical sources revealed the failure of deactivation of default-mode network (DMN) during the task amongst the subjects with opioid addiction. In addition, there was a decrease in the executive function areas in the subjects with opioid addiction. This lack of sufficiently active executive network and persistence of DMN during the task (as compared to baseline) may potentially form the basis of functional impairments in the subjects with opioid addiction.
