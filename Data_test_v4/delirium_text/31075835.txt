31075835|t|STIM Proteins and Glutamate Receptors in Neurons: Role in Neuronal Physiology and Neurodegenerative Diseases.
31075835|a|Neuronal calcium (Ca2+) influx has long been ascribed mainly to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and glutamate receptor channels. Recent research has shown that it is also complemented by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) protein-mediated store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE is described as Ca2+ flow into cells in response to the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. The present review summarizes recent studies that indicate a relationship between neuronal SOCE that is mediated by STIM1 and STIM2 proteins and glutamate receptors under both physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders. We present evidence that the dysregulation of neuronal SOCE and glutamate receptor activity are hallmarks of acute neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., traumatic brain injury and cerebral ischemia) and chronic neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease). Emerging evidence indicates a role for STIM proteins and glutamate receptors in neuronal physiology and pathology, making them potential therapeutic targets.
