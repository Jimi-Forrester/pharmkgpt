33521363|t|Mancozeb impairs mitochondrial and bioenergetic activity in Drosophila melanogaster.
33521363|a|Mancozeb (MZ) is a broad-spectrum fungicide used worldwide in several crops. Neurological disorders in humans and animals have been associated with exposure to this compound by mechanisms still not fully understood. Drosophila melanogaster represents a reliable model in toxicological studies, presenting genetic and biochemical similarities with mammals. In this study, D. melanogaster flies were exposed for 15 days to MZ through the food (5 and 10 mg/mL). After that period, the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration complexes and metabolic markers were analyzed and evaluated. Flies presented weight loss, lower glucose, trehalose, and glycogen levels, and augmented levels of triglycerides concerning control (non-treated group). Acetyl-CoA Synthetase (ACeCS-1) and Acyl-Coenzyme Synthetase (ACSL1) contents were unchanged by MZ treatment. Mitochondrial respiration of flies was targeted by MZ treatment, evidenced by a decrease in oxygen consumption and bioenergetics rate and inhibition in mitochondrial complexes I/II. These results suppose that an impairment in mitochondrial respiration jointly with reduced levels of energetic substrates might be a mechanism involved in MZ deleterious effects, possibly by the limitation of ATP's availability, necessary for essential cellular processes.
