38859546|t|Signaling pathways in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with acupuncture: a narrative review.
38859546|a|BACKGROUND: To date, there is no effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. The objective of this review was to summarize the core targets and signaling pathways involved in acupuncture treatment for AD. METHODS: We reviewed numerous signaling pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3 K/Akt), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor (NF)-kB, p53, Wnt, nitric oxide (NO), Janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/ STAT), RhoA/ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase) and Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) / cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein (CREB). The relevant data were obtained from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases. RESULTS: In summary, the effects of acupuncture are mediated by multiple targets and pathways. Furthermore, acupuncture can improve pathological changes associated with AD (such as abnormal deposition of amyloid (A)beta, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis) through multiple signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings provide a basis for future research into the effects of acupuncture on AD.
