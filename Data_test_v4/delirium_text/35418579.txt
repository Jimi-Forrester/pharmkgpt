35418579|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), as expressed by older adults, is associated with negative affect, which, in turn, is a likely risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This study assessed the associations between negative affective burden, cognitive functioning, and functional connectivity in networks vulnerable to AD in the context of SCD. Older participants (60-90 years) with SCD (n = 51) and healthy controls (n = 50) were investigated in a cross-sectional study. Subclinical negative affective burden, quantified through a composite of self-reported negative affective factors, was related to cognitive functioning (self-perceived and objective) and functional connectivity. Seed-to-voxel analyses were carried out in default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SAL) nodes using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Greater negative affective burden was associated with lower self-perceived cognitive functioning and lower between-network functional connectivity of DMN and SAL nodes in the total sample. In addition, there was a significant moderation of SCD status. Greater negative affective burden related to higher functional connectivity within DMN (posterior cingulate-to-precuneus) and within SAL (anterior cingulate-to-insula) nodes in the SCD group, whereas in controls the inverse association was found. We show that negative affective burden is associated with functional brain alterations in older adults, regardless of SCD status. Specifically in the SCD phenotype, greater negative affective burden relates to higher functional connectivity within brain networks vulnerable to AD. Our findings imply that negative affective burden should be considered a potentially modifiable target for early intervention.
