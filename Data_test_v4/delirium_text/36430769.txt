36430769|t|Integrating Network Pharmacology and Transcriptomic Strategies to Explore the Pharmacological Mechanism of Hydroxysafflor Yellow A in Delaying Liver Aging.
36430769|a|Aging affects the structure and function of the liver. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) effectively improves liver aging (LA) in mice, but the potential mechanisms require further exploration. In this study, an integrated approach combining network pharmacology and transcriptomics was used to elucidate the potential mechanisms of HSYA delay of LA. The targets of HSYA were predicted using the PharmMapper, SwissTargetPrediction, and CTD databases, and the targets of LA were collected from the GeneCards database. An ontology (GO) analysis and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation of genes related to HSYA delay of LA were performed using the DAVID database, and Cytoscape software was used to construct an HSYA target pathway network. The BMKCloud platform was used to sequence mRNA from mouse liver tissue, screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were altered by HSYA, and enrich their biological functions and signaling pathways through the OmicShare database. The results of the network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses were combined. Then, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot experiments were used to further verify the prediction results. Finally, the interactions between HSYA and key targets were assessed by molecular docking. The results showed that 199 potentially targeted genes according to network pharmacology and 480 DEGs according to transcriptomics were involved in the effects of HSYA against LA. An integrated analysis revealed that four key targets, including HSP90AA1, ATP2A1, NOS1 and CRAT, as well as their three related pathways (the calcium signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway), were closely related to the therapeutic effects of HSYA. A gene and protein expression analysis revealed that HSYA significantly inhibited the expressions of HSP90AA1, ATP2A1 and NOS1 in the liver tissue of aging mice. The molecular docking results showed that HSYA had high affinities with the HSP90AA1, ATP2A1 and NOS1 targets. Our data demonstrate that HSYA may delay LA in mice by inhibiting the expressions of HSP90AA1, ATP2A1 and NOS1 and regulating the calcium signaling pathway, the estrogen signaling pathway, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.
