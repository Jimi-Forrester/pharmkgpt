30140275|t|The Six-Item Cognitive Impairment Test Is Associated with Adverse Outcomes in Acutely Hospitalized Older Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.
30140275|a|AIM: The study aim was to investigate whether cognitive impairment, measured by the Six-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT), is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in acutely hospitalized older patients. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter study including acutely hospitalized patients aged 70 years and older. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate whether impaired cognition (6-CIT >=11 points) was an independent predictor of 90-day adverse outcome, a composite measure of functional decline and mortality. Secondary endpoints were hospital length of stay, new institutionalization, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In total, 196 (15.6%) of 1,252 included patients had a 6-CIT >=11. Median age was 80 years (interquartile range 74-85). Patients with impaired cognition had higher rates of 90-day adverse outcome (41.7% compared to 30.3% in 1,056 not cognitively impaired patients, p = 0.009). Impaired cognition was a predictor of 90-day adverse outcome with a crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.64 (95% CI 1.13-2.39), but statistical significance was lost when fully corrected for possible confounders (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.98-2.11). For all secondary outcomes, impaired cognition was an independent predictor. CONCLUSIONS: In the acute hospital setting, the 6-CIT is associated with 90-day adverse outcome and is an independent predictor of hospital length of stay, new institutionalization, and in-hospital mortality.
