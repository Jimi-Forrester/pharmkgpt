39000605|t|Non-Coding RNAs of Mitochondrial Origin: Roles in Cell Division and Implications in Cancer.
39000605|a|Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a heterogeneous group, in terms of structure and sequence length, consisting of RNA molecules that do not code for proteins. These ncRNAs have a central role in the regulation of gene expression and are virtually involved in every process analyzed, ensuring cellular homeostasis. Although, over the years, much research has focused on the characterization of non-coding transcripts of nuclear origin, improved bioinformatic tools and next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms have allowed the identification of hundreds of ncRNAs transcribed from the mitochondrial genome (mt-ncRNA), including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA (circRNA), and microRNA (miR). Mt-ncRNAs have been described in diverse cellular processes such as mitochondrial proteome homeostasis and retrograde signaling; however, the function of the majority of mt-ncRNAs remains unknown. This review focuses on a subgroup of human mt-ncRNAs whose dysfunction is associated with both failures in cell cycle regulation, leading to defects in cell growth, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, and the development of tumor hallmarks, such as cell migration and metastasis formation, thus contributing to carcinogenesis and tumor development. Here we provide an overview of the mt-ncRNAs/cancer relationship that could help the future development of new biomedical applications in the field of oncology.
