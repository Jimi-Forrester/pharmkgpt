37670239|t|The effect of intravenous lidocaine on postoperative cognitive dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37670239|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has been reported as a significant complication in elderly patients. Various methods have been proposed for reducing the incidence and severity of POCD. Intravenous lidocaine administration has been reported in the literature to reduce POCD, but the effect of lidocaine remains controversial. METHODS: We screened Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (up to April 2022) databases following a search strategy for intravenous lidocaine on POCD. We also screened related bibliographies on lidocaine for POCD. Ten articles comprising 1517 patients were selected and analyzed. We divided the postoperative follow-up period as follows: short term (<30 days), medium term (30-90 days), and long term (>90 days). OUTCOMES: We found that lidocaine could attenuate the overall incidence of POCD, especially in the short term. There were no differences between lidocaine and placebo on the overall severity of POCD. CONCLUSION: Lidocaine administered intravenously could attenuate the overall incidence of POCD and its severity in the short term.
