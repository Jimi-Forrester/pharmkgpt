35681465|t|Functional Deficits of 5xFAD Neural Stem Cells Are Ameliorated by Glutathione Peroxidase 4.
35681465|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia affecting millions of people around the globe. Impaired neurogenesis is reported in AD as well as in AD animal models, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Elevated lipid peroxidation products are well-documented in AD. In current study, the role of lipid peroxidation on neural stem cell (NSCs) function is tested. Neural stem cells (NSCs) from 5xFAD mice, a widely used AD model with impaired neurogenesis, were observed to have increased levels of lipid reactive oxygen species compared to NSCs from control WT mice. 5xFAD NSCs exhibited altered differentiation potential as revealed by their propensity to differentiate into astrocytic lineage instead of neuronal lineage compared to WT NSCs. In addition, 5xFAD NSCs showed a reduced level of Gpx4, a key enzyme in reducing hydroperoxides in membrane lipids, and this reduction appeared to be caused by enhanced autophagy-lysosomal degradation of Gpx4 protein. To test if increasing Gpx4 could restore differentiation potential, NSCs from 5xFAD and Gpx4 double transgenic mice, i.e., 5xFAD/GPX4 mice were studied. Remarkably, upon differentiation, neuronal linage cells increased significantly in 5xFAD/GPX4 cultures compared to 5xFAD cultures. Taken together, the findings suggest that deficiency of lipid peroxidation defense contributes to functional decline of NSCs in AD.
