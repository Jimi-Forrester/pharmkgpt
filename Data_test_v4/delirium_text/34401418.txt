34401418|t|Immersive Virtual Reality Used as Adjunct Anesthesia for Conversion Total Hip Arthroplasty in a 100-Year-Old Patient.
34401418|a|Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is an adjunctive form of anesthesia intended to distract patients from their intraoperative environment and reduce other side effects of sedating or narcotic agents. While this technology has been applied sparingly in various orthopedic procedural environments, its clinical utility has not been widely evaluated in major, nonelective surgical settings. The use of IVR in the geriatric hip fracture population represents a novel indication with potential benefit to reduced cognitive dysfunction and delirium. We report a case of a 100-year-old patient who received IVR adjunctive to neuraxial anesthesia during conversion total hip arthroplasty via posterolateral approach for treatment of failed peritrochanteric hip fracture fixation.
