39833066|a|This study aims to assess the impact of comprehensive nursing care on sleep quality and rehabilitation duration in patients experiencing arrhythmia after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Eighty-four patients with post-AMI arrhythmia treated at our hospital from February 2018 to February 2019 were selected and divided based on the nursing care received. The observation group (n = 44) underwent comprehensive nursing interventions, while the control group (n = 40) received standard nursing care. Evaluations of cardiac function indices and sleep quality were conducted before and after the nursing interventions. In addition, comparisons were made between the 2 groups regarding arrhythmia occurrence, patient compliance during care, visual analog scale scores for pain, self-rating anxiety scale scores, self-rating depression scale scores, and overall nursing satisfaction. Following the nursing interventions, the observation group exhibited a significant increase in cardiac output, unlike the control group, which showed no notable change. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and left ventricular ejection fraction; however, these enhancements were more pronounced in the observation group. Post-intervention, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were significantly lower in the observation group compared with the control group, indicating better sleep quality. The observation group also experienced a significant reduction in the incidence, frequency, and duration of arrhythmia episodes. Furthermore, this group showed a lower incidence of complications during the intervention period and reported lower visual analog scale, self-rating anxiety scale, and self-rating depression scale scores after nursing care. Nursing satisfaction rates were notably higher in the observation group than in the control group. Comprehensive nursing care significantly enhances sleep quality, speeds up rehabilitation, and increases patient satisfaction in individuals with arrhythmia after AMI. These findings support the clinical adoption of comprehensive nursing interventions for this patient population.
