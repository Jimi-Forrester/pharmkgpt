34141693|t|Outcomes of Wedge Wing in the Lag Screw for Unstable Intertrochanteric Fractures in Elderly Patients.
34141693|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical-functional and radiologic outcomes of elderly patients with an unstable intertrochanteric femur fracture treated with a wedge wing in the lag screw. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients treated with the Dyna Locking Trochanteric nail (DLT nail) to resolve an unstable intertrochanteric femur fracture were reviewed retrospectively. Based on AO/OTA classification, Fracture 31-A2 (34 cases) and 31-A3 (14 cases) were included in the analysis. We measured the femoral neck-shaft angle, tip-apex distance (TAD), Cleveland index, sliding distance of the lag screw, and time to the fracture union. The Harris Hip Score and Paker and Palmer's mobility score for clinical evaluation were used. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21.4 months (range, 12-34 months). The postoperative state of reduction was good in 28 cases and acceptable in 20 cases. The mean TAD was 20.5 mm. The position of the lag screw was center-center in 30 cases and center-inferior in 18 cases. The mean sliding distance of the lag screw was 3.4 mm at the last follow-up. The mean union time was 4.5 months. Two cases had complications which included a cut-out (1 case) and non-union (1 case). The mean Harris Hip Score was 86.5+-8.3 (range, 76-90). Walking ability in 34 of the cases (70.8%) at last follow-up was similar to that prior to fracture. CONCLUSION: Functional and radiological outcomes are satisfactory using the DLT nail in the treatment of elderly patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures; however, wedge wing in the lag screw does not prevent implant-related complications.
