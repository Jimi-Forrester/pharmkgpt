33349959|t|Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates hnRNPA2 granule protein partitioning and reduces neurodegeneration.
33349959|a|mRNA transport in neurons requires formation of transport granules containing many protein components, and subsequent alterations in phosphorylation status can release transcripts for translation. Further, mutations in a structurally disordered domain of the transport granule protein hnRNPA2 increase its aggregation and cause hereditary proteinopathy of neurons, myocytes, and bone. We examine in vitro hnRNPA2 granule component phase separation, partitioning specificity, assembly/disassembly, and the link to neurodegeneration. Transport granule components hnRNPF and ch-TOG interact weakly with hnRNPA2 yet partition specifically into liquid phase droplets with the low complexity domain (LC) of hnRNPA2, but not FUS LC. In vitro hnRNPA2 tyrosine phosphorylation reduces hnRNPA2 phase separation, prevents partitioning of hnRNPF and ch-TOG into hnRNPA2 LC droplets, and decreases aggregation of hnRNPA2 disease variants. The expression of chimeric hnRNPA2 D290V in Caenorhabditis elegans results in stress-induced glutamatergic neurodegeneration; this neurodegeneration is rescued by loss of tdp-1, suggesting gain-of-function toxicity. The expression of Fyn, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates hnRNPA2, reduces neurodegeneration associated with chimeric hnRNPA2 D290V. These data suggest a model where phosphorylation alters LC interaction specificity, aggregation, and toxicity.
