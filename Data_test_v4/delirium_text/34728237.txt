34728237|a|A relationship between environmental exposure to air pollution and cognitive impairment and neurological disorders has been described. Previous literature has focused on the direct effects of the air pollution components on neuronal and glial cells, as well as on involvement of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation on microglia and astrocyte reactivity. However, other mechanisms involved in the air pollution effects on central nervous system (CNS) toxicity can be playing critical roles. Increasingly, extracellular vesicle's (EVs) mediated intercellular communication is being recognized as impacting the development of cognitive impairment and neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease and others. Here we describe the available evidence about toxic air pollutants and its components on brain, an involvement of brain cells specific and EVs types (based in the origin or in the size of EVs) in the initiation, exacerbation, and propagation of the neurotoxic effects (inflammation, neurodegeneration, and accumulation of neurotoxic proteins) induced by air pollution in the CNS. Additionally, we discuss the identification and isolation of neural-derived EVs from human plasma, the most common markers for neural-derived EVs, and their potential for use as diagnostic or therapeutic molecules for air pollution-related cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.
