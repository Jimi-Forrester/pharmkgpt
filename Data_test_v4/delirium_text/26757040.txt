26757040|t|The Cytome Assay as a Tool to Investigate the Possible Association Between Exposure to Extremely Low Frequency Magnetic Fields and an Increased Risk for Alzheimer's Disease.
26757040|a|Exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) has been identified as one of the potential environmental risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this is far from being established. So far there is no experimental evidence supporting this alleged association. We have performed an in vitro cytogenetic laboratory investigation to explore the plausibility of such association. Our investigation was based on possible similarities found in cells from AD patients and in cells exposed to ELF-MF. We especially found that 50  Hz ELF-MF increase the frequency of cells with (large) micronuclei and nuclear buds indicating that fields above 50 muT may induce chromosome instabilities as those found in AD patients. It should be stressed yet that results from the few published experimental studies on ELF-MF and AD are rather reassuring. Thus, our findings certainly do not prove anything. They only suggest that further investigations might be necessary.
