33671187|a|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes which cleave extracellular matrix (ECM) and other substrates. They are deeply involved in both cancer metastasis and human chronic inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis and Crohn's disease. Regulation of MMPs is closely associated with signaling molecules, especially mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including three representative kinases, extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Ginseng (Panax sp.) is a plant which has been traditionally used for medicinal applications. Ginsenosides are major metabolites which have potentials to treat various human diseases. In this review, the pharmacological effects of ginsenosides have been rigorously investigated; these include anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory activities of ginsenosides associated with suppression of MMPs via regulation of various signaling pathways. This will highlight the importance of MMPs as therapeutic targets for anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory drug development based on ginsenosides.
