39123123|t|Medication-based profiling of older orthopedic patients: a multicenter cross-sectional study.
39123123|a|BACKGROUND: Managing medication use in older orthopedic patients is imperative to extend their healthy life expectancy in an aging society. However, the actual situation regarding polypharmacy, the intake of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), and fall risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) among older orthopedic patients is not well characterized. This study aimed to investigate the medication-based profiles of older orthopedic patients to highlight the critical points of concern. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of consecutive patients aged >= 65 years who underwent orthopedic surgery at two acute care hospitals between April 2020 and March 2021. The cutoff number of prescribed drugs for polypharmacy was set at 6. According to the specified guidelines, 19 categories of drugs were identified as PIMs, and 10 categories were classified as FRIDs. RESULTS: A total of 995 older patients with orthopedic surgery were assessed, of which 57.4% were diagnosed with polypharmacy, 66.0% were receiving PIMs, and 41.7% were receiving FRIDs. The prevalence of FRID intake did not significantly differ among patients with degenerative spinal disease (n = 316), degenerative disease of extremities (n = 331), and fractures (n = 272). Compared with patients with degenerative disease of the extremities, the multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of polypharmacy and PIM intake were significantly higher in patients with degenerative spinal disease (1.26 [confidence intervals (CI): 1.11-1.44] and 1.12 [CI: 1.00-1.25]), respectively. Use of antiemetic drugs (adjusted PR, 13.36; 95% CI: 3.14-56.81) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (adjusted PR, 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05-1.78) was significantly higher in patients with degenerative spinal disease. Among patients with degenerative spinal disease, the prevalence of antiemetic drug intake was 8.7% in lumbar spinal patients and 0% in cervical spinal patients. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the orthopedic patients in this study were affected by polypharmacy, and approximately two-thirds were prescribed some form of PIMs. Patients with degenerative spinal disease showed a significantly higher prevalence of polypharmacy and PIM use compared with other orthopedic diseases. Particular attention should be paid to the high frequency of antiemetic drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intake among patients with degenerative lumbar spine conditions.
