35719257|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has created the need to develop psychological interventions to support people with dementia and their caregivers in the context of social distancing. This study sought to investigate, systematize, and report results of scientific studies published in the past 5 years on synchronous online psychological interventions using videoconferencing for informal caregivers of people with dementia. The PubMed, BIREME, and Web of Science databases were searched using the descriptors "caregiver," "dementia," "online," and "intervention." Six international studies were included in the review. Results demonstrated, in general, that this modality of intervention was acceptable, feasible, and promoted benefits for the health, quality of life, and well-being of caregivers. A need was identified for further studies investigating synchronous online interventions that include follow-up and a control group to further the evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of this type of therapeutic intervention.
