30076332|a|Adherence to antihypertensive medication is a critical factor to control blood pressure and prevent complications. However, cognitive impairment can negatively affect medication adherence. In this study, we investigated the association between cognitive function and antihypertensive medication adherence among elderly hypertensive patients using the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort Data of the Elderly Cohort. The study included 20,071 elderly hypertensive patients and the prevalence of poor medication adherence to antihypertensive medications was 16.4%. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower cognitive function was associated with poor medication adherence (adjusted odds ratio 0.980, 95% confidence interval 0.961-0.999). Additionally, high income levels, living in metropolitan areas, and comorbidities (such as stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) were positively associated with medication adherence, while patients diagnosed with cancers showed poor medication adherence. Our study demonstrated that cognitive impairment is a possible risk factor for poor antihypertensive medication adherence, even in patients without dementia. Thus, clinicians involved with geriatric care should monitor patients' cognitive function and medication adherence. And if a patient shows cognitive impairment, clinicians need to educate patients and caregivers about the importance of proper adherence, and consider proper interventions to optimize the cognitive function of elderly patients.
