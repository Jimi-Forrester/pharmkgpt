33816035|t|Intestinal Malrotation Associated With Invagination of the Distal Ileum and Cancer of the Cecum: A Case Report and Literature Review.
33816035|a|Associated midgut malrotation and colon cancer in adult patients is extremely rare and associated with delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity. We present the case of a patient with a three-week history of weakness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain with invagination of the distal ileum. Exploratory laparotomy with ileocecal resection revealed invagination, malrotation, and cecal adenocarcinoma.
