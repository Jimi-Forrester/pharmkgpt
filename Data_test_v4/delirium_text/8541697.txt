8541697|t|The use of a football helmet to secure a nasogastric tube.
8541697|a|We describe the case of a 83-yr-old diabetic woman who, during convalescence for treatment of hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma, required nasogastric intubation for enteral feeding. Her course was complicated by delirium during which time she repeatedly removed the nasogastric tube. A football helmet was used to secure the feeding tube and prevent its premature removal. Thereafter nasogastric feeding was uncomplicated. We recommend the use of a football helmet in patients with delirium who repeatedly remove their nasogastric tubes.
