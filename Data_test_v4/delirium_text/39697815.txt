39697815|t|Carbon nanotubes as neuroprotective agents.
39697815|a|Carbon nanotubes, an emerging class of carbon nanomaterials, possess tremendous potential for application in biotechnology and biomedicine particularly in neurological disorders. Carbon nanotubes owing to their fascinating properties have the potential to revolutionize medicine and technology, particularly in the realm of drug delivery, biosensing, bioimaging, and as therapeutic agents to tackle complex neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In this review, a summary of the use of carbon nanotubes for neuropathological outcomes such as alleviating oxidative stress and amyloid formation, which are well-studied molecular outcomes associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In the end, challenges associated with the clinical testing of carbon nanotubes and possible ways to overcome them are highlighted.
