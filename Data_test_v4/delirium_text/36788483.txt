36788483|a|BACKGROUND: Anaemia is common following hip fracture in ortho-geriatric patients and is associated with postoperative infections.. This study investigated whether intravenous iron supplements reduced the rate of postoperative infections within 30 days postoperatively in older adults after hip fracture surgery. METHODS: This observational study included 198 ortho-geriatric patients July 2018-May 2020. In May 2019 a local guideline was implemented and recommended II therapy on the 3rd postoperative day if haemoglobin concentration was < 6.5 mmol/L after hip fracture surgery. RESULTS: The patients were divided into four treatment groups: blood transfusion (n = 44), IV iron (n = 69), blood transfusion + IV iron (n = 35) and no treatment (n = 50). The number of patients who had an infection within 30 days was similar in the two time periods (38.8% before vs. 38.9% after systematic I.V. iron supplementation, P = 1.00) and no significant difference according to risk of infection was found between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This study documents no effect of intravenous iron supplements on postoperative infections in older adults after hip fracture surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with the Danish Data Protection Authority (2008-58-0028) the 2th of September 2019.
