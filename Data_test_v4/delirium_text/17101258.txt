17101258|t|Identifying and monitoring cognitive deficits in clinical populations using Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) tests.
17101258|a|In this article we review studies in which Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) measures were used to screen for impairment in various clinical populations. These clinical groups include patients with multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia, acquired brain injury, and migraine headache. Data are also presented from a group of outpatient referrals unselected with respect to clinical condition. Findings support the use of ANAM as a screening procedure for identifying the impaired patient.
