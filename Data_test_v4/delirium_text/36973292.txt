36973292|a|Exosomes (small extracellular vesicles: EVs) have attracted increasing attention from basic scientists and clinicians since they play important roles in cell-to-cell communication in various biological processes. Various features of EVs have been elucidated regarding their contents, generation and secretion mechanisms, and functions in inflammation, regeneration, and cancers. These vesicles are reported to contain proteins, RNAs, microRNAs, DNAs, and lipids. Although the roles of individual components have been rigorously studied, the presence and roles of glycans in EVs have rarely been reported. In particular, glycosphingolipids in EVs have not been investigated to date. In this study, the expression and function of a representative cancer-associated ganglioside, GD2, in malignant melanomas was investigated. Generally, cancer-associated gangliosides have been shown to enhance malignant properties and signals in cancers. Notably, EVs derived from GD2-expressing melanomas enhanced the malignant phenotypes of GD2-negative melanomas, such as cell growth, invasion, and cell adhesion, in a dose-dependent manner. The EVs also induced increased phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as EGF receptor and focal adhesion kinase. These results suggest that EVs released from cancer-associated ganglioside-expressing cells exert many functions that have been reported as a function of these gangliosides and regulate microenvironments, including total aggravation of heterogeneous cancer tissues, leading to more malignant and advanced cancer types.
