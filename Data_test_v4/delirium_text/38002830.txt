38002830|t|Acute Pupillary Disorders in Children: A 10-Year Retrospective Study of 101 Patients.
38002830|a|BACKGROUND: To date, no study has specifically examined children with acute-onset pupillary motility disorders (APMD). Especially in the Emergency Department (ED), it is crucial to distinguish benign and transient conditions from life-threatening or urgent conditions (UCs). The aim of the study is to describe the clinical characteristics of children with APMD and their association with an increased risk of UCs. METHODS: We conducted a pediatric retrospective study of APMD referred to ED over a 10-year period. We described the characteristics in the overall sample and in two subgroups divided according to urgency of the underlying condition. Furthermore, we applied a logistic regression model to identify the variables predictive of LT condition. RESULTS: We analyzed 101 patients. In 59.4%, the APMD was isolated. In patients with extra-ocular involvement, the most frequently associated features were altered consciousness, headache, and vomiting. Exposure to toxic agents was reported in 48.5%. Urgent conditions occurred significantly more frequently in older children, presenting bilateral APMD and/or other ocular or extra-ocular manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that UCs most commonly occur in patients presenting with bilateral APMD and other associated features. In unilateral/isolated APMD ophthalmological examination, exclusion of toxic exposure and observation until resolution of symptoms should be recommended.
