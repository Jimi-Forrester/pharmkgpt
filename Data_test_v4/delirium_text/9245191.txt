9245191|t|[Psychiatric symptoms in acute myeloblastic leukemia: a clinical case].
9245191|a|The psychiatric manifestations of hematological diseases are interesting because of their diverse presentations, complex treatment, pharmacological interactions, and frequent infectious complications. A patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) presented psychiatric manifestations of sudden onset and psychotic characteristics. The absence of organic lesions in routine neuroimaging studies suggested an added schizophreniform disorder. Further neurological study using more sensitive methods disclosed herpetic encephalitis as the origin of delirium. This case illustrates how early diagnosis, although not always possible, is important if major sequelae are to be avoided. Likewise, it is important to make a through search for organic factors in psychotic pictures that appear in the context of systemic disease.
