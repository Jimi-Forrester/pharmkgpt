33086769|t|CRP Is Transported by Monocytes and Monocyte-Derived Exosomes in the Blood of Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.
33086769|a|The objective of this work was to study the ability of blood cells and their microparticles to transport monomeric and pentameric forms of C-reactive protein (mCRP and pCRP) in the blood of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Blood was obtained from 14 patients with CAD 46 +- 13 years old and 8 healthy volunteers 49 +- 13.6 years old. Blood cells and microparticles with mCRP and pCRP on their surface were detected by flow cytometry. Messenger RNA (mRNA) of CRP was extracted from peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). mRNA of CRP in monocytes was detected with PCR. Monocytes were predominantly pCRP-positive (92.9 +- 6.8%). mCRP was present on 22.0 +- 9.6% of monocyte-derived exosomes. mCRP-positive leukocyte-derived microparticle counts were significantly higher (8764 +- 2876/microL) in the blood of patients with CAD than in healthy volunteers (1472 +- 307/microL). LPS and GM-CSF stimulated monocytes expressed CRP mRNA transcripts levels (0.79 +- 0.73-fold), slightly lower relative to unstimulated hepatocytes of the HepG2 cell line (1.0 +- 0.6-fold), but still detectable. The ability of monocytes to transport pCRP in blood flow, and monocyte-derived exosomes to transmit mCRP, may contribute to the maintenance of chronic inflammation in CAD.
