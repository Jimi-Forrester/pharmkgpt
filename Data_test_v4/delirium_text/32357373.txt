32357373|t|The MUC6/AP2A2 Locus and Its Relevance to Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.
32357373|a|We recently reported evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked genetic variation within the mucin 6 (MUC6) gene on chromosome 11p, nearby the adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit alpha 2 (AP2A2) gene. This locus has interesting features related to human genomics and clinical research. MUC6 gene variants have been reported to potentially influence viral-including herpesvirus-immunity and the gut microbiome. Within the MUC6 gene is a unique variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region. We discovered an association between MUC6 VNTR repeat expansion and AD pathologic severity, particularly tau proteinopathy. Here, we review the relevant literature. The AD-linked VNTR polymorphism may also influence AP2A2 gene expression. AP2A2 encodes a polypeptide component of the adaptor protein complex, AP-2, which is involved in clathrin-coated vesicle function and was previously implicated in AD pathogenesis. To provide background information, we describe some key knowledge gaps in AD genetics research. The "missing/hidden heritability problem" of AD is highlighted. Extensive portions of the human genome, including the MUC6 VNTR, have not been thoroughly evaluated due to limitations of existing high-throughput sequencing technology. We present and discuss additional data, along with cautionary considerations, relevant to the hypothesis that MUC6 repeat expansion influences AD pathogenesis.
