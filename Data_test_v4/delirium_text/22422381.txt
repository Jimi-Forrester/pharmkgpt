22422381|t|Clinico-radiological spectrum of bilateral temporal lobe hyperintensity: a retrospective review.
22422381|a|Bilateral temporal lobe hyperintensity (BTH) is a commonly encountered  MRI finding in a wide spectrum of clinical conditions and often poses a diagnostic  challenge to the radiologist. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate several  diseases that manifest as BTH on MRI, based on a retrospective review of cranial  MRI of 65 cases seen in our institution between October 2007 and September  2010. We found BTH in different clinical scenarios that included infective  diseases (herpes simplex virus, congenital cytomegalovirus infection),  epileptic syndrome (mesial temporal sclerosis), neurodegenerative  disorders (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Type 1  myotonic dystrophy), neoplastic conditions (gliomatosis cerebri),  metabolic disorders (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and  stroke-like episodes, Wilson's disease, hyperammonemia), dysmyelinating  disease (megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts),  and vascular (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical  infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) and paraneoplastic (limbic encephalitis)  disorders. The conventional MRI findings with advanced MRI such as diffusion-weighted  imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy along with laboratory  results are potentially helpful in distinguishing the different clinical conditions  and thus affect the early diagnosis and clinical outcome.
