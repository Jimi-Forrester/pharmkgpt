32938351|t|The Pathogenesis Mechanism, Structure Properties, Potential Drugs and Therapeutic Nanoparticles against the Small Oligomers of Amyloid-beta.
32938351|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people in the world. The abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is regarded as the key event in AD onset. Meanwhile, the Abeta oligomers are believed to be the most toxic species of Abeta. Recent studies show that the Abeta dimers, which are the smallest form of Abeta oligomers, also have the neurotoxicity in the absence of other oligomers in physiological conditions. In this review, we focus on the pathogenesis, structure and potential therapeutic molecules against small Abeta oligomers, as well as the nanoparticles (NPs) in the treatment of AD. In this review, we firstly focus on the pathogenic mechanism of Abeta oligomers, especially the Abeta dimers. The toxicity of Abeta dimer or oligomers, which attributes to the interactions with various receptors and the disruption of membrane or intracellular environments, were introduced. Then the structure properties of Abeta dimers and oligomers are summarized. Although some structural information such as the secondary structure content is characterized by experimental technologies, detailed structures are still absent. Following that, the small molecules targeting Abeta dimers or oligomers are collected; nevertheless, all of these ligands have failed to come into the market due to the rising controversy of the Abeta-related "amyloid cascade hypothesis". At last, the recent progress about the nanoparticles as the potential drugs or the drug delivery for the Abeta oligomers are present.
