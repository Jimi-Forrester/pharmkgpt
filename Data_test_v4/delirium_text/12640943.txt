12640943|t|Cognitive function assessment in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
12640943|a|PURPOSE: To describe brief assessments of functional performance and cognition to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression in older adults for the primary care provider. DATA SOURCES: Review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for the clinician to interview both the patient and a knowledgeable informant to assess changes in the patients' functioning in daily life tasks and to administer brief screening tests to detect cognitive impairment and depression in older adults. Several suggested instruments for use in the primary care setting are included. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Standardized assessments of functional performance and brief cognitive tests identify individuals with clinically meaningful cognitive impairment and provide baseline measurement against which to compare future assessments.
