37995077|t|Aging Modulates the Ability of Quiescent Radial Glia-Like Stem Cells in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus to be Recruited into Division by Pro-neurogenic Stimuli.
37995077|a|A delicate balance between quiescence and division of the radial glia-like stem cells (RGLs) ensures continuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) over the lifespan. Transient or persistent perturbations of this balance due to a brain pathology, drug administration, or therapy can lead to unfavorable long-term outcomes such as premature depletion of the RGLs, decreased AHN, and cognitive deficit. Memantine, a drug used for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, and electroconvulsive seizure (ECS), a procedure used for treating drug-resistant major depression or bipolar disorder, are known strong AHN inducers; they were earlier demonstrated to increase numbers of dividing RGLs. Here, we demonstrated that 1-month stimulation of quiescent RGLs by either memantine or ECS leads to premature exhaustion of their pool and altered AHN at later stages of life and that aging of the brain modulates the ability of the quiescent RGLs to be recruited into the cell cycle by these AHN inducers. Our findings support the aging-related divergence of functional features of quiescent RGLs and have a number of implications for the practical assessment of drugs and treatments with respect to their action on quiescent RGLs at different stages of life in animal preclinical studies.
