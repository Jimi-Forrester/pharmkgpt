38298714|t|Potential role of immunotherapy and targeted therapy in the treatment of cancer: A contemporary nursing practice.
38298714|a|Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have emerged as promising therapeutic options for cancer patients. Immunotherapies induce a host immune response that mediates long-lived tumor destruction, while targeted therapies suppress molecular mechanisms that are important for tumor maintenance and growth. In addition, cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies regulate immune responses, which increases the chances that these therapeutic approaches may be efficiently combined with immunotherapy to ameliorate clinical outcomes. Various studies have suggested that combinations of therapies that target different stages of anti-tumor immunity may be synergistic, which can lead to potent and more prolonged responses that can achieve long-lasting tumor destruction. Nurses associated with cancer patients should have a better understanding of the immunotherapies and targeted therapies, such as their efficacy profiles, mechanisms of action, as well as management and prophylaxis of adverse events. Indeed, this knowledge will be important in establishing care for cancer patients receiving immunotherapies and targeted therapies for cancer treatment. Moreover, nurses need a better understanding regarding targeted therapies and immunotherapies to ameliorate outcomes in patients receiving these therapies, as well as management and early detection of possible adverse effects, especially adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors and various other therapies that control T-cell activation causing autoimmune toxicity. Nurses practice in numerous settings, such as hospitals, home healthcare agencies, radiation therapy facilities, ambulatory care clinics, and community agencies. Therefore, as compared to other members of the healthcare team, nurses often have better opportunities to develop the essential rapport in providing effective nurse-led patient education, which is important for effective therapeutic outcomes and continuance of therapy. In this article, we have particularly focused on providing a detailed overview on targeted therapies and immunotherapies used in cancer treatment, management of their associated adverse events, and the impact as well as strategies of nurse-led patient education.
