37568156|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The incidence of depression is increasing, despite continued advances in psychological and pharmacological interventions. New treatment approaches are urgently needed. Here we assess the effects on depression of individualized micronutrient supplementation, in concert with a standard set of lifestyle changes. METHODS: We conducted a small field-study with 17 participants in Austria. Patients with depression (n = 11) and healthy volunteers (n = 6) underwent laboratory serum analysis and filled out the DASS-21 and a questionnaire about their medical history and condition. The list of parameters to be tested in the serum analysis was derived from an expert heuristic compilation of factors known to influence depression, narrowed down to a workable list to be tested in this initial study. On the basis of the results, the participants (n = 17) received individualized recommendations for micronutrient supplementation, in collaboration with their treating physician. Participants followed the individual supplementation regime for two months, along with a standard set of lifestyle changes. After two months the laboratory serum analyses, the DASS-21, and the questionnaire were repeated. RESULTS: All patients with micronutrient deficiencies were in the patient group; none of the healthy volunteers showed any micronutrient deficiencies. After two months of precision supplementation and lifestyle changes, all but one patient had recovered from their depression or had considerably improved. The one patient who didn't recover was the only one with a known trigger of their depression (trauma). Of 11 patients with depression, the trigger was unknown for the other ten. CONCLUSIONS: These results have promising implications for further research, treatment, drug development, and public health. We propose that systematic screening of patients with symptoms of depression be developed for future research, medical care, and practice. Psychiatry and psychotherapy may see improved results once they no longer have to push against the underlying constraints of existing micronutrient deficiencies.
