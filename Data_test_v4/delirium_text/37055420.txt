37055420|t|Optimization of synergic antibacterial activity of Punica granatum L. and Areca nut (P.G.L.A.N) extracts through response surface methodology.
37055420|a|The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the use of natural compounds as opposed to chemical preservatives. This study employed response methodology to evaluate the synergistic antibacterial effect of Areca nut and Punica granatum L. extract. Independent variables included extract type (Punica granatum L., Areca nut, and their mixture), solvent (water, ethanol, methanol), bacterial type (S. aureus, Salmonella, E. coli), and extract concentration (1, 10, 100 mg/L). The sensitivity was determined using the disk diffusion method, and the diameter of the inhibitory zone was measured. On the specified bacteria, the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of each extract were ascertained using the serial dilution method. This study revealed the existence of beneficial synergistic effects between the two extracts. Results indicated that the ethanolic extracts of Punica granatum L. and Areca nut had a synergistic effect on E. coli.
