15723159|t|Alzheimer's associated inflammation, potential drug targets and future therapies.
15723159|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. The most widely used treatment for Alzheimer's disease at present is acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which aim to prolong cognitive function through increased synaptic activity, without providing neuroprotection. This treatment is only symptomatic and provides modest outcomes for patients. The recent elucidation of the inflammatory pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease however, has opened doors for better treatment and prevention by identification of areas of therapeutic intervention that target the cause of the disease rather than the symptoms. This review describes the inflammatory pathways that are thought to be present in Alzheimer's disease and some of the new therapies that have shown promise, via alteration or inhibition of these pathways. Some of the therapies included in this review, which have already demonstrated beneficial effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, or have the potential to do so, are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, RAGE antagonists and antioxidants.
