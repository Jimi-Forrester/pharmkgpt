35838008|t|Association between white matter microstructure and cognitive function in patients with methamphetamine use disorder.
35838008|a|Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) has been associated with broad neurocognitive impairments. While the cognitive impairments of MUD have been demonstrated, the neuropathological underpinnings remain inadequately understood. To date, the published human diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies involving the correlation between diffusion parameters and neurocognitive function in MUD are limited. Hence, the present study aimed to examine the association between cognitive performance and white matter microstructure in patients with MUD. Forty-five patients with MUD and 43 healthy controls (HCs) completed their demographic information collection, cognitive assessments, and DTI imaging. DTI images were preprocessed to extract fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of various fiber tracts. Univariate tests were used to examine group differences in cognitive assessments and DTI metrics. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between these two metrics. The results revealed that patients with MUD had lower subset scores of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), which reflects five cognitive domains: processing speed, attention, verbal learning, visual learning, problem-solving. Patients with MUD also had significantly higher AD, MD, and RD values of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus than HCs. Furthermore, the RD value of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus was a significant predictor of processing speed and problem-solving ability, as shown by the digit-symbol coding test and NAB-Mazes scores, respectively. Findings extended our understanding of white matter microstructure that is related to neurocognitive deficits in MUD and provided potential targets for the prevention and treatment of this chronic disorder.
