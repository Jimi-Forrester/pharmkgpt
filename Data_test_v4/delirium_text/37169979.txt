37169979|t|Spectroscopic Determination of Acetylcholine (ACh): A Representative Review.
37169979|a|Acetylcholine (ACh) is one of the most crucial neurotransmitters of the cholinergic system found in vertebrates and invertebrates and is responsible for many processes in living organisms. Disturbances in ACh transmission are closely related to dementia in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. ACh in biological samples is most often determined using chromatographic techniques, radioenzymatic assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or potentiometric methods. An alternative way to detect and determine acetylcholine is applying spectroscopic techniques, due to low limits of detection and quantification, which is not possible with the methods mentioned above. In this review article, we described a detailed overview of different spectroscopic methods used to determine ACh with a collection of validation parameters as a perspective tool for routine analysis, especially in basic research on animal models on central nervous system. In addition, there is a discussion of examples of other biological materials from clinical and preclinical studies to give the whole spectrum of spectroscopic methods application. Descriptions of the developed chemical sensors, as well as the use of flow technology, were also presented. It is worth emphasizing the inclusion in the article of multi-component analysis referring to other neurotransmitters, as well as the description of the tested biological samples and extraction procedures. The motivation to use spectroscopic techniques to conduct this type of analysis and future perspectives in this field are briefly discussed.
