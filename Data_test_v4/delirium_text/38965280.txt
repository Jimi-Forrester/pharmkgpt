38965280|t|Pharmacokinetic and molecular docking studies to pyrimidine drug using Mn3O4 nanoparticles to explore potential anti-Alzheimer activity.
38965280|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the cause of dementia and accounts for 60-80% cases. Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine that provides resistance to infections, inflammation, and cancer. It developed as a prospective therapeutic target against multiple autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Cholinergic insufficiency is linked to Alzheimer's disease, and several cholinesterase inhibitors have been created to treat it, including naturally produced inhibitors, synthetic analogs, and hybrids. In the current study, we tried to prepared compounds may also support the discovery and development of novel therapeutic and preventative drugs for Alzheimer's using manganese tetroxide nanoparticles (Mn3O4-NPs) as a catalyst to generate compounds with excellent reaction conditions. The Biginelli synthesis yields 4-(4-cyanophenyl)-6-oxo-2-thioxohexahydropyrimidine-5-carbonitrile when the 4-cyanobenzaldehyde, ethyl cyanoacetate, and thiourea were coupled with Mn3O4-NPs to produce compound 1. This multi-component method is non-toxic, safe, and environmentally friendly. The new approach reduced the amount of chemicals used and preserved time. Compound 1 underwent reactions with methyl iodide, acrylonitrile, chloroacetone, ethyl chloroacetate, and chloroacetic acid/benzaldehyde, each of the synthetized compounds was docked with TNF-alpha converting enzyme. These compounds may also support the discovery and development of novel therapeutic and preventative drugs for Alzheimer's disease. The majority of the produced compounds demonstrated pharmacokinetic features, making them potentially attractive therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
