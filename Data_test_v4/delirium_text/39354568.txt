39354568|a|BACKGROUND: To date a number of papers analysing outcomes of the frozen elephant trunk (FET) in acute aortic dissection has been published. However, there are limited comparative studies on long-term outcomes of FET in acute and chronic aortic dissection. The objective of the study was to analyze the long-term outcomes after FET procedure for aortic dissection (AD). METHODS: Between March 2012 and December 2022, a total of 123 FET had been performed for thoracic aortic disease. Patients with aortic dissection (n = 97) were divided into 2 groups: acute (n = 32, 33%) and chronic aortic dissection (n = 65, 67%). Pre-, intra- and postoperative data were retrospectively collected from electronic patient's records, including follow-up data of the analyzed patients. RESULTS: The incidence of stroke was 3.1%. The delirium rate was up to 9.3% in both groups with a prevalence in chronic aortic dissection (CAD) group without significant differences (P = 0.494). Paraplegia was diagnosed only in CAD patients (n = 2). Respiratory failure and the rate of renal replacement therapy were similar in the studied groups. Re-sternotomy was required in one (3.1%) patient with acute AD and 5 (7.7%) patients with chronic AD (P = 0.416). Overall 30-day mortality in the entire cohort, acute and chronic AD was 13 (13.4%), 7 (21.9%) and 6 (9.2%), respectively (P = 0.097). The overall survival rate at 60 months for the entire cohort, acute and chronic AD was 64.1 +- 5.9%, 62.3 +- 9.1%, 66.5 +- 7%, respectively (P = 0.265). Freedom from unintended distal aortic re-intervention at 60 months for the entire cohort of patients, acute and chronic AD was 74.2 +- 1.5%, 100%, 65.3 +- 2%, respectively (P = 0.355). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience showed acceptable long-term outcomes after the FET procedure including mortality and re-intervention rate in patients with aortic dissection regardless of acuity of the dissection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered in Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12618001329257) on August 7, 2018.
