Investigating effective drugs for their treatment is imperative. Moracin D, a natural benzofuran compound isolated from Morus alba L., shows anti-inflammation and anti-breast cancer properties and is effective against Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect and mechanism of Moracin D action in pancreatic cancer remain obscure. PURPOSE: To investigate the function and molecular mechanism of Moracin D action in repressing the malignant progression of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cells were treated with Moracin D, and cell proliferation was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and immunofluorescence assays. The clonogenicity of pancreatic cancer cells was assessed based on plate colony formation and soft agar assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. The expression of proteins related to the apoptosis pathway was determined by Western blot analysis. Moracin D and XIAP were subjected to docking by auto-dock molecular docking analysis. Ubiquitination levels of XIAP and the interaction of XIAP and PARP1 were assessed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Moracin D's effects on tumorigenicity were assessed by a tumor xenograft assay. RESULTS: Moracin D inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and regulated the protein expression of molecules involved in caspase-dependent apoptosis pathways. Moracin D suppressed clonogenicity and tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, XIAP could interact with PARP1 and stabilize PARP1 by controlling its ubiquitination levels. Moracin D diminished the stability of XIAP and decreased the expression of XIAP by promoting proteasome-dependent XIAP degradation, further blocking the XIAP/PARP1 axis and repressing the progression of pancreatic cancer. Moracin D could dramatically improve the chemosensitivity of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Moracin D repressed cell growth and tumorigenesis, induced cell apoptosis, and enhanced the chemosensitivity of gemcitabine through the XIAP/PARP1 axis in pancreatic cancer. Moracin D is a potential therapeutic agent or adjuvant for pancreatic cancer.
