36165002|a|OBJECTIVES: Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress of human brain microvascular endothelial cells(BMECs) are contributors to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Acteoside has shown its therapeutic potential for AD treatment. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of acteoside on Abeta-induced blood-brain barrier damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as to explore the underlying mechanisms through network pharmacology. METHODS: The study used Abeta to induce human BMECs to construct an in-vitro injury model. Following treatment with acteoside, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to evaluate the permeability of BMECs. The apoptosis level was detected by TUNEL and Western blot, ROS assay kit was used for the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression. The let-7g-5p expression level was detected by RT-qPCR. After additional treatment with let-7g-5p inhibitor, corresponding assays were performed again. Finally, network pharmacology was used to verify the mechanism. RESULTS: Acteoside decreased the permeability, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis of Abeta-stimulated cells. More importantly, acteoside-activated let-7g-5p and additional treatment with let-7g-5p inhibitor abated the effects of acteoside on Abeta-induced permeability, oxidative stress and apoptosis of Abeta-stimulated BMECs. According to network pharmacology, 233 targeted genes of acteoside and 122 potential targets of let-7g-5p were determined by screening several databases, and two targets called Casp-3 and ITGB3 were obtained after taking the intersection. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results reveal that acteoside-activated let-7g-5p attenuating Abeta-induced increased permeability and apoptosis of human BMECs.
