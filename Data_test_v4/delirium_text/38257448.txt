38257448|t|Hydrogen Peroxide and Dopamine Sensors Based on Electrodeposition of Reduced Graphene Oxide/Silver Nanoparticles.
38257448|a|In this work, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites were electrodeposited on glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) to construct electrochemical sensors for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and dopamine (DA). The AgNPs were synthesized on graphene oxide (GO) by the hydrothermal method, followed by the reduction of the GO during the electrodeposition process, resulting in the formation of the nanocomposites on the surface of the electrodes. The generation of AgNPs on the graphene sheets was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The AgNPs/rGO/GCE showed a linear response to H2O2 in the range of 5 muM to 620 muM, with a sensitivity of 49 muA mM-1cm-2 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.19 muA. The linear response of the AgNPs/rGO/GCE to DA ranged from 1 muM to 276 muM, the sensitivity was 7.86 muA mM-1cm-2, and the LOD was 0.18 muM. Furthermore, DA and H2O2 were detected simultaneously in the same solution without interferences, and the sensors displayed good stability over time. The preparation method for the sensors is relatively eco-friendly, convenient, and efficient, exhibiting great potential for sensitive detection of DA and H2O2.
