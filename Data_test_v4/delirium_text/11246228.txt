11246228|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays a role in the distribution of lipid within many organs and cell types in the human body, including neurons and astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS). The apoE4 isoform is also a genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which apoE is involved in AD is largely unknown. In order to understand how apoE is involved in the distribution of lipid in the CNS, we sought to investigate not only the origin of intraneuronal apoE, but the pathway by which it is processed once synthesized. We have established that human neurons can synthesize apoE in the presence of astrocytes, and that intracellular neuronal apoE is processed through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, and CD63-positive lysosomes where it may be stored before secretion. Our results also suggest that apoE synthesis is regulated by a feedback mechanism, controlled by the neuron itself. This regulatory mechanism may be essential to the maintenance of neuronal cholesterol concentrations and in turn membrane stability.
