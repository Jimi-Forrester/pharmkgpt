Carnosic acid (CA) is an effective antioxidant substance and recent studies have shown that its electrophilic compounds play a role in reversing oxidative stress. Thus we tried to find out whether CA administration protects hippocampal neurons, preventing neurodegeneration in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ANIMALS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS: Sham-operated (sham), CA-pretreated sham-operated (sham+CA), untreated lesion (lesion) and CA-pretreated lesion (lesion+CA). Animals in all groups received vehicle or vehicle plus CA (CA: 10mg/ kg) intra-peritoneally one hour before surgery, again the same solution injected 3-4 hours after surgery (CA: 3 mg/kg) and repeated each afternoon for 12 days. A lesion was made by bilateral intra-hippocampal injection of 4 microl of beta amyloid protein (1.5 nmol/microl) or vehicle in each side. 14 days after surgery, the brains were extracted for histochemical studies. Data was expressed as mean +- SEM and analyzed using SPSS statistical software. RESULTS: Results showed that pretreatment with carnosic acid can reduce cellular death in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus in the lesion+CA group, as compared with the lesion group. CONCLUSION: Carnosic acid may be useful in protecting against beta amyloid-induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.
