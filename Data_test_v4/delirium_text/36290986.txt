36290986|t|Design and Fabrication of alpha-MnO2-Nanorods-Modified Glassy-Carbon-Electrode-Based Serotonin Sensor.
36290986|a|Serotonin is a very important monoamine neurotransmitter, which takes part in biological and psychological processes. In the present scenario, design and fabrication of a serotonin electrochemical sensor is of great significance. In this study, we have synthesized alpha-MnO2 via a hydrothermal synthesis method using potassium permanganate as a precursor. The physiochemical properties, such as structural and phase-purity of the prepared alpha-MnO2, were investigated by various characterization techniques and methods (powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy). Furthermore, the serotonin sensor was fabricated using alpha-MnO2 as an electrode modifier or electro-catalyst. The bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was adopted as a working substrate, and its active carbon surface was modified with the synthesized alpha-MnO2. This modified GCE (alpha-MnO2/GCE = MGCE) was explored as a serotonin sensor. The electrochemical investigations showed that the MGCE has excellent electro-catalytic properties towards determination of serotonin. The MGCE exhibits an excellent detection limit (DL) of 0.14 microM, along with good sensitivity of 2.41 microAmicroM-1 cm-2. The MGCE also demonstrated excellent selectivity for determination of serotonin in the presence of various electro-active/interfering molecules. The MGCE also exhibits good cyclic repeatability, stability, and storage stability.
