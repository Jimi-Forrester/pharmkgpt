30148531|t|Outcomes of Patients With Delirium in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Prospective Cohort Study.
30148531|a|A 6-month prospective cohort study was performed in patients with or without dementia admitted to two Korean long-term care (LTC) facilities. Participants were categorized into four groups: (a) no delirium or dementia, (b) dementia only, (c) delirium only, and (d) delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD). Delirium incidence, mortality, readmission, discharge placement, length of stay, and other associated factors were evaluated. The incidence of delirium was 48%. The largest number of patients belonged to the DSD group; outcomes associated with delirium were analyzed as covariates. The delirium-only group had a significantly higher mortality rate than other groups. Length of stay was the longest for the dementia-only group. On the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, the delirium-only group had the lowest probability of survival compared to other groups. The mortality rate of patients with delirium only was significantly higher than the mortality rates of all other groups. LTC facilities should provide preventive interventions for patients with delirium. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 44(9), 41-50.].
