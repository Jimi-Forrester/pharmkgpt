39239892|a|BACKGROUND: Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, present as low-burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their effectiveness in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or predicting its trajectory is still unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive assessments provide for identifying those at high risk of cognitive decline. METHODS: We analyzed >500 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive assessment and amyloid beta (Abeta)/tau positron emission tomography scans, examining their ability to distinguish cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. RESULTS: Performance on the digital cognitive assessment was superior to both cortical Abeta and entorhinal tau in detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting decline and future tau accumulation. DISCUSSION: Digital assessments are effective at identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools for early AD detection and monitoring. HIGHLIGHTS: Performance on digital cognitive assessments predicts progression to mild cognitive impairment at a higher proficiency compared to amyloid beta and tau. Deficits in mnemonic discrimination are indicative of future cognitive decline. Impaired mnemonic discrimination predicts future entorhinal and inferior temporal tau.
