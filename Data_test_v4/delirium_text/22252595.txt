22252595|t|[Life-threatening complication of schizophrenia].
22252595|a|The Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE) as a result of a (sub)acute thiamine deficiency remains, unfortunately, still under-diagnosed, especially among non-alcoholics. It should be considered in each occurrence of delirium as well as in any ocular motor disorder and ataxia, in particular if there is a history of weight loss with or without gastrointestinal symptoms. In cases with suspected WE an immediate intravenous substitution of 3x200 mg/d is recommended.
