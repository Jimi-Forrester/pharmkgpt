36648916|t|Occurrence of Postoperative Delirium and the Use of Different Assessment Tools.
36648916|a|(1) Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) poses a high risk of worsening outcomes for patients and is also a burden for hospitals. The leading guidelines recommend standardized POD assessment and prevention. The aim of this subgroup analysis of the PRe-Operative Prediction of Postoperative DElirium by Appropriate SCreening (PROPDESC) trial was to compare different delirium assessments and to analyse the frequency of POD on five postoperative days. (2) Methods: This prospective observational trial enrolled 1097 patients in a university hospital from 2018 until 2019. The following POD assessment tools were used for five consecutive days: Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) or Confusion Assessment Method for normal ward (CAM), 4 A's Test (4AT) and Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale. (3) Results: In a 5-day visit interval, most new POD developments occurred on the first and second postoperative day. A clear recommendation for a specific POD assessment tool based on our results cannot be given. (4) Conclusions: According to guidelines, a POD assessment should take place on the first five postoperative days, but of these, the first two are those of highest POD occurrence. The POD assessment tool used should at best include direct patient questioning and aspects of patient observation.
