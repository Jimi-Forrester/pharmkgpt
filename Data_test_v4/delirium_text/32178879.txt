32178879|a|Several disorders are usually involved in the cognitive deficit of the oldest old. Alzheimer disease is the commonest. It is usually characterized by progressive memory impairment - neocortical symptoms occurring much later in the course of the disease. Alzheimer disease should not be considered any more as the single cause of a cognitive deficit in a very old patient. Vascular alterations, possibly causing microinfarcts, are commonly associated, especially in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A slowly progressive memory deficit with negative CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease may be due to hippocampal sclerosis that may be the consequence of multiple causes: in most of the cases, it is associated with neuronal TDP-43 inclusions. Recently, a distribution of these inclusions to a territory more extensive than the hippocampus has been reported and attributed to a new entity, called Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE) with or without hippocampal sclerosis. The presence of cortical Lewy bodies may cause an intellectual deficit or contribute to it. The prevalence of dementia with cortical Lewy bodies in the oldest old is discussed. Tau inclusions in cortical glia have also been shown to participate to the intellectual deficit. Association of neurodegenerative and vascular changes is the most frequent situation in the very old patients. Systemic diseases such as diabetes or heart failure, prescription drugs (when misused), or toxic such as alcohol may also contribute to the cognitive impairment and be amenable to treatment.
