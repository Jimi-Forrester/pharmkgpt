32854248|t|Lessons from Recent Advances in Ischemic Stroke Management and Targeting Kv2.1 for Neuroprotection.
32854248|a|Achieving neuroprotection in ischemic stroke patients has been a multidecade medical challenge. Numerous clinical trials were discontinued in futility and many were terminated in response to deleterious treatment effects. Recently, however, several positive reports have generated the much-needed excitement surrounding stroke therapy. In this review, we describe the clinical studies that significantly expanded the time window of eligibility for patients to receive mechanical endovascular thrombectomy. We further summarize the results available thus far for nerinetide, a promising neuroprotective agent for stroke treatment. Lastly, we reflect upon aspects of these impactful trials in our own studies targeting the Kv2.1-mediated cell death pathway in neurons for neuroprotection. We argue that recent changes in the clinical landscape should be adapted by preclinical research in order to continue progressing toward the development of efficacious neuroprotective therapies for ischemic stroke.
