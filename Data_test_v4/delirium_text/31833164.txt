31833164|t|Serum levels and mutual correlations of amyloid beta in patients with depression.
31833164|a|AIM: Epidemiological studies have shown that depression is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the biological mechanism underlying the link between depression and AD is unclear, altered amyloid beta (Abeta) metabolism in patients with depression has been suggested as a potential mechanism. Results from previous studies of Abeta metabolism in patients with depression have been inconsistent, and Abeta polymerization, which is a crucial process in AD pathology, has not previously been assessed. METHODS: Serum levels of Abeta40, Abeta42 and Abeta oligomers were evaluated in 104 inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 132 healthy control individuals. RESULTS: Lower serum Abeta42 levels were observed in patients with MDD, but there was no difference in serum Abeta oligomer levels between the MDD group and the healthy control group, even in older adults. Interestingly, serum Abeta oligomer levels in patients with MDD were dependent on serum Abeta42 levels, regardless of age, and this relationship was not observed in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Abeta42 is more prone to aggregation and polymerization in patients with depression than in healthy individuals, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the transition from depression to AD.
