39305703|t|Resting-state functional connectivity abnormalities in subjective cognitive decline: A 7T MRI study.
39305703|a|Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) MRI is sensitive to brain changes in Alzheimer's disease in preclinical stages, however studies in persons with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have reported conflicting findings, and no study is available at 7T MRI. In this study, we investigated FC alterations in sixty-six participants recruited at the Geneva Memory Center (24 controls, 14 SCD, 28 cognitively impaired [CI]). Participants were classified as SCD if they reported cognitive complaints without objective cognitive deficits, and underwent 7T fMRI to assess FC in canonical brain networks and their association with cognitive/clinical features. SCD showed normal cognition, a trend for higher depressive symptoms, and normal AD biomarkers. Compared to the other two groups, SCD showed higher FC in frontal default mode network (DMN) and insular and superior temporal nodes of ventral attention network (VAN). Higher FC in the DMN and VAN was associated with worse cognition but not depression, suggesting that hyper-connectivity in these networks may be a signature of age-related cognitive decline in SCD at low risk of developing AD.
