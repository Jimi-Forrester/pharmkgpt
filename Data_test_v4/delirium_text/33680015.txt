33680015|a|In this study, we focused on the neuro-behavioral profile, toxicity, and possible mechanisms of action of Dorema ammoniacum gum essential oil (DAG-EO). For this purpose, passive avoidance and Y-maze tests were performed to evaluate the potential effect of DAG-EO in the attenuation of memory impairment induced by 49 days administration of D-galactose and acute injection of scopolamine. Anticonvulsant and anti-nociceptive activities of DAG-EO were evaluated in the pentylenetetrazole and maximal electroshock-induced models of seizure and acetic acid-induced writhing tests, respectively. To find the possible mechanism of action, flumazenil and naloxone were used. Furthermore, the possible side effects were determined in the open field, grip strength, and rotarod tests. Our findings supported that 7-day administration of DAG-EO (50 and 100 mg/kg) improves memory impairment induced following administration of D-galactose and scopolamine. It was also revealed that DAG-EO possesses a dose-dependent sedative-hypnotic (100 mg/kg), anticonvulsant (ED50   170 mg/kg), and anti-nociceptive (ED50   175 mg/kg) activities possibly mediated via directly and/or indirectly modulation of GABAA and opioid receptors. No side effect was observed except muscle relaxation which was less than that of diazepam. The output of this study confirms anti-seizure, anti-nociceptive, sedative-hypnotic, and memory-enhancing properties of DAG-EO by modulation of GABAA receptors.
