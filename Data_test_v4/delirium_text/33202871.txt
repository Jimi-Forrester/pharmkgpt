33202871|a|Aging is a complicated biological process in which functional and structural alterations in a living organism take place over time. Reactive oxygen species is one of the main factors responsible for aging and is associated with several chronic pathologies. The relationship between aging and diet is quite interesting and has attained worldwide attention. Healthy food, in addition to dietary antioxidants, are required to delay the process of aging and improve the quality of life. Many healthy foods such as fruits are a good source of dietary nutrients and natural bioactive compounds which have antioxidant properties and are involved in preventing aging and other age-related disorders. Health benefits linked with healthy consumption of fruit have drawn increased interest. A significant number of studies have documented the advantages of fruit intake, as it suppresses free-radical development that further reduces the oxidative stress created in the body and protects against several types of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory disorders, and other cardiovascular diseases that ultimately prevent aging. In addition, fruits have numerous other properties like anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, and have health-promoting effects. Mechanisms of various bioactive compounds that aids in preventing various diseases and increases longevity are also described. This manuscript provides a summary of various bioactive components present in fruits along with their health-promoting and antiaging properties.
