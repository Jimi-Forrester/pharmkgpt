34684091|a|Background and Objectives: Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease in which gradual destruction of tissues around teeth is caused by plaque formed by pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of 75% ethanol extract of Colocasia antiquorum var. esculenta (CA) as a prophylactic and improvement agent for periodontal disease in vitro and in vivo. Materials and Methods: The antimicrobial efficacy of CA against Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis, ATCC 33277) was evaluated using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) test, and cytotoxicity was confirmed by CCK-8 assay. For the in vivo study, P. gingivalis was applied by oral gavage to BALB/c mice. Forty-two days after the first inoculation of P. gingivalis, intraoral swabs were taken for microbiome analysis, and the mice were sacrificed to evaluate the alveolar bone loss. Results: The MIC of CA against P. gingivalis was 31.3 mug/mL, the MBC was 62.5 mug/mL, with no cytotoxicity. The diversity of the oral microbiome decreased in the positive control group, while those of the VA (varnish) and VCA (varnish added with CA) groups increased as much as in the negative control group, although the alveolar bone loss was not induced in the mouse model. Conclusions: CA showed antibacterial effects in vitro, and the VA and VCA groups exhibited increased diversity in the oral microbiome, suggesting that CA has potential for improving periodontal disease.
