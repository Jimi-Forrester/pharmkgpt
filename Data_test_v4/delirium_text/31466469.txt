31466469|t|Medication Use and Risk of Delirium in Mechanically Ventilated Patients.
31466469|a|One of the principal complications in patients in the intensive care unit, particularly in those receiving mechanical ventilation, is medication-induced delirium. The present study aimed to intensively analyze pharmaceutical factors affecting the development of delirium in mechanically ventilated patients using the electronic health records. The present study was designed as a retrospective case-control study. The delirium group included 500 mechanically ventilated patients. The non-delirium group included 2,000 patients who were hospitalized during the same period as the delirium group and received mechanical ventilation. A total of seven types of medications (narcotic analgesics, non-narcotic analgesics, psychopharmaceuticals, sleep aid medications, anticholinergics, steroids, and diuretics), conventionally used to manage mechanical ventilation, were found to be major risk factors associated with the occurrence of delirium. Since these medications are an integral part of managing mechanically ventilated patients, prudent protocol-based medication approaches are essential to decrease the risk of delirium.
