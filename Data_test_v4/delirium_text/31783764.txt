31783764|a|Human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus and infects approximately 10-20 million people worldwide. While the majority of infected people are asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1, only 4% of infected people develop HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a chronic, progressive, neurological disease which usually progresses slowly without remission, and is characterized by perivascular inflammatory infiltrates in chronic inflammatory lesions of the central nervous system (CNS), primarily affecting the spinal cord. A high HTLV-1 proviral load, high levels of antibodies against HTLV-1 antigens, and elevated concentration of proteins are detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HAM/TSP patients. These chronically activated immune responses against HTLV-1 and infiltration of inflammatory cells including HTLV-1 infected cells into the CNS contribute to clinical disability and underlie the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. Since the disease development of HAM/TSP mainly occurs in adults, with a mean age at onset of 40-50 years, it is important for HTLV-1-infected carriers and HAM/TSP patients to be monitored throughout the disease process. Recent advances in technologies and findings provide new insights to virological and immunological aspects in both the CNS as well as in peripheral blood. In this review, we focus on understanding the inflammatory milieu in the CNS and discuss the immunopathogenic process in HTLV-1-associated neurologic diseases.
