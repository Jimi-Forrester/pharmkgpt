6666458|t|[Psychopathology of delusional disorders of an interpretive character in the course of paroxysmal schizophrenia].
6666458|a|Sixty patients with paroxysmal progressive schizophrenia were observed. Three variants of paroxysms were identified, viz. acute systematized interpretative delirium states; those with a mild degree of systematization and states with a mixed (interpretative-sensual) nature of delirium formation and a tendency toward delirium systematization. The psychopathological structure of every variant of these conditions was found to correlate with the clinical picture of the disease as a whole.
