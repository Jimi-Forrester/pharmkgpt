36046698|t|Effectiveness and Safety of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Persons Exposed to Cases of Invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease: A Systematic Review.
36046698|a|Among close contacts of patients with invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection, the benefits and harms of chemoprophylaxis are uncertain. We conducted a systematic review of studies that reported on persons who, after being exposed to a case of laboratory-confirmed or probable iGAS, received any antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of GAS infection or carriage. Thirty-seven studies including 26 outbreak investigations and 11 case series or reports were included with predominantly descriptive information that suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis may be effective in preventing GAS infection or GAS carriage, with very few serious adverse events. However, current available evidence is scant (with limited information on contacts of iGAS cases) and largely based on studies with weak design and small sample size. Therefore, definitive conclusions on effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis cannot be drawn. Well designed prospective studies are required to establish the benefit-harm profile of antibiotic prophylaxis for secondary prevention of GAS disease among close contacts of iGAS cases.
