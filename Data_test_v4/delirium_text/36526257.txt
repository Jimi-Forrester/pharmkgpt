36526257|a|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) are the global standard of care for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and show significant positive effects in neurodegenerative diseases with cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Although experimental and large-scale clinical evidence indicates the potential long-term efficacy of ChEI, primary outcomes are generally heterogeneous across outpatient clinics and regional healthcare systems. Sub-optimal dosing or slow tapering, heterogeneous guidelines about the timing for therapy initiation (prodromal versus dementia stages), healthcare providers' ambivalence to treatment, lack of disease awareness, delayed medical consultation, prescription of ChEI in non-AD cognitive disorders, contribute to the negative outcomes. We present an evidence-based overview of determinants, spanning genetic, molecular, and large-scale networks, involved in the response to ChEI in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A comprehensive understanding of cerebral and retinal cholinergic system dysfunctions along with ChEI response predictors in AD is crucial since disease-modifying therapies will frequently be prescribed in combination with ChEI. Therapeutic algorithms tailored to genetic, biological, clinical (endo)phenotypes, and disease stages will help leverage inter-drug synergy and attain optimal combined response outcomes, in line with the precision medicine model.
