28214194|a|AIM: To describe the orthogeriatric activity in the elderly with hip fractures in the Hospital Mancha Centro, based on the recommendations of the main guidelines. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Observational prospective study, comprising all patients over 65 years of age admitted to the Traumatology Unit with a hip fracture between April 2015 and December 2015. Patients were admitted under the care of the Traumatology Unit with cross-consultation carried out with the Geriatrics Department, which then carried out a pre-operative geriatric assessment and the post-operative follow-ups. RESULTS: The mean pre-surgery waiting time was 48h and the overall time in hospital was 10.3+-8.2 days. Patients who suffered from delirium (42.1%) did not improve as well, and were referred to nursing homes. Blood transfusions were received by 54.7% of the patients, despite 53.5% of them having received intravenous and/or oral iron after the surgery. Treatment with calcium and vitamin D was prescribed in 79% of the patients on discharge. The Rehabilitation Unit assessed 36% of the patients, with 4.8% fully, and 16.7% partially recovering their prior functional status. Upon discharge, 55% of the patients returned to their homes, and 22% were referred to short-term assisted living facilities. DISCUSSION: This article describes how the main clinical problems are handled in the elderly with hip fractures in our hospital, based on recommendations of the main guidelines and publications. CONCLUSIONS: Our hospital follows the recommended guidelines. Aspects for improvement include the management of anaemia during admission and rehabilitation.
