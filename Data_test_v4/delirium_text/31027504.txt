31027504|a|BACKGROUND: To determine whether photobiomodulation (PBM) rescued the disruption of Na+/Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential by ouabain; the Na, K-ATPase inhibitor. For PBM in this study, a 660 nm LED array was used at energy densities of 0.78, 1.56, 3.12, 6.24, and 9.36 J/cm2. RESULTS: HCN-2 neuronal cells treated with ouabain showed loss of cell polarity, disrupted cell morphology, and decreased cell viability, which were improved after PBM treatment. We found that ouabain-induced Na, K-ATPase inhibition promoted activation of downstream signaling through Src, Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which were suppressed after PBM treatment. This provided evidence of Na, K-ATPase alpha-subunit inactivation and intracellular Ca2+ increase. In response to ouabain, we observed activation of Src and MAPK by Na, K-ATPase, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and Na+-dependent Ca2+ increases, which were restored by PBM treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that Na+/K+ imbalance could be regulated by PBM treatment in neuronal cells, and we suggest that PBM is a potential therapeutic tool for Na, K-ATPase targeted neuronal diseases.
