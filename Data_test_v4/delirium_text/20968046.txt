20968046|t|[Alteration of calcium signaling as one of the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and diabetic polyneuropathy].
20968046|a|This review is devoted to the action of amyloid-beta peptide on the functional activity of intracellular and plasmalemmal calcium-regulated structures in cultured hyppocampal neurons: mitochondria and voltage-gated calcium channels. A comparative analysis of relative changes of plasmalemmal structures in such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's illness and diabetic neuropathy has been made.
