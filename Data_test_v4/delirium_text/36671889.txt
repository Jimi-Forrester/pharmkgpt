36671889|t|Palladium Hydroxide (Pearlman's Catalyst) Doped MXene (Ti3C2Tx) Composite Modified Electrode for Selective Detection of Nicotine in Human Sweat.
36671889|a|High concentrations of nicotine (40 to 60 mg) are more dangerous for adults who weigh about 70 kg. Herein, we developed an electrochemical transducer using an MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/palladium hydroxide-supported carbon (Pearlman's catalyst) composite (MXene/Pd(OH)2/C) for the identification of nicotine levels in human sweat. Firstly, the MXene was doped with Pd(OH)2/C (PHC) by mechanical grinding followed by an ultrasonication process to obtain the MXene/PHC composite. Secondly, XRD, Raman, FE-SEM, EDS and E-mapping analysis were utilized to confirm the successful formation of MXene/PHC composite. Using MXene/PHC composite dispersion, an MXene/PHC composite-modified glassy carbon electrode (MXene/PHC/GCE) was prepared, which showed high sensitivity as well as selectivity towards nicotine (300 microM NIC) oxidation in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry. The MXene/PHC/GCE had reduced the over potential of nicotine oxidation (about 200 mV) and also enhanced the oxidation peak current (8.9 microA) compared to bare/GCE (2.1 microA) and MXene/GCE (5.5 microA). Moreover, the optimized experimental condition was used for the quantification of NIC from 0.25 microM to 37.5 microM. The limit of detection (LOD) and sensitivity were 27 nM and 0.286 microA microM-1 cm2, respectively. The MXene/PHC/GCE was also tested in the presence of Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, ascorbic acid, dopamine and glucose. These molecules were not interfered during NIC analysis, which indicated the good selectivity of the MXene/PHC/GCE sensor. In addition, electrochemical determination of NIC was successfully carried out in the human sweat samples collected from a tobacco smoker. The recovery percentage of NIC in the sweat sample was 97%. Finally, we concluded that the MXene/PHC composite-based sensor can be prepared for the accurate determination of NIC with high sensitivity, selectivity and stability in human sweat samples.
