21860088|a|Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous work has demonstrated that combined folate and vitamin B12 (vit-B12) supplementation prevents tau hyperphosphorylation and memory deficits induced by acute administration of homocysteine in young rats. Here, we further investigated whether folate/vit-B12 supplementation is also effective in aged rats with a chronically high level of homocysteine. 18-month-old rats were injected with homocysteine via the vena caudalis with or without a concurrent folate/vit-B12 supplementation for 28 weeks. We found that hyperhomocysteinemia induced tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation in hippocampus and cortex. Concurrent signaling changes included the activation of glycogen synthase kinases-3beta, cyclin-dependent kinase-5, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38MAPK, and inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A. Although the ability to learn was not affected, the aged rats exhibited significant memory deficits. Folate/vit-B12 supplementation attenuated these biochemical and behavioral correlates. These data demonstrate that folate/vit-B12 supplementation is also effective in a chronic hyperhomocysteinemia model in reversing the AD-like tau pathologies and memory deficits.
