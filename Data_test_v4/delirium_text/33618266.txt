33618266|t|Differential associations of age and Alzheimer's disease with sleep and rest-activity rhythms across the adult lifespan.
33618266|a|This study aimed to identify differences between physiological age-related and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related alterations in sleep and rest-activity rhythm. All participants (n = 280; 20-90 years) underwent clinical assessments, [11C] Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography, and actigraphic monitoring. In cognitively normal adults without cerebral amyloid-beta, older age was associated with earlier timing of circadian phase and robust rest-activity rhythm, but sleep quantity and quality were mostly unaffected by age. While preclinical AD was associated with earlier circadian timing, clinical AD exhibited later timing of daily rhythm and increased sleep duration. In conclusion, our findings suggest that older age itself leads to a more regular daily activity rhythm, but does not affect sleep duration. While preclinical AD made the effects of age-related phase advance more prominent, clinical AD was related to later circadian timing and increased sleep duration.
