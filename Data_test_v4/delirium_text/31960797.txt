31960797|a|Traumatic brain injury remains a global health crisis that spans all demographics, yet there exist limited treatment options that may effectively curtail its lingering symptoms. Traumatic brain injury pathology entails a progression from primary injury to inflammation-mediated secondary cell death. Sequestering this inflammation as a means of ameliorating the greater symptomology of traumatic brain injury has emerged as an attractive treatment prospect. In this review, we recapitulate and evaluate the important developments relating to regulating traumatic brain injury-induced neuroinflammation, edema, and blood-brain barrier disintegration through pharmacotherapy and stem cell transplants. Although these studies of stand-alone treatments have yielded some positive results, more therapeutic outcomes have been documented from the promising area of combined drug and stem cell therapy. Harnessing the facilitatory properties of certain pharmaceuticals with the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects of stem cell transplants creates a synergistic effect greater than the sum of its parts. The burgeoning evidence in favor of combined drug and stem cell therapies warrants more elaborate preclinical studies on this topic in order to pave the way for later clinical trials.
