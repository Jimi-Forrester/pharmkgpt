16453252|t|Efficacy and safety of outpatient alcohol detoxification with a combination of tiapride/carbamazepine: additional evidence.
16453252|a|BACKGROUND: Few medications have been tested for outpatient alcohol detoxification. Previously we had shown a combination of carbamazepine and tiapride to be effective in an open study. This database is an extension of our previous work. METHODS: This was an open prospective study to examine the efficacy, practicability and medical safety of a combination of tiapride and carbamazepine in outpatient detoxification of alcohol dependent patients. Patients were carefully screened for relevant neuropsychiatric disorders and then seen on a daily outpatient basis. RESULTS: A total number of 116 consecutively admitted patients entered the programme; 107 (92%) successfully ended the treatment. The mean initial dose for tiapride was 289 mg and for carbamazepine 502 mg. No serious medical complications or adverse events were observed except for one case of delirium tremens. Only four patients dropped out because of side effects. In general medication was well tolerated. Withdrawal symptomatology as indicated by CIWA-A-scores decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study give further evidence for a combination of tiapride and the anticonvulsant carbamazepine as an effective and safe treatment for outpatient alcohol detoxification in patients with moderate severity of withdrawal syndrome. Further randomized trials are warranted to examine the efficacy of this combination in outpatient alcohol withdrawal.
