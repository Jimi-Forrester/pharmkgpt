39500626|t|Lysine Acetyltransferase TIP60 Restricts Nerve Injury by Activating IKKbeta/SNAP23 Axis-Mediated Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion in Alzheimer's Disease.
39500626|a|OBJECTIVE: The hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein is considered an important cause of neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The disruption of neuronal histone acetylation homeostasis mediated by Tip60 HAT is a common early event in neurodegenerative diseases, but the deeper regulatory mechanism on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and autophagic function in AD is still unclear. METHODS: AD models were established both in APP/PS1 mice and Abeta1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The Morris water maze test (MWM) was performed to examine mouse cognitive function. Neurological damage in the hippocampus was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Nissl's, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and NeuN staining. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion was detected by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Lyso-Tracker Red staining. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The molecular interactions were verified by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), dual luciferase assays, and ChIP detections. The RNA and autophagy-lysosome-related proteins were assessed by Western blot and RT-qPCR. RESULTS: TIP60 overexpression improved cognitive deficits and neurological damage and restored the impairment of autophagy-lysosomes fusion in vivo. Similarly, the upregulation of TIP60 in Abeta1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells suppressed neuronal apoptosis and tau phosphorylation through the activating autophagy-lysosome pathway. Mechanistically, TIP60 activated IKKbeta transcription by promoting SOX4 acetylation, thus leading to the translocation of SNAP23 to STX17-contained autophagosomes. Moreover, the protective roles of TIP60 in neuron damage were abolished by the inhibition of SOX4/IKKbeta signaling. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results highlighted the potential of the TIP60 target for AD and provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying neuroprotection in this disorder.
