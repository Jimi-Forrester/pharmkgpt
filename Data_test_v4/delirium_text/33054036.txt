33054036|a|The literature data on changes in the content of iron and its metabolites in brain structures during aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease - PD and Alzheimer's disease - AD) are analyzed. It was revealed that with aging, the iron content in nigrostriatal formations of brain changes: the level of non-heme iron and ferritin increases and neuromelanin also accumulates in neurons of black substance. The accumulation of neuromelanin in combination with increase in ferritin content can be considered as a morphochemical sign of neuroprotective effect of nervous tissue during aging. The iron level in PD and AD compared with that during physiological aging continues to increase, and the ability of chelating agents to bind iron decreases (ferritin in neuroglia cells and neuromelanin in neurons), which activates the mechanisms of cell destruction. As a result, in PD, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein is disrupted, which leads to the formation of Levi bodies, and in AD, the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) undergoes proteolysis and this leads to the formation of amyloid plaques, which triggers subsequent neurodegenerative changes, including the death of neurons.
