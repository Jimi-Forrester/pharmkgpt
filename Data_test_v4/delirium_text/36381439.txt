36381439|t|Surgical Treatment for Degenerative Lumbar Disease With Neurologic Deficits: Comparison Between Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion and Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion.
36381439|a|Objective: This study aimed to compare the radiological and clinical outcomes of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) surgeries and to confirm the effects of additional partial laminectomy on the surgical outcomes of OLIF. Methods: This retrospective study included 130 patients who underwent OLIF or PLIF for single-level fusion. Among them, 42 patients underwent PLIF and open pedicle screw fixation and 88 underwent OLIF and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. In the OLIF group, 42 patients received additional neural decompression through partial laminectomy and discectomy (direct OLIF), whereas the remaining 46 patients did not (indirect OLIF). To measure the neurological deficits, the clinical outcomes were evaluated using a visual analog scale for back and leg pain and the Oswestry Disability Index. Radiologic outcomes were evaluated based on the disc and foraminal heights as well as the segmental lordotic and lumbar lordotic angles. Results: The improvement in the clinical outcomes did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. Radiologically, the 2 OLIF groups showed statistically significant improvements in the disc and foraminal heights when compared with the PLIF group. The PLIF group showed a significant decrease in the disc height and segmental lordotic angle when compared with the OLIF group in the postoperative 1-year period. Conclusion: Both OLIF and PLIF showed similar clinical outcomes in the single-level lumbar fusion. However, OLIF grafts showed an advantage over PLIF with respect to the radiographic outcomes and complication rates. Additionally, partial laminectomy did not significantly affect the radiological results.
