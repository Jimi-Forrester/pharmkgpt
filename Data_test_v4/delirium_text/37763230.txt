37763230|t|Synergism of Carbamoylated Erythropoietin and Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 in Immediate Early Gene Expression.
37763230|a|Trophic factors are secreted proteins that can modulate neuronal integrity, structure, and function. Previous preclinical studies have shown synergistic effects on decreasing apoptosis and improving behavioral performance after stroke when combining two such trophic factors, erythropoietin (EPO) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). However, EPO can elevate the hematocrit level, which can be life-threatening for non-anemic individuals. A chemically engineered derivative of EPO, carbamoylated EPO (CEPO), does not impact hematological parameters but retains neurotrophic effects similar to EPO. To obtain insight into CEPO and IGF-1 combination signaling, we examined immediate early gene (IEG) expression after treatment with CEPO, IGF-1, or CEPO + IGF-1 in rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and found that combining CEPO and IGF-1 produced a synergistic increase in IEG expression. An in vivo increase in the protein expression of Npas4 and Nptx2 was also observed in the rat hippocampus. We also examined which kinase signaling pathways might be mediating these effects and found that while AKT inhibition did not alter the pattern of IEG expression, both ERK and JAK2 inhibition significantly decreased IEG expression. These results begin to define the molecular effects of combining CEPO and IGF-1 and indicate the potential for these trophic factors to produce positive, synergistic effects.
