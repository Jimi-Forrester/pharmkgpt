22447723|t|A potential role for zinc alterations in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
22447723|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the major causes of disability and mortality in Western societies, is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence suggests that the etiology of AD may involve disruptions of zinc (Zn) homeostasis. This review discusses current evidence supporting a potential role of Zn and zinc transporters (ZnTs) in processing of the amyloid beta protein precursor (APP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide generation and aggregation.
