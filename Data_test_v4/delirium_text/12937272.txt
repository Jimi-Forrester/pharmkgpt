12937272|a|Association between protein inclusions and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and polyglutamine disorders, has been widely documented. Although ubiquitin is conjugated to many of these aggregated proteins, the 26S proteasome does not efficiently degrade them. Mutations in the ubiquitin-protein ligase Parkin are associated with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. Although Parkin-positive inclusions are not detected in brains of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism patients, Parkin is found in Lewy bodies in sporadic disease. This suggests that loss of Parkin ligase activity via mutation, or sequestration to Lewy bodies, is a contributory factor to sporadic disease onset. We now demonstrate that decreased proteasomal activity causes formation of large, noncytotoxic inclusions within the cytoplasm of both neuronal and nonneuronal cells overexpressing Parkin. This is not a general phenomenon as there is an absence of similar inclusions when HHARI, a structural homolog of Parkin, is overexpressed. The inclusions colocalize with ubiquitin and with proteasomes. Furthermore, Parkin inclusions colocalize with gamma-tubulin, acetylated alpha-tubulin, and cause redistribution of vimentin, suggesting aggresome-like properties. Our data imply that lower proteasomal activity, previously observed in brain tissue of Parkinson's disease patients, leads to Parkin accumulation and a concomitant reduction in ligase activity, thereby promoting Lewy body formation.
