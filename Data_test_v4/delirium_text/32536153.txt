32536153|t|DNAzyme-Powered Three-Dimensional DNA Walker Nanoprobe for Detection Amyloid beta-Peptide Oligomer in Living Cells and in Vivo.
32536153|a|Amyloid beta-peptide oligomer (AbetaO) is widely acknowledged as the promising biomarker for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this work, we designed a three-dimensional (3D) DNA walker nanoprobe for AbetaO detection and real-time imaging in living cells and in vivo. The presence of AbetaO triggered the DNAzyme walking strand to cleave the fluorophore (TAMRA)-labeled substrate strand modified on the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface and release TAMRA-labeled DNA fragment, resulting in the recovery of fluorescent signal. The entire process was autonomous and continuous, without external fuel strands or protease, and finally produced plenty of TAMRA fluorescence, achieving signal amplification effect. The nanoprobe enabled the quantitative detection of AbetaO in vitro, and the limit of detection was 22.3 pM. Given the good biocompatibility of 3D DNA walker nanoprobe, we extended this enzyme-free signal amplification method to real-time imaging of AbetaO. Under the microscope, nanoprobe accurately located and visualized the distribution of AbetaO in living cells. Moreover, in vivo imaging results showed that our nanoprobe could be used to effectively distinguish the AD mice from the wild-type mice. This nanoprobe with the advantages of great sensitivity, high specificity, and convenience, provides an outstanding prospect for AD's early diagnosis development.
