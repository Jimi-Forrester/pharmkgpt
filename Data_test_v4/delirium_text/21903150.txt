21903150|a|Aging is associated with cognitive deterioration. A recent study showed two polymorphisms (rs505058 in LMNA and rs11622883 near a SERPINA13 gene), identified in a genome-wide association study of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, to be associated with cognitive function (Mini Mental State Examination) in a UK elderly population. This study replicated these findings in Chinese elderly males without dementia. A total of 358 elderly subjects were assessed by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instruments (CASI) and the Wechsler Digit Span Task tests. Analysis of covariance was used to compare cognitive scores among genotypic groups, with age and total education years as covariates. The two polymorphisms were not associated with the global cognitive function or specific cognitive domains in the elderly without dementia. Our data argue against that these two polymorphisms may affect cognitive function in the elderly.
