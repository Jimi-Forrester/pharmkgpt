18665420|t|Functional genomics approaches to neurodegenerative diseases.
18665420|a|Many of the neurodegenerative diseases that afflict humans are characterised by the protein aggregation in neurons. These include complex diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and Mendelian diseases caused by polyglutamine expansion mutations [like Huntington's disease (HD) and various spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), like SCA3]. A range of functional genomic strategies have been used to try to elucidate pathways involved in these diseases. In this minireview, I focus on how modifier screens in organisms from yeast to mice may be of value in helping to elucidate pathogenic pathways.
