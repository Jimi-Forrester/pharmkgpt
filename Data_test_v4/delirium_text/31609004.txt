31609004|a|In this study, urease, tyrosinase, cholinesterase inhibitory, and antioxidant activities of various extracts of Sideritis albiflora and Sideritis leptoclada were determined together with the phytochemical contents. In addition, the fatty acid compositions and phenolic compounds were investigated by gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid in both Sideritis species were identified as the most abundant phenolic compounds whereas palmitic acid was found as a major fatty acid. The acetone extract of S. leptoclada indicated the highest antioxidant activity in beta-carotene-linoleic acid (IC50 : 17.23 +- 0.11 microg/ml), DPPH  (IC50 : 28.14 +- 0.05 microg/ml) and ABTS + (IC50 : 15.18 +- 0.02 microg/ml) assays. The acetone extract of S. albiflora (A0.50 : 32.71 +- 0.44 microg/ml) was found as the best reductant in cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay. Against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), only the hexane extracts of Sideritis species showed moderate inhibitory activity. Moreover, all extracts of S. albiflora and the hexane extract of S. leptoclada exhibited significantly higher urease inhibitory activity than that of thiourea. Further, in vivo activity studies on extracts and isolated constituents obtained from these species are needed to understand the activity in biological systems. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Multiple pharmacological studies have proven that Sideritis species is precious with significant bioactive properties. This is the first comprehensive research to determine the enzyme inhibitory and antioxidant activities of various extracts of S. albiflora and S. leptoclada with phytochemical contents. Both Sideritis species were found to be rich in rosmarinic and caffeic acids. The acetone extracts showed the highest activity in terms of antioxidant activity, while the hexane extracts exhibited superior urease inhibitory activity. These results show that Sideritis species could be used as urease inhibitors' agents and source of antioxidants in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.
