33605409|a|OBJECTIVE: Cartilage and bone damage in RA are associated with elevated IL-1beta. The effects of IL-1beta can be reduced by biological therapies that target IL-1beta or TNF-alpha. However, the mechanisms responsible for increased IL-1beta and the effect of anti-TNF-alpha have not been fully elucidated. Recently, sterile-alpha and armadillo motif containing protein (SARM) was identified as a negative regulator of toll-like receptor (TLR) induced IL-1beta secretion through an interaction with the inflammasome. This study set out to investigate SARM during TLR-induced IL-1beta secretion in RA peripheral blood monocytes and in patients commencing anti-TNF-alpha treatment. METHODS: Monocytes were isolated from RA patients and healthy controls; disease activity was measured by DAS28. IL-1beta secretion was measured by ELISA following TLR1/2, TLR4 and TLR7/8 stimulation. The mRNA expression of SARM1, IL-1beta and the components of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome were measured by quantitative PCR. SARM protein expression was measured by western blotting. RESULTS: TLR1/2 activation induced elevated IL-1beta in RA monocytes compared with healthy controls (P = 0.0009), which negatively correlated with SARM1 expression (P = 0.0086). Lower SARM expression also correlated with higher disease activity (P = 0.0246). Additionally, patients responding to anti-TNF-alpha treatment demonstrated a rapid upregulation of SARM, which was not observed in non-responders. CONCLUSION: Together, these data highlight a potential contribution from SARM to RA pathophysiology where decreased SARM may lead to elevated IL-1beta associated with RA pathogenesis. Furthermore, the data additionally present a potential mechanism by which TNF-alpha blockade can modify IL-1beta secretion.
