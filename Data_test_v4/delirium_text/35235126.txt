35235126|t|Switch from Olanzapine Long-Acting Injectable to its Oral Equivalent during COVID-19 Pandemic: a Real World Observational Study.
35235126|a|Schizophrenia is a psychiatric condition with chronic evolution, one of the most disabling diseases. The main cause for the disease's progression is considered to be the lack of compliance with the treatment. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are an important treatment option for patients with schizophrenia. Olanzapine long-acting injection (OLZ-LAI) is a pamoate monohydrate salt of olanzapine that is administered by deep intramuscular gluteal injection. The aim of this paper is to report the effects of a sudden and unplanned switch from olanzapine long-acting injectable to oral olanzapine in remitted patients with schizophrenia due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. An observational study conducted in the Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology of Brasov, Romania between April 2020 and March 2021. 27 patients with OLZ-LAI were entered into the study. Of 27 cases, 21 patients preferred to be switched to oral olanzapine (77.77%). Only 6 patients continued with the long-acting formulation. The main reason for the initiation of olanzapine pamoate in all the patients was non-adherence to oral medication (80.95%), and the mean age of starting LAI olanzapine was 36.42 years (SD +- 10.09). Within the following 12 months after switching from olanzapine LAI to OA, 15 patients (71.42%) relapsed, and 12 were admitted to the emergency psychiatric unit. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought multiple disservices to current medical practice. Sudden and unplanned switch from olanzapine long-acting formulation to oral olanzapine was followed by the high rate of relapse in remitted schizophrenia.
