36903345|t|Exploration of Pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidines as Antagonists of the Human Chemokine Receptor CXCR2.
36903345|a|Upregulated CXCR2 signalling is found in numerous inflammatory, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in cancer. Consequently, CXCR2 antagonism is a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of these disorders. We previously identified, via scaffold hopping, a pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine analogue as a promising CXCR2 antagonist with an IC50 value of 0.11 microM in a kinetic fluorescence-based calcium mobilization assay. This study aims at exploring the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and improving the CXCR2 antagonistic potency of this pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine via systematic structural modifications of the substitution pattern. Almost all new analogues completely lacked the CXCR2 antagonism, the exception being a 6-furanyl-pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine analogue (compound 17b) that is endowed with similar antagonistic potency as the original hit.
