29614751|t|Annexin A1: Uncovering the Many Talents of an Old Protein.
29614751|a|Annexin A1 (ANXA1) has long been classed as an anti-inflammatory protein due to its control over leukocyte-mediated immune responses. However, it is now recognized that ANXA1 has widespread effects beyond the immune system with implications in maintaining the homeostatic environment within the entire body due to its ability to affect cellular signalling, hormonal secretion, foetal development, the aging process and development of disease. In this review, we aim to provide a global overview of the role of ANXA1 covering aspects of peripheral and central inflammation, immune repair and endocrine control with focus on the prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the molecule in cancer, neurodegeneration and inflammatory-based disorders.
