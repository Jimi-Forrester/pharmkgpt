22247431|a|The need for evidence-based non-pharmacological community programs to improve care of older adults with dementia is self-evident, considering the sheer numbers of affected individuals; the emotional, physical, and financial toll on affected individuals and their caregivers; the impact on our health care system; and the growing availability of evidence regarding the potential for psychosocial interventions to enhance care and decrease costs. To address this need, the Administration on Aging has begun funding translation of evidence-based programs into community settings. Two programs, Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease and STAR-Community Consultants (STAR-C), were selected by the Ohio Department of Aging (in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Association Chapters in Ohio) and the Oregon Department of Health Services (in partnership with Area Agencies on Aging and the Oregon Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association) to be implemented by their staff. Both programs are designed to improve care, enhance life quality, and reduce behavioral problems of persons with dementia and have demonstrated efficacy via randomized controlled trials. This article addresses the developmental and ongoing challenges encountered in the translation of these programs to inform other community-based organizations considering the translation of evidence-based programs and to assist researchers in making their work more germane to their community colleagues.
