The purpose of our study was to compare the effect of propofol vs sevoflurane on early postoperative sleep quality and complications of patients receiving laparoscopic surgery after general anesthesia. METHODS: Seventy-four patients undergoing selective laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to the propofol group or sevoflurane group. The wireless portable sleep monitor (WPSM) is used to collect sleep quality on the night before surgery (sleep preop 1), the first night after surgery (sleep POD 1), and the third night after surgery (sleep POD 3). Record the subjective sleep quality and dreaming state during the operation. The perioperative hemodynamics, postoperative sleep and complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with Sleep preop 1, patients showed lower sleep efficiency, Stable sleep and Unstable sleep during Sleep POD 1 and Sleep POD 3. In addition, compared with the propofol group, the proportion of REM sleep in the sevoflurane group was much higher during Sleep POD 1 and Sleep POD 3, and the incidence of dreaming was also higher in the sevoflurane group. Patients in the propofol group had better pain relief at 2, 4, and 6 hours after surgery. And the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and dizziness in the sevoflurane group was significantly higher than that in the propofol group. CONCLUSION: The degree of postoperative sleep efficiency was better on Sleep POD1 and Sleep POD3; the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and dizziness was lower; and postoperative pain was slighter when the operation was performed under propofol anesthesia compared with patients in the sevoflurane group. Propofol should be considered a better choice during the operation to promote the patient's postoperative sleep quality, relieve postoperative pain and improve the incidence of postoperative dizziness and nausea and vomiting.
