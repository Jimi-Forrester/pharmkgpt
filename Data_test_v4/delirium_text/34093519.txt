34093519|a|Severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) strongly hampered the broad clinical applicability of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. Vascular endothelial activation has been suggested to contribute to the development of CRS and ICANS after CAR-T therapy. However, therapeutic strategies targeting endothelial dysfunction during CAR-T therapy have not been well studied yet. Here, we found that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) produced by CAR-T cells upon tumor recognition and interleukin 1beta (IL1beta) secreted by activated myeloid cells were the main cytokines in inducing endothelial activation. Therefore, we investigated the potential effectiveness of TNFalpha and IL1beta signaling blockade on endothelial activation in CAR-T therapy. The blockade of TNFalpha and IL1beta with adalimumab and anti-IL1beta antibody respectively, as well as the application of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor, effectively ameliorated endothelial activation induced by CAR-T, tumor cells, and myeloid cells. Moreover, adalimumab and anti-IL1beta antibody exerted synergistic effect on the prevention of endothelial activation induced by CAR-T, tumor cells, and myeloid cells. Our results indicate that TNFalpha and IL1beta blockade might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of CAR-T therapy-associated CRS and neurotoxicity.
