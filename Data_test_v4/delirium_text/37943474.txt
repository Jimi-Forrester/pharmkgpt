37943474|t|Factors Associated with Psychotropic Medication Use in People Living with Dementia in the Community: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37943474|a|BACKGROUND: There has been considerable focus on the use of psychotropic agents in people living with dementia in long-term care. However, psychotropic use often commences well before transitioning to long-term care. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize the available literature to identify factors associated with psychotropic medication use in people living with dementia in the community. METHODS: This PROSPERO-registered review reports findings from a comprehensive search of Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed (including MEDLINE) databases according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (2010-2022). Inclusion criteria were original prospective or retrospective design research papers enrolling people diagnosed with dementia utilizing a psychotropic medication and living at home. Quality and risk of bias was assessed Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The last search was conducted in November 2022. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize the emergent factors identified, and a meta-analysis was undertaken on suitable data. RESULTS: The search identified 619 articles. After review and exclusions, 39 articles were included for synthesis, including 1,338,737 people. The majority of papers (67%) were rated as low risk of bias and corresponding good quality. Thematic analysis suggested associations between psychotropic prescribing and patient and environmental factors, with little data concerning carer and prescriber factors. Such factors included age (< 75 years, > 90 years), sex, more advanced functional decline, and living alone. Meta-analysis identified significant associations between psychotropic use and respite (temporary full-time care or hospitalization) and comorbid psychiatric illness. CONCLUSIONS: While it is clear from this review that there remains a significant lack of clarity as to the reasons why these medications are being utilized in this population, this review provides greater insight and understanding into the context of psychotropic use. The study has highlighted an opportunity for further targeted research to be conducted and provides a much-needed context for this to occur. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021286322.
