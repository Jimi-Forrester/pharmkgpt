24112792|a|Age-related cognitive decline is accompanied by an increase of neuronal apoptosis and a dysregulation of neuroplasticity-related molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotoxic factors including beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide. Because it has been previously demonstrated that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) protect against hippocampal synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and physiological aging, we investigated the effect of a treatment with the PDE5-I, sildenafil, on cell death, pro- and antiapoptotic molecules, and Abeta production. We demonstrated that chronic intraperitoneal injection of sildenafil (3 mg/kg for 3 weeks) decreased terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling-positive cells in the CA1 hippocampal area of 26-30-month-old mice, downregulating the proapoptotic proteins, caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X, and increasing antiapoptotic molecules such as B-cell lymphoma protein-2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Also, sildenafil reverted the shifting of amyloid precursor protein processing toward Abeta42 production and the increase of the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio in aged mice. Our data suggest that PDE5-I might be beneficial to treat age-related detrimental features in a physiological mouse model of aging.
