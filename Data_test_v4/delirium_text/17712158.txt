17712158|a|This study estimates the prevalence of depressed mood in caregivers of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and assesses whether demographics, stressors, intrapsychic strain, and gain are associated with depressed mood. A secondary analysis of baseline data from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study MCI trial was conducted using a cross-sectional, correlational design. Descriptive statistics to estimate the prevalence of caregiver depressed mood and univariate and block-wise logistic regression analyses were used. The prevalence of depressed mood in 769 caregivers was 24.6% (95% confidence interval, 21.5-27.7). The odds of being depressed were significantly higher in younger, nonspousal caregivers with less education, who cared for MCI patients with lower activities of daily living functioning, and who perceived greater relational deprivation, higher levels of self-loss, and personal gain. Controlling for relevant variables, relational deprivation and caregiver education continued to be significantly associated with depressed mood. Relational deprivation may be important for future interventions.
