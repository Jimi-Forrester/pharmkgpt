12128085|t|Biogenesis and metabolism of Alzheimer's disease Abeta amyloid peptides.
12128085|a|Biochemical and genetic evidence indicates the balance of biogenesis/clearance of Abeta amyloid peptides is altered in Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is derived, by two sequential cleavages, from the receptor-like amyloid precursor protein (APP). The proteases involved are beta-secretase, identified as the novel aspartyl protease BACE, and gamma-secretase, a multimeric complex containing the presenilins (PS). Gamma-secretase can release either Abeta40 or the more aggregating and cytotoxic Abeta42. Secreted Abeta peptides become either degraded by the metalloproteases insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin or metabolized through receptor uptake mediated by apolipoprotein E. Therapeutic approaches based on secretase inhibition or amyloid clearance are currently under development.
