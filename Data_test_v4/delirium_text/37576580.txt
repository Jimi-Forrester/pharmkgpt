37576580|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) is highest in very old elderlies (>=75 years). The increasing use of antithrombotic drugs is shifting the epidemiology of SICH towards predominance of lobar subtype, suggesting an incremented propensity of bleeding associated with underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy. With population aging and antithrombotic use, a parallel raise of proportion of lobar SICH is occurring. Improvement of prognostication in this specific age group and SICH type is needed. Routine blood biomarkers can contribute to prediction of short-term mortality after SICH. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the contribution of routine blood biomarkers for short-term mortality (30-days) in elderly patients with lobar SICH. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive 130 patients with >= 75 years and lobar SICH. The outcome was 30-day mortality. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate whether admission routine biomarkers can be used as predictors. RESULTS: The case fatality was 40.8%. Admission glycaemia level, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and mean platelet volume were significantly different between groups (p = 0.001, p = 0.024, p = 0.038, respectively). There was no significant difference in all other routine biomarkers. On multivariate analysis, admission higher mean BG level (odds ratio [OR]: 1.010, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.019, p = 0.026) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (OR: 1.070, 95% CI: 1.008-1.136, p = 0.027) emerged as predictors. CONCLUSION: In very old patients with lobar SICH, higher BG level and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio are associated with increased risk of short-term death.
