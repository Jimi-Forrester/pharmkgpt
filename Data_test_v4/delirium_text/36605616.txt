36605616|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by the progressive loss of selectively vulnerable populations of neurons, which is responsible for the clinical symptoms. Although degeneration of neurons is a prominent feature that undoubtedly contributes to and defines NDD pathology, it is now clear that neuronal cell death is by no means mediated solely by cell-autonomous mechanisms. Oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), enable rapid transmission of electrical signals and provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons. Recent evidence suggests that OLs and their progenitor population play a role in the onset and progression of NDDs. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence suggesting a role of OL lineage cells in the pathogenesis of age-related NDDs. We start with multiple system atrophy, an NDD with a well-known oligodendroglial pathology, and then discuss Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), NDDs which have been thought of as neuronal origins. Understanding the functions and dysfunctions of OLs might lead to the advent of disease-modifying strategies against NDDs.
