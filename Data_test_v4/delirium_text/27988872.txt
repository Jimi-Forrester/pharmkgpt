27988872|t|Insulin Resistance and Neurodegeneration: Progress Towards the Development of New Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease.
27988872|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) should be regarded as a degenerative metabolic disease caused by brain insulin resistance and deficiency, and overlapping with the molecular, biochemical, pathophysiological, and metabolic dysfunctions in diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. Although most of the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches over the past several decades have focused on amyloid-beta (Abeta42) and aberrantly phosphorylated tau, which could be caused by consequences of brain insulin resistance, the broader array of pathologies including white matter atrophy with loss of myelinated fibrils and leukoaraiosis, non-Abeta42 microvascular disease, dysregulated lipid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, astrocytic gliosis, neuro-inflammation, and loss of synapses vis-a-vis growth of dystrophic neurites, is not readily accounted for by Abeta42 accumulations, but could be explained by dysregulated insulin/IGF-1 signaling with attendant impairments in signal transduction and gene expression. This review covers the diverse range of brain abnormalities in AD and discusses how insulins, incretins, and insulin sensitizers could be utilized to treat at different stages of neurodegeneration.
