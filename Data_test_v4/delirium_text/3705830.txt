3705830|t|[Effect of heminevrin on the functional status of the liver and cholinergic system during treatment of severe forms of alcoholic delirium].
3705830|a|The effect of hemineurin on the clinical picture and the course of severe forms of delirium tremens was studied over time in 28 male patients who were simultaneously examined for the enzymic activity of the liver and parameters of the cholinergic system. The activity of alanine (AlAT) and aspartate aminotransferases (AsAT), sorbite dehydrogenase (SorDH), fructose-1-phosphate aldolase, blood acetylcholine (AC) levels, the activity of acetylcholine esterase in the whole blood (ACWB) and acetylcholine esterase of red blood cells (ACRC) determined in the course of treatment showed that hemineurin, in addition to a marked sedative effect, contributed to rapid normalization of liver function and carbohydrate metabolism. The effect of hemineurin helped to restore the synthesis and acetylation of CoA, to stimulate AC metabolism, and to set a relative balance of the mediator systems, ensuring the prevention of dangerous complications (acute cardiovascular insufficiency, cerebral edema) in severe cases of delirium tremens.
