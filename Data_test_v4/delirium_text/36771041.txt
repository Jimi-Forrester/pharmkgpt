36771041|a|The present study aimed to estimate the antiviral activities of Ginkgo biloba (GB) leaves extract and eco-friendly free silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) against the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) and HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E), as well as isolation and identification of phytochemicals from GB. Different solvents and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to extract and identify flavonoids and phenolic compounds from GB leaves. The green, silver nanoparticle synthesis was synthesized from GB leaves aqueous extract and investigated for their possible effects as anti-coronaviruses MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E using MTT assay protocol. To verify the synthesis of Ag NPs, several techniques were employed, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scan, transmission electron microscopy, FT-IR, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The highest contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds were recorded for acetone, methanol, and ethanol as mixtures with water, in addition to pure water. HPLC flavonoids were detected as apegenin, luteolin, myricetin, and catechin, while HPLC phenolic compounds were pyrogallol, caffeic acid, gallic acid, and ellagic acid. In addition, our results revealed that Ag NPs were produced through the shift from yellow to dark brown. TEM examination of Ag NPs revealed spherical nanoparticles with mean sizes ranging from 5.46 to 19.40 nm and an average particle diameter of 11.81 nm. A UV-visible spectrophotometric investigation revealed an absorption peak at lambda max of 441.56 nm. MTT protocol signified the use of GB leaves extract as an anti-coronavirus to be best from Ag NPs because GB extract had moderate anti-MERS-CoV with SI = 8.94, while had promising anti-HCov-229E, with an SI of 21.71. On the other hand, Ag NPs had a mild anti-MERS-CoV with SI = 4.23, and a moderate anti-HCoV-229E, with an SI of 7.51.
