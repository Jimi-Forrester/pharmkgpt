31564373|a|INTRODUCTION: Geriatric fracture patients are at risk for poorly controlled pain and side effects of opioid medications. The arthroplasty literature has demonstrated that infiltration of long-acting local anesthetic or anesthetic cocktails improves pain control and reduces post-operative opioid use resulting in better postoperative mobility without the deleterious effects of narcotics. Despite having a higher risk for adverse events, there is limited data among geriatric trauma patients. The aim this study was to evaluate whether local anesthetic infiltration (LAI) into the soft tissues surrounding the surgical field reduces narcotic use or pain scores in patients undergoing surgical management of proximal and diaphyseal femur fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients age >65 undergoing operative intervention for proximal and diaphyseal femur fracture. The electronic record was utilized to determine if local anesthetic was injected into the surgical wound, the amount of narcotics administered over 48 h in four-hour intervals, and to obtain visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores associated with patients post-operative course in four-hour intervals. The amount of narcotics was converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME). RESULTS: Among 477 patients with femur fracture, 358 did not receive LAI and 119 patients received LAI. Baseline demographics, fracture types, and surgical procedure were equivalent between the groups. In the first 28 h following surgery, compared with those who did not receive LAI, those who did required significantly less opioid (57.8 MME versus 94.3 MME, p = 0.034) and despite decreased narcotics, had equal pain scores (mean difference 0.37, p = 0.22). There was no difference in rates of post-operative complications. CONCLUSION: LAI is associated with a reduction in opioid consumption in geriatric fracture patients with equivalent pain scores. Optimizing pain control is a critical issue in caring for geriatric fracture patients since both under-treated pain and opioid medications are implicated in postoperative delirium, complications, and ability to mobilize early. More research is needed to identify effective ways to optimize pain management in this at-risk patient population.
