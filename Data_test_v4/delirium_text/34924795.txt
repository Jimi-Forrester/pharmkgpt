34924795|a|INTRODUCTION: Informed consent is an indispensable condition of the clinical practice for the provision of health care. The main objective of this study is to translate the MacArthur competence assessment tool for treatment (MacCAT-T) into Turkish and evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version in schizophrenia patients and healthy control subjects. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 30 hospitalized schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy subjects were assessed with MacCAT-T, Mental Competence Evaluation Form for Assessment of Competency (MCEF), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Mini Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - Similarities subtest and the Schedule for Assessing the Three Components of Insight. Psychometric properties of MacCAT-T were examined by intra-class correlation coefficients and Cronbach's alpha values. RESULTS: Intra-class correlations ranged between 0.83 and 0.99 for four subscales of the tool. Cronbach alpha value of MacCAT-T was found 0.89. Severity of psychopathology and indices of insight were found to be negatively correlated with the subscales of the tool. WAIS-Similarities subtest scores were found to be positively correlated with understanding and reasoning subscales of MacCAT-T. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of MacCAT-T is a valid and reliable instrument for Turkish patients. The severity of psychopathology, insight and executive functions were shown to be significantly related to the decision making capacity in patients with schizophrenia.
