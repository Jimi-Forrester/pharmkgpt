25503824|t|Medication adherence in patients with Parkinson's disease.
25503824|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer's disease, affecting the elderly worldwide. Current therapy for PD is largely based on prescription of drugs that act as either dopamine precursors, dopamine agonists or agents that inhibit key enzymes in the dopamine catabolic pathways. Most of these drugs are administered in tablet or capsule form and can involve multiple daily doses in complex dosing regimens, which contributes to sub-optimal compliance amongst patients. There is evidence to suggest that non-compliance with medications results in perceived poor response to therapy and may ultimately increase direct and indirect health care costs. Medication compliance in PD assumes a particularly important role, given that PD is a progressive, debilitating condition, and once medication is instituted for ameliorating the symptoms of PD, it is lifelong. We included nine research studies in our review of the medical literature, which report the prevalence of significant medication non-compliance in PD, using standard definitions, varies between 10 and 67%. This variation partly reflects differences in defining what clinically significant medication adherence is, the methods used to estimate the scale of the problem and the underlying population heterogeneity. Nevertheless, medication adherence is related to health costs and to the quality of life of patients affected by PD and, indirectly, their carers. Educating patients and their carers is one method of improving patient adherence to therapy. Simplifying drug regimens can also aid in this effort.
