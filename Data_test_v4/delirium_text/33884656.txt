33884656|t|Phenotypes, roles, and modulation of regulatory lymphocytes in periodontitis and its associated systemic diseases.
33884656|a|Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease that can result in tooth loss and poses a risk to systemic health. Lymphocytes play important roles in periodontitis through multiple mechanisms. Regulatory lymphocytes including regulatory B cells (Bregs) and T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells that maintain immune homeostasis, and are critical to our understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontitis and the development of effective treatments. In this review, we discuss the phenotypes, roles, and modulating strategies of regulatory lymphocytes including Bregs and Tregs in periodontitis and frequently cooccurring inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer disease, diabetes mellitus, and stroke. The current evidence suggests that restoring immune balance through therapeutic targeting of regulatory lymphocytes is a promising strategy for the treatment of periodontitis and other systemic inflammatory diseases.
