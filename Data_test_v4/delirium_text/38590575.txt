38590575|t|Clinical presentation of severe COVID-19 with heart failure: A single-center retrospective study.
38590575|a|The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global transformation in public health interventions. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical features as well as the outcomes of severe heart failure (HF) among patients with severe COVID-19. A single-center observational study was carried out at The 904th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force (Wuxi, China) from November 2022 to April 2023, and a total of 210 patients diagnosed with severe HF were included. Among these patients, 128 patients had COVID-19 whereas the remaining patients were not diagnosed with COVID-19. The analysis entailed investigated pre-existing medical records, that is, admission and discharge, laboratory values, neuroimaging, length of hospitalization, mortality and costs incurred by patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic from the records. All the 210 incorporated patients accomplished the follow-up and it was established that there was no significant differences in baseline characteristics between HF combined with COVID-19 and HF without COVID-19 were affirmed (P>0.05). HF coupled with COVID-19 infection demonstrated an increased risk of 30-day mortality (28.91 vs. 14.63%; P=0.017), extended length of hospital stays (22.54+-6.73 vs. 19.35+-5.69; P<0.001) and higher expenses for hospitalization (P<0.001). Complications related to hospitalization, including pneumonia (76.56 vs. 35.37%; P=1.0x10-4), respiratory failure (47.66 vs. 24.39%; P=0.001), pulmonary embolism (8.59 vs. 2.44%; P=0.031), deep vein thrombosis (30.47 vs. 14.63%; P=0.009), 7 days delirium (60.16 vs. 45.12%; P=0.033), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (32.81 vs. 18.29%; P=0.021) and neurological deficits (30.47% vs. 17.07%, P=0.029) increased significantly. In conclusion, HF combined with COVID-19, treatment and prognosis are getting worse. Enhancing preparedness for future COVID-19 and other similar pandemics necessitates the comprehension of this to refine care provided to patients with HF (registration no.
