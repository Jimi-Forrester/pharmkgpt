22990527|a|PURPOSE: WHO's three step ladder sometimes cannot provide adequate pain relief for pancreatic cancer. Some patients develop terminal delirium (TD). The aim of this study was to test if the addition of a celiac plexus block (CPB) to pharmacotherapy could reduce the incidence of TD. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer patients under the care of our palliative-care team were investigated with regard to the duration and occurrence of TD, pain scores [numerical rating score (NRS)] and daily opioid dose. Between August 2007 to September 2008, 17 patients received only pharmacotherapy (control group). Then, we modified our guideline for analgesia, performing CPB 7 days after the first intervention of our team. Between October 2008 to September 2009, 19 patients received CPB. RESULTS: The opioid doses in CPB group were significantly lower both at 10 days after the first intervention (3 days after CPB) (27 +- 11 vs. 66 +- 82 mg; p = 0.029) and 2 days before death (37 +- 25 vs. 124 +- 117 mg; p = 0.009). NRS in the CPB group were significantly lower both at 10 days after the first intervention (0 [0-2] vs. 3 [2-5], p < 0.0001) and 2 days before death (1 [0-2] vs. 3 [1-4.5], p = 0.018). The occurrence and duration of TD in CPB group were both reduced (42 vs. 94 %, p = 0.019; and 1.8 +- 2.9 vs. 10.4 +- 7.5 days, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: The duration and occurrence of TD and the pain severity were significantly less in pancreatic cancer patients who underwent neurolytic CPB.
