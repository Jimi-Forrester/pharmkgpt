8024269|t|Are the associations between Alzheimer's disease and polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E and the apolipoprotein CII genes due to linkage disequilibrium?
8024269|a|Allele frequencies for polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E and the apolipoprotein CII genes were determined in subjects of Ashkenazi Jewish origin with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and in unaffected control subjects from the same ethnic group. A significant association was observed between late-onset Alzheimer's disease and the epsilon 4 (112Cys-->Arg) allele of apolipoprotein E; however, no association was detected with apolipoprotein CII. These results suggest that the association with epsilon 4 is probably not due to linkage disequilibrium.
