37920189|a|Astrocytes not only support neuronal function with essential roles in synaptic neurotransmission, action potential propagation, metabolic support, or neuroplastic and developmental adaptations. They also respond to damage or dysfunction in surrounding neurons and oligodendrocytes by releasing neurotrophic factors and other molecules that increase the survival of the supported cells or contribute to mechanisms of structural and molecular restoration. The neuroprotective responsiveness of astrocytes is based on their ability to sense signals of degeneration, metabolic jeopardy and structural damage, and on their aptitude to locally deliver specific molecules to remedy threats to the molecular and structural features of their cellular partners. To the extent that neuronal and other glial cell disturbances are known to occur in affective disorders, astrocyte responsiveness to those disturbances may help to better understand the roles astrocytes play in affective disorders. The astrocytic sensing apparatus supporting those responses involves receptors for neurotransmitters, purines, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors. Astrocytes also share with the immune system the capacity of responding to cytokines released upon neuronal damage. In addition, in responses to specific signals astrocytes release unique factors such as clusterin or humanin that have been shown to exert potent neuroprotective effects. Astrocytes integrate the signals above to further deliver structural lipids, removing toxic metabolites, stabilizing the osmotic environment, normalizing neurotransmitters, providing anti-oxidant protection, facilitating synaptogenesis and acting as barriers to contain varied deleterious signals, some of which have been described in brain regions relevant to affective disorders and related animal models. Since various of the injurious signals that activate astrocytes have been implicated in different aspects of the etiopathology of affective disorders, particularly in relation to the diagnosis of depression, potentiating the corresponding astrocyte neuroprotective responses may provide additional opportunities to improve or complement available pharmacological and behavioral therapies for affective disorders.
