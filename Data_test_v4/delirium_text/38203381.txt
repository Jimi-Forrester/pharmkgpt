38203381|t|The Function of ASK1 in Sepsis and Stress-Induced Disorders.
38203381|a|Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a serine-threonine kinase that is ubiquitously expressed in nucleated cells and is responsible for the activation of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) to regulate cell stress. Activation of ASK1 via cellular stress leads to activation of downstream signaling components, activation of transcription factors, and proinflammatory cytokine production. ASK1 is also expressed in anucleate platelets and is a key player in platelet activation as it is important for signaling. Interestingly, the mechanism of ASK1 activation is cell type-dependent. In this review we will explore how ASK1 regulates a variety of cellular processes from innate immune function to thrombosis and hemostasis. We will discuss how ASK1 influences FcgammaRIIA-mediated platelet reactivity and how that reactivity drives platelet clearance. Furthermore, we will explore the role of ASK1 in thromboxane (TxA2) generation, which highlights differences in the way ASK1 functions in mouse and human platelets.
