30308769|t|Withdrawal delirium with dance drug 'liquid ecstasy' (GHB).
30308769|a|We wish to describe a case of gamma hydroxyl butyrate (GHB) withdrawal, including seizure activity in a 34 year old male, who had been taking the substance over a two year period. The syndrome has many aspects in common with alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens) and benzodiazepine withdrawal (long duration of symptoms), however detoxification presents many challenges for clinicians.
