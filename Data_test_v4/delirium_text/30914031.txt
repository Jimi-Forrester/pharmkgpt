30914031|t|Atrial and Brain Natriuretic Peptides- Benefits and Limits of their use in Cardiovascular Diseases.
30914031|a|Natriuretic peptides, produced by cardiac myocytes, are regulators of the intravascular volume and blood pressure, and also exhibit neuroendocrine, metabolic and growth controlling effects. In heart failure, their synthesis increases exponentially as part of the neuroendocrine activation, but their beneficial effects are diminished. The paper reviews relevant data about their role as diagnosis and prognosis markers in heart failure, the hemodynamic and clinical benefits of their use as therapy in heart failure, together with the main adverse effects. Peptides non-specifically increase in extracardiac pathology and the literature reveals the mechanisms of increase, significance and threshold values to exclude cardiac dysfunction.
