35947248|t|In silico study of tacrine and acetylcholine binding profile with human acetylcholinesterase: docking and electronic structure.
35947248|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process, one of the most common and incident dementia in the population over 60 years. AD manifests the presence of complex biochemical processes involved in neuronal degeneration, such as the formation of senile plaques containing amyloid-beta peptides, the development of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and the suppression of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter. In this way, we performed a set of theoretical tests of tacrine ligand and acetylcholine neurotransmitter against the human acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Molecular docking was used to understand the most important interactions of these molecules with the enzyme. Computational chemistry calculation was carried out using MP2, DFT, and semi-empirical methods, starting from molecular docking structures. We have also performed studies regarding the non-covalent interactions, electron localization function, molecular electrostatic potential and explicit water molecule influence. For Trp86 residue, we show two main interactions in accordance to the results of the literature for TcAChE. First, intermolecular interactions of the cation-pi and sigma-pi type were found. Second, close stacking interactions were stablished between THA+ and Trp86 residue on one side and with Tyr337 residue on the other side.
