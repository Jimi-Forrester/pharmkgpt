36900592|t|Ginsenoside Rg2 Promotes the Proliferation and Stemness Maintenance of Porcine Mesenchymal Stem Cells through Autophagy Induction.
36900592|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used as a cell source for cultivated meat production due to their adipose differentiation potential, but MSCs lose their stemness and undergo replicative senescence during expansion in vitro. Autophagy is an important mechanism for senescent cells to remove toxic substances. However, the role of autophagy in the replicative senescence of MSCs is controversial. Here, we evaluated the changes in autophagy in porcine MSCs (pMSCs) during long-term culture in vitro and identified a natural phytochemical, ginsenoside Rg2, that could stimulate pMSC proliferation. First, some typical senescence characteristics were observed in aged pMSCs, including decreased EdU-positive cells, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, declined stemness-associated marker OCT4 expression, and enhanced P53 expression. Importantly, autophagic flux was impaired in aged pMSCs, suggesting deficient substrate clearance in aged pMSCs. Rg2 was found to promote the proliferation of pMSCs using MTT assay and EdU staining. In addition, Rg2 inhibited D-galactose-induced senescence and oxidative stress in pMSCs. Rg2 increased autophagic activity via the AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, long-term culture with Rg2 promoted the proliferation, inhibited the replicative senescence, and maintained the stemness of pMSCs. These results provide a potential strategy for porcine MSC expansion in vitro.
