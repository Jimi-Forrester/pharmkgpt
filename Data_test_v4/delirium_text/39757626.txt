39757626|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by gradual onset and complex pathological mechanisms. Clinically, it presents with progressive cognitive decline and behavioral impairments, making it one of the most common causes of dementia. The intricacies of its pathogenesis are not fully understood, and current treatment options are limited, with diagnosis typically occurring at intermediate to advanced stages. The development of new biomarkers offers a crucial avenue for the early diagnosis of AD and improving patient outcomes. Several biomarkers with high specificity have been identified. This article reviews biomarkers related to tau protein, beta-amyloid, and blood cells to deepen our understanding of AD and emphasize the advantages and disadvantages of various biomarkers in order to explore further and mine new biomarkers for AD diagnosis.
