36361729|t|In Silico and In Vitro Studies of Benzothiazole-Isothioureas Derivatives as a Multitarget Compound for Alzheimer's Disease.
36361729|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) aggregation and avoiding the oxidative stress could prevent the progression of AD. Benzothiazole groups have shown neuroprotective activity whereas isothioureas groups act as AChE inhibitors and antioxidants. Therefore, 22 benzothiazole-isothiourea derivatives (3a-v) were evaluated by docking simulations as inhibitors of AChE and Abeta1-42 aggregation. In silico studies showed that 3f, 3r and 3t had a delta G (DeltaG) value better than curcumin and galantamine on Abeta1-42 and AChE, respectively. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetics predictions showed that only 3t does not violate Lipinski's rule of five, though it has moderated cytotoxicity activity. Then, 3f, 3r and 3t were synthetized and chemically characterized for their in vitro evaluation including their antioxidant activity and their cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. 3r was able to inhibit AChE, avoid Abeta1-42 aggregation and exhibit antioxidant activity; nevertheless, it showed cytotoxic against PC12 cells. Compound 3t showed the best anti-Abeta1-42 aggregation and inhibitory AChE activity and, despite that predictor, showed that it could be cytotoxic; in vitro with PC12 cell was negative. Therefore, 3t could be employed as a scaffold to develop new molecules with multitarget activity for AD and, due to physicochemical and pharmacokinetics predictions, it could be administered in vivo using liposomes due to is not able to cross the BBB.
