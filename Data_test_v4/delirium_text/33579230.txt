33579230|a|BACKGROUND: Pyomyoma is an unusual fibroid that usually develops during the puerperal or postmenopausal period. If not promptly diagnosed and treated, it can become life threatening. Although various conservative and surgical therapies have been discussed in the literature for this condition, there are very few reports related to the management of prolapsed pedunculated submucosal myoma. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, an intramural fibroid transformed into a pedunculated submucosal pyomyoma, which prolapsed into the vagina after a miscarriage and caused life-threatening toxic shock. Apart from prompt antibiotic treatment, a transabdominal myomectomy rather than hysterectomy was performed due to the very large diameter of the pyomyoma. As a result, fertility was preserved, and the patient conceived naturally and delivered a healthy baby two years later. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: It is important to maintain strong clinical suspicion for pregnant or postpartum women with a triad of pain, sepsis without an obvious source and a known diagnosis of leiomyoma. Timely recognition and prompt surgical treatment with antibiotics are necessary and could conserve the uterus for future fertility.
