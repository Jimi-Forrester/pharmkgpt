34884761|a|(1) Background: Vitamin B12 deficiency in Caenorhabditis elegans results in severe oxidative stress and induces morphological abnormality in mutants due to disordered cuticle collagen biosynthesis. We clarified the underlying mechanism leading to such mutant worms due to vitamin B12 deficiency. (2) Results: The deficient worms exhibited decreased collagen levels of up to approximately 59% compared with the control. Although vitamin B12 deficiency did not affect the mRNA expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline involved in intercellular collagen biosynthesis, the level of ascorbic acid, a prolyl 4-hydroxylase coenzyme, was markedly decreased. Dityrosine crosslinking is involved in the extracellular maturation of worm collagen. The dityrosine level of collagen significantly increased in the deficient worms compared with the control. However, vitamin B12 deficiency hardly affected the mRNA expression levels of bli-3 and mlt-7, which are encoding crosslinking-related enzymes, suggesting that deficiency-induced oxidative stress leads to dityrosine crosslinking. Moreover, using GMC101 mutant worms that express the full-length human amyloid beta, we found that vitamin B12 deficiency did not affect the gene and protein expressions of amyloid beta but increased the formation of dityrosine crosslinking in the amyloid beta protein. (3) Conclusions: Vitamin B12-deficient wild-type worms showed motility dysfunction due to decreased collagen levels and the formation of highly tyrosine-crosslinked collagen, potentially reducing their flexibility. In GMC101 mutant worms, vitamin B12 deficiency-induced oxidative stress triggers dityrosine-crosslinked amyloid beta formation, which might promote its stabilization and toxic oligomerization.
