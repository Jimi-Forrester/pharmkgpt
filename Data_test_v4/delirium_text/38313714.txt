38313714|t|Incidence of complications associated with deep brain stimulation surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease: An 8-year retrospective study.
38313714|a|Background: Various complications occur in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of complications in patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent DBS surgery and identify the risk factors, especially anesthetic factors. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed between May 2015 and December 2022. Based on a review of medical charts, patients aged 18 years or older who underwent DBS surgery at a tertiary neurological center in Thailand were recruited. Univariate analysis using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was performed to compare patients with and without complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictive factors for complications. Results: The study included 46 patients. The most common complication during DBS electrode placement was hypertension (30/46, 65.2%), and 19 patients (41.3%) who developed hypertension did not receive antihypertensive treatment. The most common complication during battery placement was clinical hypotension (14/46, 30.4%). The most common postoperative complication was delirium (6/46, 13.0%). In the multivariate analysis, no significant independent risk factors for overall complications after DBS surgery were identified. Conclusions: Hypertension during DBS electrode insertion was the most common perioperative complication. Hemodynamic instability is preventable and manageable, and vigilant and prompt treatment should be provided during DBS surgery.
