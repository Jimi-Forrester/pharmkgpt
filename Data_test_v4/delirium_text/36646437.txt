36646437|t|The role of tRNA-derived small RNAs in aging.
36646437|a|Aging is characterized by a gradual decline in biological functions, leading to the increased probability of diseases and deaths in organisms. Previous studies have identified biological factors that modulate aging and lifespan, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Here, we review the relationship between aging and tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), ncRNAs that are generated from the cleavage of tRNAs. We describe age-dependent changes in tsRNA levels and their functions in age-related diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We also discuss the association of tsRNAs with aging-regulating processes, including mitochondrial respiration and reduced mRNA translation. We cover recent findings regarding the potential roles of tsRNAs in cellular senescence, a major cause of organismal aging. Overall, our review will provide useful information for understanding the roles of tsRNAs in aging and age-associated diseases. [BMB Reports 2023; 56(2): 49-55].
