25204716|a|The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include extracellular neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The neuritic plaques contain beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta peptides) as the major proteinaceous constituent and are surrounded by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as dystrophic neurites. N-terminally truncated forms of Abeta peptides are highly prevalent in neuritic plaques, including Abeta 3-x beginning at Glu eventually modified to pyroglutamate (Abeta N3pE-x), Abeta 2-x, Abeta 4-x, and Abeta 5-x. The precise origin of the different N-terminally modified Abeta peptides currently remains unknown. To assess the contribution of specific cell types to the formation of different N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides, supernatants from serum-free primary cell cultures of chicken neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as human astrocytes, were analyzed by Abeta-ELISA and one- and two-dimensional SDS-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis. To evaluate the contribution of beta- and gamma-secretase to the generation of N-terminally modified Abeta, cultured astrocytes were treated with membrane-anchored "tripartite beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors" and the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia each exhibited cell type-specific patterns of secreted Abeta peptides. Neurons predominantly secreted Abeta peptides that begin at Asp1, whereas those released from astrocytes and microglia included high proportions of N-terminally modified Abeta peptides, presumably including Abeta 2/3-x and 4/5-x. The inhibition of BACE1 reduced the amount of Abeta 1-x in cell culture supernatants but not the amount of Abeta 2-x.
