35963090|a|The quantitative analysis of neurological drugs is critical since the kinetics of body fluids is strongly dependent on the dosage of the drug levels. Thus, the study of neurological medicines is significant because of the major diseases connected to it, for instance, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Herein, a 2D hybrid MXene/graphene (MX/Gr) film was synthesized through a top-down approach and utilized to prepare an electrochemical transducer for the electrochemical sensing of nicotine. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the successful incorporation of MX with Gr sheets. The high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to confirm the formation of MX, graphene sheets and the MX/Gr hybrid film. Furthermore, the MX/Gr hybrid film composite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was prepared to selectively detect the nicotine in phosphate buffer medium (0.1 M PBS, pH~7.4). Under the optimized condition, the MX/Gr/GCE based sensor provided a linear response against nicotine from 1 to 55 microM and 30 nM - 600 nM with the lowest limit of detections (LOD) of 290 nM and 0.28 nM by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and amperometry, respectively. This newly developed MX/Gr hybrid film modified electrode displayed a remarkable selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility for accurate detection of nicotine. Finally, this new sensor was applied to detect nicotine in human/artificial saliva samples with high accuracy.
