33757894|a|Steroids play an important role in cell regulation and homeostasis. Many diseases like Alzheimer's disease or Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome are known to be associated with deviations in the steroid profile. Most published methods only allow the analysis of small subgroups of steroids and cannot give an overview of the total steroid profile. We developed and validated a method that allows the analysis of free neutral steroids, including intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis, free oxysterols, C19 and C21 steroids, free steroid acids, including bile acids, and sterol sulfates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Samples were analyzed in scan mode for screening purposes and in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode for highly sensitive quantitative analysis. The method was validated for mouse brain and liver tissue and consists of sample homogenization, lipid extraction, steroid group separation, deconjugation, derivatization and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. We applied the method on brain and liver samples of mice (10 months and 3 weeks old) and cultured N2a cells and report the endogenous concentrations of 29 physiological steroids.
