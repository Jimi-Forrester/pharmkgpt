33676401|a|BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation interventions are frequently cited as key in supporting frail older people's recovery following periods of decompensation and acute ill-health. Clinicians are required to make decisions about a patient's potential to respond to rehabilitation. 'Rehabilitation potential' decisions can determine access to services. In acute settings clinicians have limited time to assess and work with patients, families and carers. The complexities of ageing, recovery, rehabilitation and frailty may not be fully appreciated. This study aimed to explore multiple perspectives of the concept of rehabilitation potential and how it is assessed in older people living with frailty in the acute healthcare setting. METHODS: Five focus groups with a purposive sample of 28 participants which included clinicians and members of the public were conducted. Analysis comprised a thematic approach using the Framework method. RESULTS: Rehabilitation potential was found to encapsulate a complex decision-making process where clinicians judged an individual's ability to benefit from and participate in targeted rehabilitation. They asked, "Will it work?", "Is it wanted?" and "Is it available?" In order to predict who would benefit from rehabilitation interventions, clinicians assessed a range of holistic clinical and non-clinical factors. An iterative approach to assessment delivered by a multi-disciplinary team, centred around patient and carer needs and wants was needed to accommodate complexity. Participants believed that everyone had some form of potential but this was dependent on availability of rehabilitation resources and conceptualisations of frailty and rehabilitation. Tensions between iterative approaches to rehabilitation potential assessment and the realities of rapid decision making in the acute hospital setting were found. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation potential decisions involve a complex process of multidisciplinary decision-making and prognostication on the likely outcome and benefit from rehabilitation programmes. These findings lay the foundation for developing structured approaches to rehabilitation potential decision making tools and guidance.
