32231560|a|Background: Little is known about the underlying mechanisms of the similarities in the core features of postoperative delirium (POD) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn)-related cognitive disorders. We herein investigated associations between fluctuated levels of exosomal alpha-syn in the plasma and POD presentation in geriatric hip fracture patients. Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective, and 1:1 matched (on age older than 65, hip fracture diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologist' (ASA) physical status, duration of surgery, and intraoperative bleeding) case-control study: POD cases and non-POD controls were selected from the overall cohort by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Delirium severity was measured by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Plasma exosome levels of alpha-syn were examined preoperatively and at the time that POD was diagnosed, by using an established immunocapture technology based on a putative brain-cell-specific marker. Circulating concentrations of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were also determined. The relationship between alpha-syn levels and POD risk, as well as the association between alpha-syn and MDAS scores and plasma cytokines, were assessed. Results: POD incidence was 8.4% (17/202). Postoperative alpha-syn were either elevated or lowered. As primary outcome variables, the change of alpha-syn in POD patients was significantly higher than non-POD ones (21.0 +- 29.3 pg.ml-1 vs.1.9 +- 20.0, P = 0.047). The alpha-syn alteration was positively correlated to MDAS (r = 0.436, P = 0.010) and the change of IL-6 (r = 0.383, P = 0.025). Conclusions: Exosome alpha-syn release in plasma may be associated with the POD development which might be due to systemic inflammation.
