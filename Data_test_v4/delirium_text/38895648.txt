38895648|t|Potential Link Between Exercise and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Glutamate Receptors in Alcohol Use Disorder: Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.
38895648|a|Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant risk factor, accounting for approximately 13% of all deaths in the US. AUD not only destroys families but also causes economic losses due to reduced productivity, absenteeism, and healthcare expenses. Statistics revealing the sustained number of individuals affected by AUD over the years underscore the need for further understanding of the underlying pathophysiology to advance novel therapeutic strategies. Previous research has implicated the limbic brain regions N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDAR) in the emotional and behavioral effects of AUD. Given that aerobic exercise can modulate NMDAR activity and sensitivity to alcohol, this review presents a summary of clinical and basic science studies on NMDAR levels induced by alcohol consumption, as well as acute and protracted withdrawal, highlighting the potential role of aerobic exercise as an adjunctive therapy for AUD. Based on our findings, the utility of exercise in the modulation of reward-linked receptors and AUD may be mediated by its effects on NMDA signaling. These data support further consideration of the potential of aerobic exercise as a promising adjunctive therapy for AUD.
