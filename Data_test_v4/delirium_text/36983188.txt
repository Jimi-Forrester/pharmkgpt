36983188|a|BACKGROUND: The number of joint revision arthroplasties has increased in the elderly population, which is burdened by several perioperative risks. METHODS: Patients who underwent hip and knee revision arthroplasty were retrospectively included, and they were divided into two groups by age: <80 years old (Group 1) and >=80 years old (Group 2). The primary outcome was to compare perioperative complication rates. The secondary outcome was to compare the 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year readmission rates. RESULTS: In total, 74 patients in Group 1 and 75 patients in Group 2 were included. Postoperative anemia affected 13 patients in Group 1 (17.6%) and 25 in Group 2 (33.3%, p 0.027); blood units were transfused in 20 (26.7%) and 11 (14.9%, p 0.076) patients, respectively. In Group 1, two (2.7%) patients reported wound infection. In Group 2, eight (10.7%) patients presented hematomas, and two (2.7%) patients reported dislocations. No significant differences in the two groups were observed for 30-day (p 0.208), 90-day (p 0.273), or 1-year readmission rates (p 0.784). CONCLUSION: The revision arthroplasty procedure in patients over 80 years old is not associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications, or higher readmission rate compared with younger patients undergoing hip and knee revision surgery.
