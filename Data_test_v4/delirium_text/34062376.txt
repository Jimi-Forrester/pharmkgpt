34062376|t|The effect of an educational intervention to improve orthopaedic nurses' knowledge of delirium: A quasi-experimental study.
34062376|a|BACKGROUND: Lack of delirium knowledge and its clinical repercussions contributes to the absence of delirium prevention activities in routine clinical practice. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a delirium awareness educational program on nurses' knowledge about delirium prevention and management. METHODS: A quasi-experimental (pre-intervention, post-intervention test) design was used to test the effectiveness of an educational intervention using a knowledge survey. RESULTS: There was no difference in the knowledge scores between the 2 periods for domains 1, 2 3 and 4. However, the median (IQR) knowledge scores for domain 5 (risk factors) and domain 6 (recognising delirium) was higher at post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. CONCLUSION: A multi-step educational intervention had a positive but small impact on nurses' knowledge of delirium. However, the training was not mandatory and uptake of the training was not as high as hoped. Most nurses preferred ward-based education - combination of formal knowledge delivery and informal practice discussion. Future studies should focus on programs which are ward-based including various of teaching styles.
