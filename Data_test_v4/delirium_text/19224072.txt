19224072|a|A 31-year-old man Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition usually seen in the visually-impaired elderly, causing complex visual hallucinations in the absence of any delirium, dementia or psychiatric illness. We report an elderly man, with blindness in one eye and a cataract in the other, from the Iban tribe, which is indigenous to the island of Borneo. He presented with a three-week history of vivid hallucinations of burglars intruding on his living quarters in the longhouse where he lived.
