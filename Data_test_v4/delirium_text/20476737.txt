20476737|a|Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are a group of complex and heterogeneous compounds formed from nonenzymatic reactions. The accumulation of AGEs in vivo has been implicated as a major pathogenic process in diabetic complications and other health disorders, such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging. In this study, we investigate the inhibitory effects of cinnamon bark proanthocyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2 on the formation of specific AGE representatives including pentosidine, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), and methylglyoxal (MGO) derived AGEs. These compounds displayed obvious inhibitory effects on these specific AGEs, which are largely attributed to both their antioxidant activities and carbonyl scavenging capacities. Meanwhile, in terms of their potent MGO scavenging capacities, effects of these proanthocyanidins on insulin signaling pathways interfered by MGO were evaluated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. According to the results, proanthocyanidins exerted protective effects on glucose consumption impaired by MGO in 3T3-L1 fat cells.
