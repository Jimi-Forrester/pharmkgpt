36261846|t|Lrpap1 deficiency leads to myopia through TGF-beta-induced apoptosis in zebrafish.
36261846|a|BACKGROUND: Frameshift mutations in LRPAP1 are responsible for autosomal recessive high myopia in human beings but its underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of LRPAP1 defect on ocular refractive development and its involved mechanism. METHODS: A lrpap1 mutant zebrafish line with homozygous frameshift mutation was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The ocular refractive phenotype was analyzed by calculating the relative refractive error (RRE) with vivo photography and histological analysis at different development stages, together with examining ocular structure change via transmission electron microscopy. Further, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed. The potentially involved signaling pathway as well as the interacted protein were investigated in vivo. RESULTS: The lrpap1 homozygous mutant zebrafish line showed myopic phenotype. Specifically, the mutant lines showed larger eye axial length-to-body length in one-month old individuals and a myopic shift with an RRE that changed after two months. Collagen fibers became thinning and disordered in the sclera. Further, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis indicated that apoptosis signaling was activated in mutant line; this was further confirmed by acridine orange and TUNEL staining. Moreover, the expression of TGF-beta protein was elevated in the mutant lines. Finally, the treatment of wild-type embryos with a TGF-beta agonist aggravated the degree of eyeball apoptosis; conversely, the use of a TGF-beta inhibitor mitigated apoptosis in mutant embryos. CONCLUSION: The study provides functional evidence of a link between lrpap1 and myopia, suggesting that lrpap1 deficiency could lead to myopia through TGF-beta-induced apoptosis signaling.
