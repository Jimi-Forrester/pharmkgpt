Aberrations in DNA repair and the DDR are observed in many cancer subtypes and can promote de novo carcinogenesis, genomic instability, and ensuing resistance to current cancer therapy. Additionally, stalled or collapsed DNA replication forks present a unique challenge to the double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair system. Of the various inducible DNA lesions, DSBs are the most lethal and thus desirable in the setting of cancer treatment. In mammalian cells, DSBs are typically repaired by the error prone non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) or the high-fidelity homology directed repair (HDR) pathway. Targeting DSB repair pathways using small molecular inhibitors offers a promising mechanism to synergize DNA-damaging drugs and IR while selective inhibition of the NHEJ pathway can induce synthetic lethality in HDR-deficient cancer subtypes. Selective inhibitors of the NHEJ pathway and alternative DSB-repair pathways may also see future use in precision genome editing to direct repair of resulting DSBs created by the HDR pathway. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in the development of inhibitors of the non-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (non-PIKKs) members of the NHEJ, HDR and minor backup SSA and alt-NHEJ DSB-repair pathways. The inhibitors described within this review target the non-PIKKs mediators of DSB repair including Ku70/80, Artemis, DNA Ligase IV, XRCC4, MRN complex, RPA, RAD51, RAD52, ERCC1-XPF, helicases, and DNA polymerase theta. While the DDR PIKKs remain intensely pursued as therapeutic targets, small molecule inhibition of non-PIKKs represents an emerging opportunity in drug discovery that offers considerable potential to impact cancer treatment.
