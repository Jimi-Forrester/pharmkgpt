36480442|a|Globally Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial neurological disease. AD is categorized clinically through a steady loss in memory and progressive decline of cognitive function. So far, there is no effective cure is available for the treatment of AD. Here, we identified Plant-based compounds (PBCs) from seven therapeutic plants through pharmacophore and pharmacokinetics approaches. Subsequently, we retrieved 65 AD associated proteins by Text Mining approach .We observed the interactions between 39 PBCs with 65 AD-associated targets by using molecular docking. Further, we carried out Molecular dynamics simulation analysis to predict the steady binding of top drug-target complexes. The entire MD simulation results analysis was evidence that seven drug-target complexes consistently interacted during the in silico experiment. The top complexes were the target CHLE interacted with 2 PBCs (Pseudojujubogenin and Anahygrine), target VDAC1 interacted with Withanolide R, target THOP1 interacted with Withaolide R, target AOFB interacted with 2 PBCs (Nardostachysin and Viscosalactone B), and target ACHE interacted with the drug (12-Deoxywithastramonolide). These PBCs have stably and flexibly interacted at the protein's active site region. Our results suggest that these PBCs and targets are potential therapeutic candidates for molecular development in AD.
