31775356|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative brain disorder associated with loss of memory and cognitive function. Beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates, in particular, are known to be highly neurotoxic and lead to neurodegeneration. Therefore, blockade or reduction of Abeta aggregation is a promising therapeutic approach in AD. We have previously reported an inhibitory effect of the methanol extract of Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton (Lamiaceae) and its hexane fraction on Abeta aggregation. Here, the hexane fraction of P. frutescens was subjected to diverse column chromatography based on activity-guided isolation methodology. This approach identified five asarone derivatives including 2,3-dimethoxy-5-(1E)-1-propen-1-yl-phenol (1), beta-asarone (2), 3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-(2E)-2-propen-1-ol (3), asaronealdehyde (4), and alpha-asarone (5). All five asarone derivatives efficiently reduced the aggregation of Abeta and disaggregated preformed Abeta aggregates in a dose-dependent manner as determined by a Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay. Furthermore, asarone derivatives protected PC12 cells from Abeta aggregate-induced toxicity by reducing the aggregation of Abeta, and significantly reduced NO production from LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that asarone derivatives derived from P. frutescens are neuroprotective and have the prophylactic and therapeutic potential in AD.
