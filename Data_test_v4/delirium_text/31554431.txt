31554431|a|BACKGROUND: Administration of d-galactose (d-gal) has been used to create animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, and huperzine A has been used to treat the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. METHODS: An animal model of hearing dysfunction was established by administration of d-gal in the rats, and the effect of huperzine A on d-gal-induced abnormal hearing function and cochlear damage was investigated. Senescence of the cochlear tissues was examined by beta-galactase staining, and messenger RNA expression of inflammatory cytokines was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: It was found that d-gal significantly increased auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold and cellular senescence and decreased neurofilament in the cochlear tissues. Huperzine A could significantly attenuate d-gal-induced increase of ABR threshold and cellular senescence as well as reduction of neurofilament. Moreover, huperzine A could inhibit d-gal-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) in Schwann cells and significantly blocked d-gal-stimulated gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that d-gal causes hearing dysfunction by inflammatory injury of cochlear neurons and that huperzine A could prevent hearing loss by protecting d-gal-induced physical damage of cochlear tissues.
