36949303|a|Numerous studies have investigated the causes and mechanisms of psychiatric disorders through postmortem examination of patients with a history of a schizophrenia, mood disorder, or neurocognitive disorder. In addition, the search for specific mechanism-based treatments for psychiatric disorders has been intensified through the use of transgenic animal models involving specific genes tightly associated with psychiatric disorders. As a result, many studies with patients or animal models have reported a close association of neuroglia with major psychiatric disorders. Recently, research has focused on the associations between microglia and major psychiatric disorders and on the role of the immune response and abnormal microglia in the onset and symptoms of psychiatric disorders, in particular. Postmortem studies of brain tissue and animal models recapitulating human mental disorders have also confirmed association between psychiatric disorders and quantitative, structural, or functional abnormalities of neuron-microglia crosstalk. This review aims to describe the relationships between microglia and major psychiatric disorders and to specifically examine studies of gene expression and function of microglia in depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.
