38260541|a|In a series of translational experiments using fully quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with a new tracer specific for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter ([18F]VAT) in vivo in humans, and genetically targeted cholinergic markers in mice, we evaluated whether changes to the cholinergic system were an early feature of age-related cognitive decline. We found that deficits in cholinergic innervation of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and decline in performance on behavioral tasks engaging the EC are, strikingly, early features of the aging process. In human studies, we recruited older adult volunteers that were physically healthy and without prior clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Using [18F]VAT PET imaging, we demonstrate that there is measurable loss of cholinergic inputs to the EC that can serve as an early signature of decline in EC cognitive performance. These deficits are specific to the cholinergic circuit between the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/vDB; CH1/2) to the EC. Using diffusion imaging, we further demonstrate impaired structural connectivity in the tracts between the MS/vDB and EC in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Experiments in mouse, designed to parallel and extend upon the human studies, used high resolution imaging to evaluate cholinergic terminal density and immediate early gene (IEG) activity of EC neurons in healthy aging mice and in mice with genetic susceptibility to accelerated accumulation amyloid beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated mouse tau. Across species and aging conditions, we find that the integrity of cholinergic projections to the EC directly correlates with the extent of EC activation and with performance on EC-related object recognition memory tasks. Silencing EC-projecting cholinergic neurons in young, healthy mice during the object-location memory task impairs object recognition performance, mimicking aging. Taken together we identify a role for acetylcholine in normal EC function and establish loss of cholinergic input to the EC as an early, conserved feature of age-related cognitive decline in both humans and rodents.
