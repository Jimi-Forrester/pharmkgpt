37428472|t|Scientific Evidence for the Beneficial Effects of Dietary Blueberries on Gut Health: A Systematic Review.
37428472|a|Emerging evidence indicates the association between an unhealthy gut and chronic diseases. A healthy gut comprises an intact gut epithelium and balanced gut microbes. Diet is one of the critical factors that modulate gut health by positively or negatively affecting the intestinal barrier and gut microbes. Blueberries are an excellent source of health-promoting bioactive components, and this systematic review is conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary blueberries on gut health. A literature search is conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to review relevant studies published between 2011 and 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias (SYRCLE-RoB) tool is used for methodological quality assessments. Sixteen studies included from four countries are reviewed and the results are synthesized narratively. This data analysis indicates that blueberry supplementation improves gut health by improving intestinal morphology, reducing gut permeability, suppressing oxidative stress, ameliorating gut inflammation, and modulating the composition and function of gut microbes. However, there are significant knowledge gaps in this field. These findings indicate that further studies are needed to establish the beneficial effects of blueberries on gut health.
