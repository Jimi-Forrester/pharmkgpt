38020406|a|Background: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects approximately 50-70 million people worldwide. Epilepsy has a significant economic and social burden on patients as well as on the country. The recurrent, spontaneous seizure activity caused by abnormal neuronal firing in the brain is a hallmark of epilepsy. The current antiepileptic drugs provide symptomatic relief by restoring the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Besides, about 30% of epileptic patients do not achieve seizure control. The prevalence of adverse drug reactions, including aggression, agitation, irritability, and associated comorbidities, is also prevalent. Therefore, researchers should focus on developing more effective, safe, and disease-modifying agents based on new molecular targets and signaling cascades. Summary: This review overviews several clinical trials that help identify promising new targets like lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, c-jun n-terminal kinases, high mobility group box-1 antibodies, astrocyte reactivity inhibitors, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitors, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitors, and glycolytic inhibitors to develop a new antiepileptic drug. Key messages: Approximately 30% of epileptic patients do not achieve seizure control. The current anti-seizure drugs are not disease modifying, cure or prevent epilepsy. Lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitor, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors have a promising antiepileptogenic effect.
