30355540|a|Given the current demographic situation, the primary care must consider the frailty concept. The << Frailty and Alzheimer's disease prevention into Primary care >> project (FAP) enabled geriatric assessment by a nurse in general practitioner's office to assess older persons. The aim of our study was to evaluate patients' satisfaction after geriatric assessment into primary care. METHODS: This is an observational descriptive study performed in the Occitanie area on a population of 268 older patients. Gathering of information was performed through a phone survey. RESULTS: A total of 133 questionnaires were filled in. Average age was 80 (+-6) years old and 60% were women. 75.2% (n=100) were frail or pre-frail; 72% (n=89) of participants have been completely satisfied by this assessment; 71% (n=24) have been completely satisfied about their personalized plan of care; 79% (n=89) of them thought the general practitioners' office as the best place for geriatric assessment; 42% (n=52) would have refused the evaluation in the hospital. DISCUSSION: Patient's feedback is very encouraging. They were favorable to the development of the geriatric assessment into primary care and the generalization of the FAP project in other areas. Further studies must be carried out in order to evaluate the medico-economic effect of this care model.
