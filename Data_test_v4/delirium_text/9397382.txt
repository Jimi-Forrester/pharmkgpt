9397382|a|Postmenopausal estrogen deficiency may result in a wide variety of physiologic disorders, including vasomotor symptoms, urogenital atrophy, an increase in the risk of coronary heart disease, osteoporotic fractures, and Alzheimer's disease. The growing body of evidence, including much that is newly published, demonstrating that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can largely prevent or mitigate these sequelae, will be reviewed in this paper. The efficacy of HRT in alleviating vasomotor and urogenital discomfort, the most common symptoms of postmenopausal estrogen deficiency, is well established. Evidence from over 30 epidemiologic studies indicates that estrogen reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) by 50%. The risk of major CHD has been found to be markedly reduced in women who receive combined estrogen/progestogen therapy compared to nonusers (or estrogen-alone users). Estrogen is recommended as the modality of choice to prevent bone loss: data supporting a positive effect of estrogen on the risk of wrist and vertebral fracture are quite favorable. Similarly, outcomes of recent investigations have demonstrated a positive impact of HRT on both psychological function and the risk of osteoarthritis. In addition, HRT substantially reduces the risk of colon cancer. Moreover, the potential for HRT to delay the progression or reduce the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease is a new area of research that shows promise. Improvements in quality-of-life assessments have also been reported in conjunction with the relief of menopausal symptoms by HRT. Clinicians should be aware of the large amount of new evidence that strengthens the case for wider use of HRT. Based on these new data, physicians may conclude that HRT would benefit the majority of their postmenopausal patients and thus encourage HRT use in the absence of known risk factors.
