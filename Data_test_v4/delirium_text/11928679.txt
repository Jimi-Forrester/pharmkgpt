11928679|t|[Nervous system disorders induced by occupational exposure to aluminium compounds: a literature review].
11928679|a|This is a review of the literature on the effect of aluminum (Al) and its compounds on the nervous system. The role of aluminum in etiology of some degenerative diseases of the nervous system, e.g. Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or dementia, is presented. The special attention was turned to the effects of aluminum on the nervous system functions in persons occupationally exposed to metal-containing dusts and fumes, manifested mostly by neurobehavioral disorders and changes in the brain bioelectric functions and less frequently pronounced by clinical neurological symptoms.
