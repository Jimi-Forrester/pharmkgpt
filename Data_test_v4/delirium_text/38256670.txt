38256670|t|Controversial Past, Splendid Present, Unpredictable Future: A Brief Review of Alzheimer Disease History.
38256670|a|Background: The concept of Alzheimer disease (AD)-since its histological discovery by Alzheimer to the present day-has undergone substantial modifications. Methods: We conducted a classical narrative review of this field with a bibliography selection (giving preference to Medline best match). Results: The following subjects are reviewed and discussed: Alzheimer's discovery, Kraepelin's creation of a new disease that was a rare condition until the 1970's, the growing interest and investment in AD as a major killer in a society with a large elderly population in the second half of the 20th century, the consolidation of the AD clinicopathological model, and the modern AD nosology based on the dominant amyloid hypothesis among many others. In the 21st century, the development of AD biomarkers has supported a novel biological definition of AD, although the proposed therapies have failed to cure this disease. The incidence of dementia/AD has shown a decrease in affluent countries (possibly due to control of risk factors), and mixed dementia has been established as the most frequent etiology in the oldest old. Conclusions: The current concept of AD lacks unanimity. Many hypotheses attempt to explain its complex physiopathology entwined with aging, and the dominant amyloid cascade has yielded poor therapeutic results. The reduction in the incidence of dementia/AD appears promising but it should be confirmed in the future. A reevaluation of the AD concept is also necessary.
