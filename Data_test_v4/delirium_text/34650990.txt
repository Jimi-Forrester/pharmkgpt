34650990|t|Clinical Knowledge and Practice of "Ketofol" at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital.
34650990|a|Background: Ketamine and propofol in a single syringe are reported to create an admixture used for balancing cardiorespiratory effects during induction of general anesthesia. This study aimed to assess the clinical practice and knowledge of "ketofol" among anesthesia providers. Methods: A cross-sectional institutional-based study was conducted among anesthesia providers. Data abstracted format was prepared and distributed to senior anesthetists, junior anesthetist postgraduate students, and undergraduate students. The study was conducted from January 1, 2019, to January 30, 2019. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed for frequency distribution and to determine the association, respectively. Result: From a total of 133 participants included in the study, the majority, 88 (66.2%), were men and 75 (56.9%) had 0-2 years of experience. More than two-thirds of participants, 105 (78.9%), have never had a seminar or educational session about combined use. Lack of experience among 11 participants (8.3%) was one of the reasons for not using "ketofol" followed by lack of knowledge among three (2.3%) participants. The majority of participants, 112 (84.2%), prefer ketamine and propofol to be administered one right after the other with separate syringes and the ratio to be 1:2, 64 (48.2). There was no significant association observed between sociodemographic and other characteristics and the practice of "ketofol." Conclusion: In this study, nearly half of the participants rated their knowledge at the average level, and the study identifies that there is clinical knowledge and practice gap among anesthesia providers working in the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UOGCSH). Preparing educational sessions regarding "ketofol" for addressing identified barriers is among the recommendations forwarded to UOGCSH.
