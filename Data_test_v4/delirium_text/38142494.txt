38142494|t|A novel near-infrared fluorescent probe for high-sensitivity detection of butyrylcholinesterase in various pathological states.
38142494|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a crucial hydrolytic enzyme predominantly synthesized in the liver, playing a significant role in conditions like liver disorders, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and fat metabolism regulation. This study aims to address the current limitations in visualizing BChE activity in diseases at various states by introducing an ultra-sensitive near-infrared fluorescent probe, FDCM-BChE. The probe was engineered to have several properties, such as a large Stokes shift, rapid response time, high stability, excellent selectivity, and low detection limits. We validated the efficacy of FDCM-BChE in quantifying BChE activity in human serum and leveraged its low cytotoxicity for cellular imaging. The study revealed the downregulation of BChE activity in liver cancer and hepatic injury and the upregulation in diabetes. Thus, FDCM-BChE shows promise as a tool for specific applications, providing insights into diseases associated with BChE activity.
