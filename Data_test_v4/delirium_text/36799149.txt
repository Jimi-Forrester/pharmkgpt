36799149|t|Role of ceramides in diabetic foot ulcers (Review).
36799149|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder, which if not managed properly, can lead to serious health problems over time and impose significant financial burden on the patient, their family and society as a whole. The study of this disease and the underlying biological mechanism is gaining momentum. Multiple pieces of conclusive evidence show that ceramides are involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes. The present review focuses on the function of ceramides, a type of sphingolipid signaling molecule, to provide a brief description of ceramides and their metabolism, discuss the significant roles of ceramides in the healthy skin barrier, and speculate on the potential involvement of ceramides in the pathogenesis and development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Understanding these aspects of this disease more thoroughly is crucial to establish how ceramides contribute to the etiology of diabetic foot infections and identify possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of DFUs.
