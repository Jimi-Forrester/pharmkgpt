38212850|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate the associations between insulin resistance (IR)-related features and cognitive function in type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: A total of 117 adult patients with T1D were recruited in this cross-sectional study. IR-related features include overweight/obesity/central obesity, hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and decreased estimated insulin sensitivity (eIS). The Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and Sustained Attention to Response Task was used to assess memory, executive function and sustained attention, respectively. A z-score was generated from each test, and a composite measure of global cognitive performance was calculated by averaging the z-scores of all tests. Cognitive differences were measured between T1D patients with and without IR-related features. The associations between IR-related features and and cognitive performance were analyzed using: logistic regression, partial correlation, and multivariate linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 53 (45.3%) T1D patients were defined as having IR-related features. Individuals with IR-related features displayed worse overall cognitive scores compared to those without and had a 4-fold increase in the risk for having global cognitive z-score < 0. Among the IR-related features, higher triglyceride (TG) and lower eIS showed linear correlation with lower global cognitive performance. And the subsequent regression analysis identified eIS as the factor independently associated with global cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: We have provided evidence linking IR-related features to deteriorated cognitive function in adult patients with T1D. And eIS showed an independent positive correlation with global cognitive performance. Although no causal relationship can be drawn, IR emerges as an important factor reflecting cognitive function.
