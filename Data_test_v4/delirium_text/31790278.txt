31790278|t|Serpina3n: Potential drug and challenges, mini review.
31790278|a|Serpina3n is a secretory serine protease inhibitor belonging to clade "a" exhibiting unique structural and physiological characteristics, playing significant roles ranging from complement cascade, apoptosis, wound healing to Alzheimer by inhibiting a wide range of proteases. Recently studies have reported its significant roles during various pathologies. Although its full range of potential applications are yet to reveal, its reported implications particularly in CNS insults are making it potential therapeutical approach. Here we aim to draw together the literature shedding light on the potential therapeutical applications of Serpina3n/SERPINA3 in various diseases and a brief comparison between murine Serpina3n and its human ortholog SERPINA3 (alpha1-antichymotrypsin) accounting their biological roles and significance.
