38203706|a|Mounting evidence supports the role of the endocannabinoid system in neurophysiology, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Recent work has demonstrated that activation of endocannabinoid receptors can mitigate insults to the BBB during neurological disorders like traumatic brain injury, cortical spreading depression, and stroke. As alterations to the BBB are associated with worsening clinical outcomes in these conditions, studies herein sought to examine the impact of endocannabinoid depletion on BBB integrity. Barrier integrity was investigated in vitro via bEnd.3 cell monolayers to assess endocannabinoid synthesis, barrier function, calcium influx, junctional protein expression, and proteome-wide changes. Inhibition of 2-AG synthesis using DAGLalpha inhibition and siRNA inhibition of DAGLalpha led to loss of barrier integrity via altered expression of VE-cadherin, which could be partially rescued by exogenous application of 2-AG. Moreover, the deleterious effects of DAGLalpha inhibition on BBB integrity showed both calcium and PKC (protein kinase C)-dependency. These data indicate that disruption of 2-AG homeostasis in brain endothelial cells, in the absence of insult, is sufficient to disrupt BBB integrity thus supporting the role of the endocannabinoid system in neurovascular disorders.
