35538555|a|BACKGROUND: Alumina nanoparticles (aluminaNPs), which are widely used in a range of daily and medical fields, have been shown to penetrate blood-brain barrier, and distribute and accumulate in different brain areas. Although oral treatment of aluminaNPs induces hippocampus-dependent learning and memory impairments, characteristic effects and exact mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, male adult rats received a single bilateral infusion of aluminaNPs (10 or 20 microg/kg of body weight) into the hippocampal region, and their behavioral performance and neural function were assessed. RESULTS: The results indicated that the intra-hippocampus infusions at both doses of aluminaNPs did not cause spatial learning inability but memory deficit in the water maze task. This impairment was attributed to the effects of aluminaNP on memory consolidation phase through activation of proBDNF/RhoA pathway. Inhibition of the increased proBDNF by hippocampal infusions of p75NTR antagonist could effectively rescue the memory impairment. Incubation of aluminaNPs exaggerated GluN2B-dependent LTD induction with no effects on LTD expression in hippocampal slices. AluminaNP could also depress the amplitude of NMDA-GluN2B EPSCs. Meanwhile, increased reactive oxygen specie production was reduced by blocking proBDNF-p75NTR pathway in the hippocampal homogenates. Furthermore, the neuronal correlate of memory behavior was drastically weakened in the aluminaNP-infused groups. The dysfunction of synaptic and neuronal could be obviously mitigated by blocking proBDNF receptor p75NTR, implying the involvement of proBDNF signaling in aluminaNP-impaired memory process. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that the accumulation of aluminaNPs in the hippocampus exaggeratedly activates proBDNF signaling, which leads to neural and memory impairments.
