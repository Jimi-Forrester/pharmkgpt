36152400|a|OBJECTIVES: Older adults have a disproportionately higher COVID-19 risk; however, there is limited research investigating adherence to the major COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (handwashing, masking, social distancing) for older populations. We examined COVID-19 risk factors and predictors for adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors among a national sample of US older adults. STUDY DESIGN: Data were retrieved for 3257 respondents from a nationally representative prospective sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged >=65 years. COVID-19 variables were collected in 2020, whereas all other data were collected in 2019. METHODS: We used multiple logistic regression to analyze COVID-19 risk factors and predictors for handwashing, masking, and social distancing to minimize COVID-19 spread. All models applied survey sampling weights. RESULTS: Factors significantly associated with increased odds of COVID-19 diagnosis among US older adults were Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.83, P = .01), income (aOR = 0.71, P = .04), residential care or nursing home (aOR = 2.62, P = .01), and generalized anxiety disorder (aOR = 2.38, P = .04). We identified multiple factors significantly associated with adherence to handwashing, masking, and social distancing. Most notably, older males had a significantly lower odds of practicing all three COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, and Black older adults had a significantly higher odds of masking (aOR = 7.94, P < .001) and social distancing (aOR = 2.33, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: When prioritizing COVID-19 prevention efforts for older adults, risk factors that should be considered are race and ethnicity, income, residential setting, and anxiety. To effectively mitigate COVID-19 disease spread, public health professionals must also recognize sociodemographic and health factors may influence whether older adults adhere to handwashing, masking, and social distancing.
