35774110|a|Background: Although cumulating evidence has suggested that early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) conferred on patients a broader tendency for complications beyond vascular ones, a comprehensive analysis of patterns of complications across all relevant systems is currently lacking. Method: We prospectively studied 1 777 early-onset (age at diagnosis <= 45 years) and 35 889 late-onset (>45 years) T2DM patients with matched unexposed individuals from the UK Biobank. Diabetes-specific and -related complications were examined using phenome-wide association analysis, with patterns identified by comorbidity network analysis. We also evaluated the effect of lifestyle modifications and glycemic control on complication development. Results: The median follow-up times for early-onset and late-onset T2DM patients were 17.83 and 9.39 years, respectively. Compared to late-onset T2DM patients, patients with early-onset T2DM faced a significantly higher relative risk of developing subsequent complications that primarily affected sense organs [hazard ratio (HR) 3.46 vs. 1.72], the endocrine/metabolic system (HR 3.08 vs. 2.01), and the neurological system (HR 2.70 vs. 1.81). Despite large similarities in comorbidity patterns, a more complex and well-connected network was observed for early-onset T2DM. Furthermore, while patients with early-onset T2DM got fewer benefits (12.67% reduction in pooled HR for all studied complications) through fair glycemic control (median HbA1c <= 53 mmol/mol) compared to late-onset T2DM patients (18.01% reduction), they seemed to benefit more from favorable lifestyles, including weight control, healthy diet, and adequate physical activity. Conclusions: Our analyses reveal that early-onset T2DM is an aggressive disease resulting in more complex complication networks than late-onset T2DM. Aggressive glucose-lowering intervention, complemented by lifestyle modifications, are feasible strategies for controlling early-onset T2DM-related complications.
