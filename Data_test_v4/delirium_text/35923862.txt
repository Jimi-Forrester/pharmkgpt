35923862|t|Synaptic Secretion and Beyond: Targeting Synapse and Neurotransmitters to Treat Neurodegenerative Diseases.
35923862|a|The nervous system is important, because it regulates the physiological function of the body. Neurons are the most basic structural and functional unit of the nervous system. The synapse is an asymmetric structure that is important for neuronal function. The chemical transmission mode of the synapse is realized through neurotransmitters and electrical processes. Based on vesicle transport, the abnormal information transmission process in the synapse can lead to a series of neurorelated diseases. Numerous proteins and complexes that regulate the process of vesicle transport, such as SNARE proteins, Munc18-1, and Synaptotagmin-1, have been identified. Their regulation of synaptic vesicle secretion is complicated and delicate, and their defects can lead to a series of neurodegenerative diseases. This review will discuss the structure and functions of vesicle-based synapses and their roles in neurons. Furthermore, we will analyze neurotransmitter and synaptic functions in neurodegenerative diseases and discuss the potential of using related drugs in their treatment.
