32977518|t|Synapse and Receptor Alterations in Two Different S100B-Induced Glaucoma-Like Models.
32977518|a|Glaucoma is identified by an irreversible retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve damage. Over the past few years, the immune system gained importance in its genesis. In a glaucoma-like animal model with intraocular S100B injection, RGC death occurs at 14 days. In an experimental autoimmune glaucoma model with systemic S100B immunization, a loss of RGCs is accompanied by a decreased synaptic signal at 28 days. Here, we aimed to study synaptic alterations in these two models. In one group, rats received a systemic S100B immunization (n = 7/group), while in the other group, S100B was injected intraocularly (n = 6-7/group). Both groups were compared to appropriate controls and investigated after 14 days. While inhibitory post-synapses remained unchanged in both models, excitatory post-synapses degenerated in animals with intraocular S100B injection (p = 0.03). Excitatory pre-synapses tendentially increased in animals with systemic S100B immunization (p = 0.08) and significantly decreased in intraocular ones (p = 0.04). Significantly more n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (both p <= 0.04) as well as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (both p < 0.03) were observed in S100B animals in both models. We assume that an upregulation of these receptors causes the interacting synapse types to degenerate. Heightened levels of excitatory pre-synapses could be explained by remodeling followed by degeneration.
