31289648|a|Diabetes is a metabolic disorder disease associated with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and protein glycation. The effect of polygonum cuspidatum extract (PE) on AGEs and Nepsilon-(Carboxymethyl)-L-lysine formation, protein glycation, and diabetes was investigated. Six primary phenolics in a range of 12.36 mg/g for ellagic acid to 0.01 mg/g for piceid were determined in PE. In an intermediate-moisture-foods model, inhibition rate of PE was as high as 54.2% for AGEs and 78.9% for CML under aw 0.75. The protein glycation was also inhibited by PE. In a diabetic rat model, the levels of blood glucose, serum malondialdehyde, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins were effectively reduced by PE treatment. The antioxidation capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were also mediated by PE. Additionally, the activates of liver function-related enzymes including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) in diabetic rat were improved by PE.
