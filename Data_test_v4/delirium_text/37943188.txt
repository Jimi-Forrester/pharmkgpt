37943188|t|Dexmedetomidine - An Alternative to Midazolam in the Treatment of Ketamine-Induced Emergence Delirium: A Systematic Review.
37943188|a|PURPOSE: Analyze the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine compared to midazolam for the treatment of ketamine-induced emergence delirium in noncardiac surgical patients. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)22 were used for this review. PubMed, Cumulative Index To Nursing And Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost, National Institute of Health clinical trials, Google Scholar, and gray literature were searched for relevant studies. Only peer-reviewed nonexperimental studies, quasi-experimental studies, and randomized control trials with or without meta-analysis were included. The evidence was assessed using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice guidelines for quality ratings and evidence level. FINDINGS: Five blinded randomized controlled trials, three quasi-experimental studies, and two retrospective nonexperimental studies comprised of 1,024 subjects were evaluated for this review. Dexmedetomidine was more effective at reducing ketamine-induced delirium in adult patients, although midazolam attenuated the psychomimetic effects of ketamine better in pediatric patients. Furthermore, postanesthesia care unit discharge times were similar between patients treated with dexmedetomidine and midazolam. The studies in this review were categorized as Level I, Level II, or Level III and rated Grade A, implying strong confidence in the actual effects of dexmedetomidine in all outcome measures of the review. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is an effective alternative for alleviating ketamine-induced delirium in noncardiac adult surgical patients. Multiple studies in this review noted improved hemodynamics and reduced postoperative analgesic requirements after administration of dexmedetomidine in conjunction with ketamine.
