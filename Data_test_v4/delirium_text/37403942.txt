37403942|a|BACKGROUND: Brain MRI scanner variability can introduce bias in measurements. Harmonizing scanner variability is crucial. PURPOSE: To develop a harmonization method aimed at removing scanner variability, and to evaluate the consistency of results in multicenter studies. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: Multicenter data from 170 healthy participants (males/females = 98/72; age = 73.8 +- 7.3) and 170 Alzheimer's disease patients (males/females = 98/72; age = 76.2 +- 8.5) were compared with reference data from another 340 participants. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3-T, magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo and turbo field echo; 1.5-T, inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient echo T1-weighted sequences. ASSESSMENT: Gray matter (GM) brain images, obtained through segmentation of T1-weighted images, were utilized to evaluate the performance of the harmonization method using common orthogonal basis extraction (HCOBE) and four other methods (removal of artificial voxel effect by linear regression, RAVEL; Z_score; general linear model, GLM; ComBat). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to access the effectiveness of different methods in reducing scanner variability. The performance of harmonization methods in preserving GM volumes heterogeneity was evaluated by the similarity of the relationship between GM proportion and age in the reference and multicenter data. Furthermore, the consistency of the harmonized multicenter data with the reference data were evaluated based on classification results (train/test = 7/3) and brain atrophy. STATISTICAL TESTS: Two-sample t-tests, area under the curve (AUC), and Dice coefficients were used to analyze the consistency of results from the reference and harmonized multicenter data. A P-value <0.01 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: HCOBE reduced the scanner variability from 0.09 before harmonization to 0.003 (ideal: 0, RAVEL/Z_score/GLM/ComBat = 0.087/0.003/0.006/0.013). GM volumes showed no significant difference (P = 0.52) between the reference and HCOBE-harmonized multicenter data. Consistency evaluation showed that AUC values of 0.95 for both reference and HCOBE-harmonized multicenter data (RAVEL/Z_score/GLM/ComBat = 0.86/0.86/0.84/0.89), and the Dice coefficient increased from 0.73 before harmonization to 0.82 (ideal: 1, RAVEL/Z_score/GLM/ComBat = 0.39/0.64/0.59/0.74). DATA CONCLUSION: HCOBE may help to remove scanner variability and could improve the consistency of results in multicenter studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 1.
