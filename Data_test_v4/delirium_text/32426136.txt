32426136|a|The development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy has achieved promising results, both in clinical studies and in commercial products for patients with hematologic malignancies. Despite high remission rates of CAR-T cell therapy in previously untreatable, refractory and/or relapsed patients, several challenges in CAR-T therapy remain to be overcome, especially in integrating such therapies into personalized disease management approaches. Given the unique characteristics of CAR-T therapy, it is particularly urgent to identify biomarkers to maximize their clinical benefits. This systematic review summarizes clinically relevant biomarkers that may help individualized disease management in patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy in terms of toxicity warning, efficacy prediction and relapse monitoring. We summarize data from 18 clinical trials, including traditional indicators like cytokines, biochemical proteins, tumor burden, as well as potential novel indicators such as CAR-T cell expansion and persistency. The establishment of a biomarker-based system aimed at individualized management is recommended to guide better clinical application of CAR-T products.
