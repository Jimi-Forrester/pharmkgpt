29756163|a|PURPOSE: To assess the clinical utility of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for detection of early signs of neurodegeneration in conditions of increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as defined by: subjective cognitive decline (SCD), evidence of cerebral amyloid-pathology, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4-positive genotype, or autosomal dominant forms of AD (ADAD) in asymptomatic stages. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PICO model to extract evidence from relevant studies. An expert panel then voted using the Delphi method on three different diagnostic scenarios. RESULTS: The level of empirical study evidence for the use of FDG-PET to detect meaningful early signs of neurodegeneration was considered to be poor for ADAD and lacking for SCD and asymptomatic persons at risk, based on APOE epsilon4-positive genotype or cerebral amyloid pathology. Consequently, and consistent with current diagnostic criteria, panelists decided not to recommend routine clinical use of FDG-PET in these situations and to currently mainly reserve it for research purposes. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is limited evidence on which to base recommendations regarding the clinical routine use of FDG-PET to detect diagnostically meaningful early signs of neurodegeneration in asymptomatic subjects with ADAD, with APOE epsilon4-positive genotype, or with cerebral amyloid pathology, and in subjects with SCD. Future prospective studies are warranted and in part already ongoing, aiming to assess the added value of FDG-PET in this context beyond research applications.
