35053874|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the aging brain has been often observed and is thought to be a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. The use of natural products for disease prevention and treatment is gaining attention worldwide. Carthamus tinctorius L. seed and Taraxacum coreanum have been used as traditional medicines in Asian countries, where they have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. It has been demonstrated that the combination of C. tinctorius L. seed and T. coreanum has an effect on cognitive enhancement, indicating a ratio of 5:5 synergistically enhancing learning and memory abilities in comparison with a single treatment. Here, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of C. tinctorius L. seed and T. coreanum mixture (CT) at different concentrations on cognition in Abeta25-35-infused mice. CT-administered mice showed significant cognitive improvement in the T-maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, amyloidogenesis-related proteins, such as beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, were detected and their protein levels decreased after treatment with CT. Our study shows that CT attenuates cognitive dysfunction by improving learning and memory capability and regulating Abeta-related proteins in Abeta25-35-injected mice. These findings suggest that CT might be a candidate for functional food on cognitive improvement.
