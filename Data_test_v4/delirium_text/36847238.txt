36847238|t|Neutron Activation Analysis: An Excellent Nondestructive Analytical Technique for Trace Metal Analysis.
36847238|a|For proper functioning of the human body, several metals are required in different concentrations but if their concentration slightly elevates, because of any metal-contaminated environment or of other food sources, which leads to high toxicity and different chronic health issues. Different analytical techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma- mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy are used for metals analysis present in different samples in different fields but nowadays neutron activation analysis (NAA) is preferred over other analytical techniques because it is an efficient, multi-elemental, nondestructive analytical technique having an ultralow minimum detection limit, therefore it can detect heavy metals (HMs) even if at a very trace level parts per billion (ppb) with a quite simple sample preparation technique. This technique is known as "referee technique" because of its accuracy and trustworthiness. There is a widespread use of this technique in biomedical science like in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, arthritis, metabolism study, brain tumor and in many more conditions where metals are actively present. For its typical sample sizes and due to a multitude of additional benefits, it also helps in mapping of pathophysiology of the disease. Besides all, mainly in biomedical science the biological samples can easily be analyzed irrespective of any form. In recent years NAA is preferred over other analytical techniques in several research fields, so this article focuses on the analytical technique, its general principle and recent applications.
