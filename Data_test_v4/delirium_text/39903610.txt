39903610|t|"I'm Seeing Dead People": A Case Report on Salicylate Poisoning in a Patient with Hallucinations.
39903610|a|INTRODUCTION: Salicylate poisoning remains one of the most common global accidental overdoses and poses a considerable health threat. Typical presentations for salicylate overdoses include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain as well as tinnitus, tachypnea, fever, and dehydration resulting in a concomitant metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. This may progress to a predominance of neurological symptoms such as mental status changes, confusion, delirium, and hallucinations. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of an accidental, sub-chronic overdose (up to 7.5 grams/day for multiple weeks; ~75 milligrams/kilogram/day) that resulted in predominantly neurological symptoms (ie, tinnitus and hallucinations, including the patient reporting "seeing dead people") but without the more typical findings classically associated with salicylate toxicity. The patient was started on a sodium bicarbonate drip; after two days, symptoms completely resolved, and she was safely discharged home. CONCLUSION: This case serves as a reminder for physicians to have a high index of suspicion for chronic toxicities including salicylates in patients who present as acute psychosis or altered mental status of unknown etiology.
