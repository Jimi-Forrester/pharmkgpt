36803745|t|Bloodborne Pancreatic Amylin, A Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease.
36803745|a|Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathology has been linked to brain accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tau tangles. An intriguing question is whether targeting therapeutically factors independent of Abeta and tau pathologies could delay or even stop neurodegeneration. Amylin, a pancreatic hormone co-secreted with insulin, is believed to play a role in the central regulation of satiation and was shown to form pancreatic amyloid in persons with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that amyloid-forming amylin secreted from the pancreas synergistically aggregates with vascular and parenchymal Abeta in the brain, in both sporadic and early-onset familial AD. Pancreatic expression of amyloid-forming human amylin in AD-model rats accelerates AD-like pathology, whereas genetically suppressed amylin secretion protects against AD effects. Thus, current data suggest a role of pancreatic amyloid-forming amylin in modifying AD; further research is required to test whether lowering circulating amylin levels early during AD pathogenesis may curb cognitive decline.
