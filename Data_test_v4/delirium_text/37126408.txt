37126408|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) into oligomers and amyloid fibrils is closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta40 and Abeta42, as two most prominent isoforms of Abeta peptides, can cross-interact with each other and form co-aggregates, which affect the progression of the disease. However, the molecular determinants underlying Abeta40 and Abeta42 cross-interaction and the structural details of their co-oligomers remain elusive. Herein, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on Abeta40-Abeta42 heterogeneous and Abeta40/Abeta42 homogeneous dimer systems to dissect the co-aggregation mechanisms of the two isoforms. Our results show that the interpeptide main-chain interaction of Abeta40-Abeta42 is stronger than that of Abeta40-Abeta40 and Abeta42-Abeta42. The positions of hotspot residues in heterodimers and homodimers display high similarity, implying similar molecular recognition sites for both cross-interaction and self-interaction. Contact maps of Abeta40-Abeta42 heterodimers reveal that residue pairs crucial for cross-interaction are mostly located in the C-terminal hydrophobic regions of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides. Conformational analysis shows that Abeta40 and Abeta42 monomers can co-assemble into beta-sheet-rich heterodimers with shorter beta-sheets than those in homodimers, which is decremental to monomer addition. Similar molecular recognition sites and beta-sheet distribution of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides are observed in heterodimers and homodimers, which may provide the molecular basis for the two isoforms' co-aggregation and cross-seeding. Our work dissects the co-aggregation mechanisms of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides at the atomic level, which will help for in-depth understanding of the cross-talk between the two Abeta isoforms and the pathogenesis of AD.
