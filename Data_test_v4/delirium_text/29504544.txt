29504544|t|Circular Inference in Dementia Diagnostics.
29504544|a|Referring to recent international articles stating that amyloid imaging or detection has a high additive value in making a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) when previous investigations are inconclusive, the authors of this editorial argue that this statement is based on circular reasoning and, hence, misleading. Since autopsy findings and other potential indicators fit poorly with amyloid PET, they conclude that this examination has no role in the diagnosis of AD.
