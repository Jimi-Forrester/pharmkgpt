37874087|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with complex disease etiology and pathological processes. These include formation of plaques and tangles, aberrant lipid processing, neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysregulation, ion channel and mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Disease-modifying therapies focusing on all these different facets are needed. TW001 is an oral formulation with the radical scavenger edaravone as its active ingredient, targeting oxidative stress. OBJECTIVES: This manuscript describes the trial design for Phase IIA Alzheimer Study Using oRal Edaravone (ASURE). METHODS: ASURE is a randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study aiming to evaluate safety and target engagement following administration of TW001 in early AD patients. Patients should have a biomarker confirmed diagnosis to be included in the trial and will be treated for 90 days. The primary endpoints include safety and effect of TW001 on oxidative stress biomarkers. Exploratory endpoints focus on a panel of AD(-related) fluid-based biomarkers and EEG. In addition, a recently developed cognitive functional composite (CFC) score will measure early signs of cognitive and functional effects of TW001. RESULTS: This article outlines the design of the clinical study, no results are included. CONCLUSIONS: The ASURE trial design is discussed, with a particular focus on fluid biomarkers, EEG, and CFC as endpoints. By testing multiple measures related to pathology, pharmacodynamics, EEG as proxy for cognition, and cognitive functional scores, it is expected that small changes will be detectable in trials of shorter duration. Moreover, the wide range of endpoints allows to make well-informed decisions for designing pivotal studies later.
