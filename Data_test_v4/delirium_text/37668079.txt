37668079|a|Loss of function in epigenetic acting genes together with driver alterations in the PIK3CA pathway have been shown significantly associated with poor outcome in cervical squamous cell cancer. More recently, a CoxBoost analysis identified 16 gene alterations and 30 high level activated proteins to be of high interest, due to their association with either good or bad outcome, in the context of treatment received by chemoradiation. The objectives here were to review and confirm the significance of these molecular alterations as suggested by literature reports and to pinpoint alternate treatments options for poor-responders to chemoradiation.
