28252543|t|Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Multiple Previous Episodes of Postanesthesia Care Unit Delirium: A Case Report.
28252543|a|We report the case of a 37-year-old female patient who required 22 surgeries following a pedestrian versus car accident. She was enrolled in a clinical study investigating emergence from anesthesia. In 10 of her 22 surgeries, we assessed her cognitive status in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) using the Confusion Assessment Method. We observed PACU delirium in all 4 cases in which the patient received sevoflurane, but only in 1 of 6 cases in which she received propofol. The patient showed EEG alpha-band activity similar to that of an elderly patient who may reflect a greater risk of PACU delirium.
