38846194|t|Capnocytophaga canimorsus Meningitis Complicated by Septic Shock: The Use of Extracorporeal Blood Purification Techniques.
38846194|a|Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a Gram-negative bacterium, commonly found as a commensal germ in the oral cavity of dogs and cats. It is an opportunistic pathogen, but, in specific situations, it can cause very severe diseases, including arthritis, pleuritis, endocarditis, sepsis, and, in extremely rare cases, meningoencephalitis. The predisposing situations include immunosuppression, liver cirrhosis, splenectomy, hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia), and alcohol abuse. In this report, we describe the case of a 48-year-old male patient, with a medical history of several predisposing conditions, who developed a severe case of meningoencephalitis caused by C. canimorsus, following a dog bite on his hand. The patient was successfully treated for his meningitis, but subsequently he developed a hospital-acquired septic shock from Acinetobacter baumannii, which was treated with targeted antibiotic therapy and sequential extracorporeal blood purification therapies using Oxiris  and Toraymyxin  hemofilters.
