24819306|t|Decrease of event-related delta oscillations in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder.
24819306|a|Decreased delta oscillation upon cognitive load is common in patients with Alzheimer s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia. However, there is no previous study analyzing the delta responses in euthymic medication-free patients with bipolar disorder. Participants comprised of 22 euthymic medication-free patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of bipolar disorder and 21 healthy controls who were matched to the patients for sex, age, and education. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded at 30 electrode sites using an application of an auditory oddball paradigm. The maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes for each subject s averaged delta response (0.5-3.5Hz) were measured. There was a significant inter-group difference in evoked and event-related delta (0.5-3.5Hz) responses. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the event-related delta oscillatory responses of the bipolar patient group were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group over the temporo-parietal and occipital electrode sites. Euthymic bipolar patients showed reduced event-related delta oscillatory responses in comparison to healthy subjects under cognitive load. The decrease of delta oscillations may be a common phenomenon that can be observed in different neuropsychiatric disorders with cognitive dysfunction.
