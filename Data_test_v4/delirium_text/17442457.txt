17442457|t|No association of dynamin binding protein (DNMBP) gene SNPs and Alzheimer's disease.
17442457|a|A recent scan of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 10q found significant association of six correlated SNPs with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) among Japanese. We examined the SNP with the highest statistical significance (rs3740058) in a large Caucasian American case-control cohort and the remaining five SNPs in a smaller subset of cases and controls. We observed no association of statistical significance in either the total sample or the APOE*4 non-carriers for any of the SNPs.
