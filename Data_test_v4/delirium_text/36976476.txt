36976476|a|This study evaluates the range of neurological manifestation in children with COVID-19 (neuro-COVID-19) both with and without the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) and the persistence of symptoms after hospital discharge. The study was conducted as a prospective study of children and adolescents under 18 years of age who were admitted to a children's hospital for infectious diseases from January 2021 to January 2022. The children had no previous neurological or psychiatric disorders. Out of the 3021 patients evaluated, 232 were confirmed to have COVID-19 and 21 of these patients (9%) showed neurological manifestations associated with the virus. Of these 21 patients, 14 developed MIS-C, and 7 had neurological manifestations unrelated to MIS-C. There was no statistical difference regarding the neurological manifestations during hospitalization and outcomes between patients with neuro-COVID-19 who had or did not have MIS-C, except for seizures that occurred more frequently in patients with neuro-COVID-19 without MIS-C (p-value = 0.0263). One patient died, and 5 patients still had neurological or psychiatric manifestations at discharge, which persisted for up to 7 months. The study highlights that SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect the central and peripheral nervous system, particularly in children and adolescents with MIS-C, and that it is crucial to be vigilant for long-term adverse outcomes, as the neurological and psychiatric effects of COVID-19 in children are emerging during an important stage of brain development.
