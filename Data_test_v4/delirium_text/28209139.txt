28209139|t|Stroke caused by an inflammatory thrombus: a case report.
28209139|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Several definite risk factors have been identified for stroke, although infectious factors might also contribute to stroke episodes through increased susceptibility or direct induction. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Chinese male initially presented with fever, headache, and impaired memory and developed disturbance of consciousness after admission. A clinical diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, massive cerebral infarction and haemorrhagic transformation (left internal carotid arterial system, inflammatory thrombus) were made based on brain radiography, blood culture and postoperative pathological examinations. These symptoms improved following antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and conventional treatments for stroke. CONCLUSION: For stroke patients without traditional cerebrovascular risk factors but with signs of infection, infectious causes should be considered.
