38984342|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults are at high risk of femoral neck fractures (FNFs). Elderly patients face and adapt to significant psychological burdens, resulting in different degrees of psychological stress response. Total hip replacement is the preferred treatment for FNF in elderly patients; however, some patients have poor postoperative prognoses, and the underlying mechanism is unknown. We speculated that the postoperative prognosis of elderly patients with FNF may be related to preoperative psychological stress. AIM: To explore the relationship between preoperative psychological stress and the short-term prognosis of elderly patients with FNF. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the baseline data, preoperative 90-item Symptom Checklist score, and Harris score within 6 months of surgery of 120 elderly patients with FNF who underwent total hip arthroplasty were collected. We analyzed the indicators of poor short-term postoperative prognosis and the ability of the indicators to predict poor prognosis and compared the correlation between the indicators and the Harris score. RESULTS: Anxiety, depression, garden classification of FNF, cause of fracture, FNF reduction quality, and length of hospital stay were independent influencing factors for poor short-term postoperative prognoses in elderly patients with FNF (P < 0.05). The areas under the curve for anxiety, depression, and length of hospital stay were 0.742, 0.854, and 0.749, respectively. The sensitivities of anxiety, depression, garden classification of FNF, and prediction of the cause of fracture were 0.857, 0.786, 0.821, and 0.821, respectively. The specificities of depression, FNF quality reduction, and length of hospital stay were the highest at 0.880, 0.783, and 0.761, respectively. Anxiety, depression, and somatization scores correlated moderately with Harris scores (r = -0.523, -0.625, and -0.554; all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative anxiety, depression, and somatization are correlated with poor short-term prognosis in elderly patients with FNF and warrant consideration.
