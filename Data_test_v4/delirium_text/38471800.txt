38471800|t|An Autopsy-proven Case-based Review of Autoimmune Encephalitis.
38471800|a|Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a type of immunoreactive encephalitic disorder and is recognized as the most prevalent noninfectious encephalitis. Nevertheless, the rarity of definitive AIE diagnosis through biopsy or autopsy represents a significant hurdle to understanding and managing the disease. In this article, we present the pathological findings of AIE and review the literature based on a distinct case of AIE presenting as CD8+ T-lymphocyte predominant encephalitis. We describe the clinical progression, diagnostic imaging, laboratory data, and autopsy findings of an 80-year-old deceased male patient. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 6 months before death and received appropriate medications. A week before admission to the hospital, the patient manifested symptoms such as a tendency to sleep, decreased appetite, and confusion. Although the patient temporally improved with medication including correction of hyponatremia, the patient progressed rapidly and died in 6 weeks. The brain tissue revealed lymphocytic infiltration in the gray and white matter, leptomeninges, and perivascular infiltration with a predominance of CD8+ T lymphocytes, suggesting a case of AIE. There was no detectable evidence of viral infection or underlying neoplasm. The autopsy revealed that this patient also had Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and aging-related tau astrogliopathy. This report emphasizes the pivotal role of pathological examination in the diagnosis of AIE, especially when serological autoantibody testing is not available or when a patient is suspected of having multiple diseases.
