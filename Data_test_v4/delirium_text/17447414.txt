17447414|a|Oxidative stress has been associated with damage and progressive cell death that occurs in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant capacity in postmortem motor cortex (MC), nucleus caudatus (NC), gyrus temporalis (GT) and substantia nigra (SN) from controls (C) and patients with PD and AD. The initial samples consisted of 68 subjects of PD, AD and C. Brains were matched for age, sex and postmortem time. Brain tissue was homogenized in a phosphate buffer pH 7.3 and separated with two-step centrifugation at 15,000rpm for 30 min and 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 degrees C. Antioxidant capacity in the supernatants was measured using the oxygen radical absorbance assay (ORAC). The results showed that in the SN of parkinsonian's brain the balance between production of free radicals and the neutralization by a complex antioxidant system is disturbed. No changes in the antioxidant capacity of postmortem MC and NC of parkinsonian's brain in comparison with C were found. In the SN of parkinsonian's brain, antioxidant capacity seems to be lower in comparison with C (p < 0.05). Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radical showed that MC of AD patients was lower than in the MC of C (p < 0.005). In NC of AD patients the antioxidant capacity against hydroxyl radical was increased in comparison with C (p < 0.04). No changes in the antioxidant capacity were found in brain tissues of AD in comparison with C, when CuSO4 was used as a free radical generator.
