35021178|t|Identification of Serum Biomarkers in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease by 2D-DIGE Proteomics.
35021178|a|AIM: The aim of this study is to identify potential serum biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) for early diagnosis and to evaluate these markers on a large cohort. METHODS: We performed two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis to compare the serum of AD patients and normal controls. Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to identify the expression levels of proteins. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 13 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, 2 proteins (inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 [ITI-H4], Apolipoprotein A-IV) were validated by Western blot and 4 proteins (Cofilin 2, Tetranectin, Zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein [AZGP1], Alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor [AMBP]) were validated by ELISA, respectively. Western blot results showed that the full size of the ITI-H4 protein was increased, while a fragment of ITI-H4 was decreased in AD patients. In contrast, 1 fragment of Apo A-IV was mainly found in control group and rare to be detected in AD patients. On the other hand, ELISA results showed that Cofilin 2, Tetranectin, AZGP1, and AMBP were significantly increased in AD patients, and Cofilin 2 is strongly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores of the AD patients. Serum Cofilin 2 was unchanged in Parkinson disease patients as compared to the control group, indicating a specific correlation of serum Cofilin 2 with AD. Moreover, Cofilin 2 was increased in both the serum and brain tissue in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice. CONCLUSION: Our study identified several potential serum biomarkers of AD, including: ITI-H4, ApoA-IV, Cofilin 2, Tetranectin, AZGP1, and AMBP. Cofilin 2 was upregulated in different AD animal models and might play important roles in AD pathology.
