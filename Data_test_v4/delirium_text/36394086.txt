36394086|a|BACKGROUND: Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is an important complication of severe influenza with high morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in tertiary hospitals in Switzerland during 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 influenza seasons. All adults with PCR-confirmed influenza infection and treatment on intensive-care unit (ICU) for >24 h were included. IAPA was diagnosed according to previously published clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria. We assessed risk factors for IAPA and predictors for poor outcome, which was a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay >=7 days, mechanical ventilation >=7 days, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight patients (median age 64 years, 45% females) with influenza were included, of which 17 (10.8%) had IAPA. Asthma was more common in IAPA patients (17% vs. 4% in non-IAPA, P = 0.05). Asthma (OR 12.0 [95% CI 2.1-67.2]) and days of mechanical ventilation (OR 1.1 [1.1-1.2]) were associated with IAPA. IAPA patients frequently required organ supportive therapies including mechanical ventilation (88% in IAPA vs. 53% in non-IAPA, P = 0.001) and vasoactive support (75% vs. 45%, P = 0.03) and had more complications including ARDS (53% vs. 26%, P = 0.04), respiratory bacterial infections (65% vs. 37%, P = 0.04), and higher ICU-mortality (35% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.05). IAPA (OR 28.8 [3.3-253.4]), influenza A (OR 3.3 [1.4-7.8]), and higher SAPS II score (OR 1.07 [1.05-1.10]) were independent predictors of poor outcome. INTERPRETATION: High clinical suspicion, early diagnostics, and therapy are indicated in IAPA because of high morbidity and mortality. Asthma is likely an underappreciated risk factor for IAPA.
