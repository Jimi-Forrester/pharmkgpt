6129808|t|Overview: cerebrovascular accident and the hospitalized elderly--a multidimensional clinical problem.
6129808|a|A cerebrovascular accident is unwelcome at any age, but for the elderly it involves concerns. The abrupt onset of a cerebrovascular accident signals anew the already present fears of loss of control, death, insanity, disfigurement, loss of physical function, and sexual impairment. The accident can also result in worry about the possibility of explosive recurrence, disruption of thoughts and emotions, lengthy treatment away from home, and exhaustion of retirement funds. Therapeutic endeavors must be eclectic and individually tailored to address the special needs of the elderly patient, the highly technical and diverse health care team, the worried family, and the depression, delirium, and subtle clinical syndromes manifesting as poor patient motivation that often accompany a cerebrovascular accident.
