31793421|t|Active Targeting Towards and Inside the Brain based on Nanoparticles: A Review.
31793421|a|BACKGROUND: Treatment of neurological diseases using systemic and non-surgical techniques presents a significant challenge in medicine. This challenge is chiefly associated with the condensation and coherence of the brain tissue. METHODS: The coherence structure of the brain is due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which consists of a continuous layer of capillary endothelial cells. The BBB prevents most drugs from entering the brain tissue and is highly selective, permitting only metabolic substances and nutrients to pass through. RESULTS: Although this challenge has caused difficulties for the treatment of neurological diseases, it has opened up a broad research area in the field of drug delivery. Through the utilization of nanoparticles (NPs), nanotechnology can provide the ideal condition for passing through the BBB. CONCLUSION: NPs with suitable dimensions and optimum hydrophobicity and charge, as well as appropriate functionalization, can accumulate in the brain. Furthermore, NPs can facilitate the targeted delivery of therapeutics into the brain areas involved in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, glioma, migraine, and other neurological disorders. This review describes these methods of actively targeting specific areas of the brain.
