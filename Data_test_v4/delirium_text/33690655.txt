The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of PHH and neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants undergoing neurosurgical treatment for PHH. STUDY DESIGN: Preterm infants with PHH were enrolled across the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network. CSF samples were collected at the time of temporizing neurosurgical procedure (n = 98). Amyloid precursor protein (APP), L1CAM, NCAM-1, and total protein (TP) were compared in PHH versus control CSF. Fifty-four of these PHH subjects underwent Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III (Bayley-III) testing at 15-30 months corrected age. Controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) and adjusting for post-menstrual age (PMA) and IVH grade, Pearson's partial correlation coefficients were used to examine relationships between CSF proteins and Bayley-III composite cognitive, language, and motor scores. RESULTS: CSF APP, L1CAM, NCAM-1, and TP were elevated in PHH over control at temporizing surgery. CSF NCAM-1 was associated with Bayley-III motor score (R = -0.422, p = 0.007, FDR Q = 0.089), with modest relationships noted with cognition (R = -0.335, p = 0.030, FDR Q = 0.182) and language (R = -0.314, p = 0.048, FDR Q = 0.194) scores. No relationships were observed between CSF APP, L1CAM, or TP and Bayley-III scores. FOHR at the time of temporization did not correlate with Bayley-III scores, though trends were observed with Bayley-III motor (p = 0.0647 and R = -0.2912) and cognitive scores (p = 0.0506 and R = -0.2966). CONCLUSION: CSF NCAM-1 was associated with neurodevelopment in this multi-institutional PHH cohort. This is the first report relating a specific CSF protein, NCAM-1, to neurodevelopment in PHH. Future work will further investigate a possible role for NCAM-1 as a biomarker of PHH-associated neurological disability.
