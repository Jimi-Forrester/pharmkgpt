32397687|t|Isoprostanoids Levels in Cerebrospinal Fluid Do Not Reflect Alzheimer's Disease.
32397687|a|Previous studies showed a relationship between lipid oxidation biomarkers from plasma samples and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), constituting a promising diagnostic tool. In this work we analyzed whether these plasma biomarkers could reflect specific brain oxidation in AD. In this work lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD and non-AD (including other neurological pathologies) participants, by means of an analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis evaluated correlations between biological matrices. The results did not show satisfactory correlations between plasma and CSF samples for any of the studied lipid peroxidation biomarkers (isoprostanes, neuroprostanes, prostaglandines, dihomo-isoprostanes). However, some of the analytes showed correlations with specific CSF biomarkers for AD and with neuropsychological tests (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)). In conclusion, lipid peroxidation biomarkers in CSF samples do not reflect their levels in plasma samples, and no significant differences were observed between participant groups. However, some of the analytes could be useful as cognitive decline biomarkers.
