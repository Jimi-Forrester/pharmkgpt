23868536|t|Heme prevents amyloid beta peptide aggregation through hydrophobic interaction based on molecular dynamics simulation.
23868536|a|Heme, which is abundant in hemoglobin and many other hemoproteins, is known to play an important role in electron transfer, oxygen transport, regulation of gene expression, and many other biological functions. With the belief that the aggregation of Abeta peptides forming higher order oligomers is one of the central pathological pathways in Alzheimer's disease, the formation of the Abeta-heme complex is essential as it inhibits Abeta aggregation and protects the neurons from degradation. In our studies, conventional molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the 1 Abeta + 1 heme and 2 Abeta + 4 hemes system, respectively, with the identification of several dominant binding motifs. We found that hydrophobic residues of the Abeta peptide have a high affinity to interact with heme instead of the histidine residue. We conclude that hydrophobic interaction plays a dominant role in the Abeta-heme complex formation which indirectly serves to physically prevent Abeta aggregation.
