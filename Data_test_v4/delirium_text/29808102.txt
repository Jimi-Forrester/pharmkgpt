29808102|t|The Function of Ophiocordyceps sinensis in Airway Epithelial Cell Senescence in a Rat COPD Model.
29808102|a|Ophiocordyceps sinensis (O. sinensis) seems to be able to alleviate airway epithelial cell senescence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of O. sinensis on airway epithelial senescence in the COPD model both in vitro and in vivo. We observed the expression of P16 and P21 in the airway epithelia of 30 patients with COPD. The optimal concentration of O. sinensis and exposure time of the cigarette smoke extract (CSE) were determined in vitro, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were used to evaluate the senescence and proliferation of human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells pretreated with O. sinensis by staining kits. COPD model rats were treated with O. sinensis at various concentrations to determine the changes in P16 and P21 expression in airway epithelial tissues. It was found that the expression levels of P16 and P21 were higher in the airway epithelia of COPD patients than those in the control group based on immunohistochemical staining, real-time quantitative PCR, and western blotting. The CSE could induce 16HBE cell senescence, and O. sinensis could alleviate CSE-induced senescence and promote the proliferation of 16HBE cells. The expression levels of P16 and P21 were also higher in the airway epithelia of COPD model rats; however, the levels of P16 and P21 in the groups treated with all concentrations of O. sinensis were obviously lower than those in the COPD model group based on real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting. In conclusion, the CSE can induce airway epithelium senescence, and O. sinensis can inhibit CSE-induced cellular senescence, both in vitro and in vivo.
