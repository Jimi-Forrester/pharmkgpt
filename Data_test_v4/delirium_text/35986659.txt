35986659|t|Sleep disruption and delirium in critically ill children: Study protocol feasibility.
35986659|a|Delirium is a serious complication of pediatric critical illness. Sleep disruption is frequently observed in children with delirium, and circadian rhythm dysregulation is one proposed cause of delirium. Children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) experience multiple environmental exposures with the potential to disrupt sleep. Although researchers have measured PICU light and sound exposure, sleep, and delirium, these variables have not yet been fully explored in a single study. Furthermore, caregiving patterns have not often been included as a component of the PICU environment. Measuring the light and sound exposure, caregiving patterns, and sleep of critically ill children requires continuous PICU bedside data collection. This presents multiple methodological challenges. In this paper, we describe the protocol for an observational pilot study of the PICU environment, sleep, and delirium experienced by a sample of 10 critically ill children 1-4 years of age. We also evaluate and discuss the feasibility (i.e., acceptability, implementation, practicality) of the study protocol. Light and sound exposure were measured with bedside sensors. Caregiving was quantified through video recording. Sleep was measured via actigraphy and confirmed by video recording. Delirium screening with the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium was conducted twice daily, either in person or via video review. This study provides a refined measurement framework to inform future, large-scale studies and the development of nurse-driven sleep promotion interventions.
