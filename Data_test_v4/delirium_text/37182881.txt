37182881|t|Extracellular Tau Oligomers Damage the Axon Initial Segment.
37182881|a|BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, neuronal polarity and synaptic connectivity are compromised. A key structure for regulating polarity and functions of neurons is the axon initial segment (AIS), which segregates somatodendritic from axonal proteins and initiates action potentials. Toxic tau species, including extracellular oligomers (xcTauOs), spread tau pathology from neuron to neuron by a prion-like process, but few other cell biological effects of xcTauOs have been described. OBJECTIVE: Test the hypothesis that AIS structure is sensitive to xcTauOs. METHODS: Cultured wild type (WT) and tau knockout (KO) mouse cortical neurons were exposed to xcTauOs, and quantitative western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-TRIM46 monitored effects on the AIS. The same methods were used to compare TRIM46 and two other resident AIS proteins in human hippocampal tissue obtained from AD and age-matched non-AD donors. RESULTS: Without affecting total TRIM46 levels, xcTauOs reduce the concentration of TRIM46 within the AIS and cause AIS shortening in cultured WT, but not TKO neurons. Lentiviral-driven tau expression in tau KO neurons rescues AIS length sensitivity to xcTauOs. In human AD hippocampus, the overall protein levels of multiple resident AIS proteins are unchanged compared to non-AD brain, but TRIM46 concentration within the AIS and AIS length are reduced in neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles. CONCLUSION: xcTauOs cause partial AIS damage in cultured neurons by a mechanism dependent on intracellular tau, thereby raising the possibility that the observed AIS reduction in AD neurons in vivo is caused by xcTauOs working in concert with endogenous neuronal tau.
