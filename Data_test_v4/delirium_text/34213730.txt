34213730|t|Mesenchymal stem cell therapies for Alzheimer's disease: preclinical studies.
34213730|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory failure, cognitive impairment, as well as behavioral and psychological manifestations. Drugs can only moderately manage, but not alleviate, clinical symptoms. Results, based on animal models, have demonstrated that cell therapy is a promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders. The homing effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) replaces damaged cells, while some scholars believe that the paracrine effects play a crucial role in treating diseases. In fact, these cells have rich sources, exhibit high proliferation rates, low tumorigenicity, and immunogenicity, and have no ethical concerns. Consequently, MSCs have been used across various disease aspects, such as regulating immunity, nourishing nerves, and promoting regeneration. Deterioration of public health status have exposed both Alzheimer's patients and researchers to various difficulties during epidemics. In this review, we discuss the advances and challenges in the application of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
