35844216|t|Neurovascular Dysfunction in Diverse Communities With Health Disparities-Contributions to Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.
35844216|a|Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are an expanding worldwide crisis. In the absence of scientific breakthroughs, the global prevalence of ADRD will continue to increase as more people are living longer. Racial or ethnic minority groups have an increased risk and incidence of ADRD and have often been neglected by the scientific research community. There is mounting evidence that vascular insults in the brain can initiate a series of biological events leading to neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and ADRD. We are a group of researchers interested in developing and expanding ADRD research, with an emphasis on vascular contributions to dementia, to serve our local diverse community. Toward this goal, the primary objective of this review was to investigate and better understand health disparities in Alabama and the contributions of the social determinants of health to those disparities, particularly in the context of vascular dysfunction in ADRD. Here, we explain the neurovascular dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors contributing to dysfunction of the neurovascular unit (NVU). Next, we ascertain ethnoregional health disparities of individuals living in Alabama, as well as relevant vascular risk factors linked to AD. We also discuss current pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment options for neurovascular dysfunction, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, including relevant studies and ongoing clinical trials. Overall, individuals in Alabama are adversely affected by social and structural determinants of health leading to health disparities, driven by rurality, ethnic minority status, and lower socioeconomic status (SES). In general, these communities have limited access to healthcare and healthy food and other amenities resulting in decreased opportunities for early diagnosis of and pharmaceutical treatments for ADRD. Although this review is focused on the current state of health disparities of ADRD patients in Alabama, future studies must include diversity of race, ethnicity, and region to best be able to treat all individuals affected by ADRD.
