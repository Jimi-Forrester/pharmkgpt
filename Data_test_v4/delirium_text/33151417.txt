33151417|t|A Systematic Review of Postoperative Delirium in the Urologic Patient.
33151417|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common phenomenon among general surgery patients, but it is not well described in urologic surgical patients. We sought to define the incidence and predictive risk factors for POD in patients undergoing urologic surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: Eighteen articles were included for review. The pooled incidence rate of postoperative delirium after urologic surgery was 1.69% (0.69-46.97%). Longer intraoperative time, male sex, unmarried status, and age were shown to be risk factors for POD. POD is common after many urologic surgeries and leads to worse postoperative outcomes and higher healthcare utilization. Future studies are needed to better assess for and prevent POD.
