11957740|t|[Diagnosis and treatment of delirium].
11957740|a|Delirium is a common psychiatric complication in somatically ill in-patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer lengths of stay and higher cost of treatment. It remains often unrecognized and thus inadequately treated. The main risk factors, differential diagnosis, primary and secondary prevention, non-pharmacological interventions and pharmacological treatment are discussed. For the treatment of the non alcohol associated delirium, haloperidol remains the treatment of choice, whereas for the treatment of delirium related to alcohol withdrawal benzodiazepines and clomethiazole are recommended. Other treatment strategies, especially the use of newer atypical antipsychotic medications are outlined.
