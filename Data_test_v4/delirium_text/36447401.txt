36447401|a|OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the impact of head computed tomography (CT) on clinical decision-making about older adults with acute altered mental status (AMS) in the emergency department in terms of CT's diagnostic yield, emergency department length of stay, and changes in medical strategy. It also attempted to find predictors of an acute imaging abnormality. METHODS: This was a 1-year, retrospective, single-center observational study of patients aged >=75 years who underwent noncontrast head CT because of an isolated episode of AMS. The acute positive CT findings were ischemic strokes, hemorrhages, tumors, demyelinating lesions, hydrocephalus, and intracranial infections. RESULTS: A total of 594 CTs were performed, of which 38 (6.4%) were positive. The main etiology of AMS was sepsis (29.1%). Changes in medical strategy were more common in patients with a positive CT, and the major changes were ordering additional neuro exams (odds ratio [OR], 95.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 38.4-233.8; P<0.001), adjusting treatments (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 5.0-29.5; P<0.001), and referral to a neurologic unit (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 3.0-17.5; P<0.01). Three factors were significantly associated with a positive outcome: Glasgow Coma Scale <13 (OR, 8.5; 95% CI, 2.3-28.9; P<0.001), head wound (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.2; P=0.025), and dehydration (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4; P=0.021). For elderly patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale >=13 and no head wound or clinical dehydration, the probability of a positive CT was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.04). Considering only those patients, the diagnostic yield fell to 1.7%. CONCLUSION: In elderly patients, the causes of AMS are primarily extracerebral. Randomized clinical trials are needed to validate a clinical pathway for selecting patients who require emergent neuroimaging.
