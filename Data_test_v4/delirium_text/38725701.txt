38725701|a|The precise identification of Alzheimer's disease and other prevalent neurodegenerative diseases remains a difficult issue that requires the development of early detection of the disease and inexpensive biomarkers that can replace the present cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers. Blood biomarkers, such as amyloid and neurofilament light, have been emphasized as an important and practical tool in a testing or examination procedure thanks to advancements in ultra-sensitive detection techniques. Although saliva is not currently being researched for neurodegenerative diseases, it is an important source of biomarkers that can be used for the identification of diseases and has some advantages over other biofluids. While this may be true for most people, getting saliva from elderly people presents some significant challenges. In this overview, we will first discuss how saliva is created and how aging-related illnesses may affect the amount and kind of saliva produced. The findings support the use of salivary amyloid protein, tau species, and novel biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
