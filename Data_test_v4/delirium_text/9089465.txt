9089465|t|The natural history of dementia in ageing people with intellectual disability.
9089465|a|In a retrospective follow-up study over 11 years, the incidence and natural history of dementia was assessed in an institutionalized group of 144 people, aged 60 years and over, with mild to profound intellectual disability resulting from causes other than Down's syndrome. Age-related incidences, age at onset, duration and symptoms of dementia were comparable to those in the general population. The frequent and invalidating physical comorbidity (11/11) hampered the diagnostic process in this group. The high prevalence of episodes of delirium (9/11) and depressive symptoms (8/11) as the first manifestations of dementia and/or during dementia might reflect increased vulnerability as compared to other ageing people.
