31072062|a|Background: Asthma may be considered as a non-communicable condition associated with higher bronchial responsiveness that may impair quality of life (QoL). Purpose: The research aim was to compare scores of depression, as well as general and foot health-related QoL, in patients who suffered from asthma with respect to healthy subjects. Methods: A total sample of 152 subjects, median age of 37.00 +- 16.00 years, were recruited from a respiratory and allergy department of a hospital and divided into patients with asthma (n = 76) and healthy subjects (n = 76). The scores of the Spanish foot health status questionnaire (SFHSQ) domains as well as the Spanish Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and categories were collected. Results: The only statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was shown for the difference of the FHSQ footwear domain establishing that patients who suffered from asthma presented a worse QoL related to foot health for footwear (lower FHSQ scores) compared to healthy matched-paired participants (higher FHSQ scores). Regarding the rest of the outcome measurements, there were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) for the other FHSQ domains scores as well as the BDI scores and categories. Conclusions: Patients with allergic asthma presented impairment of the QoL related to foot health for footwear, which seemed to be linked to the presence of asthma.
