39345364|t|TRPC3 suppression ameliorates synaptic dysfunctions and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
39345364|a|Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in the brain; however, their precise roles in neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain elusive. Bioinformatic analysis of the published single-cell RNA-seq data collected from AD patient cohorts indicates that the Trpc3 gene is uniquely upregulated in excitatory neurons. TRPC3 expression is also upregulated in post-mortem AD brains, and in both acute and chronic mouse models of AD. Functional screening of TRPC3 antagonists resulted in a lead inhibitor JW-65, which completely rescued Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, impaired synaptic plasticity (e.g., LTP), and learning memory in acute and chronic experimental AD models. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we found that treatment with soluble beta-amyloid oligomers (AbetaOs) induces rapid and sustained upregulation of the TRPC3 expression selectively in excitatory neurons. This aberrantly upregulated TRPC3 contributes to AbetaOs-induced Ca 2+ overload through the calcium entry and store-release mechanisms. The neuroprotective action of JW-65 is primarily mediated via restoring AbetaOs-impaired Ca 2+ /calmodulin-mediated signaling pathways, including calmodulin kinases CaMKII/IV and calcineurin (CaN). The synaptic protective mechanism via TRPC3 inhibition was further supported by hippocampal RNA-seq data from the symptomatic 5xFAD mice after chronic treatment with JW-65. Overall, these findings not only validate TRPC3 as a novel therapeutic target for treating synaptic dysfunction of AD but most importantly, disclose a distinct role of upregulated TRPC3 in AD pathogenesis in mediating Ca 2+ dyshomeostasis.
