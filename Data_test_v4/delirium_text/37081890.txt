37081890|t|The regulation of self-tolerance and the role of inflammasome molecules.
37081890|a|Inflammasome molecules make up a family of receptors that typically function to initiate a proinflammatory response upon infection by microbial pathogens. Dysregulation of inflammasome activity has been linked to unwanted chronic inflammation, which has also been implicated in certain autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and related animal models. Classical inflammasome activation-dependent events have intrinsic and extrinsic effects on both innate and adaptive immune effectors, as well as resident cells in the target tissue, which all can contribute to an autoimmune response. Recently, inflammasome molecules have also been found to regulate the differentiation and function of immune effector cells independent of classical inflammasome-activated inflammation. These alternative functions for inflammasome molecules shape the nature of the adaptive immune response, that in turn can either promote or suppress the progression of autoimmunity. In this review we will summarize the roles of inflammasome molecules in regulating self-tolerance and the development of autoimmunity.
