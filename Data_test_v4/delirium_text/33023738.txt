33023738|t|COVID-19-related intracranial imaging findings: a large single-centre experience.
33023738|a|AIM: To describe the neuroradiological changes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 3,403 patients who were confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020, and who underwent neuroimaging. Abnormal brain imaging was evaluated in detail and various imaging patterns on magnetic resonance imaging MRI were identified. RESULTS: Of the 3,403 patients with COVID-19, 167 (4.9%) had neurological signs or symptoms warranting neuroimaging. The most common indications were delirium (44/167, 26%), focal neurology (37/167, 22%), and altered consciousness (34/167, 20%). Neuroimaging showed abnormalities in 23% of patients, with MRI being abnormal in 20 patients and computed tomography (CT) in 18 patients. The most consistent neuroradiological finding was microhaemorrhage with a predilection for the splenium of the corpus callosum (12/20, 60%) followed by acute or subacute infarct (5/20, 25%), watershed white matter hyperintensities (4/20, 20%), and susceptibility changes on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in the superficial veins (3/20, 15%), acute haemorrhagic necrotising encephalopathy (2/20, 10%), large parenchymal haemorrhage (2/20, 10%), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1/20, 5%), hypoxic-ischaemic changes (1/20, 5%), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like changes (1/20, 5%). CONCLUSION: Various imaging patterns on MRI were observed including acute haemorrhagic necrotising encephalopathy, white matter hyperintensities, hypoxic-ischaemic changes, ADEM-like changes, and stroke. Microhaemorrhages were the most common findings. Prolonged hypoxaemia, consumption coagulopathy, and endothelial disruption are the likely pathological drivers and reflect disease severity in this patient cohort.
