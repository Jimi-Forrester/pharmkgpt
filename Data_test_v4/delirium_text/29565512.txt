29565512|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of melatonin on acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning (AOPP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized control trial, a total of 59 AOPP patients with subsequent delirium were randomly divided into two groups, the melatonin group (n=29) and the placebo-controlled group (n=30). Patients in the melatonin group (n=29) underwent oral administration of melatonin in addition to the symptomatic treatment, while those in the placebo-controlled group took a placebo in addition to the symptomatic treatment. Before and 12 weeks after treatment, adverse events of participants in both groups were classified according to their scores in the assessment of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-SI) scale, and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). RESULTS: The excellence rates of patients in the melatonin group and the placebo-controlled group were 82.75% and 30.00%, respectively (chi2 = 17.054, p < 0 .01). No adverse events were identified in all participants. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin may serve as an effective drug in the treatment of AOPP-induced deliration.
