33673244|t|A Toxic Synergy between Aluminium and Amyloid Beta in Yeast.
33673244|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent, age-related, neurodegenerative disease, is associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and oxidative stress. However, the sporadic nature of late-onset AD has suggested that other factors, such as aluminium may be involved. Aluminium (Al3+) is the most ubiquitous neurotoxic metal on earth, extensively bioavailable to humans. Despite this, the link between Al3+ and AD has been debated for decades and remains controversial. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism expressing Abeta42, this study aimed to examine the mechanisms of Al3+ toxicity and its interactions with Abeta42. S. cerevisiae cells producing Abeta42 treated with varying concentrations of Al3+ were examined for cell viability, growth inhibition, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Al3+ caused a significant reduction in cell viability: cell death in yeast producing green fluorescent protein tagged with Abeta42 (GFP-Abeta42) was significantly higher than in cells producing green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone. Additionally, Al3+ greatly inhibited the fermentative growth of yeast producing GFP-Abeta42, which was enhanced by ferric iron (Fe3+), while there was negligible growth inhibition of GFP cells. Al3+- induced ROS levels in yeast expressing native Abeta42 were significantly higher than in empty vector controls. These findings demonstrate Al3+ has a direct, detrimental toxic synergy with Abeta42 that can be influenced by Fe3+, causing increased oxidative stress. Thus, Al3+ should be considered as an important factor, alongside the known characteristic hallmarks of AD, in the development and aetiology of the disease.
