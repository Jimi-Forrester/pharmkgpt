27496825|t|Immediate ICU Care for Patients Following Aortic Arch Surgery.
27496825|a|Patients undergoing aortic arch surgery are at high risk for stroke, delirium, low cardiac output, respiratory failure, renal failure, and coagulopathy. A significantly higher mortality is seen in patients experiencing any of these complications when compared with those without complications. As surgical, perfusion, and anesthetic techniques improve, the incidence of major complications have decreased. A recent paradigm shift in cardiac surgery has focused on rapid postoperative recovery, and a similar change has affected the care of patients after arch surgery. Nevertheless, a small subset of patients experience significant morbidity and mortality after aortic arch surgery, and rapid identification of any organ dysfunction and appropriate supportive care is critical in these patients. In this article, the current state of postoperative care of the patient after open aortic arch surgery will be reviewed.
