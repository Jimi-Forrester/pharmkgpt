31811072|a|BACKGROUND: In vitro conversion assays, including real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) techniques, were first developed to study the conversion process of the prion protein to its misfolded, disease-associated conformation. The intrinsic property of prion proteins to propagate their misfolded structure was later exploited to detect subfemtogram quantities of the misfolded protein present in tissues and fluids from humans and animals with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Currently, conversion assays are used clinically as sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for antemortem diagnosis of prion disease. CONTENT: In vitro conversion assays are now being applied to the development of diagnostics for related neurodegenerative diseases, including detection of misfolded alpha-synuclein in Parkinson disease, misfolded amyloid-beta in Alzheimer disease, and misfolded tau in Pick disease. Like the predicate prion protein in vitro conversion diagnostics, these assays exploit the ability of endogenously misfolded proteins to induce misfolding and aggregation of their natively folded counterpart in vitro. This property enables biomarker detection of the underlying protein pathology. Herein, we review RT-QuIC and PMCA for (a) prion-, (b) alpha-synuclein-, (c) amyloid-beta-, and (d) tau-opathies. SUMMARY: Although already in routine clinical use for the detection of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, in vitro conversion assays for other neurodegenerative disorders require further development and evaluation of diagnostic performance before consideration for clinical implementation.
