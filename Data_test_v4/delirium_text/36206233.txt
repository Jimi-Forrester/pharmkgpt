36206233|t|Frailty independently predicts unfavorable discharge in non-operative traumatic brain injury: A retrospective single-institution cohort study.
36206233|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with adverse outcomes in traumatically injured geriatric patients but has not been well-studied in geriatric Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). OBJECTIVE: To assess relationships between frailty and outcomes after TBI. METHODS: The records of all patients aged 70 or older admitted from home to the neurosurgical service of a single institution for non-operative TBI between January 2020 and July 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was adverse discharge disposition (either in-hospital expiration or discharge to skilled nursing facility (SNF), hospice, or home with hospice). Secondary outcomes included major inpatient complication, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. RESULTS: 100 patients were included, 90% of whom presented with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 14-15. The mean length of stay was 3.78 days. 7% had an in-hospital complication, and 44% had an unfavorable discharge destination. 49% of patients attended follow-up within 3 months. The rate of readmission within 30 days was 13%. Patients were characterized as low frailty (FRAIL score 0-1, n = 35, 35%) or high frailty (FRAIL score 2-5, n = 65, 65%). In multivariate analysis controlling for age and other factors, frailty category (aOR 2.63, 95CI [1.02, 7.14], p = 0.005) was significantly associated with unfavorable discharge. Frailty was not associated with increased readmission rate, LOS, or rate of complications on uncontrolled univariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with increased odds of unfavorable discharge disposition for geriatric patients admitted with TBI.
