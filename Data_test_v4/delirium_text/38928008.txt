38928008|a|Mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism provides carbon units to several pathways, including nucleic acid synthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and methylation reactions. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, characterised by impaired energy metabolism, and is potentially linked to mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here, we discuss the intersection between the molecular pathways linked to both mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism and Alzheimer's disease. We propose that enhancing one-carbon metabolism could promote the metabolic processes that help brain cells cope with Alzheimer's disease-related injuries. We also highlight potential therapeutic avenues to leverage one-carbon metabolism to delay Alzheimer's disease pathology.
