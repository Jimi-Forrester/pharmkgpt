36002132|t|Epigenetic perspectives of COVID-19: Virus infection to disease progression and therapeutic control.
36002132|a|COVID-19 has caused numerous deaths as well as imposed social isolation and upheaval world-wide. Although, the genome and the composition of the virus, the entry process and replication mechanisms are well investigated from by several laboratories across the world, there are many unknown remaining questions. For example, what are the functions of membrane lipids during entry, packaging and exit of virus particles? Also, the metabolic aspects of the infected tissue cells are poorly understood. In the course of virus replication and formation of virus particles within the host cell, the enhanced metabolic activities of the host is directly proportional to viral loads. The epigenetic landscape of the host cells is also altered, particularly the expression/repression of genes associated with cellular metabolism as well as cellular processes that are antagonistic to the virus. Metabolic pathways are enzyme driven processes and the expression profile and mechanism of regulations of the respective genes encoding those enzymes during the course of pathogen invasion might be highly informative on the course of the disease. Recently, the metabolic profile of the patients' sera have been analysed from few patients. In view of this, and to gain further insights into the roles that epigenetic mechanisms might play in this scenario in regulation of metabolic pathways during the progression of COVID-19 are discussed and summarised in this contribution for ensuring best therapy.
