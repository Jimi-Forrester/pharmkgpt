19535882|t|[Assessment of urinary incontinence in the elderly using the InterRAI-AC instrument].
19535882|a|UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate the prevalence of urinary incontinence and risk factors that influenced it among inpatients treated in the departments of internal medicine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 151 inpatients were questioned using a standardized geriatric questionnaire (InterRAI-Acute Care). Inpatients aged 65 years and more and who gave written informed consent were enrolled into the study. The mean age of the inpatients was 78+/-0.6 years. There were 58.9% of women and 41.06% of men. RESULTS: Urinary incontinence was significantly influenced by the age of the inpatients. Inpatients with urinary incontinence were 3 years older on the average as compared to those without urinary continence (P<0.025). Women were more frequently affected than men (74.2% vs. 48.4%). A significant association between urinary and fecal incontinence and memory problems, movement disorders, delirium, dependence in daily activities, falls was established. The odds of having double incontinence were increased by dementia (OR=20.9; 95%, CI 2.3-186) and residual effects of a stroke (OR=3.5; 95%, CI 1.2-9.6). The prevalence of urinary incontinence decreased from 63.6% before hospitalization to 39.7% after hospitalization. According to standard medical documentation, urinary incontinence was diagnosed in 3.3% of cases, while using the interRAI-AC questionnaire, it was documented in 63.6% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of urinary incontinence increases in the elderly; therefore, it has to be investigated and treated. Memory problems, delirium, dependence in daily activities, movement disorders, and falls are directly related to the risk of urinary, fecal, and double incontinence among elderly inpatients. Double incontinence was significantly influenced by dementia (20.9 times) and residual effects of a stroke (3.5 times). Underdiagnosis of urinary and fecal incontinence in inpatients burdens the possibility of providing aid for elderly patients with this disorder.
