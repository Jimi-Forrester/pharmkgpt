32294542|a|In order to gauge the impact of proteomics in discovery of Alzheimer's disease (AD) blood-based biomarkers, this study had systematically reviewed articles published between 1984-2019. Articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias. A meta-analysis was performed for replicable candidate biomarkers (CB). Of the 1651 articles that were identified, 17 case-control and two cohort studies, as well as three combined case-control and longitudinal designs were shortlisted. A total of 207 AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) CB were discovered, with 48 reported in >2 studies. This review highlights six CB, namely alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha2M)ps, pancreatic polypeptide (PP)ps, apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1)ps, afaminp, insulin growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2)ps and fibrinogen-gamma-chainp, all of which exhibited consistent pattern of regulation in >three independent cohorts. They are involved in AD pathogenesis via amyloid-beta (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Meta-analysis indicated that ApoA-1ps was significantly downregulated in AD (SMD = -1.52, 95% CI: -1.89, -1.16, p < 0.00001), with low inter-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.59). alpha2Mps was significantly upregulated in AD (SMD = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.05, 1.62, p = 0.04), with moderate inter-study heterogeneity (I2 = 41%, p = 0.19). Both CB are involved in Abeta formation. These findings provide important insights into blood-based AD biomarkers discovery via proteomics.
