35040403|t|Natural Products as Sources of Multitarget Compounds: Advances in the Development of Ferulic Acid as Multitarget Therapeutic.
35040403|a|Nature has provided therapeutic substances for millennia, with many valuable medications derived from plant sources. Multitarget drugs become essential in the management of various disorders, including hepatic disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, and carcinomas. Ferulic acid is a significant potential therapeutic agent, which is easily available at low cost, possesses a low toxicity profile, and has minimum side effects. Ferulic acid exhibits various therapeutic actions by modulation of various signal transduction pathways such as Nrf2, p38, and mTOR. The actions exhibited by ferulic acid include anti-apoptosis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticarcinogenic, hepatoprotection, cardioprotection, activation of transcriptional factors, expression of genes, regulation of enzyme activity, and neuroprotection, which further help in treating various pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, skin diseases, brain disorders, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypoxia, hepatic disorders, H1N1 flu, and viral infections. The current review focuses on the significance of natural products as sources of multitarget compounds, and a primary focus has been made on ferulic acid and its mechanism, role, and protective action in various ailments.
