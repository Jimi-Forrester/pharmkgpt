28177519|a|BACKGROUND: The oxidation of methionine residue in position 35 of Ab to sulphoxide (Ab-sulphoxide) has the ability to deeply modify wild-type Ab 1-42 (Ab) neurotoxic action. Our previous studies suggest that in nucleated cells, lower toxicity of Ab-sulphoxide might result not from structural alteration, but from elevation of methionine sulphoxide reductase A (MsrA) activity and mRNA levels. DESIGN: On this basis, we hypothesised that red blood cell (RBC), a cell devoid almost completely of MsrA activity, shares with nucleated cells an antioxidant system induced by methionine 35 sulphoxide, responsible for the lower toxicity of Ab-sulphoxide in RBC. (Results) Supporting this hypothesis, we found that the low toxicity of Ab-sulphoxide in RBC correlated with pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux increase, and this event was associated with a low level of methionine oxidation in total proteins. None of these effects were observed when cells were exposed to Ab native. DISCUSSION: These results outline the importance of the redox state of methionine 35 in the modulation of Ab-mediated events and suggest an important protective role for PPP in RBC of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease.
