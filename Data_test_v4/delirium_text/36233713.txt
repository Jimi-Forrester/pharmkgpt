36233713|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease has a significant epidemiological and socioeconomic impact, and, unfortunately, the extensive research focused on potential curative therapies has not yet proven to be successful. However, in recent years, important steps have been made in the development and functionalization of nanoporous alumina membranes, which might be of great interest for medical use, including the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, the aim of this article is to present the synthesis and biocompatibility testing of a special filtrating nano-membrane, which is planned to be used in an experimental device for Alzheimer's disease treatment. METHODS: Firstly, the alumina nanoporous membrane was synthesized via the two-step anodizing process in oxalic acid-based electrolytes and functionalized via the atomic layer deposition technique. Subsequently, quality control tests (spectrophotometry and potential measurements), toxicity, and biocompatibility tests (cell viability assays) were conducted. RESULTS: The proposed alumina nanoporous membrane proved to be efficient for amyloid-beta filtration according to the permeability studies conducted for 72 h. The proposed membrane has proven to be fully compatible with the tested cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed alumina nanoporous membrane model is safe and could be incorporated into implantable devices for further in vivo experiments and might be an efficient therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.
