29719350|t|A Case Report of A Patient with Treatment-Resistant Depression Successfully Treated with Repeated Intravenous Injections of A Low Dosage of Ketamine.
29719350|a|Depression is a highly prevalent and severely disabling disease. The treatment effects, intensity and onset time of antidepressants have been highlighted in many studies. Recent studies on the rapid-onset of antidepressant response focused on the effect of a single low dose of intravenous ketamine. However, there are still some problems with treatment, including safety, efficacy, ethics, dose, frequency of administration and their effect in treatment-resistant depression. In the present study, we treated one case of treatment resistant depression with repeated intravenous injections with a low dosage of ketamine.
