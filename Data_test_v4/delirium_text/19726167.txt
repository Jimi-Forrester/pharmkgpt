19726167|a|Amyloid beta (1-40) and (1-42) peptides are the major constituents of hallmark senile plaques found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Study of aggregation of Abeta (1-40) and (1-42) peptides and the truncated Abeta fragments could lead towards the mechanism of AD. Langmuir monolayer approach is one of the excellent methods to investigate the mechanism and origin of AD. Particularly, to study the steps involved in the formation and assembly of beta-sheet structures leading to formation of amyloid fibrils. Surface pressure- and surface potential-area isotherms provide information regarding the nature of short-range and long-range interactions between the molecules especially the lipids and the Abeta peptides. Spectroscopic methods like IRRAS, PM-IRRAS, FTIR-ATR, and GIXD at the air-water interface provide insight into the structural characterization, and orientation of the molecules in the Langmuir monolayer.
