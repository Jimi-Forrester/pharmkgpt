32309362|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of perivascular space (PVS) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in stroke-free patients with intracranial and extracranial atherosclerosis of different extents. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-two patients received carotid artery ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cranial computed tomography angiography (CTA) and computed tomography perfusion (CTP). PVS was scored. The extents of intracranial and extracranial arteriosclerosis were evaluated based on the scores of intracranial and extracranial arteriosclerosis. CTP was done to determine the CBF in the region of interest (ROI). The risk factors of vascular disease were assessed in patients with and without PVS. The relationship between PVS and CBF was evaluated among patients with different scores of intracranial and extracranial atherosclerosis. RESULTS: The incidences of intracranial atherosclerosis and extracranial carotid plaque were higher in PVS patients. Subjects with intracranial and/or extracranial arteriosclerosis also had a higher incidence of PVS as compared to controls. The score of intracranial and/or extracranial arteriosclerosis was positively related to the score of basal ganglia PVS. Patients with intracranial and/or extracranial arteriosclerosis had lower CBF as compared to controls. The CBF was negatively associated with the intracranial and/or extracranial arteriosclerosis and the PVS score. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PVS in patients with intracranial and extracranial arteriosclerosis is higher than in patients without arteriosclerosis. The extent of intracranial and extracranial atherosclerosis is related to PVS, especially the basal ganglia PVS. The decreased CBF may be associated with the occurrence of PVS.
