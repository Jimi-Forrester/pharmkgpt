29561427|a|This study aimed to present a simple, fast, and safe technique, called freestyle perforator-based peninsular flap (FPBPF), for pressure sore reconstruction.Among the 21 patients who underwent pressure sore reconstruction between May 2013 and October 2016, 12 patients (Group A) and 9 patients (Group B) were subjected to perforator-based island flap (PBIF) and FPBPF, respectively. We retrospectively reviewed and statistically analyzed the data of both groups.All flaps completely survived in both groups. No significant differences were found in patient demographics, complications, hospital stay, and follow-up period. The mean arc of rotation (102.50 +- 17.645  vs 83.33 +- 14.142 ; P = .01), mean flap harvest time (35.83 +- 2.552 minutes vs 20.88 +- 1.763 minutes; P < .001), and mean operative time (145.41 +- 6.788 minutes vs 131.66 +- 10.770 minutes; P = .002) were significantly decreased in Group B compared with Group A.The FPBPF is a simpler and faster technique than the PBIF. FPBPF is a good modality with a few complications for sore reconstruction.
