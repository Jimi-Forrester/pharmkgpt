677606|t|[Apropos of a paranoid filiation delirium: the "intelligence" complex of dementia and psychiatry with associated absence of critical "control"].
677606|a|Based on a clinical observation of a paranoid filiation delirium, the authors raise the fundamental question of the nature of psychotic structure itself. They suggest an interpretation of the structure of the psychosis as an attempt to rationalize and give shape to an inarticulate discourse. This work as a whole should be looked upon in the perspective of a new approach to the psychiatric occurrence through what might be called a relativist epistemology.
