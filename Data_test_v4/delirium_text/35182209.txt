35182209|a|PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is an often unrecognized adverse event in older people after surgery. The aim of this subgroup analysis of the PRe-Operative Prediction of postoperative DElirium by appropriate SCreening (PROPDESC) trial in patients aged 70 years and older was to identify preoperative risk factors and the impact of POD on length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. METHODS: Of the total 1097 patients recruited at a German university hospital (from September 2018 to October 2019) in the PROPDESC prospective observational study, 588 patients aged 70 years and older (mean age 77.2 +- 4.7 years) were included for subgroup analysis. The primary endpoint POD was considered positive if one of the following tests were positive on any of the five postoperative visit days: Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), 4'A's (4AT) and Delirium Observation Scale (DOS). Trained doctoral students carried out these visitations and additionally the nursing staff were interviewed for completion of the DOS. To evaluate the independent effect of POD on LOS in ICU and in hospital, a multi-variable linear regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The POD incidence was 25.9%. The results of our model showed POD as an independent predictor for a prolonged LOS in ICU (36%; 95% CI 4-78%; < 0.001) and in hospital (22%; 95% CI 4-43%; < 0.001). CONCLUSION: POD has an independent impact on LOS in ICU and in hospital. Based on the effect of POD for the elderly, a standardized risk screening is required.
