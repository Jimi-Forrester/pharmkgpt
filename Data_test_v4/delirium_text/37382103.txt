37382103|t|Presymptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: from characterization to prevention.
37382103|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Significant progress in characterizing presymptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is ushering in an era of potential disease prevention. Although these advances have largely been based on cohorts of deep-phenotyped mutation carriers at an elevated risk for ALS, there are increasing opportunities to apply principles and insights gleaned, to the broader population at risk for ALS [and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)]. RECENT FINDINGS: The discovery that blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) level increases presymptomatically and may serve as a susceptibility biomarker, predicting timing of phenoconversion in some mutation carriers, has empowered the first-ever prevention trial in SOD1-ALS. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that presymptomatic disease is not uniformly clinically silent, with mild motor impairment (MMI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and/or mild behavioral impairment (MBI) representing a prodromal stage of disease. Structural and functional brain abnormalities, as well as systemic markers of metabolic dysfunction, have emerged as potentially even earlier markers of presymptomatic disease. Ongoing longitudinal studies will determine the extent to which these reflect an endophenotype of genetic risk. SUMMARY: The discovery of presymptomatic biomarkers and the delineation of prodromal states is yielding unprecedented opportunities for earlier diagnosis, treatment, and perhaps even prevention of genetic and apparently sporadic forms of disease.
