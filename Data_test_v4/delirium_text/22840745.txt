22840745|t|Mitochondrial abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease: possible targets for therapeutic intervention.
22840745|a|Mitochondria from persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) differ from those of age-matched control subjects. Differences in mitochondrial morphology and function are well documented, and are not brain-limited. Some of these differences are present during all stages of AD, and are even seen in individuals who are without AD symptoms and signs but who have an increased risk of developing AD. This chapter considers the status of mitochondria in AD subjects, the potential basis for AD subject mitochondrial perturbations, and the implications of these perturbations. Data from multiple lines of investigation, including epidemiologic, biochemical, molecular, and cytoplasmic hybrid studies, are reviewed. The possibility that mitochondria could potentially constitute a reasonable AD therapeutic target is discussed, as are several potential mitochondrial medicine treatment strategies.
