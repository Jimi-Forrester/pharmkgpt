34612821|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 25% of people over the age of 70. Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are frequent in patients with CKD and affect 30% to 60% of patients treated by haemodialysis. The link between CKD and NCD is explained by common risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, but also by CKD-specific risk factors through vascular, degenerative, and toxic mechanisms. In patients with non-dialysed CKD, albuminuria is more strongly linked to the occurrence of NCD than glomerular filtration rate. Vascular dementia is the main cause of NCDs in patients with CKD, but the incidence of Alzheimer's disease has also been found to be higher in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in the general population. Executive functions, orientation and attention are the most frequently affected cognitive domains in patients with CKD. The occurrence of NCDs in older patients with CKD could be prevented by controlling blood pressure or by using anticoagulant drugs in the case of atrial fibrillation, which is particularly frequent in patients with CKD, in order to prevent cerebrovascular lesions. Nephrological care could also influence the occurrence of neurological complications. Anticholinesterase drugs and memantine should be used with caution in patients with CKD, as most of these drugs accumulate due to a low glomerular filtration rate. Due to the poor prognosis of patients with NCD and ESRD treated by dialysis or kidney transplantation, a cognitive assessment should be proposed in older patients with severe CKD in order to discuss the initiation and type of renal replacement therapy with both patients and caregivers.
