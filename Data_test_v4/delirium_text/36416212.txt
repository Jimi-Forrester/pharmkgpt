36416212|t|Poor prognostic impact of delirium: especially on mortality and institutionalisation.
36416212|a|The course of delirium is associated with increased hospital costs, healthcare complications, increased mortality, and long-term poor outcomes. Despite delirium being long recognised as one of the most important prognostic components of patients with illnesses, delirium remains poorly understood, effective management options are limited, and no effective treatment has yet been established. This review evaluated the effects of delirium on mortality, institutionalisation, and dementia in various situations to clarify its prognostic seriousness to elucidate important areas for clinical practice and future research. The effect of delirium on mortality in COVID-19 patients was similar to that in other diseases. The effect of delirium on mortality in patients with delirium between the ages of 18 and 65 may be higher than in those with delirium aged over 65, but studies are scarce. Promoting recognition of delirium at all ages is needed. With careful attention to the specific factors in younger patients that contribute to delirium, healthcare providers may be able to decrease the poor impact of delirium on clinical outcomes. Evaluation of the association between interventions for delirium such as sedation in present clinical practice and the prognosis of delirium is lacking, and further clinical studies are essential.
