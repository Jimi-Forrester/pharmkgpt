15908748|a|We compared the scores of the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), initial fluency subtest, category fluency subtest and subtests of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) between patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and age-, sex- and MMSE-matched patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In patients with iNPH, the time and number of steps required to go and come back a 10-meter distance were measured (Walking test) and the associations between the scores of the cognitive tests and the performance of the Walking test were evaluated. The scores of the FAB and initial fluency subtest in patients with iNPH were significantly lower than those in patients with AD. The scores of the FAB, initial fluency subtest and serial 7 subtest of the MMSE significantly correlated with the two scores of the Walking test in patients with iNPH. The present results indicate that frontal lobe functions were impaired in patients with iNPH and that cognitive impairment was closely associated with gait disturbance in patients with iNPH.
