32858422|a|The rapid and direct detection of biomarkers in biofluids at clinically relevant concentrations faces serious limitations to develop diagnostic criteria for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this regard, the early detection of biomarkers correlated with AD using novel modalities and instruments is at the center of attention. Recently, some newly invented optical-based biosensors namely Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) has been extensively investigated for the detection of biomarkers using a label-free method or by checking interaction between ligand and analyte. These approaches can sense a very small amount of target molecules in the blood and cerebrospinal fluids samples. In this review, the different hypothesis related to AD, and the structural properties of AD biomarkers was introduced. Also, we aim to highlight the specific role of available SPR-based sensing methods for early detection of AD biomarkers such as aggregated beta-amyloid and tau proteins. Efforts to better understand the accuracy and efficiency of optical-based biosensors in the field of neurodegenerative disease enable us to accelerate the advent of novel modalities in the clinical setting for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
