36902861|t|Prospective Evaluation of Two Cohorts of Non-Operatively Treated Patients with Displaced vs. Minimally and Non-Displaced Distal Radius Fractures.
36902861|a|BACKGROUND: Distal radius fractures (DRFs) in the elderly are common. Recently, the efficacy of operative treatment of displaced DRFs in patients above 65 years of age has been questioned and it has been suggested that non-operative treatment should be the gold standard. However, the complications and functional outcome of displaced vs. minimally and non-displaced DRFs in the elderly has not been evaluated yet. The aim of the present study was to compare non-operatively treated displaced DRFs vs. minimally and non-displaced DRFs in terms of complications, PROMs, grip strength and range of motion (ROM) after 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. METHODS: We used a prospective cohort study that compared patients with displaced DRFs (n = 50), i.e., >10 degrees of dorsal angulation after two reduction attempts, with patients with minimally or non-displaced DRFs after reduction. Both cohorts received the same treatment of 5 weeks of dorsal plaster casting. Complications and functional outcomes (quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH), patient-rated wrist/hand evaluation (PRWHE), grip strength and EQ-5D scores) were assessed after 5 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-injury. The protocol of the VOLCON RCT and present observational study has been published (PMC6599306; clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03716661). RESULTS: One year after 5 weeks of dorsal below-elbow casting of low-energy DRFs in patients >= 65 years old, we found a complication rate of 6.3% (3/48) in minimally or non-displaced DRFs and 16.6% (7/42) in displaced DRFs (p = 0.18). However, no statistically significant difference was observed in functional outcomes in terms of QuickDASH, pain, ROM, grip strength or EQ-5D scores. DISCUSSION: In patients above 65 years of age, non-operative treatment, i.e., closed reduction and dorsal casting for 5 weeks, yielded similar complication rates and functional outcomes after 1 year regardless of whether the initial fracture was non-displaced/minimally displaced or still displaced after closed reduction. While the initial closed reduction should still be attempted in order to restore the anatomy, failure to achieve the stipulated radiological criteria may not be as important as we thought in terms of complications and functional outcome.
