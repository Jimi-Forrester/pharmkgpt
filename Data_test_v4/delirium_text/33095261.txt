33095261|t|T reg cell-intrinsic requirements for ST2 signaling in health and neuroinflammation.
33095261|a|ST2, the receptor for the alarmin IL-33, is expressed by a subset of regulatory T (T reg) cells residing in nonlymphoid tissues, and these cells can potently expand upon provision of exogenous IL-33. Whether the accumulation and residence of T reg cells in tissues requires their cell-intrinsic expression of and signaling by ST2, or whether indirect IL-33 signaling acting on other cells suffices, has been a matter of contention. Here, we report that ST2 expression on T reg cells is largely dispensable for their accumulation and residence in nonlymphoid organs, including the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), even though cell-intrinsic sensing of IL-33 promotes type 2 cytokine production by VAT-residing T reg cells. In addition, we uncovered a novel ST2-dependent role for T reg cells in limiting the size of IL-17A-producing gammadeltaT cells in the CNS in a mouse model of neuroinflammation, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Finally, ST2 deficiency limited to T reg cells led to disease exacerbation in EAE.
