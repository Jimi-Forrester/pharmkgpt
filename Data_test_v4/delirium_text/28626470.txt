28626470|t|Multi-Infarct Dementia: A Historical Perspective.
28626470|a|BACKGROUND: Multi-infarct dementia (MID), a prominent subtype of vascular dementia (VaD), has only achieved recognition in the last 4 decades. Since its original description, the characterization, etiological understanding, and therapeutic direction of MID and other VaD subtypes has progressed at an astounding rate. SUMMARY: This paper divides the landmark discoveries and emergence of new research strategies for MID into decade-defining patterns so that a condensed picture of the total history of MID and its eventual inclusion as a VaD subtype emerges. This paper follows the first descriptive decade, a shift to a preventative focus, a renewed interest coinciding with timely advances in research technology, and a hopeful return to treatment possibilities for VaD. KEY MESSAGE: Concisely tracing the historical lineage of the modern understanding of MID, both as a singular entity and as part of the VaD con-stellation of disorders, provides a novel perspective on the foundation upon which future advances in combating vascular contributions to dementia will be based.
