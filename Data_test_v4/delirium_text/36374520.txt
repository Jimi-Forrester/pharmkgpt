36374520|a|BACKGROUND: Audiovisual stimulation, such as auditory stimulation, light stimulation, and audiovisual combined stimulation, as a non-invasive stimulation, which can induce gamma oscillation, has received increased attention in recent years, and it has been preliminarily applied in the clinical rehabilitation of brain dysfunctions, such as cognitive, language, motor, mood, and sleep dysfunctions. However, the exact mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation remains unclear; the clinical applications of 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation in brain dysfunctions rehabilitation still need further research. OBJECTIVE: In order to provide new insights into brain dysfunction rehabilitation, this review begins with a discussion of the mechanism underlying 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation, followed by a brief evaluation of its clinical application in the rehabilitation of brain dysfunctions. RESULTS: Currently, 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation was demonstrated to affect synaptic plasticity and modify the connection status of related brain networks in animal experiments and clinical trials. Although its promising efficacy has been shown in the treatment of cognitive, mood, and sleep impairment, research studies into its application in language and motor dysfunctions are still ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Although 40-Hz audiovisual stimulation seems to be effective in treating cognitive, mood, and sleep disorders, its role in language and motor dysfunctions has yet to be determined.
