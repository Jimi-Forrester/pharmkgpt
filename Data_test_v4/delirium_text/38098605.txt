38098605|a|Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, and cognitive impairment is a common consequence of stroke. Understanding the connection between stroke and cognitive impairment is crucial for effectively managing symptoms and improving patients' quality of life. This abstract provides an overview of the relationship between stroke and cognitive impairment and explores strategies for managing cognitive symptoms in stroke survivors. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted to examine the association between stroke and cognitive impairment. Various factors contributing to cognitive impairment after stroke were explored, including the location and severity of the stroke, vascular risk factors, and underlying mechanisms. Evidence-based strategies for managing cognitive symptoms in stroke survivors were also analyzed, such as cognitive rehabilitation, pharmacological interventions, and lifestyle modifications. The review revealed a strong link between stroke and cognitive impairment. The location and severity of the stroke play a significant role in determining the specific cognitive deficits experienced by individuals. Vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, contribute to cognitive decline after stroke. Mechanisms such as cerebral hypoperfusion, white matter damage, and neuroinflammation also play a role. Cognitive rehabilitation programs have shown promising results in improving cognitive function, while certain medications may help manage specific cognitive symptoms. Lifestyle modifications like physical exercise and a healthy diet have been associated with better cognitive outcomes in stroke survivors.
