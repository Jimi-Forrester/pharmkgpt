22152909|a|When approaching the neurophysiological characteristics and diagnostic approach to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), the first idea that comes to mind is that both types of dementia fall within the group of subcortical dementias, with the practical implications that this observation entails. We should therefore leave our knowledge of Alzheimer's dementia and other cortical dementias to one side as, in most cases, these forms of dementia do not correspond clinically or diagnostically to subcortical dementias. Therefore, the clinical and therapeutic approach of PDD and LBD differs from that of cortical dementias in form, if not in essence.
