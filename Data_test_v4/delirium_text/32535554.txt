32535554|a|Autophagy has been reported to play a dual "double-edged sword" role in the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the relationship between AD and autophagy, the dynamic changes of autophagic flux in the brain of postmortem AD patients, animal models and cell models were studied. The results showed that autophagosomes (APs) accumulation and expression of lysosomal markers were decreased in the brains of AD patients. In the brain of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, APs did not accumulate before the formation of SPs but accumulated along with the deposition of SPs, as well as the level of lysosomal markers cathepsin B and Lamp1 protein decreased significantly. In the brains of APP/PS1/LC3 triple - transgenic mice, the number of APs increased with age, but the number of ALs did not increase accordingly. The activation of autophagy is mainly due to the increase in Abeta rather than the overexpression of mutated APP gene. However, both the treatment with exogenous Abeta25-35 and the mutation of the endogenous APP gene blocked the fusion of APs with lysosomes and decreased lysosomal functioning in AD model cells, which may be the main mechanism of autophagy dysregulation in AD.
