39125900|t|Do Microplastics Have Neurological Implications in Relation to Schizophrenia Zebrafish Models? A Brain Immunohistochemistry, Neurotoxicity Assessment, and Oxidative Stress Analysis.
39125900|a|The effects of exposure to environmental pollutants on neurological processes are of increasing concern due to their potential to induce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Considering that many industries are currently using different types of plastics as raw materials, packaging, or distribution pipes, microplastics (MPs) have become one of the biggest threats to the environment and human health. These consequences have led to the need to raise the awareness regarding MPs negative neurological effects and implication in neuropsychiatric pathologies, such as schizophrenia. The study aims to use three zebrafish models of schizophrenia obtained by exposure to ketamine (Ket), methionine (Met), and their combination to investigate the effects of MP exposure on various nervous system structures and the possible interactions with oxidative stress. The results showed that MPs can interact with ketamine and methionine, increasing the severity and frequency of optic tectum lesions, while co-exposure (MP+Met+Ket) resulted in attenuated effects. Regarding oxidative status, we found that all exposure formulations led to oxidative stress, changes in antioxidant defense mechanisms, or compensatory responses to oxidative damage. Met exposure induced structural changes such as necrosis and edema, while paradoxically activating periventricular cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental pollutants and neurotoxicants in modulating neurotoxicity.
