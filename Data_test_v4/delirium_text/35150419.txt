35150419|t|Protective Role of Capsaicin in Neurological Disorders: An Overview.
35150419|a|Different pathological conditions that begin with slow and progressive deformations, cause irreversible affliction by producing loss of neurons and synapses. Commonly it is referred to as 'protein misfolding' diseases or proteinopathies and comprises the latest definition of neurological disorders (ND). Protein misfolding dynamics, proteasomal dysfunction, aggregation, defective degradation, oxidative stress, free radical formation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, impaired bioenergetics, DNA damage, neuronal Golgi apparatus fragmentation, axonal transport disruption, Neurotrophins (NTFs) dysfunction, neuroinflammatory or neuroimmune processes, and neurohumoral changes are the several mechanisms that embark the pathogenesis of ND. Capsaicin (8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) one of the major phenolic components in chili peppers (Capsicum) distinctively triggers the unmyelinated C-fiber and acts on Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-1, which is a Ca2+ permeable, non-selective cation channel. Several studies have shown the neuroprotective role of capsaicin against oxidative damage, behavioral impairment, with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced Parkinson's disease, pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures, global cerebral ischemia, and streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease. Based on these lines of evidence, capsaicin can be considered as a potential constituent to develop suitable neuro-pharmacotherapeutics for the management and treatment of ND. Furthermore, exploring newer horizons and carrying out proper clinical trials would help to bring out the promising effects of capsaicin to be recommended as a neuroprotectant.
