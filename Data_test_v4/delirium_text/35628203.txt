35628203|t|Nanoparticles Formulation Improves the Antifibrogenic Effect of Quercetin on an Adenine-Induced Model of Chronic Kidney Disease.
35628203|a|Renal fibrosis is the final stage of chronic kidney injury characterized by glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis with parenchymal destruction. Quercetin belongs to the most studied flavonoids with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrogenic, and antitumor activity. It modifies the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway, decreasing profibrogenic expression molecules and inducing the expression of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrogenic molecules. However, quercetin exhibits poor water solubility and low absorption and bioavailability. This limitation was solved by developing a nanoparticles formulation that improves the solubility and bioavailability of several bioactive compounds. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the in vivo antifibrogenic effect of a quercetin nanoparticles formulation. Male C57BL/6 mice were induced into chronic renal failure with 50 mg/kg of adenine for four weeks. The animals were randomly grouped and treated with 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg of quercetin, either macroparticles or nanoparticles formulation. We performed biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses to evaluate and compare the effect of macroparticles versus nanoparticles formulation on kidney damage. Here, we demonstrated that smaller doses of nanoparticles exhibited the same beneficial effect as larger doses of macroparticles on preventing kidney damage. This finding translates into less quercetin consumption reaching the desired therapeutic effect.
