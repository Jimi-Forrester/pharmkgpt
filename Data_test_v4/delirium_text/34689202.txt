34689202|t|Suppression of Low-Frequency Gamma Oscillations by Activation of 40-Hz Oscillation.
34689202|a|Gamma oscillations have received considerable attention owing to their association with cognitive function and various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, interactions of gamma oscillations at different frequency bands in humans remain unclear. In the present magnetoencephalographic study, brain oscillations in a wide frequency range were examined using a time-frequency analysis during the 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-Hz auditory stimuli in 21 healthy subjects. First, dipoles for auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were estimated and interaction among oscillations at 10-60 Hz was examined using the source strength waveforms. Results showed the suppression of ongoing low-gamma oscillations at approximately 30 Hz during stimulation at 40 Hz. Second, multi-dipole analyses suggested that the main dipole for ASSR and dipoles for suppressed low-frequency gamma oscillations were distinct. Third, an all-sensor analysis was performed to clarify the distribution of the 40-Hz ASSR and suppression of low-frequency gamma oscillations. Notably, the area of suppression surrounded the center of the 40-Hz ASSR and showed a trend of extending to the vertex, indicating that different groups of neurons were responsible for these two gamma oscillations and that the 40-Hz oscillation circuit have specific inhibitory innervation to the low-gamma circuit.
