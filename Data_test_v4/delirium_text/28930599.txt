28930599|a|Pathophysiological changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begin decades before clinical symptoms become apparent, providing an important window for early diagnosis and intervention. Prodromal stage of AD, a great opportunity for effective treatment and postponing the disease onset, has drawn extensive attention. The application of different biomarkers including neuroimaging, biochemical substances and genes makes AD-related pathology detectable in vivo and exploring novel biomarkers with relatively non-invasive and low cost has intrigued a wide range of interests. To identify individuals with high risk of conversion to AD and apply the research concept of prodromal AD into clinical practice, the utility of various biomarkers for distinguishing prodromal AD is evaluated in this review. Additionally, clinical management focusing on the stage of prodromal AD is summarized in this review for dementia prevention.
