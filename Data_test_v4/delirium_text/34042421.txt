34042421|t|Brain Targeting and Abeta Binding Bifunctional Nanoparticles Inhibit Amyloid Protein Aggregation in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice.
34042421|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disease with few disease-modifying treatments. A variety of peptide/protein drugs have neuroprotective effects, which brings new hope for the treatment of AD. However, the application of these drugs is limited because of their low specificity and difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier. Herein, using the phage display technology, we identified the Abeta oligomer binding peptide (KH) and the brain targeting peptide (IS). We combined these peptides to develop a bifunctional nanoparticle (IS@NP/KH) for the delivery of Abeta1-42 oligomer binding peptide into the brain. Intranasal administration of IS@NP/KH significantly attenuated the cognitive and behavioral deficits and reduced the Abeta deposition in the brain of an AD animal model (APPswe/PS 1d9 double-transgenic mice). Our results suggest that intranasal IS@NP/KH administration could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.
