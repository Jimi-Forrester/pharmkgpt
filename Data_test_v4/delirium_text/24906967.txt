24906967|t|Potential Similarities in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease: From Clinic to Pathology.
24906967|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by insidious onset of memory and cognitive impairments, which are also presented in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Many studies have shown that seizures occur in some patients with AD, and AD is a risk factor for epilepsy, mainly complex partial and secondary generalized seizure. Here, we focus on the relationship between TLE and AD in clinical and pathological aspects, as they are having similar comorbidities and mechanisms. In this study, we first reviewed the clinical observations that showed concomitant AD and TLE. Then, we picked up common genetic and pathological changes in both the diseases from neurobiological researches. Although both the diseases have delicate differences in many aspects, their common characteristics intrigue more detailed research to be done by newer technology.
