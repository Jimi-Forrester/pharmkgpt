8226987|t|Microtubule-associated protein tau. Abnormal phosphorylation of a non-paired helical filament pool in Alzheimer disease.
8226987|a|The major protein subunit of the paired helical filaments (PHF) of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau is a family of phosphopolypeptides that are abnormally phosphorylated in PHF. In this study, a non-PHF pool of tau abnormally phosphorylated at Ser-199/202, and tau not phosphorylated at this site (AD P-tau and AD tau, respectively) were isolated from the 27,000 x g to 200,000 x g fraction of AD brain homogenate by extraction in 8 M urea, followed by dialysis against Tris buffer. AD P-tau and AD tau were further purified and separated from each other by acid precipitation, glial fibrillary acidic protein affinity chromatography, and phosphocellulose chromatography. The resulting AD P-tau and AD tau preparations were free of cytoskeletal proteins, ubiquitin, and beta-amyloid peptide. Immunochemical and morphological analysis of AD P-tau preparations revealed that most of the protein was of non-PHF origin. The AD P-tau was about 3-4-fold (approximately 8 mol P04/mol protein, M(r) 41,318) more phosphorylated than cytosolic tau from AD and control brains. Unlike PHF, the AD P-tau lacked ubiquitin. In AD brain the levels of cytosolic tau were about half of those in control aged cases. These findings suggest that the abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD occurs in the cytosol.
