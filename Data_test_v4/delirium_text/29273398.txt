29273398|a|Given the increased public concern about the deleterious biological consequences of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs), the involvement of RF-EMFs in neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), has received increased consideration. To investigate the effect of long-term RF-EMF exposure on AD progression, we exposed 5xFAD mice to 1950 MHz RF-EMF at a specific absorption rate of 5.0 W/kg for 2 h/day and 5 days/week for 8 months. Behavioral changes were assessed by an open field test and an object recognition memory task after RF exposure was terminated. In addition, cerebral glucose metabolism was analyzed in the brains of the 5xFAD mice using 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. The hyperactivity-like and anxiolytic behaviors of the 5xFAD mice in open field tests were rescued by RF exposure. Furthermore, long-term RF-EMF exposure improved the cognitive deficits of 5xFAD mice that were observed in the object recognition memory test. Consistent with the behavioral changes, glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and amygdala regions of the brains of 5xFAD mice following RF exposure was significantly increased compared to glucose metabolism in the brains of sham-exposed mice. These data suggest that long-term exposure to RF-EMF might exert beneficial effects on AD in 5xFAD mice.
