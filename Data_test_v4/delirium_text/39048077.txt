39048077|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium remains a major postoperative concern for children undergoing surgery. Nalbuphine is a synthetic mixed agonist-antagonist opioid, which is believed to reduce the incidence of emergence delirium in children. The primary objective was to examine the effect of nalbuphine on emergence delirium in children undergoing surgery. METHODS: Databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from their starting dates until April 2023. Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT) and observational studies comparing nalbuphine and control in children undergoing surgery were included. RESULTS: Eight studies (n = 1466 patients) were eligible for inclusion of data analysis. Compared to the control, our pooled data showed that the nalbuphine group was associated with lower incidence of emergence delirium (RR = 0.38, 95% CI [0.30, 0.47], p < 0.001) and reduced postoperative pain scores (MD = -0.98, 95% CI [-1.92, -0.04], p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This review showed the administration of nalbuphine is associated with significant decrease in the incidence of emergence delirium and postoperative pain scores among children undergoing surgery. However, due to limited sample size, high degree of heterogeneity and low level of evidence, future adequately powered trials are warranted to explore the efficacy of nalbuphine on emergence delirium among the pediatric population.
