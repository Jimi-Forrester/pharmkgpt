17312661|t|[Confusion Assessment Method. Validation of a French-language version].
17312661|a|There is no systematic or standardized approach to assessing higher mental functions in hospitalized elderly patients, despite the constant presence of nursing staff. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is the only valid and reliable clinical tool for detecting symptoms of delirium easily and quickly, even by health professionals with no specialized training in psychiatry. The CAM has been translated into eight languages, but no validated French-language version has been published as yet. It was in response to this need that the researchers took the first steps in validating a French-language version of the CAM and the diagnostic algorithm, and enhanced the description in French of symptoms of delirium and the criteria of the diagnostic algorithm. The validation process was based on the first two steps in the transcultural validation method for psychological questionnaires suggested by Vallerand. The availability of a French-language version of this instrument will lead to greater professional autonomy and help to simplify the recognition of symptoms of delirium and ensure that the appropriate action is taken sooner.
