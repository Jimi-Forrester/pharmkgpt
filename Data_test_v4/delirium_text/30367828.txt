30367828|a|BACKGROUND: This study tested if central obesity, hypertension, or depressive symptoms moderated the relationship between beta-amyloid (Abeta) and longitudinal cognitive performance in late middle-aged adults enriched for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. METHODS: Participants (n = 207; ages = 40-70 years; 73% parental AD) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention study completed 3+ neuropsychological evaluations and a [11C]PiB positron emission tomography scan or lumbar puncture. Linear mixed-effects regression models tested interactions of risk factor x Abeta x visit age on longitudinal Verbal Learning & Memory and Speed & Flexibility factor scores. RESULTS: The relationship between Abeta and Verbal Learning & Memory decline was moderated by hypertension (chi2(1) = 3.85, P = .04) and obesity (chi2(1) = 6.12, P = .01); those with both elevated Abeta and the risk factor declined at faster rates than those with only elevated Abeta or elevated risk factors. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, hypertension and obesity moderated the relationship between Abeta and cognitive decline.
