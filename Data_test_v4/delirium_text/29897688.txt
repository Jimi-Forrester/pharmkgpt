29897688|a|Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) has a significant role in various cancers and Alzheimer's disease. 500 breast cancer mammograms as well as 3 cases of adenocarcinomas of esophagus, stomach, colon, prostate gland, uterus, ovary that was examined had significant infection of HPV- 16 with significantly increased beta- amyloid (1-42). When a strong HPV-16 infection is found in the oral cavity, repeated exposure to the infected individual's coughing can infect others easily through saliva. Just like all of above cancer tissues, all 20 Alzheimer's cases that were examined had significantly increased HPV-16 of 1500-3000ng with markedly reduced Acetylcholine of 0.5~1.5ng and significantly increased 3- amyloid (1-42) of 7.5ng or higher. Since every cancer and Alzheimer's patient examined had significantly reduced amounts of Vitamin D3 and Taurine, the author examined the effects of Vitamin D3 and Taurine independently, or by combination. Each of optimal doses of Vitamin D3 and Taurine had significant beneficial effects that were anti-cancer, anti-cardiac ischemia, and memory loss & other brain problems, with significant excretion of HPV- 16 and bacteria such as Borrelia Burgdorferi, if it exists, through the urine, without using any anti-viral or anti-bacterial agents. However, when optimal doses of Taurine and Vitamin D3 were used together, 3 times/day, there was reduction of cancer-associated Oncogene CfosAB-2 or Integrin a5p1 with significantly high values of 200-500ng which were reduced to 0.001-0.004ng. Memory and brain function improved by increasing markedly reduced abnormal Acetylcholine of 1.5ng or less to a few hundred-2500ng with increase in DHEA. Abnormally increased P-amyloid (1-42) is markedly reduced. Ischemic heart, where there is abnormally increased Cardiac Troponin I, reduced significantly. In addition, abnormally reduced DHEA levels often increase. HPV- 16 in urine increased from an average of 100~15ng to an average of 4000ng and cancer related parameters in the urine significantly increased. Thus, the author found combined use of optimal dose of Vitamin D3 400 I.U. and optimal dose of Taurine 175mg, 3/day, was found to be one of the safest, most effective treatments for cancer, memory problems & other brain abnormality, and Ischemic heart problems, and this combination seems to improve any part of the body. One should try this method before using any other treatment, which has a potential side effect.
