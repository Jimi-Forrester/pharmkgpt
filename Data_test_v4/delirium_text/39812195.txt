39812195|t|Effects of Yoga-Like Exercises on Mild and Moderate Alzheimer Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol.
39812195|a|BACKGROUND: While aerobic exercises have demonstrated efficacy in slowing cognitive decline and improving psychological symptoms associated with cognitive impairments, they may not be feasible due to multiple disabilities. Other gentle exercises with mindful approaches, such as "Yoga-like", have been explored but lack clear evidence. AIM: To assess the efficacy of a "Yoga-like" intervention on cognitive and psychological features in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease (AD). METHODS: We propose a randomized controlled trial design. Patients with mild to moderate AD who are able to undergo neurocognitive assessment and do not have conditions contraindicating deep breathing or extreme postures will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG: Yoga-like) or a control group (CG: no intervention). The 'Yoga-like' intervention consists of 30 minutes of exercises combining breathing, postures, concentration, and meditation, conducted three times a week over eight weeks. Both groups will undergo neuropsychological tests at baseline and after eight weeks, including attention, problem-solving, visuospatial abilities, mood and neuropsychiatric symptoms. EXPECTED RESULTS: It is anticipated that the breathing, concentration, and meditation components of the intervention will improve attention, problem-solving abilities and behavioral symptoms. The postural components are expected to enhance visuospatial control and balance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PACTR202407721329710 (https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/TrialDisplay.aspx?TrialID=30602).
