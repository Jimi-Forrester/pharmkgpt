32349180|a|BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease type C is an autosomal-recessive, lysosomal storage disorder with variable age of onset and a heterogeneous clinical presentation that includes neurological, psychiatric, and visceral findings. Serial intrathecal injections of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin are being evaluated as a treatment modality for Niemann-Pick disease type C with a subset of patients requiring anesthesia for this procedure. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of anesthesia provided for patients undergoing intrathecal injection of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. METHODS: A retrospective review of pediatric patients who received serial intrathecal injections of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin with anesthesia at two tertiary care centers was conducted from December 2015 through April 2019. Data were extracted for analysis included preoperative comorbidities, demographics, vital signs, intraoperative anesthesia course, airway management technique, venous access, postoperative course, and perioperative complications. In total, 19 patients were identified and a total of 394 anesthetic encounters were included in this study. RESULTS: All 394 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin administration procedures were successfully performed, and there were no changes made in the anesthetic plan during the anesthesia encounters. Three hundred forty-nine anesthetics were performed utilizing inhalation induction and mask maintenance, and 45 anesthetics were performed with placement of a supraglottic airway device due to patient body habitus and provider preference. The incidence of a major adverse event (aspirations, arterial desaturation) was 5/394 (1.3%, 95% CI 0.05%-3.1%). Minor adverse events (emesis, delirium, hypotension, seizure, and airway obstruction) were observed in 19/394 encounters (4.8%, 95% CI 3.0%-7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that general anesthesia induced via inhalation induction and maintained with volatile anesthetic via mask or supraglottic airway is a safe and effective option for pediatric patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C undergoing serial intrathecal injections of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, supporting this technique as a viable option for anesthetic care in these patients.
