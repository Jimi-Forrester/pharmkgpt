38901670|t|Indanone: a promising scaffold for new drug discovery against neurodegenerative disorders.
38901670|a|Indanone is a versatile scaffold that has a number of pharmacological properties. The successful development and ensuing approval of indanone-derived donepezil as a drug of choice for Alzheimer's disease attracted significant scientific interest in this moiety. Indanones could act as small molecule chemical probes as they have strong affinity towards several critical enzymes associated with the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders. Inhibition of these enzymes elevates the levels of neuroprotective brain chemicals such as norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. Further, indanone derivatives are capable of modulating the activities of both monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and -B) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and thus could be useful in various neurodegenerative diseases. This review article presents a panoramic view of the research carried out on the indanone nucleus in the development of potential neuroprotective agents.
