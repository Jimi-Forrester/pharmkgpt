36159546|a|BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation is a common resuscitation method in the intensive care unit (ICU). Unfortunately, this treatment process prolongs the ICU stay of patients with an increased incidence of delirium, which ultimately affects the prognosis. AIM: To evaluate the effect of progressive early rehabilitation training on treatment and prognosis of patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU. METHODS: The convenience sampling method selected 190 patients with mechanical ventilation admitted to the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University from March 2020 to March 2021. According to the random number table method, they were divided into the control and intervention groups. The control group received routine nursing and rehabilitation measures, whereas the intervention group received progressive early rehabilitation training. In addition, the incidence and duration of delirium were compared for the two groups along with mechanical ventilation time, ICU hospitalization time, functional independence measure (FIM) score, Barthel index, and the incidence of complications (deep venous thrombosis, pressure sores, and acquired muscle weakness). RESULTS: In the intervention group, the incidence of delirium was significantly lower than in the control group (28% vs 52%, P < 0.001). In the intervention group, the duration of delirium, mechanical ventilation time, and ICU stay were shorter than in the control group (P < 0.001). The FIM and Barthel index scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group (P < 0.001). The total incidence of complications in the intervention group was 3.15%, which was lower than 17.89% in the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Progressive early rehabilitation training reduced the incidence of delirium and complications in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation, which improved prognosis and quality of life.
