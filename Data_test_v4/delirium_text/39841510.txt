39841510|t|Assessment of Geriatric Problems and Risk Factors for Delirium in Surgical Medicine: Protocol for Multidisciplinary Prospective Clinical Study.
39841510|a|BACKGROUND: An aging population in combination with more gentle and less stressful surgical procedures leads to an increased number of operations on older patients. This collectively raises novel challenges due to higher age heavily impacting treatment. A major problem, emerging in up to 50% of cases, is perioperative delirium. It is thus vital to understand whether and which existing geriatric assessments are capable of reliably identifying risk factors, how high the incidence of delirium is, and whether the resulting management of these risk factors might lead to a reduced incidence of delirium. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the frequency and severity of geriatric medical problems in elective patients of the Clinics of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Vascular Surgery, and Orthopedics, General Surgery, and Trauma Surgery, revealing associations with the incidence of perioperative delirium regarding potential risk factors, and recording the long-term effects of geriatric problems and any perioperative delirium that might have developed later the patient's life. METHODS: We performed both pre- and postoperative assessments in patients of 4 different surgical departments who are older than 70 years. Patient-validated screening instruments will be used to identify risk factors. A geriatric assessment with the content of basal and instrumental activities of daily living (basal activities of daily living [Katz index], instrumental activities of daily living [Lawton and Brody score], cognition [6-item screener and clock drawing test], mobility [de Morton Mobility Index and Sit-to-Stand test], sleep [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Insomnia Severity Index/STOP-BANG], drug therapy [polypharmacy and quality of medication, Fit For The Aged classification, and anticholinergic burden score], and pain assessment and delirium risk (Delirium Risk Assessment Tool) will be performed. Any medical problems detected will be treated according to current standards, and no intervention is planned as part of the study. In addition, a telephone follow-up will be performed 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: Recruitment started in August 2022, with 421 patients already recruited at the time of submission. Initial analyses of the data are to be published at the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, we investigate whether the risk factors addressed in the assessment are associated with an increase in the delirium rate. The aim is then to reduce this comprehensive assessment to the central aspects to be able to conduct targeted and efficient risk screening.
