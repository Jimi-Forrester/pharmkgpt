25193979|t|Opioids, Neutral Endopeptidase, its Inhibitors and Cancer: Is There a Relationship among them?
25193979|a|The role of endogenous animal opioids in the biology of cancer is widely recognized but poorly understood. This is, among others, because of the short half-life of these peptides, which are quickly inactivated by endopeptidases, e.g., neutral endopeptidase (NEP, CD10). It has been established that NEP is engaged in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment, among others that of colon cancer, by exerting influence on cell growth factors, the extracellular matrix and other biologically active substances. Although there are some discrepancies among the findings on the role of both opioids and NEP in cancer development, authors agree that their role seems to depend on the origin, stage and grade of tumor, and even on the method of examination. Moreover, recently, natural inhibitors of NEP, such as sialorphin, opiorphin and spinorphin have been detected. Their analgesic activity has been established. It is interesting to ask whether there is a relationship among opioid peptides, tumor-associated NEP and its inhibitors.
