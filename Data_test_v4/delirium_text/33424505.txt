33424505|t|Evaluation of QTc Interval Effects of Antipsychotic Medications for Intensive Care Unit Delirium in Pediatric Patients.
33424505|a|OBJECTIVE: Intensive care unit delirium is an increasingly recognized problem in pediatric patients. Controversy exists regarding the safety and efficacy of antipsychotic medications for this indication. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for QTc interval prolongation in pediatric patients treated with antipsychotics for ICU delirium. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients admitted to the pediatric ICU or pediatric cardiac ICU and diagnosed with ICU delirium between October 1, 2014, and October 31, 2015. Patients were included if they received at least 1 dose of an antipsychotic for the treatment of delirium after a positive screen using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scoring tool. RESULTS: For the 26 patients included, the median change in QTc interval on treatment was -4 msecs. Two patients (8%) had QTc interval prolongation while on antipsychotic therapy. No risk factors were identified in these 2 patients that put them at increased risk for QTc interval prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of QTc interval prolongation in pediatric patients who were treated with antipsychotics for ICU delirium was low. There is need for future research to determine which pediatric patients are at risk for QTc interval prolongation when antipsychotic medications are used for the treatment of ICU delirium.
