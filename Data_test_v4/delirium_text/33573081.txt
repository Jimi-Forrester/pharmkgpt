33573081|t|Systematic Review of Nicotine Exposure's Effects on Neural Stem and Progenitor Cells.
33573081|a|While various modalities of chronic nicotine use have been associated with numerous negative consequences to human health, one possible benefit of nicotine exposure has been uncovered. The discovery of an inverse correlation between smoking and Parkinson's disease, and later Alzheimer's disease as well, motivated investigation of nicotine as a neuroprotective agent. Some studies have demonstrated that nicotine elicits improvements in cognitive function. The hippocampus, along with the subventricular zone (SVZ), is a distinct brain region that allow for ongoing postnatal neurogenesis throughout adulthood and plays a major role in certain cognitive behaviors like learning and memory. Therefore, one hypothesis underlying nicotine-induced neuroprotection is possible effects on neural stem cells and neural precursor cells. On the other hand, nicotine withdrawal frequently leads to cognitive impairments, particularly in hippocampal-dependent behaviors, possibly suggesting an impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis with nicotine exposure. This review discusses the current body of evidence on nicotine's effects on neural stem cells and neural progenitors. Changes in neural stem cell proliferation, survival, intracellular dynamics, and differentiation following acute and chronic nicotine exposure are examined.
