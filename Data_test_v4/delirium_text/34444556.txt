34444556|a|INTRODUCTION: Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin and is necessary for energy metabolism. Critically ill patients are at particular risk of developing thiamine deficiency and related complications. One of the complications that can occur is delirium. Delirium is a disorder that affects the body's response to treatment, length of stay in the ward, mortality, long-term cognitive impairment, and significantly increases treatment costs. In addition, studies show that delirium medication is more effective in preventing than in treating delirium. Given its low cost, availability, and minimal risk of side effects, thiamine supplementation could prove to be a relevant strategy in the prevention and treatment of delirium. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched using relevant keywords that focus on the use of thiamine to prevent or treat delirium in critically ill patients. RESULTS: Seven articles were included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: The small number of studies and considerable heterogeneity prevent conclusions supporting the use of thiamine as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of delirium among critically ill patients. There is a need for high-quality, large-scale randomized clinical trials to confirm the beneficial effects of thiamine in the prevention and treatment of delirium.
