30061171|t|Obesity-mediated regulation of cardiac protein acetylation: parallel analysis of total and acetylated proteins via TMT-tagged mass spectrometry.
30061171|a|Lysine residues undergo diverse and reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs). Lysine acetylation has traditionally been studied in the epigenetic regulation of nucleosomal histones that provides an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. Histone acetylation plays a key role in cardiac remodeling and function. However, recent studies have shown that thousands of proteins can be acetylated at multiple acetylation sites, suggesting the acetylome rivals the kinome as a PTM. Based on this, we examined the impact of obesity on protein lysine acetylation in the left ventricle (LV) of male c57BL/6J mice. We reported that obesity significantly increased heart enlargement and fibrosis. Moreover, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that lysine acetylation was markedly altered with obesity and that this phenomenon was cardiac tissue specific. Mass spectral analysis identified 2515 proteins, of which 65 were significantly impacted by obesity. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis  (IPA) further demonstrated that these proteins were involved in metabolic dysfunction and cardiac remodeling. In addition to total protein, 189 proteins were acetylated, 14 of which were significantly impacted by obesity. IPA identified the Cardiovascular Disease Pathway as significantly regulated by obesity. This network included aconitate hydratase 2 (ACO2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD), in which acetylation was significantly increased by obesity. These proteins are known to regulate cardiac function yet, the impact for ACO2 and DLD acetylation remains unclear. Combined, these findings suggest a critical role for cardiac acetylation in obesity-mediated remodeling; this has the potential to elucidate novel targets that regulate cardiac pathology.
