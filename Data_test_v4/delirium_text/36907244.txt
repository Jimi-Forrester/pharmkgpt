36907244|a|Irreversible aggregation of misfolded proteins is the underlying molecular cause of numerous pathologies, including diabetes type 2, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Such an abrupt protein aggregation results in the formation of small oligomers that can propagate into amyloid fibrils. A growing body of evidence suggests that protein aggregation can be uniquely altered by lipids. However, the role of the protein-to-lipid (P:L) ratio on the rate of protein aggregation, as well as the structure and toxicity of corresponding protein aggregates remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the P:L ratio of five different phospho- and sphingolipids on the rate of lysozyme aggregation. We observed significantly different rates of lysozyme aggregation at 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 P:L ratios of all analyzed lipids except phosphatidylcholine (PC). However, we found that at those P:L ratios, structurally and morphologically similar fibrils were formed. As a result, for all studies of lipids except PC, mature lysozyme aggregates exerted insignificantly different cell toxicity. These results demonstrate that the P:L ratio directly determines the rate of protein aggregation, however, has very little if any effect on the secondary structure of mature lysozyme aggregates. Furthermore, our results point to the lack of a direct relationship between the rate of protein aggregation, secondary structure, and toxicity of mature fibrils.
