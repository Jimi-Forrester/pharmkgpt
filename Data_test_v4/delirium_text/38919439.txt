38919439|t|Evaluation of qCON and qNOX indices in pediatric surgery under general anesthesia.
38919439|a|Background and Aims: The objective of the study was to evaluate the performances of qCON and qNOX indices in pediatric populations undergoing surgery under general anesthesia (GA), focusing on the induction and recovery periods. Both the indices are derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) and implemented in the CONOX monitor (Fresenius Kabi, Germany). Material and Methods: After approval of the institutional ethics committee, this prospective observational study was conducted in pediatric patients of either sex in the age group of 1-12 years belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade I and II undergoing elective surgery under GA. Anesthetic technique was GA with or without regional analgesia (RA). All patients underwent inhalation induction and maintenance using sevoflurane. Patients were monitored with the use of a CONOX monitoring system (Fresenius Kabi, Germany), connected via a set of electrodes placed over the forehead. qCON and qNOX scores were recorded during awake (on operating table premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg), at induction, at loss of eyelash reflex, intubation/laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, before and after regional anesthesia, surgical incision, at cessation of anesthesia, emergence, extubation, and eye-opening. Registered results were also analyzed compared with the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane (MAC). Results: A total of 46 pediatric patients were enrolled in the study with a mean age of 5.6 years. All the patients were either ASA I or II. There was a simultaneous fall and rise of qCON and qNOX upon induction and recovery, respectively. There was a rise in qNOX with surgical incision irrespective of RA. However, there was a greater rise in qNOX following surgical incision in those who did not receive RA (P = 0.33) Also both qCON (P = 0.06) and qNOX (P = 0.41) were poorly correlated with MAC values of sevoflurane during GA in the pediatric population. Conclusions: Both qCON and qNOX values change predictably with changes in the conscious level and with different noxious stimuli. Further studies are required to confirm the findings taking into account the postoperative assessment of delirium and recall of intraoperative events.
