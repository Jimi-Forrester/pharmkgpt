39732176|a|Chronic sleep deprivation and lack of physical exercise may have detrimental effects on overall health, particularly in terms of brain health, with significant implications for cognitive function and well-being. This review explores the impact of chronic sleep deprivation and physical exercise on brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drawing insights from 40 selected studies, the review synthesizes evidence on these lifestyle factors' correlations with neurodegenerative changes. Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts circadian rhythms and neurochemical pathways, potentially accelerating brain atrophy, while physical exercise preserves brain structure by enhancing vascular health, reducing inflammation, and supporting synaptic plasticity, particularly in regions like the hippocampus. Results highlight distinct patterns of brain atrophy in AD and MCI, underscoring the potential for targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive decline. Understanding the relationship between sleep disruption and brain health provides insights into strategies for possibly delaying neurodegenerative diseases like MCI, which represents a milder form of Alzheimer's, and AD. The findings underscore the potential utility of integrating sleep therapy and physical exercise interventions in clinical practice for early detection of mild cognitive impairment and potentially delaying disease progression. This integrated approach has been found to promote healthy aging, reduce atrophy rates, and enhance cognitive resilience across aging populations.
