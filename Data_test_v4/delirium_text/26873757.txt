26873757|a|This article reviews current literature regarding the neuro intensive care unit (ICU) and the ICU setting in general regarding delirium, pain, agitation, and evidence-based guidelines and assessment tools. Delirium in the ICU affects as many as 50% to 80% of patients. Delirium is associated with increased burden of illness, higher mortality, and increased suffering. Evidence-based guidelines recommend using validated and reliable assessment tools. We reviewed current national clinical guidelines, validated tools for assessing pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium. We also reviewed a delirium risk-assessment/prediction tool.
