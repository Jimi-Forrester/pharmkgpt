37239204|t|Immunological Imbalances Associated with Epileptic Seizures in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
37239204|a|PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health burden that leads to an increased morbidity and mortality rate arising from microvascular and macrovascular complications. Epilepsy leads to complications that cause psychological and physical distress to patients and carers. Although these conditions are characterized by inflammation, there seems to be a lack of studies that have evaluated inflammatory markers in the presence of both conditions (T2DM and epilepsy), especially in low-middle-income countries where T2DM is epidemic. Summary findings: In this review, we describe the role of immunity in the seizure generation of T2DM. Current evidence shows an increase in the levels of biomarkers such as interleukin (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), and toll-like receptors (TLRs) in epileptic seizures and T2DM. However, there is limited evidence to show a correlation between inflammatory markers in the central and peripheral levels of epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism behind epileptic seizures in T2DM through an investigation of immunological imbalances might improve diagnosis and further counter the risks of developing complications. This might also assist in delivering safe and effective therapies to T2DM patients affected, thus reducing morbidity and mortality by preventing or reducing associated complications. Moreover, this review also provides an overview approach on inflammatory cytokines that can be targeted when developing alternative therapies, in case these conditions coexist.
