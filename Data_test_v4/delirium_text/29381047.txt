29381047|t|Core Binding Site of a Thioflavin-T-Derived Imaging Probe on Amyloid beta Fibrils Predicted by Computational Methods.
29381047|a|Development of new diagnostic imaging probes for Alzheimer's disease, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) probes, has been strongly desired. In this study, we investigated the most accessible amyloid beta (Abeta) binding site of [123I]IMPY, a Thioflavin-T-derived SPECT probe, using experimental and computational methods. First, we performed a competitive inhibition assay with Orange-G, which recognizes the KLVFFA region in Abeta fibrils, suggesting that IMPY and Orange-G bind to different sites in Abeta fibrils. Next, we precisely predicted the IMPY binding site on a multiple-protofilament Abeta fibril model using computational approaches, consisting of molecular dynamics and docking simulations. We generated possible IMPY-binding structures using docking simulations to identify candidates for probe-binding sites. The binding free energy of IMPY with the Abeta fibril was calculated by a free energy simulation method, MP-CAFEE. These computational results suggest that IMPY preferentially binds to an interfacial pocket located between two protofilaments and is stabilized mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Finally, our computational approach was validated by comparing it with the experimental results. The present study demonstrates the possibility of computational approaches to screen new PET/SPECT probes for Abeta imaging.
