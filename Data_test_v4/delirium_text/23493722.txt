23493722|a|BACKGROUND: AD8 is a brief informant interview used to detect early cognitive change. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the participant-rated AD8 (p-AD8) in a predominantly Chinese population. METHODS: Data on demographics, clinical, and cognitive features were collected from 73 participants with no cognitive impairment (NCI), 27 participants with mild cognitive impairments, and 78 participants with Alzheimer's disease-informant dyads. Agreement and discriminative properties of p-AD8 were assessed. RESULTS: AD8 scores were associated with dementia severity. Participant and informant AD8 scores were moderately correlated within dementia dyads. The p-AD8 showed good diagnostic performance in differentiating between participants with NCI and participants with cognitive impairment (sensitivity = 85.0%, specificity = 74.0%, and area under the curve = 0.80), with a cutoff score of >=1. Combination of impairment in Mini-Mental State Examination and p-AD8 is more useful in detecting cognitive impairment than using the AD8 alone. CONCLUSION: Within a transcultural setting, the p-AD8 demonstrated good discriminative validity and can be used to gain a preliminary understanding of an individual's cognitive status.
