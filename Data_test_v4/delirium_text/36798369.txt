36798369|t|Using rapid response system trigger clusters to characterize patterns of clinical deterioration among hospitalized adult patients.
36798369|a|Background: Many rapid response system (RRS) events are activated using multiple triggers. However, the patterns in which RRS triggers co-occur to activate the medical emergency team (MET) to respond to RRS events is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe the patterns (RRS trigger clusters) in which RRS triggers co-occur when used to activate the MET and determine the association of these clusters with outcomes using a sample of hospitalized adult patients. Methods: RRS events among adult patients from January 2015 to December 2019 in the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry's MET module were examined (n=134,406). A combination of cluster analyses methods was performed to group patients into RRS trigger clusters based on the triggers used to activate their RRS events. Pearson's chi-squared and ANOVA tests were used to examine differences in patient characteristics across RRS trigger clusters. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the associations between RRS trigger clusters and outcomes following RRS events. Results: Six RRS trigger clusters were identified in the study sample. The RRS triggers that predominantly identified each cluster were as follows: tachypnea, new onset difficulty in breathing, and decreased oxygen saturation (Cluster 1); tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, and staff concern (Cluster 2); respiratory depression, decreased oxygen saturation, and mental status changes (Cluster 3); tachycardia and staff concern (Cluster 4); mental status changes (Cluster 5); hypotension and staff concern (Cluster 6). Significant differences in patient characteristics were observed across RRS trigger clusters. Patients in Clusters 3 and 6 were associated with an increased likelihood of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA [p<0.01]), while Cluster 4 was associated with a decreased likelihood of IHCA (p<0.01). All clusters were associated with an increased risk of mortality (p<0.01). Conclusions: We discovered six novel RRS trigger clusters with differing relationships to adverse patient outcomes following RRS events. RRS trigger clusters may prove crucial in clarifying the associations between RRS events and adverse outcomes and may aid in clinician decision-making during RRS events.
