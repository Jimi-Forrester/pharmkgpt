38270122|a|The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasing in recent years as the world's population ages, which poses a significant challenge to public health. Due to the complexity of pathogenesis of AD, currently there is no effective treatment for it. In recent years, cell and gene therapy has attracted widespread attention in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) represent a novel cell-free therapy with numerous advantages over cell-based therapies owing to their low immunogenicity and high safety profile. We summarize recent progress in the application of EVs for treating AD and the specific mechanisms and outline the underlying mechanisms. We also explore various methods for optimizing the function of MSC-EVs, including gene editing, modifying stem cell culture conditions and peptide modification. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potentials of MSC-EVs, as well as the obstacles that currently impede their clinical utilization.
