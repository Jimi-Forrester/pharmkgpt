1846870|a|Previous studies suggest that an alteration of the neuroendocrine system may particularly occur in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT). In the present study the reactivity of the hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis (HPA) in the elderly was assessed by hormonal stimulation of the hypophysis. Twelve young men (aged 21-24 yr), 15 mentally healthy elderly (aged 65-90 yr), and 12 patients with SDAT (aged 60-84 yr) received an iv bolus injection containing 50 micrograms CRH and 0.5 IU lysine vasopressin after a baseline period of 2 h. ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone secretion was monitored over a period of 2 h before and after the injection. The baseline ACTH concentrations were increased in both groups of elderly, the baseline cortisol levels were not different in either group. The peak ACTH and cortisol levels were significantly elevated in the mentally healthy elderly, whereas senile demented patients showed a rise comparable with that in the young subjects. Moreover, in the demented patients the post-stimulus decline in plasma ACTH levels seemed to be delayed. Dehydroepiandrosterone was significantly lowered in subjects of all ages. Our results demonstrate an enhanced reactivity of the HPA in mentally healthy elderly. This is possibly due to a diminished sensitivity of the feedback regulation to glucocorticoids. However, SDAT patients had, compared to healthy elderly subjects, an attenuated response to CRH/lysine vasopressin and a prolonged ACTH secretion, indicating alterations of the HPA in this disease.
