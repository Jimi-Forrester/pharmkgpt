38898558|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry disease-specific molecular profiles, demonstrating massive potential in biomarker discovery. In this study, we developed an integrated biochip platform, termed EVID-biochip (EVs identification and detection biochip), which integrates in situ electrochemical protein detection with on-chip antifouling-immunomagnetic beads modified with CD81 antibodies and zwitterion molecules, enabling efficient isolation and detection of neuronal EVs. The capability of the EVID-biochip to isolate common EVs and detect neuronal EVs associated with Parkinson's disease in human serum is successfully demonstrated, using the transmembrane protein L1-cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) as a target biomarker. The EVID-biochip exhibited high efficiency and specificity for the detection of L1CAM with a sensitivity of 1 pg/mL. Based on the validation of 76 human serum samples, for the first time, this study discovered that the level of L1CAM/neuronal EV particles in serum could serve as a reliable indicator to distinguish Parkinson's disease from control groups with AUC = 0.973. EVID-biochip represents a reliable and rapid liquid biopsy platform for the analysis of complex biofluids offering EVs isolation and detection in a single chip, requiring a small sample volume (300 microL) and an assay time of 1.5 h. This approach has the potential to advance the diagnosis and biomarker discovery of various neurological disorders and other diseases.
