Materials and Methods: The cell injury model of HT-22 cells was induced by L-glutamate, and cell viability and damage were detected by CCK-8 and LDH assays. Generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by DCFH-DA in situ fluorescence method. The SOD activity and MDA concentration in the supernatants were determined by WST-8 and colorimetric method, respectively. Furthermore, Western blot and real-time qPCR analysis were utilized to detect the expression levels of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome proteins and genes. Results: L-Glutamate exposure induced cell injuries in HT-22 cells, and the concentration of 5 mM L-Glutamate was chosen to be the modeling condition. Co-treatment with BA significantly promoted cell viability and reduced LDH release in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BA attenuated the L-Glutamate-induced injuries by decreasing the ROS production and MDA concentration, while increasing the SOD activity. Moreover, we also found that BA treatment up-regulated the gene and protein expression of Nrf2 and HO-1, and then inhibited the expression of NLRP3. Conclusion: Our study found that BA could relieve oxidative stress damage of HT-22 cells induced by L-Glutamate, and the mechanism might be related to the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.
