30250823|a|Remarkable progress has been made in the field of cancer immunotherapy in the past few years. Immunotherapy has become a standard treatment option for patients with various cancers, including melanoma, lymphoma, and carcinomas of the lungs, kidneys, bladder, and head and neck. Promising immunotherapy approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy and therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoints, in particular cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 pathway (PD-1/PD-L1), have boosted the development of new therapeutic regimens for patients with cancer. Immunotherapeutic strategies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) include monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab), monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibodies (avelumab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. In this review, we outline the latest highlights and progress in using immunotherapy to treat patients with DLBCL, with a focus on the therapeutic blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and CAR T cell therapy in DLBCL. We also discuss current clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 and CAR T cell therapy and review the challenges and opportunities of using immunotherapy for the treatment of DLBCL.
