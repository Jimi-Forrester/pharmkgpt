38092757|a|The PD-DLB psychosis complex found in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) includes hallucinations, Somatic Symptom/Functional Disorders, and delusions. These disorders exhibit similar presentation patterns and progression. Mechanisms at the root of these symptoms also share similarities with processes promoting altered states of consciousness found in Rapid Eye Movement sleep, psychiatric disorders, or the intake of psychedelic compounds. We propose that these mechanisms find a crucial driver and trigger in the dysregulated activity of high-order thalamic nuclei set in motion by ThalamoCortical Dysrhythmia (TCD). TCD generates the loss of finely tuned cortico-cortical modulations promoted by the thalamus and unleashes the aberrant activity of the Default Mode Network (DMN). TCD moves in parallel with altered thalamic filtering of external and internal information. The process produces an input overload to the cortex, thereby exacerbating DMN decoupling from task-positive networks. These phenomena alter the brain metastability, creating dreamlike, dissociative, or altered states of consciousness. In support of this hypothesis, mind-altering psychedelic drugs also modulate thalamic-cortical pathways. Understanding the pathophysiological background of these conditions provides a conceptual bridge between neurology and psychiatry, thereby helping to generate a promising and converging area of investigation and therapeutic efforts.
