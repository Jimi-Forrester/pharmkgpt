39765405|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty and multimorbidity are common in older adults, but the prevalence and interaction of these conditions in surgical patients remain unclear. This study describes the clinical characteristics of a heterogeneous cohort of older UK surgical patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study during 5 days in March 2022, aiming to recruit all UK patients aged 60 yr and older undergoing surgery, excluding minor procedures (e.g. cataract surgery). Data were collected on patient characteristics, clinical care, frailty, and multimorbidity measures. RESULTS: A total of 7134 patients from 214 NHS hospitals were recruited, with a mean (sd) age of 72.8 (8.1) yr. Of all operations, 69% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67.9-70.1%) were elective, and 34% (95% CI 32.7-34.8%) were day cases. Of the patients, 19% (95% CI 18.3-20.1%) were living with frailty (Clinical Frailty Score >=5), and 63.1% (95% CI 62.0-64.3%) were living with multimorbidity (count of >=2 comorbidities). Those living with frailty, multimorbidity, or both were typically older, were from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and experienced greater polypharmacy and reduced independence. Patients living with frailty were less likely to undergo elective and day-case surgeries. Four out of five (78.8% [1079/1369]) of those who were living with frailty were also living with multimorbidity; 27.1% (1079/3978) of those who were living with multimorbidity were also living with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, one in five older patients undergoing surgery is living with frailty, and almost two-thirds of older patients are living with multimorbidity. These data highlight the importance of frailty screening. In addition, they can serve to guide resource allocation and provide comparative estimates for future research.
