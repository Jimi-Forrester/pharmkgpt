36380272|t|Regulation of aging by balancing mitochondrial function and antioxidant levels.
36380272|a|Aging is the deterioration of physiological mechanisms that is associated with getting old. There is a link between aging and mitochondrial function. However, there is an unresolved relationship between ATP levels and aging. To address this issue, we administered febuxostat (FBX), an inhibitor of human xanthine oxidase (XO)/xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), to C. elegans. We used C. elegans as a model to evaluate the effects of FBX and to challenge the enigma of the relationship between ATP and lifespan. In this study, we showed that FBX protects mitochondria and prevents age-related muscle deterioration in C. elegans. In addition, we showed that FBX administration could increase ATP levels without overloading the mitochondria while extending the lifespan. We also showed that the combination of FBX and an antioxidant as a protection against ROS prolongs lifespan more. We have shown that the antioxidant effects and increased ATP levels may lead to antiaging effects.
