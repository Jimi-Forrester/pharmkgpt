28302453|t|Brain rhythm attractor breakdown in Alzheimer's disease: Functional and pathologic implications.
28302453|a|This perspective binds emerging evidence on the bidirectional relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sleep disorders through a model of brain rhythm attractor breakdown. This approach explains behavioral-cognitive changes in AD across the sleep-wake cycle and supports a causal association between early brainstem tau pathology and subsequent cortical amyloid beta accumulation. Specifically, early tau dysregulation within brainstem-hypothalamic nuclei leads to breakdown of sleep-wake attractor networks, with patients displaying an attenuated range of behavioral and electrophysiological activity patterns, a "twilight zone" of constant activity between deep rest and full alertness. This constant cortical activity promotes activity-dependent amyloid beta accumulation in brain areas that modulate their activity across sleep-wake states, especially the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, the accompanying breakdown of hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex interplay across sleep stages could explain deficient memory consolidation through dysregulation of synaptic plasticity. Clinical implications include the potential therapeutic benefit of attractor consolidation (e.g., slow-wave sleep enhancers) in delaying AD progression.
