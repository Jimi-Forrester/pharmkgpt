36923695|a|Objective: To study the prevalence of autoantibodies to glial and neuronal antigens with a focus on glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) in patients with dementia. Methods: Sera of 127 patients with different forms of dementia and sera of 82 age-matched patients with various neurological diseases except for dementia, as well as sera from 15 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed for anti-glial or anti-neuronal IgG using 1) primary murine embryonic hippocampus cell cultures, 2) murine brain sections, 3) immunoblotting on mouse brain homogenates and 4) astrocyte cultures. Sera reacting with astrocytes in hippocampus cell cultures were further analyzed using HEK293 cells transfected with human GFAP. Results: IgG in serum from 45 of 127 (35.5%) patients with dementia but only 8 of 97 (8.2%, p <= 0.001) controls bound to either glial or neuronal structures in cultured murine hippocampus cells. In these cultures antibodies to astrocytes were detected in 35 of 127 (27.5%) of the dementia patients, whereas in controls antibodies to astrocytes were detected in 4 sera only (4.1%, p <= 0.001). Among the sera exhibiting reactivity to astrocytes, 14 of 35 (40%) showed immunoreaction to HEK293 cells transfected with GFAP in dementia patients, representing 11% of all sera. Within the 4 immunoreactive control sera reacting with astrocytes one reacted with GFAP (1.0% of total immunoreactivity, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Autoantibodies to glial epitopes in general and to GFAP in particular are more frequent in patients with dementia than in age-matched controls without dementia, thus indicating the need for further investigations regarding the potential pathophysiological relevance of these antibodies.
