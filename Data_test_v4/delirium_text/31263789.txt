31263789|t|Cognitive and Functional Status of Persons Newly Enrolled at Dementia-Specific Adult Day Centers and Burden of Their Caregivers.
31263789|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recognizing the important role that dementia-specific adult day centers have in maintaining persons with a neurocognitive disorder in their home, this article examines three critical indicators at the time when people first enroll in such a center: cognitive and functional impairment of the enrollee, and burden reported by their family caregivers. We also considered variations in these 3 indicators by race/ethnicity and by the relationship of caregiver to the new enrollee. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected by a nonprofit organization operating 11 dementia-specific adult day centers located on the east coast of Florida. Nursing staff conducted intake interviews with enrollees and their caregivers, and assessed functional status within one month of admission. Instruments included the Zarit Burden Scale and components of the Minimum Data Set: the Brief Interview for Mental Status (BIMS) and 4 measures of functional status. RESULTS: On average the cognitive scores of newly enrollees were well-within the range indicated for severe impairment, and these levels did not differ by race/ethnicity. Burden reported by caregivers however differed significantly, with Latinx caregivers reporting the greatest burden and African American/Black caregivers reporting the least. Further, while daughters generally reported higher levels of burden than other family caregivers, Black daughters reported the least. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest a need for greater dissemination efforts about adult day programs to the Latinx community, as well as attention to the disparate burden placed upon differing family relationships of caregivers to enrollees.
