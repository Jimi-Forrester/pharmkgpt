22701207|t|Comparative evaluation of incidence of emergence agitation and post-operative recovery profile in paediatric patients after isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane anaesthesia.
22701207|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation (EA), although well documented in the clinical literature, still has uncertainties and confusion abound on this subject because of the absence of a clear definition and lack of reliable and valid assessment tools. AIM: To compare the incidence and severity of EA and recovery characteristics in paediatric patients under isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane anaesthesia and evaluate the effect of age and duration of anaesthesia on the incidence of EA. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Randomized prospective double-blinded study. METHODS: Seventy-five American Society of Anaesthesiologists I and II patients, aged between 4 months and 7 years, were included in the study. Patients were induced with sevoflurane and oxygen. Anaesthesia was maintained with O(2) + N(2)O and isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane according to randomization. Caudal block and paracetamol suppository was administered before the surgical incision. In the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), degree of agitation was assessed using the Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale. Aldrette score, Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability score and any adverse events were noted. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Chi-square/Fischer exact test was applied for categorical variables; for continuous variables, the analysis of variance/non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test was applied. Two-sample t-test/non-parametric Wisconsin Mann-Whitney test was applied between the two groups. Statistical significance was determined at P<0.05. RESULTS: Incidence and intensity of EA were comparable in all three groups. Age and duration of anaesthesia do not appear to have any bearing on the incidence of EA. Rapid emergence with sevoflurane and desflurane did not translate into early discharge from PACU. CONCLUSIONS: EA is a multifactorial syndrome. More well-conducted studies using validated scales and standardized protocols should be carried out to better understand this phenomenon.
