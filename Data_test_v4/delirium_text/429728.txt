429728|a|The incidence of cerebral lesions in relation to myocardial infarction (MI) was evaluated on the basis of data obtained from medical records and autopsy reports on 269 psychogeriatric patients, in a 13-year retrospective study. Among 84 demented patients with MI, brain infarcts and hemorrhages were found in 42 percent, and Alzheimer's disease in 17 percent; (combination in 8 percent). In contrast, among 70 demented patients without MI, brain infarcts and hemorrhages were found in 11 percent, and Alzheimer's disease in 43 percent; (combination in 6 percent). Therefore, when it is difficult to differentiate senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease) from dementia due to cerebrovascular impairment, data on the presence or absence of myocardial infarction may prove useful.
