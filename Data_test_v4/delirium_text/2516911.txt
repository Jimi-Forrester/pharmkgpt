2516911|t|[Electrolyte disorders, EEG changes and epileptic seizures in alcohol withdrawal delirium].
2516911|a|For 180 patients suffering alcohol-withdrawal induced delirium, electrolytic concentration in the serum of Na, K, Ca, and Mg was determined in the early withdrawal phase, and the electroencephalograms of 95 delirium patients evaluated in respect of local and diffuse changes and epileptic activity, and compared in delirium patients with and without initial seizures. Delirium patients who had initial seizures suffered significantly longer-lasting periods of delirium and significantly more frequent electrolytic changes in the form of hypomagnesemia and hypopotassemia (hypokalemia). There was no significant difference in the EEG changes. A temporary metabolic disorder in the initial phase of the two-phase withdrawal process should be assumed to be the cause of seizures during alcohol withdrawal, and the pathogenetic significance of hypomagnesemia and hypopotassemia should be taken into consideration.
