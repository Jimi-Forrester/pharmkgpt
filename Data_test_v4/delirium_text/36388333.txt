36388333|a|Background and aims: Along with an aging population, exploring the impact of oral health on holistic health and determining exact outcomes in elderly individuals are important in both scientific research and clinical practice. Significant increase in the number of systematic reviews shows that oral health can directly or indirectly affect the overall health of elderly people physically, mentally and socially. To systematically collate, appraise, and synthesize the current evidence, we carried out an umbrella review of the impacts of oral health on holistic health in elderly individuals. Methods: A systematic reviews and meta-analyses search was performed in the major databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception to February 1, 2022, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses was referred to assess methodological quality, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, assessment, Development, and Evaluation working group classification) was used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome included in the umbrella review. Results: Out of 1,067 records, a total of 35 systematic reviews were included. Respiratory diseases, malnutrition, age-related oral changes, frailty, cognitive impairment, depression and poor quality of life were identified as seven key outcomes that affect the physical, mental and social health of elderly individuals. Meanwhile, three intervention measures of oral health were summarized as (i) more rigorous and universal scales, (ii) dental cleaning and denture installation, and (iii) improving self-awareness regarding oral care. Conclusions: Evidence showed that oral health can significantly affect holistic health, and the diverse oral diseases directly lead to multiple health outcomes in elderly individuals. Clear high-quality evidence revealed that oral health is strongly associated with seven health outcomes covering physical, mental, and social levels, which directly corresponds to holistic health, and impacts the quality of life of elderly individuals. Such the results remind the importance of oral care in public health, and further studies need to be conducted to verity more specific association between oral health and other chronic diseases.
