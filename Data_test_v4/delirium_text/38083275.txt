38083275|t|Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Vascular Fingerprinting During Hypercapnia for Quantitative and Multiparametric Cerebrovascular Reactivity Measures.
38083275|a|Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) represents a potential paradigm shift in MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis using computational biophysical modelling in parallel to image acquisition. Its flexibility allows for examination of cerebrovascular metrics through MR vascular fingerprinting (MRvF), and this has been extended even further to produce quantitative cerebral blood volume (CBV), microvascular vessel radius, and tissue oxygen saturation (SO2) maps of the whole brain simultaneously every few seconds. This allows for observation of rapid physiological changes like cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which is the ability of vessels to dilate in response to a vasoactive stimulus. Here we demonstrated a novel protocol in which a rapid, spin- and gradient-echo pulse sequence allowed for dynamic, and simultaneous acquisition of MRvF and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) measures. By combining this with a tailored hypercapnic (5% CO2) breathing paradigm we were able to show how these quantitative CBV, radius, and SO2 parameters changed in response to a stimulus and directly compare those to a colocalized, traditionally used BOLD CVR. We also compared these measures to another traditionally utilized technique in cerebral blood flow CVR from an arterial spin labelling sequence. These imaging, processing, and analysis techniques will allow for further investigation into the magnitude and rate of CVR based on BOLD and MRvF-based metrics and enable investigations to better understand vascular function in healthy aging and cerebrovascular diseases.Clinical Relevance- The development of dynamic magnetic resonance vascular fingerprinting has the potential to enable rapid, quantitative, and multiparametric functional imaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular diseases like vascular cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.
