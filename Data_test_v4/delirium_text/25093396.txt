25093396|a|Executive dysfunction (ED) in geriatric depression (GD) is common, predicts poor clinical outcomes and often persists despite remission of symptoms. Here we develop a neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive remediation-geriatric depression treatment (nCCR-GD) to target ED in GD. Our assumption is that remediation of these deficits may modulate the underlying brain network abnormalities shared by ED and depression. We compare nCCR-GD to a gold-standard treatment (escitalopram: 20 mg per 12 weeks) in 11 treatment-resistant older adults with major depression; and 33 matched historical controls. We find that 91% of participants complete nCCR-GD. nCCR-GD is equally as effective at reducing depressive symptoms as escitalopram but does so in 4 weeks instead of 12. In addition, nCCR-GD improves measures of executive function more than the escitalopram. We conclude that nCCR-GD may be equally effective as escitalopram in treating GD. In addition, nCCR-GD participants showed greater improvement in executive functions than historical controls treated with escitalopram.
