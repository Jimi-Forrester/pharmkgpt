36738678|a|The TAM receptors may help delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease associated with human aging. The TAM receptors, derived from the first letter of its three constituents -Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk, are associated with immune responses, cellular differentiation and migration, and clearance of apoptotic cells and debris, with the two canonical ligands, Growth Arrest Specific 6 (Gas6) and ProS1. Several kinds of research have indicated the participation of the TAM system in AD pathology. Also, the TAMs regulate multiple features of microglia, the significant sensors of disorder in the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we describe the biology of the TAM receptors and ligands in the CNS. Then, we discuss the relationship between the TAM system and AD, specially focusing on its functional expression in the microglia. Finally, we also summarize some agents that could interfere with the TAM signaling pathways and discuss potential difficulties and strategies for drug development.
