21539718|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common among older people in hospital and various instruments have been developed for detecting delirium. One of these, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, is easy for nurses to administrate but needs to be tested further. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the validity and predictive value of the NEECHAM Confusion Scale. METHODS: The study was conducted among 149 patients aged >= 65, who had undergone surgery for a hip fracture. The patients were observed daily using DSM-IV criteria for delirium. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale was performed upon admission and prior to discharge. RESULTS: The incidence of DSM-IV related delirium was 24%. Patients who scored below 25 points on the NEECHAM scale had a 12 times higher risk of developing DSM-IV related delirium. During admission, the sensitivity of NEECHAM was zero because all patients with DSM-IV delirium were excluded, the specificity was 75%. On discharge, it was 100% and 91% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the body of knowledge that NEECHAM discriminates for delirium. It is a valid and reliable screening instrument for predicting delirium. The instrument can be used for clinical practice to identify patients who are at risk of contracting delirium and when considering prevention measures.
