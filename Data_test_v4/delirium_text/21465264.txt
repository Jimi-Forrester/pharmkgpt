21465264|t|Interleukin-1beta promoter (-31T/C and -511C/T) polymorphisms in major recurrent depression.
21465264|a|To elucidate a genetic predisposition to major depressive disorder, we investigated two polymorphisms (-31T/C and -511C/T) in the interleukin-1beta promoter region in patients who suffered from major recurrent depression. The aim of the current work was to compare alleles and genotype layout between patients with major recurrent depression and healthy people. We would like to indicate such combination of genotypes which corresponds with major recurrent depression. Correlations between genotypes for analyzed polymorphisms and number of episodes, number of points in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and age of onset were investigated as well. The study group consisted of 94 patients diagnosed with major recurrent depression. The control group included 206 healthy individuals. Both groups involved representatives of Caucasian population. Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by using PCR-RFLP technique. A specific haplotype, composed of the C allele at -31 and the T allele at -511, has a tendency to have a statistically significant difference (p = 0.064) between patients and control group. Correspondence analysis revealed that genotype T/T at -31 and genotype C/C at -511 are associated with major recurrent depression. No association was found between genotypes for studied polymorphic sites and number of episodes, number of points in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and age of onset.
