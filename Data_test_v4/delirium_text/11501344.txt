11501344|t|An overview of AIDS dementia complex.
11501344|a|The major neurological complications associated with HIV infection include cognitive, behavioral, and motor disturbances, which may range in severity from subtle, mild cognitive deficits to the clinical syndrome referred to as HIV-associated dementia or AIDS dementia complex (ADC). As with Alzheimer's type dementia, caregivers for people with HIV/AIDS have the overwhelming and burdensome task of caring for someone with deteriorating cognitive abilities, increasing physical debilitation, and changes in personality. This article describes ADC as well as some of the similarities and differences from Alzheimer's type dementia, and offers some special considerations for older adults and HIV.
