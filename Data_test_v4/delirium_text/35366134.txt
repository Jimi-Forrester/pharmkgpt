35366134|a|Iron levels in mitochondria are critically important for the normal functioning of the organelle. Abnormal levels of iron and the associated formation of toxic oxygen radicals have been linked to a wide range of diseases and consequently it is important to be able to both monitor and control levels of the mitochondrial labile iron pool. To this end a series of iron chelators which are targeted to mitochondria have been designed. This overview describes the synthesis of some of these molecules and their application in monitoring mitochondrial labile iron pools and in selectively removing excess iron from mitochondria.
