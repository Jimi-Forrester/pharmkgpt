31372555|a|INTRODUCTION: Physical inactivity often accompanies chronic pathologies. This induces a sedentariness that favors complications and patient isolation. There is a growing scientific interest in the practice of art, for such activities leave the usual healthcare framework and include the World Health Organization (WHO)'s three dimensions of health. Dance is a universal activity that has been identified as healthy. This scoping review's aim is to study the benefits, modalities and risks of dance for persons with a chronic pathology. METHOD: The literature research was conducted in English and French, using PubMed and Kinedoc's databases, and keywords related to dance and chronic pathologies. Dance activities that did not involve a dance instructor or a trained health professional were excluded. Studies' location and design, the chosen type of dance, pathologies, the number of subjects, modalities, intended effects and adverse effects were then studied. RESULTS: 51 studies were included in this work. 47.5% were RCTs and 47% originate from North America. The number of published studies is strongly increasing. Sixteen different pathologies were studied, with a large predominance of neurology diseases. Targeted effects were the impacts on mental health, quality of life, physical and motor capacities and pathology-specific symptoms. Dance activities are deemed feasible, and no adverse effects were identified. DISCUSSION: In the event of chronic pathologies, practicing dance is possible; it is stimulating and effective against sedentariness and its adverse effects. Patient adherence is good, and dance seems to respond to the multidimensional component of chronic diseases, while offering unlimited adaptation to patients' physical and cognitive impairments. There are few studies yet, and their methodological quality is moderate, which is why further research work must confirm dance's interest regarding chronic pathologies.
