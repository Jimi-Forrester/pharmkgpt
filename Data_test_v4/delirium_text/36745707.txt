However, the treatment response of gait disturbance in those patients may constitute a more interesting issue that is rarely addressed. METHODS: In this prospective, interventional study, we included 14 consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of AD. Basal gait analysis was performed using a 'Gait Analyzer' program that was uploaded to a mobile phone. The gait parameters including Step time (ST), step length (SL), step number (SN), gait velocity (GV), and cadence were measured. Afterward, donepezil 5 mg daily was initiated, and the re-assessments were re-performed 8 weeks after the treatment. RESULTS: The mean age was 71.78 +- 5.02 (F/M = 8/6). The evaluations after the donepezil treatment showed that there was a significant improvement in the SN (p = 0.021) and SL (p = 0.001) in comparison to the basal evaluations. The repeated analysis in the subgroup of early-stage AD subjects (n = 10) yielded that there were significant improvements in SN (p = 0.003), SL (p = 0.005), and cadence (p = 0.026) after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the efficiency of cholinergic treatment in gait functions in AD subjects.
