39299297|a|OBJECTIVE: Oropharyngeal dysphagia (dysphagia) is highly prevalent (up to 86%) in hospitalized patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). This study aims to describe the management and clinical course of dysphagia in hospitalized patients with ADRD. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted across 10 hospitals within a large health system in New York. Participants were older adults with ADRD admitted to the medicine service and diagnosed with dysphagia to liquids on speech-language pathologist (SLP) assessment and were recruited between January and June 2023. METHODS: Baseline characteristics (eg, dementia Functional Assessment Staging Tool [FAST]), dysphagia management (eg, prescribed diet), and clinical course (eg, dysphagia improvement, respiratory complications) were collected. RESULTS: Of patients with ADRD and dysphagia (n = 62), the average age was 86.5 and 66.1% were FAST Stage 7. On admission, 48.4% had pneumonia, 79.0% had delirium, and 69.4% were made nil per os (NPO) for aspiration risk. Of those who received SLP reassessment after diet initiation (n = 25), 76% demonstrated dysphagia improvement; 75% of patients with FAST stage 7 demonstrated improvement. Respiratory complications occurred in 21.0% of patients on the following diets: NPO, nasogastric tube feeding, dysphagia diets, and comfort feeds. In univariate analyses, hospital-acquired dehydration, no dysphagia improvement, and delirium were associated with respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The potential for dysphagia improvement in hospitalized patients with ADRD (even those with advanced dementia) highlights the critical need for standardizing reassessment. Further studies are needed to evaluate factors associated with respiratory complications in this population.
