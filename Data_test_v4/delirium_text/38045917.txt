38045917|a|Background: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is a common complication occurring in surgical practice. This study aims to comprehensively review the collaboration and impact of countries, institutions, authors, journals, keywords, and critical papers on intraoperative hypotension from the perspective of bibliometric, and to evaluate the evolution of knowledge structure clustering and identify research hotspots and emerging topics. Methods: Articles and reviews related to IOH published from 2004 to 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analyses and visualization were conducted on Excel, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix (R-Tool of R-Studio). Results: A total of 1,784 articles and reviews were included from 2004 to 2022. The number of articles on IOH gradually increased in the past few years, and peaked in 2021. These publications were chiefly from 1,938 institutions in 40 countries, led by America and China in publications. Sessler Daniel I published the most papers and enjoyed the highest number of citations. Analysis of the journals with the most outputs showed that most journals concentrated on perioperative medicine and clinical anesthesiology. Delirium, acute kidney injury and vasoconstrictor agents are the current and developing research hotspots. The keywords "Acute kidney injury", "postoperative complication", "machine learning", "risk factors" and "hemodynamic instability" may also become new trends and focuses of the near future research. Conclusion: This study uses bibliometrics and visualization methods to comprehensively review the research on intraoperative hypotension, which is helpful for scholars to better understand the dynamic evolution of IOH and provide directions for future research.
