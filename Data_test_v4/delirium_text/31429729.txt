METHODS: Three-week-old domestic cats were divided into a control group (n = 10) and a monocular deprivation group (n = 20), with an eye mask covering the right eye of those in the deprived group. After pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP) recording confirmed the formation of monocular amblyopia, the left LGBd was isolated from 5 kittens in each group. The remaining control kittens continued to be raised, and the remaining deprivation group was divided into a VIP intervention group (n = 5), Sefsol (caprylic acid monoglyceride, VIP solution) intervention group (n = 5) and amblyopia non-intervention group (n = 5) after removal of the eye mask. Three weeks later, PVEPs, VIP immunohistochemistry and VIP mRNA expression in the left LGBd were compared across groups. RESULTS: At 6 weeks of age, there were significant differences in P100 wave latency and amplitude and VIP immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization between the control group and the deprivation group (P < 0.05). After 3 weeks of the corresponding interventions, the latency and amplitude in the VIP intervention group were better than that in the Sefsol intervention group and amblyopia non-intervention group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, VIP treatment increased the number of immunohistochemical VIP-positive cells (P < 0.05) and the average optical density of positive cells (P > 0.05), as well as the number (P < 0.05) and average optical density of VIP mRNA-positive cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VIP plays an important role in visual development. Nasal administration of VIP can improve the function of neurons in the LGBd of kittens and has a certain therapeutic effect on amblyopia.
