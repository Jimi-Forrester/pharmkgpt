37347628|a|Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very challenging problem and has been attempted through data-driven methods in recent years. However, considering the inherent complexity in decoding higher cognitive functions from spontaneous neuronal signals, these data-driven methods benefit from the incorporation of multimodal data. This work proposes an ensembled machine learning model with explainability (EXML) to detect subtle patterns in cortical and hippocampal local field potential signals (LFPs) that can be considered as a potential marker for AD in the early stage of the disease. The LFPs acquired from healthy and two types of AD animal models (n=10 each) using linear multielectrode probes were endorsed by electrocardiogram and respiration signals for their veracity. Feature sets were generated from LFPs in temporal, spatial and spectral domains and were fed into selected machine-learning models for each domain. Using late fusion, the EXML model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.4%. This provided insights into the amyloid plaque deposition process as early as 3 months of the disease onset by identifying the subtle patterns in the network activities. Lastly, the individual and ensemble models were found to be robust when evaluated by randomly masking channels to mimic the presence of artefacts.
