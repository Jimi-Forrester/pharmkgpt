12958004|a|BACKGROUND: Transnational and psychometrically appropriate versions of instruments used in the diagnosis of dementia are essential for comparing information between different countries. The Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly incorporates a brief neuropsychological test battery, Cambridge Cognitive Examination (recently revised version), which provides objective data on performance across a number of cognitive domains. OBJECTIVE: To harmonise the Cambridge Cognitive Examination between seven European countries. METHOD: 40 patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease of each of the seven countries were administered the Cambridge Cognitive Examination. The Nurse Observation Scale for Geriatrics was used to assess concordance between cognitive and behavioural measures. RESULTS: Only small differences between the various Cambridge Cognitive Examination versions were found, and patterns of correlation between Cambridge Cognitive Examination and the Nurse Observation Scale for Geriatrics were consistent. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the harmonisation of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination was successful.
