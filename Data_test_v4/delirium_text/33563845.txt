33563845|t|Aortic Root Reconstruction with TachoSil Fibrin Sealant Patch in Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.
33563845|a|PURPOSE: We propose a novel technique for reconstruction of the dissected aortic root with the use of TachoSil fibrin sealant patch. METHODS: Patients with acute type A aortic dissection involving the aortic root were included. Appropriately prepared TachoSil fibrin sealant patch was placed between the dissected layers of the aortic root to achieve their durable fusion. Thus, the false lumen was eliminated, and the anatomical and functional structure of the aortic wall was restored. RESULTS: In all, 13 patients mean aged 57 +- 10.3 years underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection with the use of TachoSil fibrin sealant patch. All patients survived the surgery. The mean follow-up time was 30.8 +- 16.4 months. Follow-up computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans confirmed no aortic root dissection in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: This technique ensures durable restoration of the aortic wall structure, eliminates the secondary aortic valve regurgitation, and allows for the preservation of patients' native aortic valve.
