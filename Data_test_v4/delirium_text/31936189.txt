31936189|t|Roots and Leaf Extracts of Dipsacus fullonum L. and Their Biological Activities.
31936189|a|The aim of the study was to identify and evaluate the content of iridoids and phenolic compounds in the leaves and roots of Dipsacus fullonum L. They were identified and quantified by UPLC-PDA-MS/MS. Five iridoid compounds (loganic acid, loganin, sweroside, cantleyoside, and sylvestroside III) were identified in Dipsacus fullonum L. leaves and roots. Seven phenolic acids and three flavones were identified in the leaves, and seven phenolic acids were detected in the roots. The leaves contained more iridoids and phenolic compounds than the roots. We also evaluated the antimicrobial (anti-bacterial and anti-yeast), antioxidant (ORAC methods), and antiacetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities of Dipsacus fullonum L. leaves and roots. Leaf extract demonstrated the strongest antioxidant activity, but roots showed stronger antiacetylcholinesterase activity than leaves. The study also confirmed antibacterial activity of root-derived compounds against Staphylococcus aureus DSM 799 and Escherichia coli ATCC 10536.
