33499137|t|Reviving the Autopsy for Modern Cancer Evolution Research.
33499137|a|Outstanding questions plaguing oncologists, centred around tumour evolution and heterogeneity, include the development of treatment resistance, immune evasion, and optimal drug targeting strategies. Such questions are difficult to study in limited cancer tissues collected during a patient's routine clinical care, and may be better investigated in the breadth of cancer tissues that may be permissible to collect during autopsies. We are starting to better understand key tumour evolution challenges based on advances facilitated by autopsy studies completed to date. This review article explores the great progress in understanding that cancer tissues collected at autopsy have already enabled, including the shared origin of metastatic cells, the importance of early whole-genome doubling events for amplifying genes needed for tumour survival, and the creation of a wealth of tissue resources powered to answer future questions, including patient-derived xenografts, cell lines, and a wide range of banked tissues. We also highlight the future role of these programmes in advancing our understanding of cancer evolution. The research autopsy provides a special opportunity for cancer patients to give the ultimate gift-to selflessly donate their tissues towards better cancer care.
