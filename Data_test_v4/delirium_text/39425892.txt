39425892|a|Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease that most often affects elderly individuals and has a significant negative impact on quality of life. The disease is characterized primarily by autoantibodies to hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and/or BP230, and an inflammatory reaction with notable features of type 2 inflammation, including elevated serum IgE, increased numbers of eosinophils in lesions and peripheral blood, and elevated expression of type 2 cytokines and chemokines in skin lesions. In this review, we present what is known about BP pathophysiology, including the role of type 2 inflammation, and discuss how findings from studies of biologics targeting type 2 immune mediators have helped to clarify the biological mechanisms driving BP pathophysiology. Future studies of these targeted therapies and others in development will help to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying BP pathophysiology and potentially provide better treatment options for patients.
