35440745|a|Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and peonidin-3-glucoside (P3G) in black rice grain (BRG) demonstrate many beneficial health effects, including antioxidant and anti-aging properties. This research aimed to study on pulsed electric field assisted water extraction (PEF-AWE) on BRG using pre-treatment technique, which was determined for enhanced yields of C3G and P3G, antioxidant and sirtuin1 enzyme stimulation activities. The effects of operating parameters for PEF-AWE (intensity of electric field, X1: 3-5 kV/cm, number of pulse, X2: 1000-3000 pulse and BRG/water ratio, X3: 0.1-0.5 g/mL) were determined using regression analysis and optimized PEF-AWE condition using the response surface methodology. Regression models showed the intensity of electric field and BRG/water ratio were the strong influence parameters significantly on C3G (p < 0.01). The results highlighted optimized conditions of PEF-AWE followed by 5 kV/cm, 3000 pulse and 0.5 g/mL leading to achieve higher C3G (92.59 +- 4.79 mg/g) and P3G (4.59 +- 0.27 mg/g) than no pre-treatment by PEF process, approximately 60%. Additionally, PEF extracts of BRG can modulate the ability of surtuin1 enzyme to deacetylate substrate proteins (26.78 +- 0.50 FIR). Thus, PEF-AWE can be applied to produce BRG extract as natural antioxidant compound and functional ingredient.
