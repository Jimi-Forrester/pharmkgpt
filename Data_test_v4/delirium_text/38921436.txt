38921436|t|Discovery of Delirium Biomarkers through Minimally Invasive Serum Molecular Fingerprinting.
38921436|a|Delirium presents a significant clinical challenge, primarily due to its profound impact on patient outcomes and the limitations of the current diagnostic methods, which are largely subjective. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this challenge was intensified as the frequency of delirium assessments decreased in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), even as the prevalence of delirium among critically ill patients increased. The present study evaluated how the serum molecular fingerprint, as acquired by Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy, can enable the development of predictive models for delirium. A preliminary univariate analysis of serum FTIR spectra indicated significantly different bands between 26 ICU patients with delirium and 26 patients without, all of whom were admitted with COVID-19. However, these bands resulted in a poorly performing Naive-Bayes predictive model. Considering the use of a Fast-Correlation-Based Filter for feature selection, it was possible to define a new set of spectral bands with a wider coverage of molecular functional groups. These bands ensured an excellent Naive-Bayes predictive model, with an AUC, a sensitivity, and a specificity all exceeding 0.92. These spectral bands, acquired through a minimally invasive analysis and obtained rapidly, economically, and in a high-throughput mode, therefore offer significant potential for managing delirium in critically ill patients.
