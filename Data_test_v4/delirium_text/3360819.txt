3360819|t|Postburn delirium associated with use of intravenous lorazepam.
3360819|a|A case of delirium with persecutory delusions is reported, which occurred three days after a previously healthy male suffered burns over 30% of his total body surface area. Routine evaluation was negative for other etiology of delirium, and the symptoms spontaneously remitted within seven hours with no sequella. We found that the benefits and potential side effects of intravenous lorazepam are similar to but of longer duration than those of intravenous diazepam. The effects of intravenous lorazepam should be recognized in the differential diagnosis of postburn delirium in patients given this medication.
