39063050|t|Establishing Normal Serum Values of Neurofilament Light Chains and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Considering the Effects of Age and Other Demographic Factors in Healthy Adults.
39063050|a|Multiple studies have shown the importance of blood-based biomarkers indicating axonal damage (serum neurofilament light chains [sNfL]) or astroglia activation (serum glial fibrillary acidic protein [sGFAP]) for monitoring different neurological diseases. However, normal values of these variables remain to be clearly defined, partly due to the influence of different demographic factors. We investigated demographic differences in a cohort of healthy volunteers. A cross-sectional study was conducted including 116 healthy controls with ages between 18 and 69 years (67.5% females; n = 79). sNfL and sGFAP concentrations were measured using single-molecule arrays. Age and body mass index affected sNfL values, and age was found to be the most important factor. The normal values changed with age, and we established normal values for individuals younger than 45 years as <10 pg/mL and for controls older than 45 years as <15 pg/mL. We established normal values at <10 pg/mL for individuals younger than 45 years and <15 pg/mL for older individuals. Alternatively, a Z-score of 1.5 was relevant for all controls. sGFAP was only affected by age. Differences in normal values were evident by 55 years. The highest normality limit for sGFAP was 140 pg/mL for controls under 55 years and 280 for older controls. We defined normal levels for sNfL and sGFAP and their corresponding age-associated changes. These data may contribute to the application of such variables in clinical practice.
