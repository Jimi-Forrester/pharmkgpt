39448901|a|BACKGROUND: Psychiatric emergencies pose a special challenge for emergency physicians. It is known from other areas of medicine that the influence of a doctor's gender can have an impact on the type of treatment and quality of patient care. However, this has not yet been investigated in the context of prehospital care in psychiatric emergencies. OBJECTIVES: To identify whether the gender of the prehospital emergency physicians has an influence on the "on-scene" time, treatment strategy and on the potential escalation of interventions for patients with a psychiatric diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of emergency missions with a psychiatric diagnosis was performed between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2021 at the Department of Emergency Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Ulm, Germany. RESULTS: 2882 emergency missions with a psychiatric indication/prehospital psychiatric diagnosis were studied and divided into: intoxication (n = 1343, 46.6%), suicidal behavior (n = 488, 16.9%), exceptional mental situation (n = 282, 9.8%), agitation (n = 262, 9.1%), anxiety and panic disorders (n = 262, 9.1%) and "psychiatric miscellaneous" (n = 245, 8.5%). Inpatient hospitalization occurred in 67.9% (n = 1958) of emergency missions. Of these, 20.3% (n = 392) were admitted directly to a psychiatric hospital. Male emergency physicians had a slightly longer "on-scene" time for psychiatric emergencies than female emergency physicians (p = 0.024). However, the variance in "on-scene" time for all interventions was significantly greater for female emergency physicians than for male emergency physicians (p = 0.025). Male emergency physicians were significantly more likely than their female counterparts to administer intravenous hypnotics in prehospital psychiatric emergencies (p = 0.001). For psychiatric patients who refused medically indicated inpatient psychiatric admission ("involuntary psychiatric admission"), male and female emergency physicians were equally likely to take the required action (p = 0.522). However, male emergency physicians were significantly more likely to administer an intravenous hypnotic to enforce involuntary admission (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other medical specialties where the influence of physician gender on patient care is certainly relevant, the gender of prehospital emergency physicians also appears to influence their prehospital management strategy in psychiatric emergencies. The influence of gender is sometimes subtle and limited to specific aspects, such as the administration of hypnotics. Prospective study designs are needed to thoroughly investigate the influence of the gender of the prehospital emergency physician on the quality of care in psychiatric emergencies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Ulm, Trial-Code No. 110/22 and was prospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00031237). Patient information was not required for retrospective data analysis.
