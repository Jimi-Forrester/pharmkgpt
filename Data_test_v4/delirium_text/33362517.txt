33362517|a|Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a pathology of low incidence and prevalence worldwide; it is accompanied by symptoms such as dystonia, rigid akinetic syndrome (bradykinesia), gait disturbances, neurological deterioration associated with severe cortical subcortical atrophy, and progressive to moderate to severe neurocognitive deficits, especially in immediate verbal memory and dorsolateral or dysexecutive syndrome. We identified neurocognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient diagnosed with CBD. Participant was a 70-year-old female patient, single; she presented progressive memory loss of an immediate verbal nature. Initially, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, finding that she had no characteristic signs and symptoms of these pathologies. The patient presented conciliation insomnia, gait disturbances, and severe neurocognitive deficit, especially in executive functions, immediate verbal memory, and visuospatial functioning. It was found that the patient presented neurocognitive alterations of the executive type (frontal lobe) such as decision making, planning, inhibition and operative memory, correlated with a severe alteration in her basic, instrumental and advanced activities of daily life, with a high risk factor for developing dementia. It is necessary to diagnose in an assertive and timely manner in order to generate functional neurorehabilitation plans in people diagnosed with CBD, with the main objective of positively impacting quality of life, at the individual, family, and social level.
