36907138|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes neurodegeneration, leading to cognitive impairment and memory loss. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the induction of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34 (GADD34) by quercetin can affect eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation-activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4) signaling. However, the relationship between GADD34 expression and cognitive function has not been clarified. In this study, we determined the direct effect of GADD34 on memory. To achieve this, truncated GADD34 (GADD34.5) was injected into the mouse brain to suppress eIF2alpha phosphorylation and evaluate memory. The injection of GADD34.5 into the hippocampus in AD-model mice did not improve novel object recognition but improved novel object location. The injection of GADD34.5 into the amygdala also resulted in the maintenance of contextual fear memory based on the fear condition test. These results suggest that GADD34 is effective in improving memory for spatial cognition and contextual fear conditioning in AD by inhibiting eIF2alpha phosphorylation. In summary, GADD34 suppresses eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the brain and prevents memory loss. As quercetin feeding increases GADD34 expression, it might be used in preventative applications for AD.
