34863232|t|Determining association between blood glucose variability and postoperative delirium in acute aortic dissection patients: methodological issues.
34863232|a|The letter to the editor made several comments regarding possible methodological issues in the recent article by Lin et al. determining the association between blood glucose variability and postoperative delirium in patients undergoing acute aortic dissection surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, which is published in Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery. 2021; 16(1):82. Our concerns included the lack of some important perioperative factors associated with postoperative delirium, the process of establishing multivariate model and the method of using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess the predictive performance of the standard deviation of blood glucose for the development of POD. We would like to invite the authors to comment on these and believe that clarifying these issues would improve the transparency of this study and interpretation of findings.
