36619366|t|Management of Psychosis Associated with Graves' Disease: A Rare Case Report.
36619366|a|Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease in which patients can rarely present with psychiatric symptoms. In these patients, detailed history with psychiatric evaluation using a mental status examination is crucial for the early identification of psychiatric manifestations. Early intervention with medical and surgical therapy can help effectively treat the condition and prevent adverse outcomes such as catatonia. We reported the case of a 25-year-old African American female with Graves' disease who had significant stressors and presented with auditory hallucinations. She was diagnosed with psychosis secondary to Graves' disease and was managed medically using antithyroid drugs and beta-blockers. On failure of medical therapy, a surgical approach was employed. The patient was managed successfully, and her condition improved. Our case highlights that the importance of early intervention in these cases can lead to successful outcomes in patients with Graves' disease-induced psychosis.
