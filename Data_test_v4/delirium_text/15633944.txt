15633944|a|A growing number of studies have investigated the relationship between the elderly subjective memory complaint and their actual memory performance. If memory complaints can be used as indicators of actual memory deficits, these complaints could be an invaluable test for early detection and management of dementia disorders. This study examined the relationships between the elderly subjective memory complaint and their objective memory performance while taking into account several factors such as health and depression. The individuals with subjective memory deficits scored higher on the depression scale in comparison to the individuals without subjective memory problems. However, the alert elderly subjective complaints should be taken seriously while evaluating for dementia.
