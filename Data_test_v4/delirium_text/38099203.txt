38099203|t|Challenges and innovations in brain PET analysis of neurodegenerative disorders: a mini-review on partial volume effects, small brain region studies, and reference region selection.
38099203|a|Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain imaging is increasingly utilized in clinical and research settings due to its unique ability to study biological processes and subtle changes in living subjects. However, PET imaging is not without its limitations. Currently, bias introduced by partial volume effect (PVE) and poor signal-to-noise ratios of some radiotracers can hamper accurate quantification. Technological advancements like ultra-high-resolution scanners and improvements in radiochemistry are on the horizon to address these challenges. This will enable the study of smaller brain regions and may require more sophisticated methods (e.g., data-driven approaches like unsupervised clustering) for reference region selection and to improve quantification accuracy. This review delves into some of these critical aspects of PET molecular imaging and offers suggested strategies for improvement. This will be illustrated by showing examples for dopaminergic and cholinergic nerve terminal ligands.
