27444037|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze the mortality and morbidity of patients undergoing open aortic arch reconstruction for acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS: Between September 2005 and January 2012, 267 consecutive patients underwent open aortic arch reconstruction for acute type A aortic dissection at our center. The mean age was 51.2 +- 10.0 years, and 200 patients were male. Sixty-three and 184 patients underwent hemiarch replacement and total arch replacement, respectively, whereas the remaining 20 patients underwent single- or triple-branched stent graft implantation. Long-term mortality was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The in-hospital and operative mortality rates within 30 days were 11.2 % and 8.2 %, respectively. The cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial ischemic, and antegrade cerebral perfusion times were 150.2 +- 43.3, 71.9 +- 33.2, and 33.6 +- 14.4 min, respectively. The overall in-hospital and intensive care unit durations and mean ventilation time were 23.9 +- 18.4 and 9.5 +- 12.7 days and 122.7 +- 183.4 h, respectively. We observed new postoperative permanent neurological dysfunction in 29 patients and temporary neurological dysfunction in 17 patients. The mean follow-up duration was 52.4 +- 27.9 months; 76.4 % of patients completed follow-up and 143 remained alive. Overall long-term survival was 82.2 % at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The open aortic arch reconstruction technique for acute type A dissection carries a relatively high in-hospital mortality risk, although the late results are encouraging. Patients with an advanced age or impaired renal function may opt for endovascular or modified single- or triple-branched stent graft implantation therapy.
