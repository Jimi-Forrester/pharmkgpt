38231496|a|Purpose: To investigate retinal vascular characteristics using ultra-widefield (UWF) scanning laser ophthalmoscopy in Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: Individuals with an expert-confirmed clinical diagnosis of PD and controls with normal cognition without PD underwent Optos California UWF imaging. Patients with diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, glaucoma, dementia, other movement disorders, or known retinal or optic nerve pathology were excluded. Images were analyzed using Vasculature Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina (VAMPIRE-UWF) software, which describes retinal vessel width gradient and tortuosity, provides vascular network fractal dimensions, and conducts alpha-shape analysis to further characterize vascular morphology (complexity, Opalphamin; spread, OpA). Results: In the PD cohort, 53 eyes of 38 subjects were assessed; in the control cohort, 51 eyes of 33 subjects were assessed. Eyes with PD had more tortuous retinal arteries in the superotemporal quadrant (P = 0.043). In eyes with PD, alpha-shape analysis revealed decreased OpA, indicating less retinal vasculature spread compared to controls (P = 0.032). Opalphamin was decreased in PD (P = 0.044), suggesting increased vascular network complexity. No differences were observed in fractal dimension in any region of interest. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that retinal vasculature assessment on UWF images using alpha-shape analysis reveals differences in retinal vascular network spread and complexity in PD and may be a more sensitive metric compared to fractal dimension. Translational Relevance: Retinal vasculature assessment using these novel methods may be useful in understanding ocular manifestations of PD and the development of retinal biomarkers.
