Synaptic dysfunction is an early hallmark of the disease whose effects on whole-brain functional architecture can be identified using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Insights into mechanisms of early, whole-brain network alterations can help our understanding of the functional impact of AD's pathophysiology. Methods: Here, we obtained rsfMRI data in the TgF344-AD rat model at the pre- and early-plaque stages. This model recapitulates the major pathological and behavioral hallmarks of AD. We used co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis to investigate if and how the dynamic organization of intrinsic brain functional networks states, undetectable by earlier methods, is altered at these early stages. Results: We identified and characterized six intrinsic brain states as CAPs, their spatial and temporal features, and the transitions between the different states. At the pre-plaque stage, the TgF344-AD rats showed reduced co-activation of hub regions in the CAPs corresponding to the default mode-like and lateral cortical network. Default mode-like network activity segregated into two distinct brain states, with one state characterized by high co-activation of the basal forebrain. This basal forebrain co-activation was reduced in TgF344-AD animals mainly at the pre-plaque stage. Brain state transition probabilities were altered at the pre-plaque stage between states involving the default mode-like network, lateral cortical network, and basal forebrain regions. Additionally, while the directionality preference in the network-state transitions observed in the wild-type animals at the pre-plaque stage had diminished at the early-plaque stage, TgF344-AD animals continued to show directionality preference at both stages. Discussion: Our study enhances the understanding of intrinsic brain state dynamics and how they are impacted at the early stages of AD, providing a nuanced characterization of the early, functional impact of the disease's neurodegenerative process.
