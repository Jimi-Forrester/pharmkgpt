36632374|t|Rehabilitation of Post-Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.
36632374|a|Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is rare and only accounts for 0.5% of all reported stroke cases. CVT includes severe headaches with neurological deficits, but the vague presentation of symptoms necessitates efficient clinical examination and imaging for a proper diagnosis. Here, we present a case of this rare type of stroke. Our patient exhibited continuous headaches, further complicated by other neurological deficits. We documented this case to aid in the diagnosis and rehabilitation management of CVT. We aim to demonstrate to physicians the importance of early rehabilitation in such stroke cases and improve the outcome for patients.
