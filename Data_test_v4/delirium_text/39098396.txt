39098396|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that seriously affects the quality of the elderly's lives worldwide. The main pathological features of AD are amyloid plaques formed by beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neuronal fibrillary tangls (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The formation process of these pathological features is closely related to inflammatory response, so anti-inflammatory treatment has become a potential treatment for AD. In recent years, more and more research has shown that the anti-inflammatory therapy can relieve the symptoms of AD and improve cognitive function, which provides a valuable research direction for the treatment of AD strategy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the hotspots and development trends of AD anti-inflammatory research is important for promoting the further development of this field and improving the quality of life of patients. METHODS: This study used bibliometric methods, with AD and anti-inflammatory as key words, collected 7638 AD anti-inflammatory studies collected in Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) literature database since 2000, and conducted an in-depth analysis of the research hotspots and potential trends in this field. RESULTS: The depth and breadth of AD anti-inflammatory research are in the stage of rapid development, and the hot focus is on exploring the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD, especially the interaction of microglia in the neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondly, the treatment effect and potential risks of anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on AD are also the focus of research. Therefore, researchers have carried out a series of animal experiments and prospective clinical studies on anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of AD, forming a comprehensive research system from basic research to clinical research. As for the future development trend, we believe that the further exploration of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD will still be one of the key directions, and the application of big data and artificial intelligence technology is expected to provide strong support for the association between inflammation and AD progression. Moreover, the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs for the inflammatory mechanism of AD will be another major trend for future research. At the same time, personalized treatment strategies and alternative supplements of medicine will also become one of the hotspots of future research. Through the comprehensive use of anti-inflammatory drugs, nutritional supplements, lifestyle intervention and other means, more comprehensive and effective treatment plans for AD patients are expected. CONCLUSION: This research analyzes the overall development trend of AD anti-inflammatory research field since 2000, and provides a comprehensive perspective for the progress of AD anti-inflammatory research. Overall, the field of AD anti-inflammatory research is facing a broad development prospect. In the future, with further research and technological advances, we have resason to expect more effective and safer treatment options for AD patients to help them improve their quality of life and delay disease progression.
