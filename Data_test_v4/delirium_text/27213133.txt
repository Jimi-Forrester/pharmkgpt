27213133|t|Chronic Subdural Haematoma in the Elderly: Is It Time for a New Paradigm in Management?
27213133|a|Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is a common neurological condition that usually affects the elderly. The optimal treatment strategy remains uncertain, principally because there is a lack of a good evidence base. In this paper, we review the literature concerning the peri-operative and operative care of patients. In particular, we highlight the non-surgical aspects of care that might impact on patient outcomes and CSDH recurrence. We propose that an integrated approach to care in patients with CSDH, similar to care of fragility fractures in the elderly, may be an important strategy to improve patient care and outcomes.
