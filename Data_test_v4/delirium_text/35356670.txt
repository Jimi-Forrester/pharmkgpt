35356670|t|Anatomy and formation mechanisms of early amyloid-beta oligomers with lateral branching: graph network analysis on large-scale simulations.
35356670|a|Oligomeric amyloid-beta aggregates (AbetaOs) effectively trigger Alzheimer's disease-related toxicity, generating great interest in understanding their structures and formation mechanisms. However, AbetaOs are heterogeneous and transient, making their structure and formation difficult to study. Here, we performed graph network analysis of tens of microsecond massive simulations of early amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregations at near-atomic resolution to characterize AbetaO structures with sizes up to 20-mers. We found that AbetaOs exhibit highly curvilinear, irregular shapes with occasional lateral branches, consistent with recent cryo-electron tomography experiments. We also found that Abeta40 oligomers were more likely to develop branches than Abeta42 oligomers, explaining an experimental observation that only Abeta40 was trapped in network-like aggregates and exhibited slower fibrillization kinetics. Moreover, AbetaO architecture dissection revealed that their curvilinear appearance is related to the local packing geometries of neighboring peptides and that Abeta40's greater branching ability originates from specific C-terminal interactions at branching interfaces. Finally, we demonstrate that whether Abeta oligomerization causes oligomers to elongate or to branch depends on the sizes and shapes of colliding aggregates. Collectively, this study provides bottom-up structural information for understanding early Abeta aggregation and AbetaO toxicity.
