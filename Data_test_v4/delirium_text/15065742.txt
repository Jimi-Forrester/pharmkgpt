15065742|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the construction of a disease model incorporating both genetic an environmental factors in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), using data generated from the Indianapolis-Ibadan dementia project (I-IDP). METHOD: The I-IDP is a longitudinal comparative study of the prevalence and incidence o dementia in 2 communities: elderly African Americans living in Indianapolis, Indiana, an Yoruba living in Ibadan, Nigeria. RESULTS: African Americans are more than twice as likely as Yoruba to develop AD. Possible explanations for this finding include genetic factors: the possession of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele does not increase risk for AD among Yoruba but confers a sligh increase in AD risk for African Americans. As well, environmental factors may play a role: African Americans have a higher risk of vascular risk factors than do Yoruba. CONCLUSIONS: International comparative studies, particularly those involving population from developing and developed countries, offer a unique opportunity for applying new in formation regarding population genetics to traditional AD risk factor research.
