29593413|a|BACKGROUND: beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) and pyruvate have been associated with the brain energy utilization, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In this prospective study, we aim to investigate the trends of beta-HB and pyruvate levels, metabolic changes, and cognitive function in schizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. OBJECTIVE: We recruited 38 schizophrenia patients who had been treated with antipsychotics for 12 weeks, as well as 38 healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. Blood samples were taken from the patients at baseline and week 12 to determine the serum levels of beta-HB, pyruvate, and metabolic parameters, while blood samples of the healthy controls were taken at baseline. We evaluated the psychopathology using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and cognitive function using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. RESULTS: During the 12-week follow-up period, the beta-HB levels in patients with schizophrenia showed a decreasing trend, particularly in those undergoing treatment with aripiprazole or ziprasidone. The serum levels of beta-HB in patients at baseline and week 12 were both higher than the levels in the healthy controls. Among the schizophrenia patients, changes in beta-HB were positively correlated with changes in executive function. On the other hand, serum pyruvate levels remained steady during the 12-week follow-up period, and we found no significant correlation between pyruvate changes and changes in cognitive function or clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that beta-HB may possess a potential indicator of energy utilization and have a protective role in executive function in patients with schizophrenia. Additional longitudinal studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up periods are necessary to identify the relationship of metabolite regulation and cognitive function during schizophrenia patients' exposure to antipsychotics.
