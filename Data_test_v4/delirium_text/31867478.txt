31867478|t|Molecular and Cellular Response of Co-cultured Cells toward Cobalt Chloride (CoCl2)-Induced Hypoxia.
31867478|a|Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) is a well-known hypoxia mimetic mediator that induces hypoxia-like responses. CoCl2, a mediator confirmed to alleviate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), has been associated with a variety of hypoxic responses. HIF-1 is the foremost transcriptionfactor that is particularly activated during hypoxia and regulates various genes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular responses of the co-cultured cells under the influence of the CoCl2-induced hypoxic condition. Mono- and co-cultured C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells were exposed to CoCl2, and a significant induction in HIF-1, reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidase and a reduction in glutathione and catalase were observed. The expressions of proapoptotic genes like Bax, p53, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were notably increased, whereas the antiapoptotic gene, i.e., Bcl2, was downregulated during hypoxia in mono- as well as co-cultured C2C12 cells. However, the co-cultured C2C12 cells show significantly lower induction in oxidative stress and expression of apoptotic genes in comparison to monocultured C2C12 cells. Whereas, the co-cultured 3T3-L1 cells show comparatively higher oxidative stress and apoptotic event in comparison to monocultured 3T3-L1 cells. The reason may be the communication between the cells and some soluble factors that help in cell survival/death from hypoxia. Moreover, it may also be due to the fact that fat and muscle cells interact and communicate via proximity and mutual ability when growing together. Therefore, the co-culture system provides a unique approach to intercellular communication between the two different cell types.
