24259889|t|Relationship between Swallowing Dysfunction and Decreased Respiratory Function in Dementia Patients.
24259889|a|[Purpose] This study aimed to clarify whether respiratory function differed between dementia patients using and not using thickening fluids and texture-modifying foods for swallowing dysfunction management. [Subjects] Sixty-five inpatients in the dementia treatment ward in a psychiatric facility were enrolled. [Methods] The patients underwent respiratory function testing twice with an 80-cm party horn. Moreover, information about the patients' characteristics and use of thickening fluids and texture-modifying foods was obtained from their medical records. [Results] There was a significant difference in being able to blow the party horn to its full length between patients using and not using thickening liquids. [Conclusion] This result suggests that decreased respiratory function may reflect swallowing dysfunction in dementia patients.
