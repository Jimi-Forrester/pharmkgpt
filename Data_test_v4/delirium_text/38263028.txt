38263028|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is prevalent in ischemic stroke patients, particularly those in the intensive care unit (ICU), and it poses a significant burden on patients and caregivers, leading to increased mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and impaired cognitive function. Dysphagia, a common symptom in critically ill patients with ischemic stroke, further complicates their condition. However, the association between dysphagia and delirium in this context remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between dysphagia and delirium in ICU patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on adult patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke at a medical center in Boston. Ischemic stroke cases were identified using the ninth and tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases. Dysphagia was defined as a positive bedside swallowing screen performed by medical staff on the day of ICU admission, while delirium was assessed using the ICU Confusion Assessment Method and review of nursing notes. Logistic regression models were used to explore the association between dysphagia and delirium. Causal mediation analysis was employed to identify potential mediating variables. RESULTS: The study comprised 1838 participants, with a median age of approximately 70 years, and 50.5% were female. Among the total study population, the prevalence of delirium was 43.4%, with a higher prevalence observed in the dysphagia group (60.7% vs. 40.8%, p < 0.001) compared to the non-dysphagia group. After adjusting for confounding factors including age, sex, race, dementia, depression, sedative medications, history of falls, visual or hearing deficit, sequential organ failure score, and Glasgow coma score, multifactorial logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between dysphagia and an increased likelihood of delirium (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.05; p = 0.018; E-value = 1.73). Causal mediation analysis revealed that serum albumin levels partially mediated the association between dysphagia and delirium in critically ill patients with ischemic stroke (average causal mediated effect [ACME]: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.03; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: ICU admission dysphagia may independently contribute to the risk of delirium in patients with ischemic stroke. Early identification and intervention in ischemic stroke patients with dysphagia may help mitigate the risk of delirium and improve patient prognosis.
