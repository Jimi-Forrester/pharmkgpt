37502953|t|Application of VirCapSeq-VERT and BacCapSeq In the Diagnosis of Presumed and Definitive Neuroinfectious Diseases.
37502953|a|BACKGROUND: Unbiased high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has enabled new insights into the diversity of agents implicated in central nervous system (CNS) infections. The addition of positive selection capture methods to HTS has enhanced the sensitivity while reducing sequencing costs and complexity of bioinformatic analysis. Here we report the use of virus capture based sequencing for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) and bacterial capture sequencing (BacCapSeq) in investigating CNS infections. DESIGN/METHODS: Thirty-four samples were categorized: (1) Patients with definitive CNS infection by routine testing; (2) Patients meeting clinically Brighton Criteria (BC) for meningoencephalitis (3) Patients with presumptive infectious etiology highest on the differential. RNA extracts from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used for VirCapSeq-VERT and DNA extracts were used for BacCapSeq analysis. RESULTS: Among 8 samples from known CNS infections in group 1, VirCapSeq and BacCapSeq confirmed 3 expected diagnoses (42.8%), were negative in 2 (25%), yielded an alternative result in 1 (11.1%), and did not detect 2 expected negative pathogens. The confirmed cases identified HHV-6, HSV-2, and VZV while the negative samples included JCV and HSV-2. In groups 2 and 3, 11/26 samples (42%) were positive for at least one pathogen, however 27% of the total samples (7/26) were positive for commensal organisms. No microbial nucleic acids were detected in negative control samples. CONCLUSIONS: HTS showed limited promise for pathogen identification in presumed CNS infectious diseases in our small sample. Before conducting larger-scale prospective studies to assess clinical value of this novel technique, clinicians should understand benefits and limitations of using this modality.
