38468313|a|BACKGROUND: Multimer detection system-oligomeric amyloid-beta (MDS-OAbeta) is a measure of plasma OAbeta, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the relationship between MDS-OAbeta and disease severity of AD is not clear. We aimed to investigate MDS-OAbeta levels in different stages of AD and analyze the association between MDS-OAbeta and cerebral Abeta deposition, cognitive function, and cortical thickness in subjects within the AD continuum. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed a total 126 participants who underwent plasma MDS-OAbeta, structural magnetic resonance image of brain, and neurocognitive measures using Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, and cerebral Abeta deposition or amyloid positron emission tomography (A-PET) assessed by [18F] flutemetamol PET. Subjects were divided into 4 groups: N = 39 for normal control (NC), N = 31 for A-PET-negative mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, N = 30 for A-PET-positive MCI patients, and N = 22 for AD dementia patients. The severity of cerebral Abeta deposition was expressed as standard uptake value ratio (SUVR). RESULTS: Compared to the NC (0.803 +- 0.27), MDS-OAbeta level was higher in the A-PET-negative MCI group (0.946 +- 0.137) and highest in the A-PET-positive MCI group (1.07 +- 0.17). MDS-OAbeta level in the AD dementia group was higher than in the NC, but it fell to that of the A-PET-negative MCI group level (0.958 +- 0.103). There were negative associations between MDS-OAbeta and cognitive function and both global and regional cerebral Abeta deposition (SUVR). Cortical thickness of the left fusiform gyrus showed a negative association with MDS-OAbeta when we excluded the AD dementia group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MDS-OAbeta is not only associated with neurocognitive staging, but also with cerebral Abeta burden in patients along the AD continuum.
