11395169|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formed by nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins accumulate during normal aging and at accelerated rate during the course of diabetes. They play a role in the pathogenesis of several other chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis and renal failure. AGE-formation changes the chemical and biological properties of proteins inside and outside of the cell. Binding to specific cell surface receptors induces activation of cellular signaling pathways leading to cellular dysfunction and cell death. AGEs are inducible by oxidative stress and induce oxidative stress. Subject of current studies of cell biologists is the intracellular processing of AGEs, which is accompanied by changes of the endolysosomal compartment.
