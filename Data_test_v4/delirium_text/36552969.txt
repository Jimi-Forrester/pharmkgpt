36552969|t|Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping: Translating an Investigative Research Tool into High Volume Clinical Diagnostic Imaging.
36552969|a|Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI-based technique for iron quantification of targeted tissue. QSM provides information relevant to clinicians in a broad range of diagnostic contexts, including sickle cell disease, inflammatory/demyelinating processes, and neoplasms. However, major MRI vendors do not offer QSM post-processing in a form ready for general use. This work describes a vendor-agnostic approach for scaling QSM analysis from a research technique to a routine diagnostic test. We provide the details needed to seamlessly integrate hardware, software, and clinical systems to provide QSM processing for a busy clinical radiology workflow. This approach can be generalized to other advanced MRI acquisitions and analyses with proven diagnostic utility, yet without crucial MR vendor support.
