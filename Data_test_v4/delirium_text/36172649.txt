36172649|t|Systematic Review and Meta-Synthesis about Patients with Hematological Malignancy and Palliative Care.
36172649|a|OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to review, appraise, and synthesize the available studies and recommend the significant clinical implications for healthcare professionals to understand the existing findings of palliative care experience among patients with hematology malignancy. METHODS: After excluding the registered or ongoing systematic reviews in the PROSPERO database regarding the lived experience of palliative care among patients with HM, our systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was registered in PROSPERO [CRD42021270311]. A search for published articles in English between January 2000 and December 2020 was conducted among different electronic databases using PRISMA guidelines 2020. Meta-synthesis was accomplished using the JBI meta-aggregation method to synthesize the findings. The implemented approach involved all qualitative research and mixed-method studies that included a qualitative part. RESULTS: This review contained eight studies which led to 25 codes and seven categories. Finally, three synthesized themes were developed: (1) Approaching the end of life among patients with Hematology Malignancy, (2) submission and surrender of patients with Hematology Malignancy during their terminal stage, and (3) Entrance to the palliative care world. Therefore, realizing the importance of palliative care services to patients with Hematology Malignancy by providing evidence-based education and timely referral is crucial. CONCLUSION: There was a substantial increase in the HMs rate with late referral to palliative care services. The results of this review may draw attention to some issues reported by patients with Hematology Malignancy. Scaling up palliative care services for those patients is essential to minimize end-of-life suffering and the long-term impact of inadequate palliative care for patients with Hematology Malignancy.
