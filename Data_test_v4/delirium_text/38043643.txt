38043643|t|Network-based analysis on the genes and their interactions reveals link between schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
38043643|a|Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder marked by impaired thinking, emotions, and behaviors. Studies have suggested a strong connection between SCZ and Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, controversies exist and the underlying mechanisms linking these two disorders remain largely unknown. Therefore, systematic studies of SCZ- and AD-related genes will provide valuable insights into the molecular features of these two diseases and their comorbidities. In this study, we obtained 331 SCZ-related genes, 650 AD-related genes, 65 shared genes between SCZ and AD. Enrichment analysis shown that these 65 shared genes were mainly involved in cognition, neural development, synaptic transmission, drug reactions, metabolic processes and immune related processes, suggesting a complex mechanism for the co-existence of SCZ and AD. In addition, we performed pathway enrichment analysis and found a total of 57 common pathways between SCZ and AD, which could be largely grouped into three modules: immune module, neurodevelopment module and cancer module. We eventually identified the potential disease-related genes whose interactions provide clues to the overlapping symptoms between SCZ and AD.
