39966461|t|Incidence and factors associated with agitation in patients on mechanical ventilators in Amhara Region, North-West Ethiopia: a multi-center study.
39966461|a|Agitation is a common psychomotor disorder among critically ill patients on mechanical ventilators, posing significant risks to patients and adding strain to clinical services. Despite its importance, there is a lack of data on the incidence and contributing factors of agitation in the study area and across Ethiopia. This study, therefore, aims to assess the incidence and factors associated with agitation in patients on mechanical ventilators in the intensive care units of comprehensive specialized hospitals in the Amhara Region, North-West Ethiopia. A multi-center prospective follow-up study was conducted among 253 critically ill adult patients on mechanical ventilators in the Amhara region of Ethiopia from April 17, 2024, to July 16, 2024. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire through chart reviews, observations, and interviews. Participants were selected using a consecutive sampling technique. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and transferred to Stata version 17 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with agitation. Variables with a p value of less than 0.2 in the bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to identify factors associated with agitation. The results were presented in the form of text, tables, and figures. In the multivariable analysis, variables with a p value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant predictors. The overall incidence of agitation among patients on mechanical ventilators in intensive care units was 87.35% (95% CI 82.6, 91.2). Anxiety (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 3.5; 95% CI 1.28, 9.45), delirium (AOR 3.01; 95% CI 1.13, 7.97), pain (AOR 3.23; 95% CI 1.18, 8.85), hyperthermia (AOR 3.49; 95% CI 1.004, 12.15), hyponatremia (AOR 3.64; 95% CI 1.009, 13.11), and the use of restraints (AOR 3.49; 95% CI 1.11, 8.67) were statistically significant factors associated with agitation. In this study, the majority of participants experienced agitation. To reduce the incidence of agitation, we recommend addressing or preventing the development of anxiety, pain, delirium, hyperthermia, and hyponatremia, as well as minimizing the use of restraints in intensive care units.
