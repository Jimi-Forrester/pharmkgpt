38512402|t|The role of thiol-disulfide homeostasis and ischemia-modified albumin in osteosarcopenia.
38512402|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between the induction of reactive oxygen species and the ability of cells to metabolize them. Numerous markers can be used to assess the level of oxidative stress. Thiol-disulfide homeostasis (TDH) and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) are some of them. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TDH and IMA, which are indicators of oxidative stress, in older patients with osteosarcopenia (OS). METHODS: The study was conducted cross-sectionally in a geriatrics outpatient clinic. Patients who applied to the outpatient clinic for three months were included in the study. Patients with acute infection, delirium, malignancy, severe liver, heart or kidney dysfunction and who did not give their consent for the study were excluded from the study. The study was conducted with 136 patients. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to muscle ultrasonography (USG) and handgrip strength (HGS) results. Osteopenia/osteoporosis was diagnosed according to bone mineral densitometry (BMD) results. The combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia was accepted as OS. RESULTS: Native thiol, total thiol value and nativethiol /totalthiol*100 values were significantly lower in the group with OS (respectively; value = 265 +- 53.8 standard deviation (SD) mumol/L, p =  <= 0.001; value = 295.33 +- 55.77 SD mumol/L, p = 0.001; value = 90.06 (2.8) interquartile ranges (IQR), p = 0.033). Disulfide/native thiol*100 and disulfide/total thiol*100 values were significantly higher in the group with OS (respectively; value = 5.5 (1.7) IQR, p = 0.033; value = 4.97 (1.4) IQR, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: In our study, the role of oxidative stress in OS was demonstrated by using TDH as an oxidative stress parameter.
