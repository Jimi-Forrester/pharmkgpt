31488752|a|BACKGROUND: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) are popular drugs of abuse used for their euphoric, (potential) anabolic, sedative, and amnestic properties. Daily use of GHB/GBL can lead to addiction and the possibility of withdrawal syndrome on cessation which results in tremor, tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, delirium, coma. AIM: To describe the baseline characteristics, treatment and retention in patients admitted for GHB/GBL withdrawal management. METHODS: A retrospective review of 4 consecutive cases of patients reporting GHB/GBL addiction who were admitted for inpatient management of withdrawal syndrome. RESULTS: All patients were using GHB/GBL daily, 1-1.5 ml per hour. One of them was using cannabis additionally, others were using alcohol, cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants. Psychiatric comorbidities as personality disorders, depression, anxiety and bigorexia were recognized. Patients were treated with benzodiazepines and/or clomethiazole, atypical and typical antipsychotics and beta-blockers. Delirium was developed in two patients. One patient completed detoxification and finished the treatment program. One patient completed detoxification but stopped his treatment earlier, two patients did not completed detoxification and left the program. CONCLUSION: GHB/GBL withdrawal can be severe and retention in program is poor. Polysubstance use, psychiatric co-morbidities and heavier GHB/GBL use as possible predictors of poor treatment outcome need consideration in treatment planning.
