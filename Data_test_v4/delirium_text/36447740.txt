36447740|a|Background: Cognitive reserve may protect against the effects of brain pathology, but few studies have looked at whether cognitive reserve modifies the adverse effects of vascular brain pathology. Objective: We determined if cognitive reserve attenuates the associations of vascular brain lesions with worse cognition in persons with subjective concerns or mild impairment. Methods: We analyzed 200 participants aged 50-90 years from the Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) study. Cognition was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and a neuropsychological test battery. High vascular lesion burden was defined as two or more supratentorial infarcts or beginning confluent or confluent white matter hyperintensity. Cognitive reserve proxies included education, occupational attainment, marital status, social activities, physical activity, household income, and multilingualism. Results: Mean age was 72.8 years and 48% were female; 73.5% had mild cognitive impairment and 26.5% had subjective concerns. Professional/managerial occupations, annual household income>=$60,000 per year, not being married/common law, and high physical activity were independently associated with higher cognition. Higher vascular lesion burden was associated with lower executive function, but the association was not modified by cognitive reserve. Conclusion: Markers of cognitive reserve are associated with higher cognition. Vascular lesion burden is associated with lower executive function. However, cognitive reserve does not mitigate the effects of vascular lesion burden on executive function. Public health efforts should focus on preventing vascular brain injury as well as promoting lifestyle factors related to cognitive reserve, as cognitive reserve alone may not mitigate the effects of vascular brain injury.
