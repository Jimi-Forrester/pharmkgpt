29169250|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 91 patients with stable moderate to very severe COPD were included in this study. Cognitive functions of the patients were evaluated using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) tool and clock-drawing test. The Brody's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Questionnaire; COPD assessment test (CAT); body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE); and Charlson comorbidity index were assessed. The patients were divided into two groups as those who were diagnosed with cognitive impairment (group 1, n = 16) and those with normal cognitive functions (group 2, n = 75). Group 1 had a lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen , shorter 6-min walking distance, and higher arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) than group 2 ( p = 0.01, p = 0.024, p = 0.018, respectively). In group 1, the IADL score was lower, and CAT and BODE scores were higher than group 2 ( p = 0.002, p = 0.037, p = 0.012, respectively). When we considered all the patients, there was an independent correlation between the IADL score and MMSE score ( p = 0.03). This study revealed that COPD patients with cognitive impairment may have more hypoxemia and limited activities of daily living.
