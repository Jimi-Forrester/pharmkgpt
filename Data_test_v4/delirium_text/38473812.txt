38473812|t|Intrinsic and Microenvironmental Drivers of Glioblastoma Invasion.
38473812|a|Gliomas are diffusely infiltrating brain tumors whose prognosis is strongly influenced by their extent of invasion into the surrounding brain tissue. While lower-grade gliomas present more circumscribed borders, high-grade gliomas are aggressive tumors with widespread brain infiltration and dissemination. Glioblastoma (GBM) is known for its high invasiveness and association with poor prognosis. Its low survival rate is due to the certainty of its recurrence, caused by microscopic brain infiltration which makes surgical eradication unattainable. New insights into GBM biology at the single-cell level have enabled the identification of mechanisms exploited by glioma cells for brain invasion. In this review, we explore the current understanding of several molecular pathways and mechanisms used by tumor cells to invade normal brain tissue. We address the intrinsic biological drivers of tumor cell invasion, by tackling how tumor cells interact with each other and with the tumor microenvironment (TME). We focus on the recently discovered neuronal niche in the TME, including local as well as distant neurons, contributing to glioma growth and invasion. We then address the mechanisms of invasion promoted by astrocytes and immune cells. Finally, we review the current literature on the therapeutic targeting of the molecular mechanisms of invasion.
