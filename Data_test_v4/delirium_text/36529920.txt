In recent years, researchers and drug designers have increasingly focused on nanotechnology to break through the difficulty of small molecule inhibitors to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and improve the success rate of drug delivery to the central nervous system. Among the common central neurological diseases, such as encephalitis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease has attracted much attention from researchers. Alzheimer's disease is a specific neurodegenerative disease, which causes irreversible degeneration of neurons as well as synapses in the brain, resulting in memory and cognitive dysfunction, along with other psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders, which seriously affects people's everyday life. Moreover, nanotechnology has excellent potential for application in AD treatment. Studies have shown that nanocarriers can target the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, antioxidants, and other therapeutic substances to brain tissue using existing physiological mechanisms, thus effectively alleviating the disease progression of AD. Therefore, various nanoparticles and nanomedicine have been developed and constructed for diagnosing and treating AD in the past decades, such as nanoparticles, bionanoparticles, liposomes, nano-gel, dendrimers, and self-assembled nanoparticles. This study aims to review the applications and results of nanotechnology in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in recent years and provide some ideas and clues for future research and development of more effective drug delivery systems.
