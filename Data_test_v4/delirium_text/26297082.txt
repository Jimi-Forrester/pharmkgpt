26297082|t|An Analysis of the Public Financial Support Eligibility Rule for French Dependent Elders with Alzheimer's Disease.
26297082|a|BACKGROUND: It is crucial to define health policies that target patients with the highest needs. In France, public financial support is provided to dependent patients: it can be used to finance informal care time and nonmedical care use. Eligibility for public subsidies and reimbursement of costs is associated with a specific tool: the autonomie gerontologie groupes iso-ressources (AGGIR) scale score. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore whether patients with Alzheimer's disease who are eligible for public financial support have greater needs than do noneligible patients. METHODS: Using data from the Dependance des patients atteints de la maladie d'Alzheimer en France study, we calculated nonmedical care expenditures (in $) using microcosting methods and informal care time demand (hours/month) using the Resource Use in Dementia questionnaire. We measured the burden associated with informal care provision with Zarit Burden Interview. We used a modified two-part model to explore the correlation between public financial support eligibility and these three variables. RESULTS: We find evidence of higher informal care use, higher informal caregivers' burden, and higher care expenditures when patients have an AGGIR scale score corresponding to public financial support eligibility. CONCLUSIONS: The AGGIR scale is useful to target patients with the highest costs and needs. Given our results, public subsidies could be used to further sustain informal caregivers networks by financing programs dedicated to lowering informal caregivers' burden.
