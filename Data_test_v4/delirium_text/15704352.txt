15704352|t|Exploring alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
15704352|a|Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is characterized by hyperactivity of the nervous system. This hyperactivity represents the brain's attempt to function normally despite the inhibitory effect of chronic alcohol consumption. The syndrome manifests when alcohol consumption ceases. Experimental, clinical, and genetic research have linked the development of withdrawal to alterations in the sensitivity of neuronal communication systems. Early treatment of the syndrome is advised, because the symptom severity may increase with each subsequent episode.
