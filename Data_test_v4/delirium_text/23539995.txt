23539995|a|Nurses and other healthcare workers are often anxious about communicating with people who are living with dementia. This article discusses the issues involved and describes communication techniques taken from the Talking Toolkit, which was developed by Bupa to provide strategies for communicating in a meaningful way with people who have dementia. Since we live in an ageing society where increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, such strategies for communication are increasingly relevant for all nurses and health workers.
