32160434|a|The pathogenesis of age-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease is associated with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Violation of redox homeostasis is accompanied by the development of peroxisome dysfunction and impaired biosynthesis of plasmalogens, which can be closely related to the aging process and the development of age-dependent pathology. Reflecting the functional activity of peroxisomes, plasmalogens can serve not only as potential biomarkers of diseases associated with oxidative stress and aging, but also as an important therapeutic target. The purpose of this review is to analyze the current knowledge of little-studied biological and pathological aspects of plasmalogen participation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases of older persons. Understanding the role of plasmalogens in the pathophysiology of these diseases can lead to the development of effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as treatment methods for neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases of older people.
