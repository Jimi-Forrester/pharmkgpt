34887385|a|The pathophysiological mechanisms of postoperative delirium (POD) are still not clear, and no reliable biomarker is available to differentiate those with and without POD. Pre- and post-surgery blood from epilepsy subjects undergoing neurosurgery were collected. DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of the TNF gene, IL1B gene, and IL6 gene by the Illumina EPIC array method, and DNAm levels of the TNF gene by pyrosequencing, were analyzed. Blood from 37 subjects were analyzed by the EPIC array method, and blood from 27 subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Several CpGs in the TNF gene in preoperative blood showed a negative correlation between their DNAm and age both in the POD group and in the non-POD group. However, these negative correlations were observed only in the POD group after neurosurgery. Neurosurgery significantly altered DNAm levels at 17 out of 24 CpG sites on the TNF gene, 8 out of 14 CpG sites on the IL1B gene, and 4 out of 14 CpG sites on the IL6 gene. Furthermore, it was found that the Inflammatory Methylation Index (IMI), which was based on the post-surgery DNAm levels at the selected five CpG sites, can be a potential detection tool for delirium with moderate accuracy; area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.84. The moderate accuracy of this IMI was replicated using another cohort from our previous study, in which the AUC was 0.79. Our findings provide further evidence of the potential role of epigenetics and inflammation in the pathophysiology of delirium.
