27180357|t|Tetraspanin 8 is an interactor of the metalloprotease meprin beta within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains.
27180357|a|Meprin beta is a dimeric type I transmembrane protein and acts as an ectodomain sheddase at the cell surface. It was shown that meprin beta cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby releasing neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides and implicating a role of meprin beta in Alzheimer's disease. In order to identify non-proteolytic regulators of meprin beta, we performed a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screen using a small intestinal cDNA library. In this screen we identified tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) as interaction partner for meprin beta. Since several members of the tetraspanin family were described to interact with metalloproteases thereby affecting their localization and/or activity, we hypothesized similar functions of TSPAN8 in the regulation of meprin beta. We employed cell biological methods to confirm direct binding of TSPAN8 to meprin beta. Surprisingly, we did not observe an effect of TSPAN8 on the catalytic activity of meprin beta nor on the specific cleavage of its substrate APP. However, both proteins were identified being present in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. Therefore we hypothesize that TSPAN8 might be important for the orchestration of meprin beta at the cell surface with impact on certain proteolytic processes that have to be further identified.
