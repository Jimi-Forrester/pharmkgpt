29535528|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical significance of degree of pulmonary fissure completeness (PFC) on major in-hospital outcomes following video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a single-center retrospective analysis on the prospectively maintained database at our unit between August 2014 and October 2015. Patients were divided into two groups based on their fissure sum average (FSA). Patients with FSA >1 (1< FSA <=3) were considered to have incomplete pulmonary fissures (group A), while patients with FSA of 0-1 were considered to have complete pulmonary fissures (group B). Demographic differences in perioperative characteristics and surgical outcomes between these two groups were initially assessed. Then, a multivariate logistic-regression analysis was further conducted to identify the independent predictors for major in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 563 patients undergoing VATS lobectomy for NSCLC were enrolled. There were 190 patients in group A and 373 patients in group B. The overall morbidity and mortality rates of our cohort were 30.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Group A patients had a significantly higher overall morbidity rate than group B patients (42.1% vs 24.7%, P<0.001). Both minor morbidity (40.5% vs 22%, P<0.001) and major morbidity (11.1% vs 5.6%, P=0.021) rates in group A patients were also significantly higher than group B patients. No significant difference was observed in mortality rate between these two groups (1.1% vs 0.3%, P=0.26). The incomplete degree of PFC was significantly correlated with length of stay and chest-tube duration (log-rank P<0.001) after surgery. Finally, the incomplete degree of PFC was found to be predictive of overall morbidity (OR 2.08, P<0.001), minor morbidity (OR 2.39, P<0.001), and major morbidity (OR 2.06, P=0.031) by multivariate logistic-regression analyses. CONCLUSION: Degree of PFC is an excellent categorical predictor for both major and minor morbidity after VATS lobectomy for NSCLC.
