10791270|a|The number of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction has been increasing. However, the choice of treatment remains controversial. Medical records of 310 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were reviewed. Two retrospective analyses were performed. 1) Patients were divided into the elderly group(70 years or more) and the younger group(under 70 years). In-hospital course and outcome were compared. 2) Pre-hospital performance status and living status were reviewed in the elderly group. Acute phase reperfusion therapy was performed in fewer patients in the elderly group(60.8% vs 71.9%, p < 0.01). The difference was most pronounced in cases of direct coronary angioplasty(28.6% vs 54.7%, p < 0.05). As a result, the rate of reperfusion success(74.8% vs 86.8%, p < 0.01) was lower in the elderly group. Moreover, the rates of in-hospital death(23.6% vs 6.8%, p < 0.005), pulmonary edema(20.3% vs 10.8%, p < 0.05), cardiogenic shock(11.9% vs 6.0%, p < 0.005), pneumonia(17.3% vs 3.0%, p < 0.005), and delirium(29.4% vs 12.0%, p < 0.001) were higher in the elderly group. Five patients in the elderly group and 3 patients in the younger group required rehabilitation because of worsened performance status. Six of them were non-reperfused patients. Elderly patients considered likely to become bed-ridden because of pre-existing physical disability at admission accounted for 28.9% of the total. Moreover, many elderly patients had poor support systems (8.4% were living alone, 21.0% were living only with their spouse or a child, 30.1% were widows or widowers). These results show that a lower acute phase reperfusion rate(especially angioplasty) resulted in a poor prognosis and worse performance status in elderly patients. Also 30% of patients were not good candidates for conventional treatment because of delirium, and that self-help in daily life is a fundamental goal for most elderly patients. Rapid and simple acute phase reperfusion, subsequent immediate mobilization, and early discharge are recommended for elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction.
