3135996|a|Beside senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) there are also dementive syndromes due to a disturbance in metabolism. In a case with a disturbance of copper metabolism (Wilson's disease) a similar P300-pattern was found as described in SDAT with signs of a frontal amplitude elevation. Under therapy with d-penicillamine the frontal P300-positivity moved from frontal to parietal structures. Combined with this migration was an amelioration in cognitive function. This single-case study underlines the significance of P300-topography in the evaluation of therapy effects in dementive disorders.
