30480149|t|Coming Out of "Retirement"-Predictors of Driving Resumption Among Older Drivers.
30480149|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Predictors and consequences of driving cessation in older adults have been studied extensively. This study sought to establish the extent to which former drivers resume driving and identify associated factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Descriptive analysis of the 2011-2015 National Health and Aging Trends Study data (Round 1: n = 6,680; Round 5: n = 3,409) characterized the extent of driving resumption through 2015 by baseline driving status (driver, former driver, never driver). Weighted multivariate logistic regression and multilevel longitudinal models examined predictors of driving resumption. RESULTS: Among drivers who stopped driving during the study, 17%-28% resumed driving. Age, vehicle ownership, stroke, hospitalization, memory, and perceived transportation barriers were associated with resumption in regression analysis. In multilevel analysis stratified by baseline driving status, poor word recall (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.95) and use of public transportation (OR = 9.74; 95% CI = 1.54, 61.77) were significantly associated with driving resumption for baseline drivers, while use of taxi (OR < 0.001; 95% CI = <0.001, 0.02) was negatively associated with resumption for baseline former drivers. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights several factors associated with driving resumption. Uncertainty about the underlying causes for resumption remains, so results should be interpreted with caution. However, predictive factors may help to identify individuals in need of additional mobility transition counseling. Ongoing transportation assessment may be warranted among former drivers.
