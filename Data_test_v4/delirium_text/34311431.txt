34311431|a|Serum uric acid, a natural antioxidant, may have a protective effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the effect of serum uric acid on longitudinal cognitive and brain metabolic changes, we utilized data on baseline serum uric acid levels, APOE genotyping, and longitudinal cognitive scores from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for 1,343 participants with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia. In 979 participants, brain metabolism was measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images. Higher serum uric acid levels exhibited a detrimental effect on NC, whereas a protective trend was observed in individuals with cognitive impairment. Interestingly, higher uric acid levels were associated with a slower decline in cognitive scores and brain metabolism in females with MCI, and this effect was found in APOE4 carriers, but not in non-carriers. Longitudinal AD-like patterns of brain metabolism on FDG-PET images also appeared to mediate the effects of baseline uric acid levels on longitudinal cognitive decline. In summary, higher serum uric acid may interact with APOE4 to alleviate longitudinal metabolic changes and cognitive decline in female MCI patients.
