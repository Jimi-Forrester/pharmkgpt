30195729|a|The search for novel therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is an urgent need, due to the current paucity of available pharmacological tools and the recent failures obtained in clinical trials. Among other strategies, the modulation of amyloid-triggered neuroinflammation by the endocannabinoid system seems of relevance. Previous data indicate that the enhancement of the endocannabinoid tone through the inhibition of the enzymes responsible for the degradation of their main endogenous ligands may render beneficial effects. Based on previously reported data, in which we described a paradoxical effect of the genetic deletion of the fatty acid amide hydrolase, we here aimed to expand our knowledge on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the context of Alzheimer's disease. To that end, we inhibited the production of interleukin-1beta, one of the main inflammatory cytokines involved in the neuroinflammation triggered by amyloid peptides, in a transgenic mouse model of this disease by using minocycline, a drug known to impair the synthesis of this cytokine. Our data suggest that interleukin-1beta may be instrumental in order to achieve the beneficial effects derived of fatty acid amide hydrolase genetic inactivation. This could be appreciated at the molecular (cytokine expression, amyloid production, plaque deposition) as well as behavioral levels (memory impairment). We here describe a previously unknown link between the endocannabinoid system and interleukin-1beta in the context of Alzheimer's disease that open new possibilities for the development of novel therapeutics.
