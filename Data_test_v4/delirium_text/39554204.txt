39554204|a|Objective: Epidemiological studies suggest that patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treated with amphetamines have an increased risk of newly diagnosed psychosis. This risk in youth is poorly understood. This investigation studied the potential risk of newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms associated with exposure to 4 classes of ADHD medications. Method: This retrospective study used a medical records-linkage system from a cohort of youth (age 6-18 years) with diagnosed ADHD who were prescribed amphetamines, methylphenidate, atomoxetine, or alpha-2 agonists. Cohort members with any diagnosis of psychosis before their first ADHD medication were excluded. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms. The risk for psychotic symptoms for each medication (vs the remaining medication classes combined) was estimated using a multivariable time-varying covariate Cox proportional hazard regression model that adjusted for sex and age at ADHD diagnosis. Results: Of 5,171 youth (68.6% male), 134 (2.6 %) had newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms. Exposure to amphetamine (vs amphetamine nonexposure, hazard ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.15-2.26) and atomoxetine (vs atomoxetine nonexposure, hazard ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.92) was associated with increased risk of newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms. Secondary analysis showed that the frequency of newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms was higher with atomoxetine/stimulant lifetime combination therapy (12.5% with amphetamines, 7.7% with methylphenidate) than atomoxetine monotherapy (1.2%). Conclusion: Risk of newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms was low. These results suggest that cumulative exposure to amphetamines or atomoxetine/stimulant lifetime combination therapy may be associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed psychotic symptoms in youth with ADHD.
