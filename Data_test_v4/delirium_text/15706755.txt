15706755|t|Drinking and drinking-related problems among Alaska natives.
15706755|a|Alcohol use has adversely affected many aspects of the Alaska Native community. To a large extent, overcoming the problem of alcohol abuse may require that Alaska Natives craft individual and community solutions to detrimental health, social, and economic conditions and instill new patterns of living that inhibit alcohol abuse. An example of this approach is the Alaska Federation of Natives' "sobriety movement," a grassroots campaign to promote sobriety that emphasizes traditional values and lifestyles. The use of "healing" or other traditional methods may help Alaska Natives both recover from the trauma of decades of cultural conflict and address alcohol problems in their communities.
