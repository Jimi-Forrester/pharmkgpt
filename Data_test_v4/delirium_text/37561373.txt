37561373|a|A comparative assessment of the expression of the mitochondrial fission marker Drp1 and the autophagy marker LC3 in neurons and endothelial cells in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during progression of cognitive deficit was performed in animals with intrahippocampal administration of beta-amyloid. In both brain regions, the expression of Drp1 and LC3 in neuronal and endothelial cells was enhanced. The peak of cognitive impairment corresponded to the maximum expression of Drp1 and LC3 in hippocampal neurons and was preceded by an increase in the number of Drp1+ and LC3+ endothelial cells in this brain region. These data attests to a possible role of aberrant mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy of endothelial cells in the impairment of brain plasticity in the Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration.
