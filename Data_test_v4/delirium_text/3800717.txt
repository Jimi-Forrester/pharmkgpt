3800717|t|The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
3800717|a|Clinical and pathologic diagnoses are compared in 65 patients who had dementia and who had been studied longitudinally during life. The sensitivity of diagnosis for dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) without any other diagnosis was 87%, and the specificity was 78%. The ischemic scale score did not discriminate well between patients with pure multi-infarct dementia and those with both DAT and multi-infarct dementia. However, 35 of 38 cases of pure DAT had a score of 4 or less on the ischemic scale.
