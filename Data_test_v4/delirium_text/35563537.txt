35563537|a|Though COVID-19 is primarily characterized by symptoms in the periphery, it can also affect the central nervous system (CNS). This has been established by the association between stroke and COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause stroke related to a COVID-19 infection have not been fully explored. More specifically, stroke and COVID-19 exhibit an overlap of molecular mechanisms. These similarities provide a way to better understand COVID-19 related stroke. We propose here that peripheral macrophages upregulate inflammatory proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These inflammatory molecules and the SARS-CoV-2 virus have multiple negative effects related to endothelial dysfunction that results in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Finally, we discuss how the endothelial blood-brain barrier injury alters central nervous system function by leading to astrocyte dysfunction and inflammasome activation. Our goal is to elucidate such inflammatory pathways, which could provide insight into therapies to combat the negative neurological effects of COVID-19.
