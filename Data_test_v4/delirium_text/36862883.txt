36862883|a|BACKGROUND: Five-phase music therapy was reported to be effective in the treatment and rehabilitation of several diseases. This study explored the effect of phase I cardiac rehabilitation combined with 5-phase music in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: This prospective pilot study enrolled AMI patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from July 2018 to December 2019. The participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the control, cardiac rehabilitation, and rehabilitation-music groups. The primary endpoint was the hospital anxiety and depression scale. The secondary endpoints were the myocardial infarction dimensional assessment scale, self-rating sleep status, 6-minute walk test, and left ventricular ejection fraction. RESULTS: The study included 150 AMI patients (n = 50/group). Hospital anxiety and depression scale showed significant time effects for both anxiety and depression (both P < .05), a treatment effect for depression (P = .02), and an interaction effect for anxiety (P = .02). A time effect was also observed for diet, sleep disorders, 6-minute walk test, and left ventricular ejection fraction (all P < .001). A difference among groups was observed for emotional reaction (P = .001). Interactions effects were observed for diet (P = .01) and sleep disorders (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Phase I cardiac rehabilitation combined with 5-phase music could alleviate anxiety and depression and improve sleep quality.
