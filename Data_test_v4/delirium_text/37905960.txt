37905960|a|The biological role and prognostic value of thrombospondin domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) in gastric cancer remain unclear. Our purpose was to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of THSD7A and its prognostic value in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer-associated single cell and bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from two databases, were analyzed. We used bulk RNA sequencing to examine the differential expression of THSD7A in gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues and explored the relationship between THSD7A expression and clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox analyses revealed the prognostic value of THSD7A. Gene set enrichment and immune infiltration analyses were used to determine the cancer-promoting mechanisms of THSD7A and its effect on the immune microenvironment. We explored the relationship between THSD7A expression and sensitivity of anti-tumor drugs and immune checkpoint levels. Biological functions of THSD7A were validated at single-cell and in vitro levels. THSD7A expression was significantly increased in gastric cancer samples. High THSD7A expression was associated with poor clinical phenotypes and prognoses. Cox analysis showed that THSD7A was an independent risk factor for patients with gastric cancer. Enrichment analysis suggested that epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inflammatory responses may be potential pro-cancer mechanisms of THSD7A. Upregulation of THSD7A promoted infiltration by M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. High THSD7A expression suppressed the sensitivity of patients with gastric cancer to drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and cisplatin, and upregulated immune checkpoints, such as HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, TIGIT, and CTLA4. At the single cell level, THSD7A was an endothelial cell-associated gene and endothelial cells overexpressing THSD7A showed unique pro-oncogenic effects. In vitro experiments confirmed that THSD7A was overexpressed in gastric cancer samples and cells, and that knocking out THSD7A significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion. THSD7A overexpression may be a unique prognostic marker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer. Therefore, our study provides a new perspective on the precise treatment of gastric cancer.
