29133694|a|The collective evidence to date suggests that environmental exposure to excessive amounts of manganese (Mn) can cause a neurodegenerative condition known as manganism. It is now also relatively clear that Mn is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and at least some prion diseases. The potential involvement of Mn in a panel of other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Batten disease has been suggested and investigated, but the results to date are somewhat inconclusive. Herein, previously reported experimental studies investigating the involvement of Mn in the pathogenesis of these conditions are narratively reviewed.
