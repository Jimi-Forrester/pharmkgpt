39451233|t|Brain Metabolism in Health and Neurodegeneration: The Interplay Among Neurons and Astrocytes.
39451233|a|The regulation of energy in the brain has garnered substantial attention in recent years due to its significant implications in various disorders and aging. The brain's energy metabolism is a dynamic and tightly regulated network that balances energy demand and supply by engaging complementary molecular pathways. The crosstalk among these pathways enables the system to switch its preferred fuel source based on substrate availability, activity levels, and cell state-related factors such as redox balance. Brain energy production relies on multi-cellular cooperation and is continuously supplied by fuel from the blood due to limited internal energy stores. Astrocytes, which interface with neurons and blood vessels, play a crucial role in coordinating the brain's metabolic activity, and their dysfunction can have detrimental effects on brain health. This review characterizes the major energy substrates (glucose, lactate, glycogen, ketones and lipids) in astrocyte metabolism and their role in brain health, focusing on recent developments in the field.
