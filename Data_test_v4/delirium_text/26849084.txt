METHODS: Using structured interviews, we asked 44 nurses from 19 home-visit nursing agencies about changes in status of all 123 of their home end-of-life care patients with advanced cancer between April and September 2013. The main outcome variable was actual place of death (Home/Hospital/Still surviving) and independent variables were the patient's symptoms as a time-dependent variable. Competing risk analysis was conducted with adjustment for patient individual factors (demographics, medical factors, caregiver support, and patient's and caregiver's preference for place of death) and environmental factors (availability of physician-visit and policy at discharge). RESULTS: Among all patients, 53 died in the hospital, 52 at home, and 16 still survived. Multivariate analyses revealed the following: 1) patients were more likely to die in the hospital when pain and dyspnea were present (adjusted sub hazard ratio [SHR]: 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.83] and 1.71 [95% CI: 1.36-2.15], respectively); 2) patients were less likely to die in the hospital when delirium was present (adjusted SHR: 0.64 [95%CI: 0.43-0.96]); and 3) other factors associated with hospital death were patient's gender, primary cancer site, caregiver support, health care service, policy at discharge, and congruence between the patient's and family's preference for place of death. CONCLUSION: To alleviate pain and dyspnea among home end-of-life care patients, development of both a rapid admission system to a hospital/hospice/care facility in the community and specialist-level palliative care at home is needed.
