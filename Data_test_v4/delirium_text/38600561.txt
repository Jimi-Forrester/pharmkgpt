38600561|a|BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (aTAAD) is a critical and life-threatening condition. Previous research has demonstrated that the use of ketorolac not only reduces the progression, incidence, and severity of aortic aneurysms in animal models, but also decreases postoperative mortality and complications in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm replacement. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the efficacy of ketorolac in treating aTAAD in humans. Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketorolac in patients with aTAAD. Our hypothesis was that ketorolac treatment for aTAAD patients would meet safety indicators and effectively improve patient prognosis. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled study. A total of 120 patients with aTAAD will be recruited and will be randomized into the ketorolac group and placebo group with a ratio of 1:1. Ketorolac tromethamine 60 mg per 2 ml will be intramuscularly injected within 2 h before surgery, followed by intramuscular injections of 30 mg per 1 ml BID. on the first and second postoperative days in the Ketorolac group, while 0.9% saline will be administered at the same dose, dosage form, and time in the placebo group. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketorolac in improving the prognosis of aTAAD. The primary endpoint is the composite endpoint event concerning drug-related adverse events. Secondary endpoints include drug-related adverse events, laboratory examination of blood, diagnostic imaging tests, clinical biomarkers, etc. DISCUSSION: This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical College (approval number: 2023-197-02). This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketorolac in patients with aTAAD. All participating patients will sign an informed consent form, and the trial results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals.
