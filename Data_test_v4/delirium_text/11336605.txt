11336605|a|The past decade has seen the introduction of several new antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. These drugs demonstrate substantially lower levels of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) than the classical antipsychotics, as well as having (often poorly supported) claims of increased efficacy at ameliorating certain schizophrenic syndromes. Increasingly, these 'atypical' drugs are being used in the treatment of psychotic or related behavioural disturbances in patients with neurodegenerative disease. Thus, some newer antipsychotics are particularly valuable in ameliorating the L-dopa-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease, while behavioural problems in dementing disorders, such as those occurring in Alzheimer's disease, are also frequently treated by antipsychotic drugs. The relationship between drug pharmacology and neurotransmitter pathology is essential to understanding the relative efficacy of individual antipsychotic drugs in treating the psychotic and behavioural disturbances of neurodegenerative disorders.
