Methods: A total of 1221 ADR/ADE reports collected from a hospital in 2022 were retrieved through the National Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center. The effective reports were screened according to the Guiding Principles for Collection and Reporting of Individual Adverse Drug Reactions, and classified the standardized drugs.

The severity, age and gender, occupational distribution, drug category, route of administration, drug dosage form, system/organ involved, and main clinical symptoms of ADR/ADE reports were analyzed. Results: Among 1221 ADR/ADE reports, 890 cases (75.27%) reported by doctors; 144 cases (11.79%) were serious; Precisely 49.22% of ADR/ADE occurred in patients aged 51 to 70 years old; The highest incidence of adverse reactions was 636 cases (52.09%) by intravenous infusion, 406 cases (33.25%) by oral administration. The top categories of reported cases were anti-infective drugs (29.40%) and anti-tumor drugs (27.52%); Systems/organs involved in ADR/ADE were mainly the skin and its accessories (24.96%) and blood system (21.35%). 166 cases were cured, 893 cases were symptomatic, 160 cases were unknown, and 2 cases had sequelae. Conclusion: The occurrence of ADR/ADE is related to many influencing factors such as age, drug categories, and route of administration.
