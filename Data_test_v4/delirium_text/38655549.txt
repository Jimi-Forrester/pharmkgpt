38655549|a|Introduction: We investigated cognitive profiles among diverse, middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino adults in the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) cohort using a cross-sectional observational study design. Methods: Based on weighted descriptive statistics, the average baseline age of the target population was 56.4 years, slightly more than half were women (54.6%), and 38.4% reported less than a high school education. We used latent profile analysis of demographically adjusted z scores on SOL-INCA neurocognitive tests spanning domains of verbal memory, language, processing speed, and executive function. Results: Statistical fit assessment indices combined with clinical interpretation suggested five profiles: (1) a Higher Global group performing in the average-to-high-average range across all cognitive and instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) tests (13.8%); (2) a Higher Memory group with relatively high performance on memory tests but average performance across all other cognitive/IADL tests (24.6%); (3) a Lower Memory group with relatively low performance on memory tests but average performance across all other cognitive/IADL tests (32.8%); (4) a Lower Executive Function group with relatively low performance on executive function and processing speed tests but average-to-low-average performance across all other cognitive/IADL tests (16.6%); and (5) a Lower Global group performing low-average-to-mildly impaired across all cognitive/IADL tests (12.1%). Discussion: Our results provide evidence of heterogeneity in the cognitive profiles of a representative, community-dwelling sample of diverse Hispanic/Latino adults. Our analyses yielded cognitive profiles that may assist efforts to better understand the early cognitive changes that may portend Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. Highlights: The present study characterized cognitive profiles among diverse middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino adults.Latent profile analysis of neurocognitive test scores was the primary analysis conducted.The target population consists of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino adults enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos and ancillary Study of Latinos - Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging.
