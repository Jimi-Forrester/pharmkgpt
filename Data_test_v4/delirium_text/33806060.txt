33806060|t|Hydrogen Peroxide Effects on Natural-Sourced Polysacchrides: Free Radical Formation/Production, Degradation Process, and Reaction Mechanism-A Critical Synopsis.
33806060|a|Numerous reactive oxygen species (ROS) entities exist, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is very key among them as it is well known to possess a stable but poor reactivity capable of generating free radicals. Considered among reactive atoms, molecules, and compounds with electron-rich sites, free radicals emerging from metabolic reactions during cellular respirations can induce oxidative stress and cause cellular structure damage, resulting in diverse life-threatening diseases when produced in excess. Therefore, an antioxidant is needed to curb the overproduction of free radicals especially in biological systems (in vivo and in vitro). Despite the inherent properties limiting its bioactivities, polysaccharides from natural sources increasingly gain research attention given their position as a functional ingredient. Improving the functionality and bioactivity of polysaccharides have been established through degradation of their molecular integrity. In this critical synopsis; we articulate the effects of H2O2 on the degradation of polysaccharides from natural sources. Specifically, the synopsis focused on free radical formation/production, polysaccharide degradation processes with H2O2, the effects of polysaccharide degradation on the structural characteristics; physicochemical properties; and bioactivities; in addition to the antioxidant capability. The degradation mechanisms involving polysaccharide's antioxidative property; with some examples and their respective sources are briefly summarised.
