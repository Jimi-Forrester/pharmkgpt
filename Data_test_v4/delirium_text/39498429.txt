39498429|t|Psychiatric Camouflage: A Case Series.
39498429|a|Organic brain disorders are often camouflaged by psychiatric manifestations. Management of such 'pseudo-psychiatric' illnesses can be complicated due to the disruptive behaviour of the patients and/or lack of appropriate response to treatment. In this case series, we present three cases, each of which was initially diagnosed as a psychiatric illness but was later found to have an underlying neurological disorder. The presence of atypical symptoms, poor response to medications, disproportionate cognitive impairment and delirium should act as warning signs for the clinician to look for an underlying organic brain disorder.
