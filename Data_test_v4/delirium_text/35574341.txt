35574341|a|Background: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare, aggressive, large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The prognosis of IVLBCL in patients with central nervous system recurrence after first-line chemotherapy treatment is extremely poor. Among immunotherapies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy has been recently found to be a highly effective treatment for B-cell lymphoma, especially for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, no guidelines are available that provide a clear consensus regarding the management of patients with relapsed/refractory IVLBCL. Here, we report, for the first time, the use of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and CAR T-cell therapy in a patient with relapsed/refractory IVLBCL. Case Presentation: A 42-year-old woman was diagnosed with IVLBCL based on liver biopsy and developed central nervous system (CNS) progression. The patient received ASCT combined with murine monoclonal anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CAR T-cell therapy. She achieved complete remission for 22 months so far with negative minimal residual disease and continues to be followed up. Conclusion: ASCT combined with CAR T-cell therapy was the best choice for treatment of relapsed/refractory IVLBCL, as it allowed the achievement of a lasting complete remission.
