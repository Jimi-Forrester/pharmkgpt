34384433|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, a disorder of consciousness, often occurs for a period of time during hospitalisation. It is characterised by a disturbance of attention or awareness. Hyperactive delirium may lead to accidental removal of medical equipment, while hypoactive delirium may inhibit patients from participating in nursing interventions, medical treatment, and physical therapy. However, there are limited relevant studies of the strain of care of nurses in China when caring for patients with delirium. This study, thus, aimed to investigate the subjective level of the strain of care experienced by pulmonary and critical care nurses when caring for patients with delirium. METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. A survey was conducted with 100 nurses in the Chinese pulmonary and critical care medical (PCCM) department in 2018. The Strain of Care for Delirium Index (SCDI) was used to measure nurses' strain of care. Participants were instructed to rate the degree of perceived difficulty in managing patients who displayed the behaviours listed in the SCDI, on a scale from 1 (quite easy) to 4 (very difficult). The mean +- standard deviation (SD) scores of the ranked difficulty scores were calculated. RESULTS: In our sample, 47 % of the nurses had received delirium-related training previously. The three wards with the highest strain of care scores when caring for patients with delirium were the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ward (3.29 +- 0.72), interstitial lung disease ward (3.11 +- 1.31), and respiratory intensive care unit (3.02 +- 0.78). The three types of patient behaviours associated with the highest degree of nursing strain of care were being uncooperative and difficult to manage (3.37 +- 0.84), pulling out tubes and tearing out dressings (3.33 +- 0.98), and irritability (3.22 +- 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to focus on nurses' subjective strain of care when caring for patients with delirium in PCCM departments in China. The findings suggest the need to pay more attention to the working status of Chinese nurses. Further trials with large samples assessing relevant outcomes of patients with delirium are warranted.
