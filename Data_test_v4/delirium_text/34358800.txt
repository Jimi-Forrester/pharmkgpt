34358800|a|The abnormal self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into oligomers, as well as insoluble fibrils, has been identified as a key factor for monitoring the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The noninvasive imaging of Abeta aggregates utilizing chemical probes can be a powerful and practical technique for accurately diagnosing and monitoring the progress of AD, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic drug candidates in treating or managing it. Particularly, the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging of Abeta plaques is a potentially promising approach toward the efficient detection of the biomarker. In this study, we describe a new NIR fluorophore, which was based on curcumin derivatives. The fluorophore is equipped with desirable optical properties for in vivo brain imaging. The emission wavelength of the probe, 8b, is 667 nm, and its fluorescent intensity is significantly increased through binding with the Abeta aggregates. The probe allows the clear visualization of the Abeta plaques 10 min post administration, and the intensity of the fluorescent signal in the brain of a 5XFAD transgenic mouse model is more than three times higher than that of the normal control group. These results demonstrate that the designed probe can be an effective tool for visualizing Abeta plaques, as well as investigating the pathological progress of AD.
