20949808|t|Incidence, prevalence, and under-recognition of delirium in urology patients.
20949808|a|Unrecognized delirium may lead to negative outcomes, such as increased morbidity, longer hospital stays, and increased health care costs. A prospective cohort design study was used to determine the incidence and prevalence of delirium and percentage of patients with unrecognized delirium in a hospital inpatient unit. The sample consisted of 141 patients admitted to a urology/nephrology unit over a six-week period. Data were collected using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results showed the incidence of delirium was 6%, and the prevalence was 12% in this sample. Out of 17 patients with delirium, 6 patient records (35%) had no documentation of delirium by physicians. In the nursing assessment, 1 of 17 (6%) had no documentation of any signs/symptoms of delirium. This study provided baseline data for the development, implementation, and evaluation of a delirium recognition program using the CAM. The CAM may represent an easy-to-use, valid, and reliable instrument to detect delirium as part of a routine nursing assessment.
