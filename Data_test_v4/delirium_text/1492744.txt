1492744|t|The AD1 locus in familial Alzheimer disease.
1492744|a|The AD1 locus on chromosome 21 (MIM 104300) maps to the beta-amyloid precursor locus (APP) at approximately 27.7 Mb from pter (10.9 cM in males and 33.9 cM in females), flanked proximally by D21S8 and distally by D21S111, with D21S124 and D21S210 close but of uncertain order. AD1 accounts for 63 +/- 11% of multiplex Alzheimer pedigrees for which lod scores have been reported. Since a much smaller proportion of pedigrees have mutations in the cDNA for beta-amyloid (APP exons 16 and 17), it is likely that the AD1 locus spans controlling elements near those exons. There is no evidence for a second locus on chromosome 21. The remaining pedigrees may include sporadic cases as well as mutations at an AD2 locus on another chromosome.
