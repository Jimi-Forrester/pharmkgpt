37964799|t|Incidence and Factors Related to Prolonged Postoperative Cognitive Decline (POCD) in Elderly Patients Following Surgery and Anaesthesia: A Systematic Review.
37964799|a|Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to explore the current literature to provide evidence regarding the incidence and risk factors of prolonged POCD in elderly patients following cardiac and non-cardiac surgical interventions. Methods: The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched using appropriate keywords and search engines for adequate evidence from studies meeting the inclusion criteria so as to reveal the end-point, which was the presence of prolonged POCD in elderly patients following surgery and anaesthesia. The incidence of POCD at different time intervals and the variables predicting the occurrence of POCD were analysed. Results: The results of 23 articles covering 5077 patients (3694 non cardiac and 1383 cardiac surgeries) were carefully analysed. POCD occurs from the first postoperative day and lasts for potentially long periods. The incidence of POCD in this review ranged from 2.2% to 35.7%. More specifically, it ranged from 2.2% to 31.5% in non-cardiac surgeries and 11.8% to 35.7% in patients who had undergone cardiac surgeries. Some of the independent risk factors (predictors) for the development of POCD were advanced age, high concentration of neuroinflammatory mediators detectable in plasma, low SpO2, longer anaesthetic and surgical duration, and depth of anaesthesia. Conclusion: This review can only provide limited evidence of prolonged POCD (more than a year) and further research that involves better study designs, larger samples, involving longer follow-up, and at different sites (multicentre) is highly advised. This in turn may help researchers and clinicians to discover the actual causes and risk factors and develop appropriate preventive and treatment protocols to tackle POCD in the ageing surgical population.
