37445533|t|The Long-Term Outcome and Quality of Life after Replacement of the Ascending Aorta.
37445533|a|(1) Background: Despite optimal surgical therapy, replacement of the ascending aorta leads to a significant reduction in the quality of life (QoL). However, an optimal result includes maintaining and improving the QoL. The aim of our study was to evaluate the long-term outcome and the QoL in patients with aneurysms in the ascending aorta; (2) Methods: Between 2014 and 2020, 121 consecutive patients who underwent replacement of the ascending aorta were included in this study. Acute aortic pathologies were excluded. A standard short form (SF)-36 questionnaire was sent to the 112 survivors. According to the surgical procedure, patients were divided into two groups (A: supracoronary replacement of the aorta, n = 35 and B: Wheat-, David- or Bentall-procedures, n = 86). The QoL was compared within these groups and to the normal population, including myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD) and cancer (CAN) patients; (3) Results: 83 patients were males (68.6%) with a mean age of 62.0 +- 12.5 years. Early postoperative outcomes showed comparable results between groups A and B, with a higher re-thoracotomy rate in B (A: 0.0% vs. B: 22.1%, p = 0.002). The 30-day mortality was zero. Overall, mortality during the follow-up was 7.4%. The SF-36 showed a significant decay in both the Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) in comparison to the normal population (PCS: 41.1 vs. 48.4, p < 0.001; MCS: 42.1 vs. 50.9, p < 0.001) but without significant difference between both groups. Compared to the MI and CAD patients, significantly higher PCS but lower MCS scores were detected (p < 0.05); (4) Conclusions: Replacement of the ascending aorta shows low risk regarding the operative and postoperative outcomes with satisfying long-term results in the QoL. The extent of the surgical procedure does not influence the postoperative QoL.
