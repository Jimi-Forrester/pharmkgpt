34859240|a|The blood-brain barrier is the selectively permeable vasculature of the brain vital for maintaining homeostasis and neurological function. Low permeability is beneficial in the presence of toxins and pathogens in the blood. However, in the presence of metastatic brain tumors, it is a challenge for drug delivery. Although the blood-tumor barrier is slightly leaky, it still is not permissive enough to allow the accumulation of therapeutic drug concentrations in brain metastases. Herein, we discuss the differences between primary brain tumors and metastatic brain tumors vasculature, effects of therapeutics on the blood-tumor barrier, and characteristics to be manipulated for more effective drug delivery.
