30293517|t|Verbal adynamia in parkinsonian syndromes: behavioral correlates and neuroanatomical substrate.
30293517|a|Verbal adynamia (impaired language generation, as during conversation) has not been assessed systematically in parkinsonian disorders. We addressed this in patients with Parkinson's dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. All disease groups showed impaired verbal fluency and sentence generation versus healthy age-matched controls, after adjusting for general linguistic and executive factors. Dopaminergic stimulation in the Parkinson's group selectively improved verbal generation versus other cognitive functions. Voxel-based morphometry identified left inferior frontal and posterior superior temporal cortical correlates of verbal generation performance. Verbal adynamia warrants further evaluation as an index of language network dysfunction and dopaminergic state in parkinsonian disorders.
