37626522|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal accumulation of lipids is found in dopamine neurons and resident microglia in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The accumulation of lipids is an important risk factor for PD. Previous studies have mainly focussed on lipid metabolism in peripheral blood, but little attention has been given to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We drew the lipidomic signature in CSF from PD patients and evaluated the role of lipids in CSF as biomarkers for PD diagnosis. METHODS: Based on lipidomic approaches, we investigated and compared lipid metabolism in CSF from PD patients and healthy controls without dyslipidaemia in peripheral blood and explored the relationship of lipids between CSF and serum by Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: A total of 231 lipid species were detected and classified into 13 families in the CSF. The lipid families, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol ester (CE), had significantly increased expression compared with the control. Hierarchical clustering was performed to distinguish PD patients based on the significantly changed expression of 34 lipid species. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used to refine this classification. A total of 12 lipid species, including 3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-carnitine, Cer(d18:1/24:1), CE(20:4), CE(22:6), PC(14:0/18:2), PC(O-18:3/20:2), PC(O-20:2/24:3), SM(d18:0/16:0), SM(d18:2/14:0), SM(d18:2/24:1), SM(d18:1/20:1) and SM(d18:1/12:0), were selected to draw the lipidomic signature of PD. Correlation analysis was performed and showed that the CE family and CE (22:6) in CSF had a positive association with total cholesterol in the peripheral blood from PD patients but not from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that the lipidomic signature in CSF may be considered a potential biomarker for PD diagnosis, and increased CE, PC and SM in CSF may reveal pathological changes in PD patients, such as blood-brain barrier leakage.
