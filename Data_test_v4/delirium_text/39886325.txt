They may detect AD co-pathology in the setting of other primary neurodegenerative diseases, but this has not been systematically studied. METHODS: We compared the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological associations of plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 (mass spectrometry), p-tau217 (electrochemiluminescence), and neurofilament light ([NfL], single molecule array [Simoa]), as markers of AD co-pathology, in a sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cohort (n = 620). RESULTS: Abeta42/Abeta40 showed no clinicopathological associations. High p-tau217 was present in amnestic dementia (AmD) presumed to be due to FTD, logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), and APOEepsilon4 carriers, and correlated with worse baseline and longitudinal clinical scores, lower hippocampal volumes, and more severe AD co-pathology (Braak Stage). NfL was elevated in all FTD phenotypes, and correlated with clinical scores and frontotemporal brain volumes. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 has clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological correlates in sporadic FTD and may identify FTD cases with AD co-pathology. Highlights: Alzheimer's disease (AD) features could be identified with plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).Plasma p-tau217 is a better discriminator of AD co-pathology and AD-associated features in FTLD than plasma amyloid beta42/amyloid beta40 (Abeta42/Abeta40) and neurofilament light (NfL).In FTLD, plasma p-tau217, but not Abeta42/Abeta40 or neurofilament light, has phenotypical, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging correlates suggestive of AD co-pathology.
