27578364|a|BACKGROUND: Post-operative delirium and post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are both common but it has not been clarified how closely they are associated. We aimed to assess the possible relationship in a secondary analysis of data from the 'Surgery Depth of anaesthesia and Cognitive outcome'- study. METHODS: We included patients aged >= 60 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery planned for longer than 60 min. Delirium was assessed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) as well as within the first week after surgery. Cognitive function was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. Multivariable analysis of POCD was performed with consideration of predisposing and precipitating factors. RESULTS: Of 1277 randomized patients, 850 (66.6%) had complete data. Delirium was found in 270 patients (32.9% of 850). We detected POCD in 162 (20.9% of 776) at 1 week and in 52 (9.4% of 553) at 3 months. In multivariable analysis (n = 808), delirium had no overall effect on POCD (P = 0.30). Patients with no delirium in PACU but with postoperative delirium within 7 days had an increased risk of POCD at 3 months (OR = 2.56 (95%-confidence interval: 1.07-6.16), P = 0.035). No significant association was found for the other subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear evidence that postoperative delirium is independently associated with POCD up to 3 months.
