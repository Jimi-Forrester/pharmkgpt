27964703|t|Implications of Epigenetic Mechanisms and their Targets in Cerebral Ischemia Models.
27964703|a|BACKGROUND: Understanding the complexities associated with the ischemic condition and identifying therapeutic targets in ischemia is a continued challenge in stroke biology. Emerging evidence reveals the potential involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the incident and outcome of stroke, suggesting novel therapeutic options of targeting different molecules related to epigenetic regulation. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes our current understanding of ischemic pathophysiology, describes various in vivo and in vitro models of ischemia, and examines epigenetic modifications associated with the ischemic condition. METHOD: We focus on microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifying enzymes, and present how epigenetic studies are revealing novel drug target candidates in stroke. CONCLUSION: Finally, we discuss emerging approaches for the prevention and treatment of stroke and post-stroke effects using pharmacological interventions with a wide therapeutic window.
