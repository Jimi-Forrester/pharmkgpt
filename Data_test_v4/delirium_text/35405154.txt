35405154|a|Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau aggregates have been widely accepted as an important pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of Tau can lead to its aggregation, and Tau aggregation can then be enhanced by zinc. However, it is unclear whether zinc modulates the formation of Tau stress granules in cells. We herein report that zinc promotes the formation of stress granules containing a pathological mutant DeltaK280 of full-length human Tau. Furthermore, zinc promotes LLPS of DeltaK280 of full-length Tau, shifting the equilibrium phase boundary to a lower protein concentration, and modulates the liquid nature of droplets formed by this pathological mutation. Zinc also promotes pathological phosphorylation of DeltaK280 in neuronal cells, and aggravates mitochondrial damage and elevates reactive oxygen species production induced by Tau aggregation. Importantly, we show that treatment of cells with zinc increases the interaction between full-length Tau and G3BP1 inside stress granules to promote the formation of Tau filaments and increase Tau toxicity in neuronal cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate how Tau condensation and mitochondrial damages induced by Tau aggregation are enhanced by zinc to deteriorate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, bridging the gap between Tau LLPS and aggregation in neuronal cells.
