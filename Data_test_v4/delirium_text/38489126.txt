38489126|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common condition in hospitals, particularly among older people. This refers to a dramatic decline in mental capabilities, which is marked by diminished concentration and consciousness. AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the views, knowledge, and behavior of non-consultant hospital doctors in managing delirium in a large Irish hospital. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to 28 healthcare professionals from various departments according to Davis and MacLullich (Age Ageing 38(5):559-563, 2009). It was conducted between July and September 2023, with an emphasis on determining the prevalence rate, diagnostic criteria, and management strategies for delirium. RESULTS: The study established that the majority of respondents recognized the importance of delirium, but there appears to be a gap in the practical management of this clinical syndrome. Although many doctors agreed that delirium was significant, most lacked confidence in its diagnosis and management. The use of standardized assessment tools, such as the 4AT, was limited. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the disparity between what is known and practiced by hospital doctors regarding delirium care. This implies increased training for delirium management with frequent use of assessment tools and ongoing education aimed at enhancing patient outcomes in cases of delirium.
