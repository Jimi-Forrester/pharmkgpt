34056625|t|The transcriptional repressor Rev-erbalpha regulates circadian expression of the astrocyte Fabp7 mRNA.
34056625|a|The astrocyte brain-type fatty-acid binding protein (Fabp7) circadian gene expression is synchronized in the same temporal phase throughout mammalian brain. Cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this coordinated expression are not completely understood, but likely involve the nuclear receptor Rev-erbalpha (NR1D1), a transcriptional repressor. We performed ChIP-seq on ventral tegmental area (VTA) and identified gene targets of Rev-erbalpha, including Fabp7. We confirmed that Rev-erbalpha binds to the Fabp7 promoter in multiple brain areas, including hippocampus, hypothalamus, and VTA, and showed that Fabp7 gene expression is upregulated in Rev-erbalpha knock-out mice. Compared to Fabp7 mRNA levels, Fabp3 and Fabp5 mRNA were unaffected by Rev-erbalpha depletion in hippocampus, suggesting that these effects are specific to Fabp7. To determine whether these effects of Rev-erbalpha depletion occur broadly throughout the brain, we also evaluated Fabp mRNA expression levels in multiple brain areas, including cerebellum, cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, and VTA in Rev-erbalpha knock-out mice. While small but significant changes in Fabp5 mRNA expression exist in some of these areas, the magnitude of these effects are minimal to that of Fabp7 mRNA expression, which was over 6-fold across all brain regions. These studies suggest that Rev-erbalpha is a transcriptional repressor of Fabp7 gene expression throughout mammalian brain.
