32190824|t|Increased Circulating Levels of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps During Cardiopulmonary Bypass.
32190824|a|BACKGROUND: The intensity of inflammatory response triggered by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery has been associated with adverse outcomes. Neutrophils might contribute to organ injury through the liberation of DNA histone-based structures named "neutrophil extracellular traps" (NETs). Our objective was to assess circulating NETs levels before and after cardiac surgery in low-risk and high-risk patients. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 2 groups of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with the use of CPB. The first group consisted of low-risk patients (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II <= 1%), and the second group included high-risk patients (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II >= 5%). Blood samples were drawn pre-CPB and 3 hours post-CPB separation. Measurements of circulating NETs, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase, citrullinated histone 3, and pentraxin-related protein 3 levels were performed at each time point. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients, 12 high-risk and 12 low-risk patients, were included. Circulating NETs measurements changed from a median of 0.054 before CPB to 0.084 at 3 hours post-CPB separation, with a median increase of 0.037 (P < 0.001) per patient. No difference was noted between the high-risk and low-risk groups. A linear relationship was found between the circulating NETs measurements 3 hours post-CPB and CPB duration (ss = 0.047; confidence interval, 0.012-0.081; P = 0.01 R2 = 0.27). A correlation was found between the change in NETs with citrullinated histone 3 and myeloperoxidase levels, but not between NETs and other inflammatory biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating NETs measurements increases during cardiac surgery with postsurgical levels proportional to CPB duration. The clinical significance of NETs production during cardiac surgery should be further investigated.
