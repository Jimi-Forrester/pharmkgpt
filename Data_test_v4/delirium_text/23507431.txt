23507431|t|Surgery in elderly people: preoperative, operative and postoperative care to assist healing.
23507431|a|Surgery for elderly women is likely to increase steadily as the population of elderly people increases globally. Although increasing age increases perioperative morbidity and mortality, the functional age and physiologic reserve rather than chronological age is more important in preventing complications. Preparation for surgery, with special attention to functional capacity and activity, mental status, and existing comorbid conditions, can improve outcomes. Perioperative management must be tailored to physiologic changes of ageing, which affect respiratory, cardiac and renal function, as well as guidelines for preventing infection and thrombotic events. Of particular note is the enhanced effect of narcotic medications in elderly people, which affects intraoperative and postoperative management of pain. Prevention of postoperative delirium is accomplished through preoperative and postoperative planning. Discharge planning, particularly for frail elderly people, must start before surgery.
