39686595|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau are crucial biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, interacting synergistically to accelerate disease progression. While Abeta initiates cascades leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles, PET imaging studies suggest a sequential progression from amyloidosis to tauopathy, closely linked with neurocognitive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the complex interactions between Abeta and tau in AD using probabilistic graphical models, assessing how regional tau accumulation is influenced by Abeta burden. METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Anti-Abeta Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) study were utilized, involving participants across various cognitive stages and employing both Florbetapir and Flortaucipir as tracers. Tau standardized uptake value ratio values were harmonized across studies, and participants were stratified into quantile groups based on Abeta levels. A LASSO regularized Gaussian graphical model analyzed partial correlations among brain regions to discern patterns of tau accumulation across different Abeta levels. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in tau structure among low, medium, and high Abeta groups in both ADNI and A4 cohorts, with graph metrics, such as small-world coefficient, indicating increased tau efficiency as Abeta burden increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that tau accumulates more efficiently with increasing Abeta burden, highlighting an interplay that could inform development of dual-targeting therapies in AD. This study underscores the importance of Abeta and tau interactions in AD progression and supports the hypothesis that targeting both pathologies could be crucial for therapeutic interventions.
