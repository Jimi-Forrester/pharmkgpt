30282367|t|Class-Specific Incidence of All-Cause Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: A Latent Class Approach.
30282367|a|Identifying preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important step toward developing approaches to early treatment and dementia prevention. We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to 10 baseline neuropsychological assessments for 1,345 participants from Einstein Aging Study. Time-to-event models for all-cause dementia and AD were run examining events in 4-year intervals. Five classes were identified: Mixed-Domain Impairment (n = 107), Memory-Specific Impairment (n = 457), Average (n = 539), Frontal Impairment (n = 118), and Superior Cognition (n = 124). Compared to the Average class, the Mixed-Domain Impairment and Memory-Specific Impairment classes were at higher risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD in the first 4 years from baseline, while the Frontal Impairment class was associated with higher risk between 4 and 8 years of follow-up. LCA identified classes which differ in cross-sectional cognitive patterns and in risk of dementia over specific follow-up intervals.
