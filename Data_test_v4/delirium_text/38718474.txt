38718474|a|Neurologic disorders (NDs) are serious diseases that threaten public health. However, due to the complex pathogenesis and significant individual differences in traditional treatments, specific treatment methods for NDs are still lacking. Exosomes, the smallest extracellular vesicles secreted by eukaryotic cells, are receiving increasing attention in the field of NDs. They contain misfolded proteins related to various NDs, including amyloid-beta, Tau proteins, and alpha-synuclein, indicating their promising roles in the diagnosis and treatment of NDs. In this review, an overview of the biogenesis, composition, and biological functions of exosomes is provided. Moreover, we summarize their potential roles in the pathogenesis of three prevalent NDs (including Alzheimer's disease, Ischemic stroke, and Parkinson's disease). On this basis, the diagnostic potential and therapeutic value of exosomes carrying various bioactive molecules are discussed in detail. Also, the concerns and perspectives of exosome-based diagnosis and therapy are discussed.
