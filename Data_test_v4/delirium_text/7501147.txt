7501147|a|Although extrapyramidal signs such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural impairment frequently occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the correlation of these parkinsonian manifestations with the neuropathologic changes of Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well established. Previous clinicopathologic studies addressing this issue have been largely retrospective or have consisted of relatively small numbers of cases. We examined the neuropathologic correlates of clinical parkinsonism in 78 cases with autopsy-confirmed AD prospectively enrolled in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease. Sixteen (20.5%) of the 78 AD cases showed concomitant PD pathology (AD/PD) as evidenced by the presence of nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies at any site. There were neocortical Lewy bodies in eight of these 16 cases. Two or more clinical manifestations of extrapyramidal dysfunction were present in eight (50.0%) of the 16 cases of AD/PD versus 11 (17.7%) of the 62 cases of AD alone (p < 0.01). Although semiquantitative ratings of the frequency of neuritic plaques showed no differences between the two groups, neurofibrillary tangles in the AD/PD group were less frequent in the midfrontal (p < 0.001) and superior temporal cortex (p < 0.05). These findings support previous reports that AD/PD cases are more likely to manifest extrapyramidal dysfunction and show plaque predominance at autopsy.
