35134991|t|Profiling Secreted miRNA Biomarkers of Chemical-Induced Neurodegeneration in Human iPSC-Derived Neurons.
35134991|a|Elucidation of predictive fluidic biochemical markers to detect and monitor chemical-induced neurodegeneration has been a major challenge due to a lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms driving altered neuronal morphology and function, as well as poor sensitivity in methods to quantify low-level biomarkers in bodily fluids. Here, we evaluated 5 neurotoxicants (acetaminophen [negative control], bisindolylmaleimide-1, colchicine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and rotenone) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to profile secreted microRNAs (miRNAs) at early and late stages of decline in neuronal cell morphology and viability. Based on evaluation of these morphological (neurite outgrowth parameters) and viability (adenosine triphosphate) changes, 2 concentrations of each chemical were selected for analysis in a human 754 miRNA panel: a low concentration with no/minimal effect on cell viability but a significant decrease in neurite outgrowth, and a high concentration with a significant decrease in both endpoints. A total of 39 miRNAs demonstrated significant changes (fold-change >= 1.5 or <= 0.67, p value < .01) with at least 1 exposure. Further analyses of targets modulated by these miRNAs revealed 38 key messenger RNA targets with roles in neurological dysfunctions, and identified transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as a commonly enriched pathway. Of the 39 miRNAs, 5 miRNAs, 3 downregulated (miR-20a, miR-30b, and miR-30d) and 3 upregulated (miR-1243 and miR-1305), correlated well with morphological changes induced by multiple neurotoxicants and were notable based on their relationship to various neurodegenerative conditions and/or key pathways, such as TGF-beta signaling. These datasets reveal miRNA candidates that warrant further evaluation as potential safety biomarkers of chemical-induced neurodegeneration.
