39901279|a|Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are essential for regulating protein localization and stability, significantly affecting gene expression, biological functions, and genome replication. Among these, sumoylation a PTM that attaches a chemical group to protein sequences-plays a critical role in protein function. Identifying sumoylation sites is particularly important due to their links to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. This study introduces XGBoost-Sumo, a robust model to predict sumoylation sites by integrating protein structure and sequence data. The model utilizes a transformer-based attention mechanism to encode peptides and extract evolutionary features through the PsePSSM-DWT approach. By fusing word embeddings with evolutionary descriptors, it applies the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm for optimal feature selection and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classification. XGBoost-Sumo achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.68% on benchmark datasets using 10-fold cross-validation and 96.08% on independent samples. This marks a significant improvement, outperforming existing models by 10.31% on training data and 2.74% on independent tests. The model's reliability and high performance make it a valuable resource for researchers, with strong potential for applications in pharmaceutical development.
