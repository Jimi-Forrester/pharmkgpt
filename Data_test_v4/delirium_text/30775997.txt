30775997|t|A Potential Role for alpha-Amylase in Amyloid-beta-Induced Astrocytic Glycogenolysis and Activation.
30775997|a|BACKGROUND: Astrocytes produce and store the energy reserve glycogen. However, abnormal large glycogen units accumulate if the production or degradation of glycogen is disturbed, a finding often seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have shown increased activity of glycogen degrading alpha-amylase in AD patients and alpha-amylase positive glial cells adjacent to AD characteristic amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the role of alpha-amylase in astrocytic glycogenolysis in presence of Abeta. METHODS: Presence of alpha-amylase and large glycogen units in postmortem entorhinal cortex from AD patients and non-demented controls were analyzed by immunohistological stainings. Impact of different Abeta42 aggregation forms on enzymatic activity (alpha-amylase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), lactate secretion, and accumulation of large glycogen units in cultured astrocytes were analyzed by activity assays, ELISA, and immunocytochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: AD patients showed increased number of alpha-amylase positive glial cells. The glial cells co-expressed the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, displayed hypertrophic features, and increased amount of large glycogen units. We further found increased load of large glycogen units, alpha-amylase immunoreactivity and alpha-amylase activity in cultured astrocytes stimulated with fibril Abeta42, with increased pyruvate kinase activity, but unaltered lactate release as downstream events. The fibril Abeta42-induced alpha-amylase activity was attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that astrocytes respond to fibril Abeta42 in Abeta plaques by increasing their alpha-amylase production to either liberate energy or regulate functions needed in reactive processes. These findings indicate alpha-amylase as an important actor involved in AD associated neuroinflammation.
