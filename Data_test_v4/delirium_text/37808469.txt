37808469|a|Background and purpose: Previous studies have focused on the changes of dynamic and static functional connections in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). However, the dynamic characteristics of local brain activity are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamic cerebral activity changes in patients with CSVD using the dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (d-ALFF). Methods: A total of 104 CSVD patients with cognitive impairment (CSVD-CI, n = 52) or normal cognition (CSVD-NC, n = 52) and 63 matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Every participant underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans and a battery of neuropsychological examinations. The dynamics of spontaneous brain activity were assessed using dynamic changes in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) with the sliding-window method. We used voxel-wise one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare dynamic ALFF variability among the three groups. Post-hoc t-tests were used to evaluate differences between each group pair. Finally, the brain regions with d-ALFF values with differences between CSVD subgroups were taken as regions of interest (ROI), and the d-ALFF values corresponding to the ROI were extracted for partial correlation analysis with memory. Results: (1) There was no significant difference in age (p = 0.120), sex (p = 0.673) and education (p = 0.067) among CSVD-CI, CSVD-NC and HC groups, but there were significant differences Prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus among the three groups (p < 10-3). There were significant differences in scores of several neuropsychological scales among the three groups (p < 10-3). (2) ANOVA and post-hoc t-test showed that there were dynamic abnormalities of spontaneous activity in several brain regions in three groups, mainly located in bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus, bilateral insular and frontal lobes, and the static activity abnormalities in bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral hippocampal regions were observed at the same time, suggesting that bilateral parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral hippocampus may be the key brain regions for cognitive impairment caused by CSVD. (3) The correlation showed that d-ALFF in the bilateral insular was slightly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and disease progression rate. The d-ALFF value of the left postcentral gyrus was negatively correlated with the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) score (r = -0.416, p = 0.004), and the d-ALFF value of the right postcentral gyrus was negatively correlated with the Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) word recognition (r = -0.320, p = 0.028). Conclusion: There is a wide range of dynamic abnormalities of spontaneous brain activity in patients with CSVD, in which the abnormalities of this activity in specific brain regions are related to memory and execution or emotion.
