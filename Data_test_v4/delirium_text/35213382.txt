35213382|a|BACKGROUND: alpha-klotho might play a role in neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: To determine levels of alpha-klotho and apoE in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and their relationship with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). METHODS: All subjects were between age 39 to 83+ (n = 94). CDR and MMSE were administered to all participants. CSF was collected in the early afternoon by lumbar puncture. RESULTS: Serum and CSF levels of alpha-klotho are positively correlated and both predict scores on the MMSE and CDR, regardless of sex or apoE4 status. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that alpha-klotho may be an important biomarker of cognitive health and neurodegeneration, and that relatively non-invasive sampling of alpha-klotho from serum is likely highly reflective of CSF levels.
