37418295|t|Dual Piperidine-Based Histamine H3 and Sigma-1 Receptor Ligands in the Treatment of Nociceptive and Neuropathic Pain.
37418295|a|In search of new dual-acting histamine H3/sigma-1 receptor ligands, we designed a series of compounds structurally based on highly active in vivo ligands previously studied and described by our team. However, we kept in mind that within the previous series, a pair of closely related compounds, KSK67 and KSK68, differing only in the piperazine/piperidine moiety in the structural core showed a significantly different affinity at sigma-1 receptors (sigma1Rs). Therefore, we first focused on an in-depth analysis of the protonation states of piperazine and piperidine derivatives in the studied compounds. In a series of 16 new ligands, mainly based on the piperidine core, we selected three lead structures (3, 7, and 12) for further biological evaluation. Compound 12 showed a broad spectrum of analgesic activity in both nociceptive and neuropathic pain models based on the novel molecular mechanism.
