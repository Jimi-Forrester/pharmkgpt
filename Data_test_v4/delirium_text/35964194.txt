35964194|t|Associations Between Sub-Threshold Amyloid-beta Deposition, Cortical Volume, and Cognitive Function Modulated by APOE e4 Carrier Status in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.
35964194|a|BACKGROUND: There has been renewed interest in the deteriorating effects of sub-threshold amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite evidence suggesting a synergistic interaction between the APOE e4 allele and Abeta deposition in neurodegeneration, few studies have investigated the modulatory role of this allele in sub-threshold Abeta deposition during the preclinical phase. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the differential effect of the APOE e4 carrier status on the association between sub-threshold Abeta deposition, cortical volume, and cognitive performance in cognitively normal older adults (CN). METHODS: A total of 112 CN with sub-threshold Abeta deposition was included in the study. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging, [18F] flutemetamol PET-CT, and a neuropsychological battery. Potential interactions between APOE e4 carrier status, Abeta accumulation, and cognitive function for cortical volume were assessed with whole-brain voxel-wise analysis. RESULTS: We found that greater cortical volume was observed with higher regional Abeta deposition in the APOE e4 carriers, which could be attributed to an interaction between the APOE e4 carrier status and regional Abeta deposition in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Finally, the APOE e4 carrier status-neuropsychological test score interaction demonstrated a significant effect on the gray matter volume of the left middle occipital gyrus. CONCLUSION: There might be a compensatory response to initiating Abeta in APOE e4 carriers during the earliest AD stage. Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers some insight into recent interests concerning probabilistic AD modeling, focusing on the modulating role of the APOE e4 carrier status during the preclinical period.
