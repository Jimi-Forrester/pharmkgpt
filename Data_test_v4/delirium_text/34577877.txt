34577877|t|Relation between Alpha-Synuclein and Core CSF Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.
34577877|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, while Lewy body dementia (LBD) is characterized by alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) inclusions. Some authors examine alpha-syn protein in the neurodegeneration process of AD and propose to consider cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-syn as a possible additional biomarker to the so-called "core" of AD. Objective: To determine whether there is a correlation between alpha-syn levels and "core" AD biomarkers in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Materials and methods: In total, 81 patients in the early stages of MCI were selected from the outpatient dementia consultation in Alicante General Hospital. Using a cross-sectional case-control design, patients were analyzed in four groups: stable MCI (MCIs; n = 25), MCI due to AD (MCI-AD; n = 32), MCI due to LBD (MCI-LBD; n = 24) and a control group of patients with acute or chronic headache (Ctrl; n = 18). Correlation between CSF protein levels in the different groups was assessed by the Rho Spearman test. Results: We found positive correlations between T-tau protein and alpha-syn (rho = 0.418; p value < 0.05) and p-tau181p and alpha-syn (rho = 0.571; p value < 0.05) exclusively in the MCI-AD group. Conclusion: The correlation found between alpha-syn and tau proteins in the first stages of AD support the involvement of alpha-syn in the pathogenesis of AD. This result may have clinical and diagnostic implications, as well as help to apply the new concept of "precision medicine" in patients with MCI.
