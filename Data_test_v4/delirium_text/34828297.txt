34828297|t|Multi-Omics Interpretation of Anti-Aging Mechanisms for omega-3 Fatty Acids.
34828297|a|Aging is one of the hottest topics in biomedicine. Previous research suggested that omega-3 fatty acids have preventive effects on aging. However, most of previous studies on the anti-aging effects of omega-3 fatty acids are focused on clinical observations, and the anti-aging mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids have not been fully elucidated. This stimulated our interest to use multi-omics data related to omega-3 fatty acids in order to interpret the anti-aging mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids. First, we found that omega-3 fatty acids can affect methylation levels and expression levels of genes associated with age-related diseases or pathways in humans. Then, a Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on blood lipid levels and variation in the gut microbiome. Our results indicate that the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on aging is partially mediated by the gut microbiome (including Actinobacteria, Bifidobacteria and Streptococcus). In conclusion, this study provides deeper insights into the anti-aging mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids and supports the dietary supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids in aging prevention.
