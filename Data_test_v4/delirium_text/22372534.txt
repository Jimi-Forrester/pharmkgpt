22372534|t|Estrogenic effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on APP processing in post-menopausal platelets.
22372534|a|Ginsenoside Rg1, an active component of high abundance in ginseng, has recently been reported to possess neuroprotective properties and also identified as a potent phytoestrogen. However, it is unknown whether Rg1 intervenes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and whether such intervention is associated with its estrogenic activity. Using human platelets, this study demonstrated that Rg1 promoted alpha-secretase cleavage of APP via estrogenic activity. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway may be involved in the effect of Rg1 on APP metabolism as a downstream effector of estrogen receptor (ER) extranuclear signaling. Estrogen withdrawal is a risk factor for the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rg1 exerts estrogenic activity in APP processing in platelets supporting the use of this compound in the prevention of AD, in particular in postmenopausal females.
