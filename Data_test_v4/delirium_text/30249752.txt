30249752|a|OBJECTIVE: Wasp venom is a potentially important natural drug, but it can cause hypersensitivity reactions. The purpose of the present study was to systematically study the epitopes of wasp venom. METHODS: Using a random 12-peptide phage library, we performed antibody-binding epitope panning on ten serum samples from wasp sting victims at 3 h and 4 days after the sting. The panning epitopes were identified by high-throughput sequencing and matched with wasp venom proteins by BLAST. The panned antibody-binding epitopes were verified by ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 35 specific potential wasp venom epitopes in 4 days were identified. Amongst them, twelve peptide epitopes were matched with nine wasp venom proteins, namely, vitellogenin precursor, hexamerin 70b precursor, venom carboxylesterase-6 precursor, MRJP5, major royal jelly protein 8 precursor, venom acid phosphatase Acph-1 precursor, phospholipase A2, venom serine protease 34 precursor, and major royal jelly protein 9 precursor. The changes in serum IgM antibodies induced by wasp venom were confirmed by ELISA based on the 12 peptide epitopes. CONCLUSION: The nine wasp venom proteins are potential allergens, which should be excluded or modified in the potential biomedical applications of wasp venom.
