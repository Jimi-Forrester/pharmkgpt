38523173|a|To investigate the incidence, characteristics and risk factors for hypoactive delirium in patients with nontraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to explore the independent risk factors associated with hypoactive delirium and provide new ideas for early prediction and treatment. Hypoactive delirium is a known serious complication in ARDS patients, and currently, there are no effective early detection models or clinical prediction tools, and there is a lack of clinical treatment. This study included nontraumatic ARDS patients who stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 24 h and were older than 18 years. A total of 205 ARDS patients admitted to the ICU of Gansu Provincial People's Hospital between December 2021 and February 2023 were selected. Demographic data, clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were collected within 24 h after the patients entered the ICU. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate risk factors, evaluate the clinical prediction effect of the model and construct a nomogram for visual display. The incidence of hypoactive delirium among the patients included in the study was 41%. Patients with hypoactive delirium had hypertension; diabetes mellitus; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores >= 15; and increased procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels compared with those without hypoactive delirium. Logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus (OR 3.305, 95% CI: 1.866-12.616; p = 0.047), CRP level (OR 1.002, 95% CI: 1.001-1.023; p = 0.044), and IL-6 level (OR 1.045, 95% CI: 1.017-1.063; p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for hypoactive delirium. After receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration plot and decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed that the clinical prediction ability of this study model was satisfactory, and a nomogram was drawn for visual display. Hypoactive delirium is a common serious complication in nontraumatic ARDS patients. Our logistic regression model not only effectively predicts hypoactive delirium early but also reveals potential clinical therapeutic targets.
