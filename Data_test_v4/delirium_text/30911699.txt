30911699|a|Multiple sclerosis-related neurobehavioral abnormalities are one of the main components of disability in this disease. The same pathological processes that explain demyelination periods and neurodegeneration also allow the comprehension of neurobehavioral abnormalities. Inflammation in the central nervous system caused by cells of the immune system, especially lymphocytes, and by resident cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, directly modulate neurotransmission and synaptic physiology, resulting in behavioral changes (such as sickness behavior) and amplifying the degenerative mechanisms that occur in multiple sclerosis. In addition, neuronal death caused by glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, alterations in GABAergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the mechanisms of axon damage are of foremost importance to explain the reduction in brain volume and the associated cognitive decline. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are not isolated phenomena and various instances of interaction between them have been described. This presents attractive targets for the development of therapeutic strategies for this neglected component of multiple sclerosis related disability.
