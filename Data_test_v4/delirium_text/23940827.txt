23940827|a|Aberrant regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Our recent study shows that GSK-3 impairs lysosomal acidification and that inhibition of GSK-3 re-acidified lysosomes in brains of AD mice. This effect was accompanied by reductions in beta-amyloid pathology and amelioration of cognitive deficits. Presenilin-1 (PS1) is an essential factor in lysosomal acidification. To determine whether the inhibition of GSK-3 restores lysosomal malfunction caused by dysfunctional PS1, we treated MEF cells deficient in presenilin proteins (MEF-PS1/2(-/-)) with a selective substrate competitive GSK-3 inhibitor, L803-mts. L803-mts enhanced the acidic lysosomal pool in MEF-PS1/2(-/-) cells and increased levels of activated cathepsin D in the lysosomes. We conclude that GSK-3 and PS1 operate via similar mechanisms to disrupt lysosomal acidification. Importantly, these data indicate that GSK-3 inhibitors have potential in treatment of conditions associated with defective PS1.
