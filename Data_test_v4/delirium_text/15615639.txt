15615639|t|Tau modifiers as therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease.
15615639|a|Fibrillogenesis is a major feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Fibers are correlated with disease severity and they have been implicated as playing a direct role in disease pathophysiology. In studies of tau, instead of finding causality with tau fibrils, we found that tau is associated with reduction of oxidative stress. Biochemical findings show that tau oxidative modifications are regulated by phosphorylation and that tau found in neurofibrillary tangles is oxidatively modified, suggesting that tau is closely linked to the biology, not toxicity, of AD.
