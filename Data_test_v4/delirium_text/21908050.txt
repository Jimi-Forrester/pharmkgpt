21908050|a|BACKGROUND: Very few studies have evaluated the level of distress due to the experience of delirium in patients who have recovered from delirium. METHODOLOGY: Fifty-three patients were rated on Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 at baseline and were again evaluated on Delirium Experience Questionnaire after recovery for level of distress due to the experience of delirium. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 45.58 (S.D. 19.06) years. Only 15 patients (28.3%) remembered themselves to be confused and rest had no recollection of the same. Those who could remember their experience had moderate (n = 4; 26.7%), severe (n = 6; 40.0%) and very severe (n = 5; 33.3%) level of distress. Of those who could not remember their delirium experience, most of them had moderate (n = 17; 44.7%) to severe (n = 10; 26.3%) distress. Those who remembered their experience in general described it as a state of fearfulness (n = 8), anxiety (n = 4) confusion and feeling strange (n = 7). Other experiences which were recollected were those of visual hallucinations and illusions. CONCLUSION: Overall experience of delirium is distressing for the patients. Most of the patients (those who remembered or who were not able to remember) experienced at least moderate level of distress.
