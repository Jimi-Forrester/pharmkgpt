39803455|a|Microglia modulate their cell state in response to various stimuli. Changes to cellular lipids often accompany shifts in microglial cell state, but the functional significance of these metabolic changes remains poorly understood. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia, we observed that both extrinsic activation (by lipopolysaccharide treatment) and intrinsic triggers (the Alzheimer's disease-associated APOE4 genotype) result in accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets. We demonstrate that lipid droplet accumulation is not simply concomitant with changes in cell state but rather necessary for microglial activation. We discovered that both triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are needed for the transcription and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to extrinsic stimuli. Additionally, we reveal that triglyceride biosynthesis and catabolism are necessary for the activation-associated phagocytosis of multiple substrates including the disease-associated amyloid-beta peptide. In microglia harboring the Alzheimer's disease risk APOE4 genotype, triglyceride-rich lipid droplets accumulate even in the absence of any external stimuli. Inhibiting triglyceride biosynthesis in APOE4 microglia not only modifies the transcription of immune response genes but also attenuates disease-associated transcriptional states. This work establishes that triglyceride metabolism is necessary for microglia to respond to extrinsic activation. In APOE4 microglia, this metabolic process modulates both immune signaling and a disease-associated transcriptional state. Importantly, our work identifies metabolic pathways that can be used to tune microglial immunometabolism in APOE4- associated disease.
