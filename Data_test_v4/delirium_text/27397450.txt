27397450|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine safety and feasibility of conscious sedation using dexmedetomidine for transcatheter atrial septal defect (ASD) device closure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective institutional review of transcatheter ASD device closure without endotracheal intubation over 18 months. The protocol included topical oropharyngeal anesthesia using lignocaine followed by dexmedetomidine bolus 1 mug/kg intravenously over 10 min and maintenance dose 0.2-0.7 mug/kg/h. Ramsay sedation score 2-3 was maintained. Patients were analyzed regarding demographic profile, device size, procedure time, anesthesia time, recovery time, hospital stay, and any hemodynamic or procedural complications. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients with mean age 31.56 +- 13.74 years (range: 12-56 years) were analyzed. Mean anesthesia duration was 71.75 + 21.08 min. Mean recovery time was 7.6 +- 3.01 min. 16 females and one male patient required additional propofol with a mean dose of 30.8 +- 10.49 mg. No hemodynamic instability was noted. No patient required general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The procedure was successful in 93.02% of patients. Four patients developed atrial fibrillation. All patients were satisfied. CONCLUSION: Conscious sedation using dexmedetomidine is a safe and effective anesthetic technique for percutaneous ASD closure.
