38267090|t|A Delirium Prevention and Management Initiative: Implementing a Best Practice Recommendation for the NICU.
38267090|a|Medically complex infants experiencing NICU stays can be difficult to manage, exhibiting refractory agitation, disengagement, or both-all signs of delirium, which can present in a hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed form. Though documented in other settings, delirium is under-recognized in NICUs. Pediatric studies show that a high percentage of patients with delirium are under the age of 12 months. Delirium is associated with increased ventilation days, hospital days, and costs. It negatively affects neurodevelopment and social interaction. Studies show that pediatric nurses are unprepared to recognize delirium. Our nurse-led multidisciplinary group created a best practice recommendation (BPR) focused on detecting delirium and minimizing risk through thoughtful sedation management, promotion of sleep hygiene and mobility, and facilitation of meaningful caregiver presence. Occasionally, medications, including melatonin and risperidone, are helpful. In 2019, we introduced this BPR to reduce delirium risk in our NICU. Practice changes tied to this initiative correlate with a significant reduction in delirium scores and risk including exposure to deliriogenic medications. A multidisciplinary care bundle correlates with decreased delirium screening scores in NICU patients.
