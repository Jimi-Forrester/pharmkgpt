22397031|t|Clusterin in Alzheimer's disease.
22397031|a|Clusterin, also known as apolipoprotein J, is a ubiquitous multifunctional glycoprotein. Following its identification in 1983, clusterin was found to be clearly increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Later research demonstrated that clusterin could bind amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and prevent fibril formation, a hallmark of AD pathology. In addition to preventing excessive inflammation, intracellular clusterin was found to reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress. Although early studies were inconclusive, two recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) independently identified variants within the clusterin gene as risk factors for developing AD. This review focuses on the characteristics of clusterin and possible mechanisms of its relationship to AD.
