26481640|t|Apolipoprotein E genotyping and questionnaire-based assessment of lifestyle risk factors in dyslipidemic patients with a family history of Alzheimer's disease: test development for clinical application.
26481640|a|The cholesterol-raising properties of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon-4 (epsilon-4) allele has been validated in the South African population. Mounting evidence supports the added value of APOE genotyping for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in dyslipidemic patients beyond its established role in the diagnosis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to determine the potential benefits of combining AD family history with questionnaire-based lifestyle assessment to facilitate the clinical interpretation of APOE genotyping results. A total of 580 unrelated South African individuals prospectively enrolled in a chronic disease screening program incorporating a genetic component (2010-2015) was selected for inclusion in this study based on the presence (75) or absence (505) of AD family history. Biochemical assessment of their lipid profiles was performed according to standard laboratory protocols. All study participants were genotyped for the APOE epsilon-2/epsilon-3/epsilon-4 alleles using allele-specific TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction technology. In patients without a family history of AD, APOE genotype modified the relationship between alcohol intake and body mass index (p = 0.026), with a significant positive correlation noted between these parameters being limited to epsilon-4 allele carriers. APOE genotype also modified the association between alcohol intake and total serum cholesterol in patients with a positive family history of AD (p = 0.026). We demonstrated the benefits of a questionnaire-based approach for assessment of lifestyle risk factors to facilitate clinical interpretation of APOE genotyping results for targeted intervention in a genetic subgroup of dyslipidemic patients at increased risk for AD.
