1732438|t|The scintigraphic appearance of Alzheimer's disease: a prospective study using technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT.
1732438|a|Alzheimer's disease produces regional abnormalities in brain blood flow and metabolism that may result in recognizable scintigraphic patterns. We determined the predictive value of 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT for the presence of Alzheimer's disease based on a prospective study of 132 consecutive patients coming to our nuclear medicine clinical unit for evaluation of their memory loss or cognitive abnormalities. During clinical follow-up averaging 10.1 mo, a final diagnosis was established in 113 patients, 52 of which had Alzheimer's disease. The probability of Alzheimer's disease was determined for seven scintigraphic patterns. The probability was 19% that patients with memory loss and normal perfusion had Alzheimer's disease. For abnormal perfusion patterns, the probability of Alzheimer's disease was 82% with bilateral temporoparietal defects, 77% with bilateral temporoparietal defects with additional defects, 57% with unilateral temporoparietal defects, 43% with frontal defects only, 18% with other large defects and 0% with multiple small cortical defects. We conclude that for 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT the predictive value of bilateral temporoparietal defects for Alzheimer's disease is high, while the perfusion patterns of unilateral temporoparietal perfusion defects and frontal defects only, which occur in 20% of patients with Alzheimer's disease, are not predictive of that disease.
