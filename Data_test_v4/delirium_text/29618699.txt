29618699|a|Six triterpenic acids were separated and purified from the ethyl acetate extractive fraction of ethanol extracts of Potentilla parvifolia FISCH. using a variety of chromatographic methods. The neuroprotective effects of these triterpenoids were investigated in the present study, in which the okadaic acid induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used as an Alzheimer's disease cell model in vitro. The cell model was established with all trans-retinoic acid (5 micromol/L, 4 d) and okadaic acid (40 nmol/L, 6 h) treatments to induce tau phosphorylation and synaptic atrophy. Subsequently, the neuroprotective effects of these triterpenic acids were evaluated in vitro by this cell model. Results from the Western blot and morphology analysis suggested that compounds 3-6 had the better neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, we tested the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential of these compounds in SH-SY5Y cells by flow cytometry technology to investigate the potential neuroprotective mechanism of these compounds. All of the results indicated that maybe the mechanism of compounds 5 and 6 is to protect the cell from mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries.
