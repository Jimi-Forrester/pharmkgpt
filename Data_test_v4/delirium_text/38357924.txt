38357924|t|Yoda1 opens the lymphatic path for craniosynostosis therapy.
38357924|a|The rediscovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) has sparked research interest in their function in numerous neurological pathologies. Craniosynostosis (CS) is caused by a premature fusion of cranial sutures during development. In this issue of the JCI, Matrongolo and colleagues show that Twist1-haploinsufficient mice that develop CS exhibit raised intracranial pressure, diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow, and impaired paravascular CSF-brain flow; all features that were associated with MLV defects and exacerbated pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Activation of the mechanosensor Piezo1 with Yoda1 restored MLV function and CSF perfusion in CS models and in aged mice, opening an avenue for further development of therapeutics.
