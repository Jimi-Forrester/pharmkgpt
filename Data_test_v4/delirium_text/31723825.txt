31723825|t|CAR T Cell Toxicity: Current Management and Future Directions.
31723825|a|By late 2018, 2 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell products have been approved by US and European regulatory authorities. Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah, Novartis) is indicated in the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse, or adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma relapsed or refractory (r/r) after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. Axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta, Kite) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma relapsed or refractory after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (ZUMA-1 trial). This review will offer a practical guide for the recognition and management of the most important toxicities related to the use of the current commercial CAR T cells, and also highlight strategies to diminish these side effects in the future.
