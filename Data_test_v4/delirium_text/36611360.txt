36611360|t|An Overview of Deep-Learning-Based Methods for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment with Retinal Images.
36611360|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the most prevalent causes of premature death. Early detection is crucial to prevent and address CVDs in a timely manner. Recent advances in oculomics show that retina fundus imaging (RFI) can carry relevant information for the early diagnosis of several systemic diseases. There is a large corpus of RFI systematically acquired for diagnosing eye-related diseases that could be used for CVDs prevention. Nevertheless, public health systems cannot afford to dedicate expert physicians to only deal with this data, posing the need for automated diagnosis tools that can raise alarms for patients at risk. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, particularly, deep learning models, became a strong alternative to provide computerized pre-diagnosis for patient risk retrieval. This paper provides a novel review of the major achievements of the recent state-of-the-art DL approaches to automated CVDs diagnosis. This overview gathers commonly used datasets, pre-processing techniques, evaluation metrics and deep learning approaches used in 30 different studies. Based on the reviewed articles, this work proposes a classification taxonomy depending on the prediction target and summarizes future research challenges that have to be tackled to progress in this line.
