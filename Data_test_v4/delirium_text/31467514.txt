31467514|t|15-Deoxy- -12,14-Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an Endogenous Ligand of PPAR-gamma: Function and Mechanism.
31467514|a|15-Deoxy- -12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a natural peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, has been explored in some detail over the last 20 years. By triggering the PPAR-gamma signalling pathway, it plays many roles and exerts antitumour, anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antifibrosis, and antiangiogenesis effects. Although many synthetic PPAR-gamma receptor agonists have been developed, as an endogenous product of PPAR-gamma receptors, 15d-PGJ2 has beneficial characteristics including rapid expression and the ability to contribute to a natural defence mechanism. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in our knowledge of the biological role of 15d-PGJ2 mediated through PPAR-gamma. It is important to understand its structure, synthesis, and functional mechanisms to develop preventive agents and limit the progression of associated diseases.
