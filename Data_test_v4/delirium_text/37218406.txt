37218406|t|Ulcerated skin evaluation by electrical impedance measurements.
37218406|a|In the presented study, the transdermal results from the areas surrounding the ulcerated skin areas were compared with those obtained from healthy skin tissue. The analysis of electrical parameters, such as the slope of the Nyquist plot, min. IM, min. RE, min. f, Imagine part index, Phase index, Real part index, and Magnitude index were conducted. Electrical parameters have been measured in the group without lower leg ulceration and in the group with lower leg ulcers. On the basis of the statistical analysis, it was determined that these parameters may be effective in the evaluation of the skin. In fact, the skin surrounding the ulceration was characterised by different values of electrical parameters as compared with healthy skin tissue. A statistically significant difference was found in the electrical parameters obtained for the healthy leg skin and the skin surrounding the ulceration. This study was to investigate the applicability of electrical parameters in the evaluation of the skin in lower leg ulcers. The electrical parameters can be used as an effective tool in assessing the condition of the skin, both healthy and surrounding the ulcerations. The most useful parameters in assessing skin condition using electrical parameters include min. IM, min. RE, min. f, Imagine part index, Phase index, and Magnitude index.
