38517643|a|Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in patients admitted with acute conditions remain a major challenge to healthcare services. Here, we assessed the impact of HCAIs acquired within 7-days of acute stroke on indicators of care-quality outcomes and dependency. Data were prospectively collected (2014-2016) from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme for 3309 patients (mean age = 76.2 yr, SD = 13.5) admitted to four UK hyperacute stroke units (HASU). Associations between variables were assessed by multivariable logistic regression (odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals), adjusted for age, sex, co-morbidities, pre-stroke disability, swallow screening, stroke type and severity. Within 7-days of admission, urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia occurred in 7.6% and 11.3% of patients. Female (UTI only), older age, underlying hypertension, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, pre-stroke disability, intracranial haemorrhage, severe stroke, and delay in swallow screening (pneumonia only) were independent risk factors of UTI and pneumonia. Compared to patients without UTI or pneumonia, those with either or both of these HCAIs were more likely to have prolonged stay (> 14-days) on HASU: 5.1 (3.8-6.8); high risk of malnutrition: 3.6 (2.9-4.5); palliative care: 4.5 (3.4-6.1); in-hospital mortality: 4.8 (3.8-6.2); disability at discharge: 7.5 (5.9-9.7); activity of daily living support: 1.6 (1.2-2.2); and discharge to care-home: 2.3 (1.6-3.3). In conclusion, HCAIs acquired within 7-days of an acute stroke led to prolonged hospitalisation, adverse health consequences and risk of care-dependency. These findings provide valuable information for timely intervention to reduce HCAIs, and minimising subsequent adverse outcomes.
