38056504|a|Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a metabolic condition caused mainly by a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene (LDLR), which is highly prevalent in the population. Besides being an important causative factor of cardiovascular diseases, FH has been considered an early risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive and emotional behavioral impairments in LDL receptor knockout (LDLr-/-) mice are associated with neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, impaired neurogenesis, brain oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, today, LDLr-/- mice, a widely used animal model for studying cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis, are also considered an interesting tool for studying dementia. Here, we reviewed the main findings in LDLr-/- mice regarding the relationship between FH and brain dysfunctions and dementia development.
