36035223|t|Expression Profile of Inflammation Response Genes and Potential Regulatory Mechanisms in Dilated Cardiomyopathy.
36035223|a|Background: The inflammatory response is important in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the expression of inflammatory response genes (IRGs) and regulatory mechanisms in DCM has not been well characterized. Methods: We analyzed 27,665 cells of single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of four DCM samples and two healthy controls (HC). IRGs among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of active cell clusters were screened from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). The bulk sequencing dataset of 166 DCM patients and 166 HC was analyzed to explore the common IRGs. The biological functions of the IRGs were analyzed according to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. IRG-related transcription factors (TFs) were determined using the TRRUST database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. Then, we established the noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regulatory network based on the StarBase database. Finally, the potential drugs that target IRGs were explored using the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). Results: The proportions of dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, NK cells, and T cells were increased in DCM patients, whereas monocytes were decreased. DCs expressed more IRGs in DCM. The GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the functional characteristics of active cells mainly focused on the immune response. Thirty-nine IRGs were commonly expressed among active cell cluster DEGs, bulk RNA DEGs, and inflammatory response-related genes. ETS1 plays an important role in regulation of IRG expression. The competing endogenous RNA regulatory network showed the relationship between ncRNA and IRGs. Sankey diagram showed that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) played a major role in regulation between TFs and potential drugs. Conclusion: DCs infiltrate into the myocardium and contribute to the immune response in DCM. The transcription factor ETS1 plays an important role in regulation of IRGs. Moreover, ALOX5 may be a potential therapeutic target for DCM.
