37119325|a|INTRODUCTION: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) leads to less morbidity, faster recovery, and, therefore, shorter hospital stays. The expected increment of primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the U.S. highlights the need for sufficient pain management. The favorable use of short-lasting spinal anesthesia enables early mobilization but may lead to increased opioid consumption the first 24 h (h) postoperatively. METHODS: In a retrospective study design, we compared conventional THA with postoperative immobilization for two days (non-ERAS) and enhanced recovery THA with early mobilization (ERAS group). Data assessment took place as part of the "Quality Improvement in Postoperative Pain Treatment project" (QUIPS). Initially, 2161 patients were enrolled, resulting in 630 after performing a matched pair analysis for sex, age, ASA score (American-Society-of-Anesthesiology) and preoperative pain score. Patient-reported pain scores, objectified by a numerical rating scale (NRS), opioid consumption and side effects were evaluated 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The ERAS group revealed higher activity-related pain (p = 0.002), accompanied by significantly higher opioid consumption (p < 0.001). Maximum and minimum pain as well as side effects did not show significant differences (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to analyze pain scores, opioid consumption, and side effects in a matched pair analyses at this early stage and supports the implementation of an ERAS concept for THA. Taking into consideration the early postoperative mobilization, we were not able to detect a difference regarding postoperative pain. Although opioid consumption appeared to be higher in ERAS group, occurrence of side effects ranged among comparable percentages.
