30982329|t|Clinical 18F-FDG and amyloid brain positron emission tomography/CT in the investigation of cognitive impairment: where are we now?
30982329|a|The number of people living with dementia is increasing, but as yet there remains no cure or disease-modifying treatment. This review aims to help readers understand the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in the investigation of cognitive impairment and how the advent of amyloid PET/CT imaging may hold the key to radically changing management of the most common form of dementia - Alzheimer's disease. The indications for 18F-FDG PET/CT and amyloid PET/CT imaging in cognitive impairment are outlined. Additionally, the mechanisms of action, technique, patient preparation and acquisition parameters for both are detailed. We conclude by providing a framework for interpreting 18F-FDG PET/CT and amyloid PET/CT imaging in the more common conditions that lead to cognitive impairment conditions with tips on avoiding pitfalls in interpretation.
