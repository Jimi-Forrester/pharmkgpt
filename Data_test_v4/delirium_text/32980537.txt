32980537|t|N-Acetylcysteine as a treatment for sulphur mustard poisoning.
32980537|a|In the long and intensive search for effective treatments to counteract the toxicity of the chemical warfare (CW) agent sulphur mustard (H; bis(2-chloroethyl) sulphide), the most auspicious and consistent results have been obtained with the drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC), particularly with respect to its therapeutic use against the effects of inhaled H. It is a synthetic cysteine derivative that has been used in a wide variety of clinical applications for decades and a wealth of information exists on its safety and protective properties against a broad range of toxicants and disease states. Its primary mechanism of action is as a pro-drug for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), particularly in those circumstances where oxidative stress has exhausted intracellular GSH stores. It impacts a number of pathways either directly or through its GSH-related antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which make it a prime candidate as a potential treatment for the wide range of deleterious cellular effects that H is acknowledged to cause in exposed individuals. This report reviews the available literature on the protection afforded by NAC against the toxicity of H in a variety of model systems, including its efficacy in treating the long-term chronic lung effects of H that have been demonstrated in Iranian veterans exposed during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). Although there is overwhelming evidence supporting this drug as a potential medical countermeasure against this CW agent, there is a requirement for carefully controlled clinical trials to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal NAC dosage regimens for the treatment of inhaled H.
