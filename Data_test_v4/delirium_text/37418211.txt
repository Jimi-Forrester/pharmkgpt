37418211|t|Neurobiological Mechanisms of Cognitive Decline Correlated with Brain Aging.
37418211|a|Cognitive decline has emerged as one of the greatest health threats of old age. Meanwhile, aging is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Developing therapeutic interventions for such conditions demands a greater understanding of the processes underlying normal and pathological brain aging. Despite playing an important role in the pathogenesis and incidence of disease, brain aging has not been well understood at a molecular level. Recent advances in the biology of aging in model organisms, together with molecular- and systems-level studies of the brain, are beginning to shed light on these mechanisms and their potential roles in cognitive decline. This chapter seeks to integrate the knowledge about the neurological mechanisms of age-related cognitive changes that underlie aging.
