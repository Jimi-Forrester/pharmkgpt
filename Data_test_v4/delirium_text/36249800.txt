36249800|t|Uncovering the pharmacology of Ginkgo biloba folium in the cell-type-specific targets of Parkinson's disease.
36249800|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with a fast-growing prevalence. Developing disease-modifying therapies for PD remains an enormous challenge. Current drug treatment will lose efficacy and bring about severe side effects as the disease progresses. Extracts from Ginkgo biloba folium (GBE) have been shown neuroprotective in PD models. However, the complex GBE extracts intertwingled with complicated PD targets hinder further drug development. In this study, we have pioneered using single-nuclei RNA sequencing data in network pharmacology analysis. Furthermore, high-throughput screening for potent drug-target interaction (DTI) was conducted with a deep learning algorithm, DeepPurpose. The strongest DTIs between ginkgolides and MAPK14 were further validated by molecular docking. This work should help advance the network pharmacology analysis procedure to tackle the limitation of conventional research. Meanwhile, these results should contribute to a better understanding of the complicated mechanisms of GBE in treating PD and lay the theoretical ground for future drug development in PD.
