27634936|a|Cerebrovascular dysfunction is a critical component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Oligomeric amyloid-beta42 (oAbeta42) is considered a major contributor to AD progression. However, data are limited on the role of oAbeta42 in brain endothelial cell vessel degeneration/angiogenesis, including the interaction with angiogenic mediators. Thus, the current study determined the effect of oAbeta42 on angiogenesis in vitro, utilizing single brain endothelial cell cultures and triple cultures mimicking the microvascular unit (MVU: brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes). oAbeta42 dose-dependently reduced angiogenesis and induced vessel disruption. Critically, epidermal growth factor prevented oAbeta42-induced deficits, implicating angiogenic pathways as potential therapeutics for AD.
