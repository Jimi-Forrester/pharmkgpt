38783169|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after anesthesia/surgery, especially among elderly patients, and poses a significant threat to their postoperative quality of life and overall well-being. While it is widely accepted that elderly patients may experience POCD following anesthesia/surgery, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. Several studies have indicated that the interaction between silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is crucial in controlling cognitive function and is strongly linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this research aims to explore how SIRT1/BDNF impacts cognitive decline caused by anesthesia/surgery in aged mice. METHODS: Open field test (OFT) was used to determine whether anesthesia/surgery affected the motor ability of mice, while the postoperative cognitive function of 18 months old mice was evaluated with Novel object recognition test (NORT), Object location test (OLT) and Fear condition test (FC). The expressions of SIRT1 and other molecules were analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The hippocampal synaptic plasticity was detected by Golgi staining and Long-term potentiation (LTP). The effects of SIRT1 and BDNF overexpression as well as chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic neurons in hippocampal CA1 region of 18 months old vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) mice on POCD were further investigated. RESULTS: The research results revealed that older mice exhibited cognitive impairment following intramedullary fixation of tibial fracture. Additionally, a notable decrease in the expression of SIRT1/BDNF and neuronal excitability in hippocampal CA1 glutamatergic neurons was observed. By increasing levels of SIRT1/BDNF or enhancing glutamatergic neuron excitability in the CA1 region, it was possible to effectively mitigate synaptic plasticity impairment and ameliorate postoperative cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in SIRT1/BDNF levels leading to changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability in older mice could be a significant factor contributing to cognitive impairment after anesthesia/surgery.
