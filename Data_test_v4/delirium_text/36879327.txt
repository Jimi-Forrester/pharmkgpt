36879327|a|BACKGROUND: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is associated with poor sleep quality, depression or anxiety, poor dietary patterns, microvasculopathy, and hypoxia, all of which are known risk factors for dementia. However, the relationship between RLS and incident dementia remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study aimed to explore the possibility that RLS could be deemed as a non-cognitive prodromal feature of dementia. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Elderly Cohort (aged >= 60). The subjects were observed for 12 years, from 2002 to 2013. Identifying patients with RLS and dementia was based on the 10th revised code of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We compared the risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) in 2501 subjects with newly diagnosed RLS and 9977 matched controls based on age, sex, and index date. The association between RLS and the risk of dementia was assessed using Cox regression hazard regression models. The effect of dopamine agonists on the risk of dementia among RLS patients was also explored. RESULTS: The baseline mean age was 73.4, and the subjects were predominantly females (63.4%). The incidence of all-cause dementia was higher in the RLS group than that in the control group (10.4% vs 6.2%). A baseline diagnosis of RLS was associated with an increased risk of incident all-cause dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-1.72). The risk of developing VaD (aHR 1.81, 95% CI 1.30-2.53) was higher than that of AD (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11-1.72). The use of dopamine agonists was not associated with the risk of subsequent dementia among patients with RLS (aHR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort study suggests that RLS is associated with an increased risk of incident all-cause dementia in older adults, providing some evidence that requires confirmation through prospective studies in the future. Awareness of cognitive decline in patients with RLS may have clinical implications for the early detection of dementia.
