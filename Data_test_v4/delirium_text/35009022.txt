35009022|t|Pistachio Nuts (Pistacia vera L.): Production, Nutrients, Bioactives and Novel Health Effects.
35009022|a|Epidemiological and clinical studies have indicated positive outcomes related to tree nut consumption. Here, we review the production, nutrient, phytochemical composition and emerging research trends on the health benefits of pistachio nuts (Pistacia vera L.). Pistachios are a good source of protein, fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids, minerals and vitamins, as well as carotenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins. Polyphenols in pistachios are important contributors to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo through animal studies and clinical trials. The antimicrobial and antiviral potential of pistachio polyphenols has also been assessed and could help overcome drug resistance. Pistachio consumption may play a role in cognitive function and has been associated with a positive modulation of the human gut microbiota and beneficial effects on skin health. Pistachio polyphenol extracts may affect enzymes involved in glucose regulation and so type 2 diabetes. Taken together, these data demonstrate the health benefits of including pistachios in the diet. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms involved.
