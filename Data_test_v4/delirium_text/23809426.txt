23809426|t|Putative role of glycogen as a peripheral biomarker of GSK3beta activity.
23809426|a|Glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3beta) has a pivotal role in several intracellular signaling cascades that are involved in gene transcription, cytoskeletal reorganization, energy metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. This kinase has pleiotropic functions, and the importance of its activity has recently been shown in neurons and platelets. In addition to its regulatory function in several physiological events, changes in GSK3beta activity have been associated with many psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and autism-spectrum disorders. Beside the reports of its involvement in several pathologies, it has become increasingly apparent that GSK3beta might be a common therapeutic target for different classes of psychiatric drugs, and also that the GSK3beta ratio may be a useful parameter to determine the biochemical changes that might occur during antidepressant treatment. Although GSK3beta is commonly described as a key enzyme in a plethora of signaling cascades, originally it was identified as playing an important role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis, given its ability to inactivate glycogen synthase (GS) by phosphorylation. Acting as a constitutively active kinase, GSK3beta phosphorylates GS, which results in a decrease of glycogen production. GSK3beta phosphorylation increases glycogen synthesis and storage, while its dephosphorylation decreases glycogen synthesis. Inactivation of GSK3beta leads to dephosphorylation of GS and increase in glycogen synthesis in the adipose tissue, muscle and liver. Glycogen levels are reduced by antidepressant treatment, and this effect seems to be related to an effect of drugs on GSK3beta activity. Peripherally, glycogen is also abundantly found in platelets, where it is considered a major energy source, required for a variety of its functions, including the release reaction. Recently, analysis of platelets from patients with late-life major depression showed that active forms of GSK3beta expression were upregulated by continuous treatment with sertraline. Here, we hypothesized that the quantification of glycogen in platelets might be used as a peripheral biomarker of GSK3beta activity. Since it has been recently demonstrated that the modulation of GSK3beta activity causes changes in glycogen stores, the glycogen levels in platelets could be used to assay the effects of drugs that have this kinase as a target, or diseases where its activity is affected. In conclusion, we hypothesized that the determination of glycogen peripherally may be useful to indicate a change in the activity of this enzyme, providing a faster and non-invasive approach to guide the therapeutic procedures for the patient.
