38759008|t|Assessment of Gray Matter Microstructural Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease by Free Water Imaging.
38759008|a|Background: Cortical neurodegenerative processes may precede the emergence of disease symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by many years. No study has evaluated the free water of patients with AD using gray matter-based spatial statistics. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore cortical microstructural changes within the gray matter in AD by using free water imaging with gray matter-based spatial statistics. Methods: Seventy-one participants underwent multi-shell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, and neuropsychological evaluations. The patients were divided into two groups: healthy controls (n = 40) and the AD spectrum group (n = 31). Differences between the groups were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and free water imaging with gray matter-based spatial statistics. Results: Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed gray matter volume loss in the hippocampus of patients with AD spectrum compared to that in controls. Furthermore, patients with AD spectrum exhibited significantly greater free water, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the limbic areas, precuneus, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, right putamen, and cerebellum than did the healthy controls. Overall, the effect sizes of free water were greater than those of mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and the larger effect sizes of free water were thought to be strongly correlated with AD pathology. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of applying voxel-based morphometry, gray matter-based spatial statistics, free water imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to assess AD pathology and detect changes in gray matter.
