29881529|t|Association between age associated cognitive decline and health related quality of life among Iranian older individuals.
29881529|a|BACKGROUND: Age associated cognitive decline or normal cognitive aging is related with lower levels of functioning in real life, and may interfere with maintaining independence and health related quality of life (HRQL). OBJECTIVE: In this study, health related quality of life and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults were evaluated with the aim of exploring the association between them by adjusting for potential confounders. METHODS: This cross-sectional study, was implemented on 425 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 and over, between August 2016 and October 2016 in health centers of the municipality of Tehran, Iran, using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive function and Short Form-36 scales (SF-36) to assess HRQL. The relation between HRQL and cognitive function was evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the impact of cognitive function on HRQL adjusted for potential confounders was estimated by linear regression model. All analyses were done using SPSS, version 22.0. RESULTS: A positive significant correlation between cognitive function and quality of life (r=0.434; p<0.001) and its dimensions was observed. Two variables of educational level (B=2.704; 95% CI: 2.09 to 3.30; p<0.001) and depression (B=2.554; 95% CI: 2.00 to 3.10; p<0.001) were assumed as potential confounder by changing effect measure after entering the model. After adjusting for potential confounders in regression model, the association between MMSE scores and quality of life persisted (B=2.417; 95% CI: 1.86 to 2.96; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that cognitive function was associated with HRQL in older adults with age associated cognitive function. Two variables of educational level and depression can affect the relation between cognitive decline and HRQL.
