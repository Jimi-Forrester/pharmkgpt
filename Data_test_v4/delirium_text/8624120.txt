8624120|t|Therapeutic effects of CDP-choline in Alzheimer's disease. Cognition, brain mapping, cerebrovascular hemodynamics, and immune factors.
8624120|a|CDP-choline was given to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at a daily dose of 1000 mg/day p.o. for one month. This compound slightly improved mental performance, tended to reduce theta activity in fronto-temporal regions, increasing alpha power in occipital areas, and enhanced cerebrovascular perfusion by increasing blood flow velocity and reducing pulsatility and resistance indexes. In addition, CDP-choline diminished histamine and interleukin-1 levels in blood and serum, respectively, and increased plasma TNF.
