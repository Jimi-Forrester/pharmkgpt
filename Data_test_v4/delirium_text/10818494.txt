10818494|t|A beta vasoactivity: an inflammatory reaction.
10818494|a|Mounting evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies in transgenic mice overproducing beta-amyloid peptides (A beta) suggests that A beta can induce vasoconstriction and decrease cerebral blood flow. In this report, we describe the vasoactive properties of A beta, in particular the enhancement of endothelin-1-induced vasoconstriction and A beta's induction of a long-lasting vasoconstrictive event. Furthermore, we show that low doses (as low as 50 nM) of freshly solubilized A beta similar to those observed in the plasma of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease are vasoactive. By using various inhibitors and activators of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)/arachidonic acid (AA) cascade, we demonstrate that A beta vasoactivity is dependent on activation of this intracellular signaling pathway, resulting in stimulation of downstream cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase, which mediate production of proinflammatory eicosanoids. Taken together, our data show that A beta directly activates an intracellular proinflammatory pathway, which is responsible for its vasoactive properties.
