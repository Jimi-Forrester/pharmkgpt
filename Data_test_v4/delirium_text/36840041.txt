36840041|t|Xanthones: Biosynthesis and Trafficking in Plants, Fungi and Lichens.
36840041|a|Xanthones are a class of secondary metabolites produced by plant organisms. They are characterized by a wide structural variety and numerous biological activities that make them valuable metabolites for use in the pharmaceutical field. This review shows the current knowledge of the xanthone biosynthetic pathway with a focus on the precursors and the enzymes involved, as well as on the cellular and organ localization of xanthones in plants. Xanthone biosynthesis in plants involves the shikimate and the acetate pathways which originate in plastids and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The pathway continues following three alternative routes, two phenylalanine-dependent and one phenylalanine-independent. All three routes lead to the biosynthesis of 2,3',4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone, which is the central intermediate. Unlike plants, the xanthone core in fungi and lichens is wholly derived from polyketide. Although organs and tissues synthesizing and accumulating xanthones are known in plants, no information is yet available on their subcellular and cellular localization in fungi and lichens. This review highlights the studies published to date on xanthone biosynthesis and trafficking in plant organisms, from which it emerges that the mechanisms underlying their synthesis need to be further investigated in order to exploit them for application purposes.
