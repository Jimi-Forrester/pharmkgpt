38908029|t|Promoter dependent RNA polymerase II bypass of the epimerizable DNA lesion, Fapy dG and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine.
38908029|a|Formamidopyrimidine (Fapy dG) is a major lesion arising from oxidation of dG that is produced from a common chemical precursor of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OxodGuo). In human cells, replication of single-stranded shuttle vectors containing Fapy dG is more mutagenic than 8-OxodGuo. Here, we present the first data regarding promoter dependent RNA polymerase II bypass of Fapy dG. 8-OxodGuo bypass was examined side-by-side. Experiments were carried out using double-stranded shuttle vectors in HeLa cell nuclear lysates and in HEK 293T cells. The lesions do not significantly block transcriptional bypass efficiency. Less than 2% adenosine incorporation occurred in cells when the lesions were base paired with dC. Inhibiting base excision repair in HEK 293T cells significantly increased adenosine incorporation, particularly from Fapy dG:dC bypass which yielded ~25% adenosine incorporation. No effect was detected upon transcriptional bypass of either lesion in nucleotide excision repair deficient cells. Transcriptional mutagenesis was significantly higher when shuttle vectors containing dA opposite one of the lesions were employed. For Fapy dG:dA bypass, adenosine incorporation was greater than 85%; whereas 8-OxodGuo:dA yielded >20% point mutations. The combination of more frequent replication mistakes and greater error-prone Pol II bypass suggest that Fapy dG is more mutagenic than 8-OxodGuo.
