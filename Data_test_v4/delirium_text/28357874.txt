28357874|a|BACKGROUND: Asia has the greatest population and more patients with dementia in the world. Early recognition of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for dementia care. In order to foster collaboration in AD care, a uniformed manner to report the early clinical symptoms of AD is necessary. METHODS: We have recruited clinically diagnosed patients with AD at their very mild stage with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5 in Taiwan, Japan, China, Philippines, and Singapore. Demographic characteristics and psychometrics including Ascertain of Dementia-8 (AD8) questionnaire were administrated to collect and report the clinical presentation in these countries. RESULTS: In total, 713 clinically diagnosed patients with AD at very mild stage, CDR 0.5, have been recruited from these 5 countries. "Repeats questions, stories, or statements" were consistently the frequently reported symptom across these countries. Taiwan, China, and Singapore have the higher AD8 total score compared to that in Japan and Philippines. Japan and Philippines have the gender-related differences in clinical presentation of early AD. CONCLUSION: Difficulties in using small trouble appliance and in handling complicated financial affairs were frequently reported in Japan female, compared to male, patients with AD. Identifying the clinical symptom of AD and the gender-related issues would be crucial in the dementia care in Asia.
