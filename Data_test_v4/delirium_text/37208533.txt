37208533|a|Major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) affects over 55 million people worldwide and is characterized by cognitive impairment (CI). This study aimed to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for CI based upon retinal thickness measurements explored in a mouse model. Discrimination indices and retinal layer thickness of healthy C57BL/6J mice were quantified through a novel object recognition test (NORT) and ocular coherence tomography (OCT), respectively. Based on criteria from the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5th ed. (DSM-V), a diagnostic test was generated by transforming data into rolling monthly averages and categorizing mice into those with and without CI and those with a high or low decline in retinal layer thickness. Only inner nuclear layer thickness had a statistically significant relationship with discrimination indices. Furthermore, our diagnostic test was 85.71% sensitive and 100% specific for diagnosing CI, with a positive predictive value of 100%. These findings have potential clinical implications for the early diagnosis of CI in NCD. However, further investigation in comorbid mice and humans is warranted.
