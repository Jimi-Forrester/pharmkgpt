3577511|t|[Status of erythrocytes and erythropoiesis in alcoholics].
3577511|a|To identify changes in the status of red blood and erythropoiesis in alcoholism, the authors examined three groups of patients aged 18 to 60 years: (1) 146 patients with stage II alcoholism; (2) 97 patients with acute alcoholic hallucinosis; and (3) 76 patients with delirium tremens. The examination revealed a considerable tension of erythropoiesis and erythrodieresis, this being a compensatory response to prolonged and severe hypoxia. At the beginnings of the disease the amount of erythrocytes and total hemoglobin tended to increase, then with the development of psychoses it dramatically decreased resulting in anemia. With disease progression the mean volume of erythrocytes tended to increase consistently reaching the highest values in delirium. This may serve as one of the diagnostic markers of alcoholism to be used in combination with other laboratory tests and clinical findings. The identified decrease in the insulin depositing function of erythrocytes may also indicate that the pancreas has also been involved in the pathological process.
