17851185|t|AICD and its adaptors - in search of new players.
17851185|a|In view of the emerging evidence that amyloid-beta load in the brain and neuronal deficits are possibly independent events and the increasing importance of downstream molecular cascades in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis, the role of Amyloid Intracellular C-terminal Domain (AICD) is evaluated. This C-terminal fragment of Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is cytotoxic and is a major component of AD brain. Different portions of AICD bind to different 'adaptors' and are seen to take part in various cellular events including AbetaPP processing and trafficking, apoptosis, neuronal growth and regulation of gene transcription. Phosphorylation also plays an important role in terms of choice of binding partners. The review emphasizes the dynamics of the network created by AICD interactions and points to possible alternative routes of AD like neurodegeneration.
