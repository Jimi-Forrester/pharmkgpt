29861829|t|Non-Provitamin A and Provitamin A Carotenoids as Immunomodulators: Recommended Dietary Allowance, Therapeutic Index, or Personalized Nutrition?
29861829|a|Vegetables and fruits contain non-provitamin A (lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin) and provitamin A (beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and alpha-carotene) carotenoids. Within these compounds, beta-carotene has been extensively studied for its health benefits, but its supplementation at doses higher than recommended intakes induces adverse effects. beta-Carotene is converted to retinoic acid (RA), a well-known immunomodulatory molecule. Human interventions suggest that beta-carotene and lycopene at pharmacological doses affect immune functions after a depletion period of low carotenoid diet. However, these effects appear unrelated to carotenoids and retinol levels in plasma. Local production of RA in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, as well as the dependency of RA-induced effects on local inflammation, suggests that personalized nutrition/supplementation should be considered in the future. On the other hand, the differential effect of RA and lycopene on transforming growth factor-beta suggests that lycopene supplementation could improve immune functions without increasing risk for cancers. However, such preclinical evidence must be confirmed in human interventions before any recommendations can be made.
