33264384|t|Development, Spanish Normative Data, and Validation of a Social Cognition Battery in Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.
33264384|a|OBJECTIVES: The assessment of social cognition changes may be challenging, especially in the earliest stages of some neurodegenerative diseases. Our objective was to validate a social cognition battery from a multidomain perspective. In this regard, we aimed to adapt several tests, collect normative data, and validate them in prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A total of 92 healthy controls, 25 prodromal AD, and 39 MS patients were enrolled. Age-, gender-, and education-matched control groups were created for comparisons. Social cognition battery was composed of an emotion-labeling task developed from FACES database, the Story-based Empathy test (SET), the Faux Pas test, and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Patients were also evaluated with a comprehensive cognitive battery to evaluate the other cognitive domains. Automatic linear modeling was used to predict each social cognition test's performance using the neuropsychological tests examining other cognitive domains. RESULTS: The reliability of the battery was moderate-high. Significant intergroup differences were found with medium-large effect sizes. Moderate correlations were found between social cognition battery and neuropsychological tests. The emotion labeling task and SET showed moderate correlations with age and education, and age, respectively. Regression-based norms were created considering the relevant demographic variables. Linear regression models including other neuropsychological tests explained between 7.7% and 68.8% of the variance of the social cognition tests performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a battery for the assessment of social cognition in prodromal AD and MS with Spanish normative data to improve the evaluation in clinical and research settings.
