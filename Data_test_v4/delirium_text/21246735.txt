21246735|t|To live or to die: a matter of processing damaged DNA termini in neurons.
21246735|a|Defects in the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage underpin several hereditary neurological diseases in humans. Of the different activities that repair chromosomal DNA breaks, defects in resolving damaged DNA termini are among the most common causes of neuronal cell death. Here, the molecular mechanisms of some of the DNA end processing activities are reviewed and the association with human neurodegenerative disease is discussed.
