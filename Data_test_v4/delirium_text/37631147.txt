37631147|t|Resveratrol and Other Natural Oligomeric Stilbenoid Compounds and Their Therapeutic Applications.
37631147|a|The use of natural compounds as an alternative to synthetic molecules has become a significant subject of interest in recent decades. Stilbenoids are a group of phenolic compounds found in many plant species and they have recently gained the focus of a multitude of studies in medicine and chemistry, resveratrol being the most representative molecule. In this review, we focused on the research that illustrates the therapeutic potential of this class of natural molecules considering various diseases with higher incidence rates. PubChem database was searched for bioactivities of natural stilbenoids, while several keywords (i.e., "stilbenoids", "stilbenoid anticancer") were used to query PubMed database for relevant studies. The diversity and the simplicity of stilbenes' chemical structures together with the numerous biological sources are key elements that can simplify both the isolation of these compounds and the drug design of novel bioactive molecules. Resveratrol and other related compounds are heterogeneously distributed in plants and are mainly found in grapes and wine. Natural stilbenes were shown to possess a wide range of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and antineoplastic properties. While resveratrol is widely investigated for its benefits in various disorders, further studies are warranted to properly harness the therapeutic potential of less popular stilbenoid compounds.
