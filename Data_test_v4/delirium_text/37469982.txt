37469982|a|Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular lesion that occurs as a complication of diabetes mellitus. Many studies reveal that retinal neurodegeneration occurs early in its pathogenesis, and abnormal retinal function can occur in patients without any signs of microvascular abnormalities. The gut microbiota is a large, diverse colony of microorganisms that colonize the human intestine. Studies indicated that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological processes of DR and plays an important role in its development. On the one hand, numerous studies demonstrated the involvement of gut microbiota in retinal neurodegeneration. On the other hand, alterations in gut bacteria in RD patients can cause or exacerbate DR. The present review aims to underline the critical relationship between gut microbiota and DR. After a brief overview of the composition, function, and essential role of the gut microbiota in ocular health, and the review explores the concept of the gut-retina axis and the conditions of the gut-retina axis crosstalk. Because gut dysbiosis has been associated with DR, the review intends to determine changes in the gut microbiome in DR, the hypothesized mechanisms linking to the gut-retina axis, and its predictive potential.
