38967191|a|The development of targeted phthalazine-1,4-dione acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for treating Alzheimer's disease involved the synthesis of 32 compounds via a multistage process. Various analytical techniques confirmed the compounds' identities. Thirteen compounds were found to inhibit AChE by more than 50% without affecting butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Among these, three compounds, 8m, 8n, and 8p, exhibited extraordinary activity similar to donepezil, a reference AChE inhibitor. During enzyme kinetic studies, compound 8n, displaying the highest AChE inhibitory activity, underwent evaluation at three concentrations (2 x IC50, IC50, and IC50/2). Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated mixed inhibition activity for compound 8n against AChE, suggesting a combination of competitive and noncompetitive characteristics. Additionally, effective derivatives 8m, 8n, and 8p exhibited high blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in in vitro parallel artificial membrane permeability assay tests. Molecular docking studies revealed that these compounds bind to the enzyme's active site residues in a position similar to donepezil. Molecular dynamic simulations confirmed the stability of the protein-ligand system, and the chemical reactivity characteristics of the compounds were investigated using density functional theory. The compounds' wide energy gaps suggest stability and therapeutic potential. This research represents a significant step toward finding a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, further research and testing are required to determine the compounds' safety and efficacy. The unique structure of phthalazine derivatives makes them suitable for various biological activities, and these compounds show promise for developing effective drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease. Overall, the development of these targeted compounds is a crucial advancement in the search for an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
