32067538|t|Catatonia revived: a unique syndrome updated.
32067538|a|Catatonia was buried within the confines of schizophrenia for over a century- deterring study, appropriate diagnosis and treatment for many years. With revised changes in the classification of this distinct neuropsychiatric syndrome, it is becoming more recognized clinically and in ongoing research. Catatonia occurs among various psychiatric, metabolic or neurologic conditions. It may present in many forms, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Treatment with benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy usually produces dramatic and rapid response, although systematic, randomized trials are lacking. The role of antipsychotic agents in treatment is controversial as they may worsen the syndrome. An important unresolved clinical question is the diagnosis and treatment of catatonia in the setting of delirium.
