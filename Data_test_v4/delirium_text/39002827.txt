39002827|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and characterized by extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles and neurodegeneration. Over 80 % of AD patients also exhibit cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is a cerebrovascular disease caused by deposition of Abeta in the walls of cerebral blood vessels leading to vessel damage and impairment of normal blood flow. To date, different studies suggest that platelet function, including activation, adhesion and aggregation, is altered in AD due to vascular Abeta deposition. For example, the transgenic AD model mice APP23 mice that exhibit CAA and parenchymal Abeta plaques, show pre-activated platelets in the blood circulation and increased platelet integrin activation leading to a pro-thrombotic phenotype in these mice late stages of AD. However, it is still an open question whether or not platelets exhibit changes in their activation profile before they are exposed to vascular Abeta deposits. Therefore, the present study examined platelets from middle-aged transgenic APP23 mice at the age of 8-10 months. At this age, APP23 mice show amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma but not in the vasculature. Our analyses show that these APP23 mice have unaltered platelet numbers and size, and unaltered surface expression of glycoproteins. However, the number of dense granules in transgenic platelets was increased while the release was unaltered. Male, but not female APP23 mice, exhibited reduced platelet activation after stimulation of the thrombin receptor PAR4 and decreased thrombus stability on collagen under flow conditions ex vivo compared to control mice. In an arterial thrombosis model in vivo, male APP23 mice showed attenuated occlusion of the injured artery compared to controls. These findings provide clear evidence for early changes in platelet activation and thrombus formation in male mice before development of overt CAA. Furthermore, reduced platelet activation and thrombus formation suggest sex-specific differences in platelet physiology in AD that has to be considered in future studies of platelets and their role in AD.
