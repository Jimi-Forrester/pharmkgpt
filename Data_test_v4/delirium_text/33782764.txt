33782764|a|PURPOSE: Early post-operative delirium (EPOD) is a frequent complication following colorectal surgery. The present study investigated the risk factors for EPOD after laparoscopic colorectal surgery in elderly patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among 208 patients >=70 years old who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinicopathological factors associated with the EPOD. RESULTS: The overall incidence of EPOD was 10.1% (21/208). The univariate analysis showed that an older age (>=80 years old; P=0.002), sleeping pill medication before surgery (P=0.037), a history of dementia (P=0.030) and cerebrovascular disease (P=0.017), elevated levels of D-dimer (P=0.016), maximum intraoperative temperature >=37  C (P=0.036), and non-continuous usage of droperidol with analgesia (P=0.005) were associated with EPOD. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an older age (>=80 years old; odds ratio [OR]: 6.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.94-20.15, P=0.002), sleeping pill medication before surgery (OR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.36-21.28, P=0.016), history of cerebrovascular disease (OR: 3.91, 95% CI: 1.12-13.66, P=0.033), and maximum intraoperative temperature >=37  C (OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.53-16.92, P=0.008) to be independent risk factors. When the patients were divided into groups according to the number of positive risk factors, the prevalence rate was 6.5%, 16.0%, and 63.6% for patients with 1, 2, and 3 positive risk factors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that an older age, sleeping pill medication before surgery, history of cerebrovascular disease, and maximum intraoperative temperature >=37  C are independent risk factors of EPOD after laparoscopic colorectal surgery in elderly patients.
