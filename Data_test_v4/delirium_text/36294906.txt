36294906|t|Status Epilepticus in Post-Transplantation Hyperammonemia Involves Careful Metabolic Management.
36294906|a|Hyperammonemia is a condition that may result after solid organ transplantation, particularly lung transplantation. However, it is very uncommon for this presentation to occur more than 30 days post-transplantation. Hyperammonemia and the resulting encephalopathy typically manifest with altered sensorium, a clinical situation which is not often included in the differential diagnosis of presumed nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Seizures are common among this subset of patients with hyperammonemia and may be refractory to traditional treatments. Evidence of elevated intracranial pressure by invasive monitoring and neuroimaging findings of diffuse cerebral edema are commonly reported. Here we examine the therapeutic importance of identifying the specific cause of hyperammonemic encephalopathy, a condition which may result in status epilepticus and ultimately cerebral edema or even brain death.
