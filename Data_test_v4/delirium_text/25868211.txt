25868211|a|We report a successful case of sedation during spinal anesthesia using continuous administration of landiolol and dexmedetomidine in a patient with severe dementia. An 86-year-old man weighing 63 kg with severe dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was scheduled for emergent open reduction of fracture under spinal anesthesia. On admission, he presented with delirium as a result of pain and environmental change. He also suffered from herpes zoster infection and we decided to perform the operation under spina anesthesia. To alleviate his anxiety and state of panic we continuously administered landiolol 10 mug x g kg(-1). min(-1) and dexmedetomidine 0.4 mug x kg(-1) x hr(-1). After 10 minutes, he was sedated and agreed to undergo spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was successful with isobaric bupivacaine 3.0 mI. The patient showed no untoward behavior during anesthesia and the operation.
