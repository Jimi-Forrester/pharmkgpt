37791000|t|Factors associated with improvement in impaired consciousness during the acute phase of cerebral infarction: a prospective observational study.
37791000|a|[Purpose] In this study, we investigated factors that contribute to improvement in impaired consciousness following cerebral infarction. [Participants and Methods] This prospective observational study included 186 patients with cerebral infarction. We investigated 21 variables including the rehabilitation status to determine factors that contribute to improvement in impaired consciousness. [Results] Improvement in impaired consciousness was correlated with age, delirium, the Japan Coma Scale score at initiation of rehabilitation, worsening, cerebral edema, and standing practice. [Conclusion] We conclude that the aforementioned factors may serve as predictors of possible improvement and that standing practice may contribute to improvement in impaired consciousness.
