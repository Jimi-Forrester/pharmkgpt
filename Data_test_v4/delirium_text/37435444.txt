37435444|t|Peripheral Nerve Block and Peri-operative Neurocognitive Disorders in Older Patients With Hip Fractures: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.
37435444|a|Background: Poor pain control and opioid use are risk factors for perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). The peripheral nerve block (PNB) can reduce pain and opioid consumption. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of PNB on PND in older patients with hip fractures. Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Central Registers of Controlled Trial, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from inception until November 19, 2021 for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PNB with analgesics. The quality of the selected studies was assessed according to Version 2 of the Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias in RCTs. The primary outcome was the incidence of PND. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Subgroup analyses were based on population characteristics, type and infusion method of local anesthetics, and type of PNB. Results: Eight RCTs comprising 1015 older patients with hip fractures were included. Compared with analgesics, PNB did not reduce the incidence of PND in the elderly hip fracture population comprising patients with intact cognition and those with pre-existing dementia or cognitive impairment (risk ratio [RR] = .67; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .42 to 1.08; P = .10; I2 = 64%). However, PNB reduced the incidence of PND in older patients with intact cognition (RR = .61; 95% CI = .41 to .91; P = .02; I2 = 0%). Fascia iliaca compartment block, bupivacaine, and continuous infusion of local anesthetics were found to reduce the incidence of PND. Conclusions: PNB effectively reduced PND in older patients with hip fractures and intact cognition. When the study population included patients with intact cognition and those with pre-existing dementia or cognitive impairment, PNB showed no reduction in the incidence of PND. These conclusions should be confirmed with larger, higher-quality RCTs.
