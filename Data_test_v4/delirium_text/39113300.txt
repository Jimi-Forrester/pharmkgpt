39113300|t|Germacrone: A Multi-targeting Sesquiterpene with Promising Anti-cancer and Chronic Disease Applications.
39113300|a|BACKGROUND: Germacrone, a naturally occurring active compound found in essential oils extracted from medicinal plants within the Zingiberaceae family, has garnered attention for its potential therapeutic applications. Extensive research has highlighted its multi-targeting capabilities, positioning it as a promising treatment for various chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of germacrone as a scaffold for developing multi-targeting drugs with therapeutic potential against a range of chronic disorders. The study delves into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic effects of germacrone and explores its potential targets, including NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, JAK/STAT, caspase, apoptosis, and autophagy induction. METHODS: A systematic review of literature databases was conducted to gather relevant studies on germacrone and its therapeutic applications. The molecular mechanisms and potential targets of germacrone were examined to elucidate its multi-targeting capabilities. RESULTS: Germacrone exhibits significant potential in the management of chronic diseases, with demonstrated effects on various cellular pathways. The review highlights its impact on NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, JAK/STAT, caspase, apoptosis, and autophagy induction, showcasing its versatility in targeting multiple pathways associated with chronic conditions. Germacrone has emerged as a promising candidate for the treatment of diverse chronic diseases. The understanding of its multi-targeting capabilities, coupled with its natural origin, positions it as a valuable scaffold for developing therapeutics. CONCLUSION: The exploration of germacrone as a structural framework for multi-targeting drugs offers a potential avenue to enhance efficacy while minimizing potential side effects. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to validate the therapeutic potential of germacrone in diverse medical contexts.
