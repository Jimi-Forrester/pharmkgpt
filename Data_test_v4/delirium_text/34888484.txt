34888484|a|Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), the virus which causes roseola, has traditionally been associated with benign and self-limited childhood illness. However, HHV-6 establishes lifelong latency and can reactivate in immunocompromised adult patients. In about 1% of cases, it integrates into the human genome as inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6). We report the case of a 70-year-old man presenting with altered mental status and agitation. His infectious workup revealed a cerebrospinal fluid sample positive for HHV-6 with virus detectable in the blood as well. He was subsequently treated with ganciclovir. HHV-6 viremia (DNAemia) persisted, and the antiviral medications were switched to foscarnet under the assumption of treatment failure due to drug resistance. After several admissions to the hospital for the same complaint, and after noticing that DNAemia persisted despite adequate treatment for HHV-6, infectious disease specialists ordered testing for chromosomally integrated virus. Test results confirmed the presence of iciHHV-6, explaining his consistently elevated serum viral load. Primary HHV-6 infection in adults causes a transient increase in viral load with resolution and clearance after a few weeks while iciHHV-6 is characterized by persistent detection of viral DNA at a high copy number. Individuals with iciHHV-6 can develop HHV-6 disease and are at increased risk for active viral replication when treated with immunosuppressive medications, but only mRNA testing, which is not widely available can differentiate between latent and active infection. This makes the decision to treat challenging in this patient population. When faced with a positive HHV-6 DNA result in the setting of equivocal symptoms, clinicians should consider the possibility of chromosomally integrated virus rather than drug-resistant virus in order to reduce exposure to potentially toxic antiviral medications.
