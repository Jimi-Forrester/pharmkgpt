10409396|a|Neurotoxicity from chronic metal inhalation has been suggested as an underlying contributor to late-developing neurodegenerative diseases that have symptoms similar to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's syndromes. If inhaled metals contribute to pathogenesis of these diseases, identifying, localizing, and quantitating metal deposition(s) within specific target regions of the central nervous system will be critical to our understanding of the mechanisms. Standard analytical techniques used to date require exposure to extremely high concentrations of metals to meet analytical detection limits in small tissue areas. The relevance to lower-dose environmentally relevant exposures and potential protective barriers is therefore questionable. The feasibility of microbeam particle-induced X-ray emission is investigated as a method for rapidly scanning tissues to study the inhalation of metals, nasal permeability, and central nervous system deposition. The optimal beam spot and analysis time used to image the rat olfactory epithelium to facilitate the rapid detection of aluminum localizations were determined. Measurements of aluminum localizations in rat olfactory bulb and brain sections are also presented.
