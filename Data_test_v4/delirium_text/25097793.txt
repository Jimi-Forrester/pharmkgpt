25097793|t|Identification and Preclinical Pharmacology of the gamma-Secretase Modulator BMS-869780.
25097793|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia and is associated with accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), particularly the 42-amino acid Abeta1-42, in the brain. Abeta1-42 levels can be decreased by gamma-secretase modulators (GSM), which are small molecules that modulate gamma-secretase, an enzyme essential for Abeta production. BMS-869780 is a potent GSM that decreased Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 and increased Abeta1-37 and Abeta1-38, without inhibiting overall levels of Abeta peptides or other APP processing intermediates. BMS-869780 also did not inhibit Notch processing by gamma-secretase and lowered brain Abeta1-42 without evidence of Notch-related side effects in rats. Human pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were predicted through allometric scaling of PK in rat, dog, and monkey and were combined with the rat pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters to predict the relationship between BMS-869780 dose, exposure and Abeta1-42 levels in human. Off-target and safety margins were then based on comparisons to the predicted exposure required for robust Abeta1-42 lowering. Because of insufficient safety predictions and the relatively high predicted human daily dose of 700 mg, further evaluation of BMS-869780 as a potential clinical candidate was discontinued. Nevertheless, BMS-869780 demonstrates the potential of the GSM approach for robust lowering of brain Abeta1-42 without Notch-related side effects.
