37704994|a|BACKGROUND: Prognostic models of hospital-induced delirium, that include potential predisposing and precipitating factors, may be used to identify vulnerable patients and inform the implementation of tailored preventive interventions. It is recommended that, in prediction model development studies, candidate predictors are selected on the basis of existing knowledge, including knowledge from clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to describe the process of identifying and operationalizing candidate predictors of hospital-induced delirium for application in a prediction model development study using a practice-based approach. METHODS: This study is part of a larger, retrospective cohort study that is developing prognostic models of hospital-induced delirium for medical-surgical older adult patients using structured data from administrative and electronic health records. First, we conducted a review of the literature to identify clinical concepts that had been used as candidate predictors in prognostic model development-and-validation studies of hospital-induced delirium. Then, we consulted a multidisciplinary task force of nine members who independently judged whether each clinical concept was associated with hospital-induced delirium. Finally, we mapped the clinical concepts to the administrative and electronic health records and operationalized our candidate predictors. RESULTS: In the review of 34 studies, we identified 504 unique clinical concepts. Two-thirds of the clinical concepts (337/504) were used as candidate predictors only once. The most common clinical concepts included age (31/34), sex (29/34), and alcohol use (22/34). 96% of the clinical concepts (484/504) were judged to be associated with the development of hospital-induced delirium by at least two members of the task force. All of the task force members agreed that 47 or 9% of the 504 clinical concepts were associated with hospital-induced delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity among candidate predictors of hospital-induced delirium in the literature suggests a still evolving list of factors that contribute to the development of this complex phenomenon. We demonstrated a practice-based approach to variable selection for our model development study of hospital-induced delirium. Expert judgement of variables enabled us to categorize the variables based on the amount of agreement among the experts and plan for the development of different models, including an expert-model and data-driven model.
