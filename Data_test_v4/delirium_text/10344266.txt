10344266|t|Two-dimensional map of human brain proteins.
10344266|a|Samples of human brain from the parietal cortex lobe were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, using immobilized pH gradient strips covering the various pH regions. The protein spots were visualized with colloidal Coomassie blue stain and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Approximately 400 spots were identified, corresponding to 180 different brain proteins. The list of identified proteins includes a large number of structural proteins and of enzymes or enzyme subunits with various catalytic activities. The majority of proteins are localized in the cytoplasma and in mitochondria. The two-dimensional map may be useful as a reference database to study changes in the protein level caused by various disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, major depression and schizophrenia.
