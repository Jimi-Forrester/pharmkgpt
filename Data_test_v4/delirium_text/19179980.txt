19179980|a|The annual meeting of the American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair (ASNTR) showcases the latest research trends in neurodegenerative disease and the related medical regenerative science. The 2008 ASNTR meeting covered a variety of different topics ranging from basic research to exploration of currently unknown pathogenesis and mechanisms for specific neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or stroke. This included studies to characterize stem cells, such as neural stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and human umbilical cord blood cells, for transplantation and the conditions necessary to maximize the efficacy of endogenous and exogenous stem cells, such as isolation, purification, differentiation, and migration. Moreover, a number of studies looked at methods for more advanced application of transplantation of cells or specific factors, through tissue engineering or manipulation beyond simple injection. Finally, well-known or previously un-known dietary supplementation or pharmacological materials that can affect the nervous system positively or negatively, were also important topics.
