35159276|t|Activation of Non-Canonical Autophagic Pathway through Inhibition of Non-Integrin Laminin Receptor in Neuronal Cells.
35159276|a|To fight neurodegenerative diseases, several therapeutic strategies have been proposed that, to date, are either ineffective or at the early preclinical stages. Intracellular protein aggregates represent the cause of about 70% of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Thus, autophagy, i.e., lysosomal degradation of macromolecules, could be employed in this context as a therapeutic strategy. Searching for a compound that stimulates this process led us to the identification of a 37/67kDa laminin receptor inhibitor, NSC48478. We have analysed the effects of this small molecule on the autophagic process in mouse neuronal cells and found that NSC48478 induces the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-I) into the LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II). Interestingly, upon NSC48478 treatment, the contribution of membranes to the autophagic process derived mainly from the non-canonical m-TOR-independent endocytic pathway, involving the Rab proteins that control endocytosis and vesicle recycling. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis suggests that, while the expression of key genes linked to canonical autophagy was unchanged, the main genes related to the positive regulation of endocytosis (pinocytosis and receptor mediated), along with genes regulating vesicle fusion and autolysosomal maturation, were upregulated under NSC48478 conditions. These results strongly suggest that 37/67 kDa inhibitor could be a useful tool for future studies in pathological conditions.
