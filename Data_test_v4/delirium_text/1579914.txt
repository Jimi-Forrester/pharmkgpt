1579914|a|Physostigmine was originally isolated from the Calabar Bean, which was used for ordeal by poison in West Africa. The main alkaloid was isolated in 1864. It acts through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, and has been of major importance in elucidating the kinetics and configuration of the enzyme. Physostigmine has been important for our understanding of neurohumoral chemical transmission, and in mapping the cholinergic nerves. It was the first antagonist to curare, and has been widely used for various therapeutic purposes. Today it has been largely replaced by more efficient and safe drugs. It is still used as an antidote to poisoning from various psychopharmacological drugs, and to treat postoperative somnolence and respiratory depression. It is considered a potent antidote to organophosphorous poisoning and is used experimentally to treat Alzheimer's disease.
