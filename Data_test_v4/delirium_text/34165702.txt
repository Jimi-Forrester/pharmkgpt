34165702|a|PURPOSE: There are numerous biomarkers which may have potential predictive and prognostic significance in breast cancer. This is extremely important in older adults, who may opt for less aggressive therapy. This work outlines the literature on biological assessment outside of standard biomarkers (defined as ER, PgR, HER2, Ki67) in women >= 65 years with primary operable invasive breast cancer, to determine which additional biomarkers are relevant to outcome in older women. METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched. Studies were eligible if included >= 50 patients aged >= 65 years; stratified results by age; measured a biomarker outside of standard assay and reported patient data. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were appraised involving 5000 patients, measuring 28 biomarkers. The studies were extremely varied in methodology and outcome but three themes emerged: 1. Differences in biomarker expression between younger and older women, indicating that breast cancer in older women is generally less aggressive compared to younger women; 2. Relationship of biomarker expression with survival, suggesting biomarkers which may exclusively predict response to primary treatment in older women; 3. Association of biomarker with chemotherapy, suggesting that older patients should not be declined chemotherapy based on age alone. CONCLUSION: There is evidence to support further investigation of B-cell lymphoma (BCL2), liver kinase (LK)B1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytoplasmic cyclin-E, mucin (MUC)1 and cytokeratins (CKs) as potential predictive or prognostic markers in older women with breast cancer undergoing surgery. Studies exploring these biomarkers in larger cohorts and in women undergoing non-operative therapies are required.
