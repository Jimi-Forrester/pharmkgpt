35335234|t|Using Taguchi Method to Determine the Optimum Conditions for Synthesizing Parapyruvate.
35335234|a|The synthesis of parapyruvate is important for the analysis of the content in the pyruvate supplements and the study of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, the pure parapyruvate crystal is not, as yet, commercially available. In this study, we applied the Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array to investigate the optimal conditions for the preparation of the pure parapyruvate by the alkaline treatment of the pyruvic acid and then followed it with the solvent crystallization steps. We were also interested in revealing the major factors that affect the yield for the synthesized pure parapyruvate crystals. In addition, the parapyruvate-inhibited enzyme kinetic of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) was also investigated. We found that the pure parapyruvate could be obtained in combination with an alkaline treatment and two solvent crystallization steps. The main factors affecting the yield of the pure parapyruvate were the concentration of the pyruvic acid (the reactant), the pH of the alkali treatment, the type of solvent used for the crystallization and the volume ratio of solvent used for crystallization. Finally, the optimal conditions could prepare parapyruvate crystals with a high purity of 99.8% and a high yield of 72.8%. In addition, the results demonstrate that parapyruvate is a reversibly competitive inhibitor for KGDHC.
