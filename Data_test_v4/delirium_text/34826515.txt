34826515|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects several brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) involved in execution, working memory, and fear extinction. Despite these critical roles, the PFC is understudied in AD pathology. People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have twice the risk of developing AD, and the underlying mechanisms linking these two diseases are less understood. Here, we investigated the effect of footshock stress on behavioural vis-a-vis molecular changes in the PFC of an amyloid-beta (Abeta)-42 lesion rat model of AD. Trauma-like conditions were induced by exposing the animals to several footshocks. AD-like condition was induced via intra-hippocampal injection of Abeta-42 peptide. Following Abeta-42 injections, animals were tested for behavioural changes using the Open Field Test (OFT) and Y-maze test. The PFC was later harvested for neurochemical analyses. Our results showed an interactive effect of footshocks and Abeta-42 lesion on: reduced percentage alternation in the Y-maze test, suggesting memory impairment; reduced number of line crosses and time spent in the centre square of the OFT, indicating anxiogenic responses. Similarly, there was an interactive effect of footshocks and Abeta-42 lesion on: increased FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) expression, which can be associated with stress-induced anxiogenic behaviours; and increased neuronal apoptosis in the PFC of the animals. In addition, footshocks, as well as Abeta-42 lesion, reduced superoxide dismutase levels and Bridging Integrator-1 (BIN1) expression in the PFC of the animals, which can be linked to the observed memory impairment. In conclusion, our findings indicate that footshocks exaggerate PFC-associated behavioural and molecular changes induced by an AD-like pathology.
