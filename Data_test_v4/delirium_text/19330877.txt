19330877|a|Mind how you go: The current strategies for the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease are very diverse. Particular attention is given to the search for inhibitors (see picture for two examples) of the proteolytic enzyme beta- and gamma-secretase, which inhibits the cleavage of the amyloid precursor proteins into amyloid beta peptides, from which the disease-defining deposits of plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients originates.Research on senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease covers an extremely broad range of scientific activities. At the recent international meeting of the Alzheimer's Association (ICAD 2008, Chicago) more than 2200 individual scientific contributions were presented. The aim of this Review is to give an overview of the field and to outline its main areas, starting from behavioral abnormalities and visible pathological findings and then focusing on the molecular details of the pathology. The "amyloid hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease is given particular attention, since the majority of the ongoing therapeutic approaches are based on its theoretical framework.
