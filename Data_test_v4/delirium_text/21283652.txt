21283652|a|For many years, clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor (alpha2-AR) agonist, has been widely used as an analgesic adjuvant in perioperative conditions and pain therapy. Dexmedetomidine (DMET) is currently the most potent alpha2-AR agonist available and was first approved as a sedative agent for use in the intensive care unit. However, DMET has recently been investigated for its analgesic effects and has the potential to become an alternative to clonidine.
