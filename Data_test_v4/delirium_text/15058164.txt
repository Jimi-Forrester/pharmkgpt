Also to there may be mental, emotional and intellectual disturbances. This kind of complications occurs in 33-83% of patients. The post-cardiopulmonary by-pass delirium is a syndrome with diverse symptoms. Confusion, hallucinations, paranoid illusions, psycho-motoric excitation, fear may also occur. A high level of serotonin and overstimulation of 5-HT2 receptors in the central nervous system are the reason of delirium. The relief of symptoms may be achieved by intravenous administration of Ondansetron, an antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors.
