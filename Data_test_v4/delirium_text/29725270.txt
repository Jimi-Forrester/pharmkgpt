29725270|t|Long Noncoding RNAs and mRNA Regulation in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.
29725270|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We evaluated the lncRNA and mRNA expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy nonsmokers, smokers without airflow limitation, and COPD patients. METHODS: lncRNA and mRNA profiling of PBMCs from 17 smokers and 14 COPD subjects was detected by high-throughput microarray. The expression of dysregulated lncRNAs was validated by qPCR. The lncRNA targets in dysregulated mRNAs were predicted and the GO enrichment was analyzed. The regulatory role of lncRNA ENST00000502883.1 on CXCL16 expression and consequently the effect on PBMC recruitment were investigated by siRNA knockdown and chemotaxis analysis. RESULTS: We identified 158 differentially expressed lncRNAs in PBMCs from COPD subjects compared with smokers. The dysregulated expression of 5 selected lncRNAs NR_026891.1 (FLJ10038), ENST00000502883.1 (RP11-499E18.1), HIT000648516, XR_429541.1, and ENST00000597550.1 (CTD-2245F17.3), was validated. The GO enrichment showed that leukocyte migration, immune response, and apoptosis are the main enriched processes that previously reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. The regulatory role of ENST00000502883.1 on CXCL16 expression and consequently the effect on PBMC recruitment was confirmed. CONCLUSION: This study may provide clues for further studies targeting lncRNAs to control inflammation in COPD.
