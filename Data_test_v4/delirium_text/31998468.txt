31998468|t|Analysis of Anesthesia Methods in Percutaneous Kyphoplasty for Treatment of Vertebral Compression Fractures.
31998468|a|Aim: Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is a routine operation for the treatment of vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Both local anesthesia and general anesthesia are widely used for PKP. However, which type of anesthesia is better for PKP still remains uncertain. This study aimed to find out whether local anesthesia or general anesthesia is more suitable for PKP. Methods: This is a retrospective clinical trial. A total of 85 single-level VCF patients who received PKP 12 months ago were recruited in this study. 45 patients who received local anesthesia were in group L, and 40 patients with general anesthesia were in group G. Clinical, radiological, and economic data between the two groups were collected. Results: No difference was found on preoperative data between the two groups. The duration of operation time in group L was longer than that in group G. Within 12 months after PKP, more complications happened in group G than those in group L. Results: No difference was found on preoperative data between the two groups. The duration of operation time in group L was longer than that in group G. Within 12 months after PKP, more complications happened in group G than those in group L. Conclusion: Both local anesthesia and general anesthesia were reliable for PKP. However, local anesthesia was more efficient and safer with less expense and more bearable pain when compared with general anesthesia.
