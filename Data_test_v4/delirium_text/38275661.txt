38275661|t|Gallic Acid Protects from Sepsis-Induced Acute Lung Injury.
38275661|a|Sepsis, a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, involves multiple organ dysfunction syndromes driven by free radical-mediated processes. Uncontrolled inflammation in early sepsis stages can lead to acute lung injury (ALI). Activated leukocytes generate reactive oxygen species, contributing to sepsis development. Gallic acid, a phenolic compound, is known for its antimicrobial properties. This study aims to observe gallic acid's protective and restorative effect on the lungs in an experimental sepsis model. Male Wistar albino rats were subjected to a feces intraperitoneal injection procedure (FIP) to induce sepsis. Four groups were formed: normal control, FIP alone, FIP with saline, and FIP with gallic acid. Gallic acid was administered intraperitoneally at 20 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, and computed tomography assessed lung tissue histopathologically and radiologically. Gallic acid significantly decreased malondialdehyde, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, CRP levels, oxidative stress, and inflammation indicators. Lactic acid levels decreased, suggesting improved tissue oxygenation. Histopathological examinations revealed reduced lung damage in the gallic-acid-treated group. Computed tomography confirmed lower lung density, indicating less severe inflammation. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated improved oxygenation in gallic-acid-treated rats. Gallic acid exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, reducing markers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. The findings support its potential to protect against ALI during sepsis. Comparable studies underline gallic acid's anti-inflammatory properties in different tissues. Early administration of gallic acid in sepsis models demonstrated protective effects against ALI, emphasizing its potential as an adjunct therapy to mitigate adverse outcomes. The study proposes gallic acid to reduce mortality rates and decrease the need for mechanical ventilation during sepsis-induced ALI.
