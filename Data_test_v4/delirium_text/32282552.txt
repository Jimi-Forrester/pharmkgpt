32282552|t|Not Just Homeless, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease: A Case Report.
32282552|a|Over a 3-month period, a homeless person was admitted several times to emergency departments after displaying severe behavioral changes and paranoia. No psychiatric tests were performed but all other tests were repeatedly normal; antianxiety treatments or painkillers were the common outcome. It may seem that any diagnosis rested on the patient's immediately apparent social circumstances. Indeed, the patient was admitted to our internal medicine department after a diagnosis of acute delirium within a context of social disadvantage. This social predicament, namely, the patient's evident homelessness, proved to be a false but significant and overarching influence on several misdiagnoses until that moment. Subsequently, actual psychological observations, assessments and tests indicated and confirmed the presence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is an uncommon and fatal disease; however, early diagnosis can enable the implementation of an important palliative care program. The starkly impoverished social circumstances of a patient should never distract a medical practitioner from a comprehensive diagnosis. Homelessness, for example, may invite certain physical and mental considerations, but it must not overdetermine our response and must not obscure or detract from a wider diagnosis. Homelessness is not a medical condition.
