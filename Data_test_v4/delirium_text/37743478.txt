37743478|t|Palliative care for persons with late-stage Alzheimer's and related dementias and their caregivers: protocol for a randomized clinical trial.
37743478|a|BACKGROUND: Limited access to specialized palliative care exposes persons with late-stage Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) to burdensome treatment and unnecessary hospitalization and their caregivers to avoidable strain and financial burden. Addressing this unmet need, the purpose of this study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the ADRD-Palliative Care (ADRD-PC) program. METHODS: The study will use a multisite, RCT design and will be set in five geographically diverse US hospitals. Lead investigators and outcome assessors will be masked. The study will use 1:1 randomization of patient-caregiver dyads, and sites will enroll N = 424 dyads of hospitalized patients with late-stage ADRD with their family caregivers. Intervention dyads will receive the ADRD-PC program of (1) dementia-specific palliative care, (2) standardized caregiver education, and (3) transitional care. Control dyads will receive publicly available educational material on dementia caregiving. Outcomes will be measured at 30 days (interim) and 60 days post-discharge. The primary outcome will be 60-day hospital transfers, defined as visits to an emergency department or hospitalization ascertained from health record reviews and caregiver interviews (aim 1). Secondary patient-centered outcomes, ascertained from 30- and 60-day health record reviews and caregiver telephone interviews, will be symptom treatment, symptom control, use of community palliative care or hospice, and new nursing home transitions (aim 2). Secondary caregiver-centered outcomes will be communication about prognosis and goals of care, shared decision-making about hospitalization and other treatments, and caregiver distress (aim 3). Analyses will use intention-to-treat, and pre-specified exploratory analyses will examine the effects of sex as a biologic variable and the GDS stage. DISCUSSION: The study results will determine the efficacy of an intervention that addresses the extraordinary public health impact of late-stage ADRD and suffering due to symptom distress, burdensome treatments, and caregiver strain. While many caregivers prioritize comfort in late-stage ADRD, shared decision-making is rare. Hospitalization creates an opportunity for dementia-specific palliative care, and the study findings will inform care redesign to advance comprehensive dementia-specific palliative care plus transitional care.
