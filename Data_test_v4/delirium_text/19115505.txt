19115505|a|Although several surgical procedures had been introduced for the relief or correction of various congenital and acquired heart diseases during the early decades of the 20th century, the first performed inside the heart was that for mitral stenosis. For this reason, it has particular significance. Although some surgical advances can be characterized as dramatic and may be quickly adopted in medical practice, the history of this approach to mitral stenosis was notable for prolonged resistance from existing medical authorities. There were also frequent technical setbacks in implementing surgical treatment of this common and often fatal disease.In conclusion, as physicians and surgeons of the present and future seek novel ways to alleviate or cure the current overwhelming problems confronting them (e.g., refractory end-stage heart failure, Alzheimer's disease), the story of mitral stenosis might well serve as a lesson of how long and arduous such efforts might turn out to be.
