34295407|a|The implementation of thickened fluids in patients with dysphagia is widely considered an effective strategy for safe and physiologically improved swallow. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that this intervention reduces the risk of dysphagia-related complications including aspiration pneumonia. In addition, there is growing evidence that this approach is associated with adverse clinical effects including dehydration, malnutrition and reduced health-related quality of life. This review summarises the rationale for thickened fluids, the evidence base (or lack thereof) underpinning their use, and current guideline recommendations. EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To review the evidence base for thickened fluids in the management of dysphagia.To examine the evidence that thickened fluids reduce aspiration pneumonia.To provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of thickened fluids in the management of dysphagia.
