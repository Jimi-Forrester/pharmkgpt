29223600|t|Trans epsilon-viniferin is an amyloid-beta disaggregating and anti-inflammatory drug in a mouse primary cellular model of Alzheimer's disease.
29223600|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by several cellular and molecular damage. Therefore, the therapeutic interest of multi-target molecules is increasingly justified. Polyphenols presenting multiple pharmacological effects would be more efficient. In this study, beneficial effects of trans epsilon-viniferin, a natural polyphenol were thus evaluated. This study reported that this stilbenoid (1) induced the disaggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and (2) rescued inflammation in murine primary neuronal cultures. These both effects are higher than those of resveratrol, and so, trans epsilon-viniferin could be a good therapeutic multi-target candidate.
