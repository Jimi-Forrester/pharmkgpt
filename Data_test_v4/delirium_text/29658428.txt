29658428|t|Caregivers' Perspectives of Quality of Life of People With Young- and Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease.
29658428|a|BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is a growing area of interest in dementia research. This study aims to investigate the caregivers' perspective about the QoL of people with young-onset Alzheimer disease (YOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). We also aim to investigate factors that might be associated to caregivers' perspective in YOAD and LOAD. METHODS: We included 110 people with Alzheimer disease (PwAD; 53 YOAD) and their primary caregivers. The PwAD completed assessments about their QoL and cognition. The caregivers provided information about the PwAD (demographics, QoL, ability to perform activities of daily living, mood, and dementia severity) and had burden of care assessed. RESULTS: We did not find a difference in caregivers' perspectives of PwAD QoL according to the age at onset. However, the linear regression analysis indicated that caregivers' burden ( P < .01) and PwAD depressive symptoms ( P < .05) were significantly related to the caregivers' perspective of YOAD QoL. Caregivers' burden ( P < .01), years of education ( P < .05), and self-reported QoL ( P < .01) were significantly related to the caregivers' perspective of LOAD QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The factors that drive the perceptions of caregivers of PwAD QoL may vary according to the age at onset. The study provides basic information on caregivers' perspectives of PwAD QoL to create more effective interventions according to the age at onset.
