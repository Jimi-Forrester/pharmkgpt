36213701|t|Central Pontine Myelinolysis: A Case Report.
36213701|a|Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) classically occurs due to rapid rise in serum osmolarity. Most cases have been associated with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, malnutrition, diuretic abuse, and hyponatremia. The pathological process of CPM starts in the central pons near median raphe and spreads out "like a brush Fire" into the surrounding basis pontis. Extrapontine sites such as internal capsule, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cerebrum can also be affected. We report a case of 60-year-old male with history of chronic alcoholism who presented to us with severe neurological deficits 10 days after his episode of severe hyponatremia.
