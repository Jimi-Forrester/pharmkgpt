26953013|t|Protracted delirium with Sheehan's syndrome.
26953013|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a common problem, but often misdiagnosed and unidentified. Apart from the manifold clinical picture variable durations can also be an obstacle for its diagnosis. METHODS: We present a case of protracted delirium that has developed after severe somatic illness in association with previously undiagnosed Sheehan's syndrome. RESULTS: The variety of psychiatric symptoms with initial psychotic disorder and the long run of the disease delayed the diagnosis of delirium and meantime gave reason to assume personality change. CONCLUSION: This case report calls attention to the possibility of protracted delirium in patients with neuropsychiatric deficit symptoms that persist subsequent to somatic illness.
