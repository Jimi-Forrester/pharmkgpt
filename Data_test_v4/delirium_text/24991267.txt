24991267|t|4-Hydroxy-6-alkyl-2-pyrones as nucleophilic coupling partners in Mitsunobu reactions and oxa-Michael additions.
24991267|a|Two mild and efficient strategies have been developed for the O-functionalisation of 4-hydroxy-6-alkyl-2-pyrones, by using them as nucleophilic partners in oxa-Michael additions and the Mitsunobu reaction. The reactions proceed in moderate to excellent yields on a range of substrates containing useful functionality. The reactions serve as practical and valuable synthetic methods to construct complex 2-pyronyl ethers, which are found embedded in a number of natural products.
