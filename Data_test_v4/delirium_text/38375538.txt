38375538|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of neuroimaging abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome regression disorder (DSRD) and evaluate if neuroimaging abnormalities were predictive of therapeutic responses. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, case-control study which reviewed neuroimaging studies of individuals with DSRD and compared them to a control cohort of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) alone was performed. Individuals aged 10-30 years and meeting international consensus criteria for DSRD were included. The presence of T1, T2/FLAIR, and SWI signal abnormalities was reviewed. Response rates to various therapies, including immunotherapy, were evaluated in the presence of neuroimaging abnormalities. RESULTS: In total, 74 individuals (35%) had either T2/FLAIR and/or SWI signal abnormality compared to 14 individuals (12%) without DSRD (p < 0.001, 95%CI: 2.18-7.63). T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities were not appreciated more frequently in individuals with DSRD (14%, 30/210) than in the control cohort (9%, 11/119) (p = 0.18, OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 0.79-3.40). SWI signal abnormalities were appreciated at a higher frequency in individuals with DSRD (24%, 51/210) compared to the control cohort (4%, 5/119) (p < 0.001, OR: 7.31, 95%CI: 2.83-18.90). T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities were localized to the frontal (40%, 12/30) and parietal lobes (37%, 11/30). SWI signal abnormalities were predominantly in the bilateral basal ganglia (94%, 49/52). Individuals with DSRD and the presence of T2/FLAIR and/or SWI signal abnormalities were much more likely to respond to immunotherapy (p < 0.001, OR: 8.42. 95%CI: 3.78-18.76) and less likely to respond to benzodiazepines (p = 0.01, OR: 0.45, 95%CI: 0.25-0.83), antipsychotics (p < 0.001, OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.11-0.55), or electroconvulsive therapy (p < 0.001, OR: 0.12; 95%CI: 0.02-0.78) compared to individuals without these neuroimaging abnormalities. INTERPRETATION: This study indicates that in individuals diagnosed with DSRD, T2/FLAIR, and SWI signal abnormalities are more common than previously thought and predict response to immunotherapy.
