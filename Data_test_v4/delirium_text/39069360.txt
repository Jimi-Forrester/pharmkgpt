39069360|t|Delirium and Coronavirus Disease 2019: Looking Back, Moving Forward.
39069360|a|During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, crisis changes in clinical care increased rates of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Deep sedation, unfamiliar environments with visitor restrictions, and such factors due to high workload and health system strain contributed to the occurrence of delirium doubling in the ICU. As the pandemic wanes, health care systems and ICU leadership must emphasize post-pandemic recovery, integrating lessons learned about delirium management, evidence-based care, and family involvement. Strategies to empower clinicians, creatively deliver care, and integrate families pave the way forward for a more holistic approach to patient care in the post-pandemic era.
