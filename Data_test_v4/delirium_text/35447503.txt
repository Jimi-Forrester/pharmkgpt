35447503|t|Psychiatric adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines: A rapid review of published case reports.
35447503|a|We aimed to review the available reports of psychiatric adverse reactions to COVID vaccines. Electronic databases such as PubMed and Google scholar were combed to identify relevant reports. We found a total of 11 reports describing 14 cases of psychiatric reactions; these were mostly altered mental states, psychosis, mania, depression, and functional neurological disorder. The index case was commonly a young or middle-aged adult. All reports pertained to the use of either mRNA or vector-based vaccines. Symptom onset was within 10 days of vaccination in all cases; as such, this seems to be a high-risk period warranting vigilance.
