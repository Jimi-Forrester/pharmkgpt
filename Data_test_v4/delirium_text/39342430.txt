39342430|t|PD-L1: From Cancer Immunotherapy to Therapeutic Implications in Multiple Disorders.
39342430|a|The PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway is the gold standard for cancer immunotherapy. Therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1, such as nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and PD-L1, including atezolizumab (Tecentriq), durvalumab (Imfinzi), and avelumab (Bavencio) have received FDA approval and are currently being used to treat various cancers. Traditionally, PD-L1 is known as an immune checkpoint protein that binds to the PD-1 receptor on its surface to inhibit the activity of T cells, which are the primary effector cells in antitumor immunity. However, it also plays a role in cancer progression, which goes beyond traditional understanding. Here, we highlight the multifaceted mechanisms of action of PD-L1 in cancer cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation, and systemic immune suppression. Moreover, we consider the potential role of PD-L1 in the development and pathogenesis of diseases other than cancer, explore PD-L1-focused therapeutic approaches for these diseases, and assess their clinical relevance. Through this review, we hope to provide deeper insights into the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway and present a broad perspective on potential therapeutic approaches for cancer and other diseases.
