37252033|a|INTRODUCTION: The vaping epidemic in the US has been largely attributed to the emergence of pod-based e-cigarette devices. While these devices continue to be promoted as alternatives to cigarettes, their impact on cardiovascular and behavioral outcomes remains incompletely understood. This study assessed the impact of pod-based e-cigarettes on peripheral and cerebral vascular function, along with subjective experiences among adult cigarette smokers. METHODS: In a crossover laboratory design study, a total of 19 (e-cigarette naive) cigarette smokers (aged 21-43 years) attended two lab sessions. In one session, participants smoked a cigarette and in the other, vaped a pod-based e-cigarette. Participants completed questions assessing subjective experiences. Peripheral macrovascular and microvascular function was assessed via brachial artery FMD and reactive hyperemia, while cerebral vascular function was assessed as the blood velocity response of the middle cerebral artery during hypercapnia. Measurements were taken before and after exposure. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, there was a reduction in peripheral macrovascular function (indexed by FMD), following e-cigarette (pre=9.3+-4.3%; post=6.4+-4.1%) and cigarette use (pre=10.2+-3.7%; post=6.8+-3.8%; main effect of time p<0.0001). Cerebral vascular function (indexed by cerebral vasodilatory response during hypercapnia) was also reduced following e-cigarette (pre=53+-19%; post=44+-15%) and cigarette use (pre=54+-21%; post=44+-17%; main effect of time p<0.01). The magnitude of reduction in peripheral and cerebral vascular function was similar between conditions (condition x time, p>0.05). Compared with vaping an e-cigarette, participants scored higher for measures of satisfaction, taste, puff liking, and suppression of craving following smoking (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to smoking, vaping a pod-based e-cigarette leads to an impairment in peripheral and cerebral vascular function while providing a reduced subjective experience compared with a cigarette among adult smokers. While these data challenge the notion that e-cigarette use is a safe and satisfactory alternative to cigarette use, large longitudinal studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of pod-based e-cigarette devices on cardiovascular and behavioral outcomes.
