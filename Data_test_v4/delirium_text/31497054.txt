31497054|a|INTRODUCTION: Before the operation each cardiosurgery geriatric patient is assessed by the Vulnerable Elders-13 Survey (VES-13) and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) scales. AIM: To compare the applicability of the VES-13 and EuroSCORE scale in the assessment of postoperative risk among operated patients > 60 years old qualified most often for coronary artery bypass grafting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: VES-13 is a questionnaire containing 13 questions, including patient's age and a health self-assessment. The EuroSCORE includes age, sex and cardiological assessment and vascular changes, respiratory diseases, neurological and nephrological disorders. In both scales the risk of death is high when the patient has > 6 points. The study included 100 patients >= 60 (60.83 +-6.18) years old who were divided into subgroups with < 6 points and >= 6 points. RESULTS: The number of VES-13 points = 3.06 +-2.25, EuroSCORE = 5.50 +-3.19. In patients > 75 years old VES score was 4.32 +-2.6 vs. 2.707 +-2.02 and EuroSCORE 8.09 +-3.02 vs. 4.77 +-2.83. The most frequent postoperative complication was atrial fibrillation. The most frequent complications were the following: death (5%), delirium (3.64%), bleeding (3.54%), stroke (3.54%), renal failure (3.32%), pacemaker implantation (3.28%), difficult healing of the wound (2.64%), intestinal ischemia (2.56%). The correlation between the VES-13 and EuroSCORE was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: In cardiosurgery patients who obtained before the operation >= 6 points on the VES-13 or EuroSCORE the risk of postoperative complications is high. VES-13 and EuroSCORE cannot be used interchangeably because the correlation is at a medium level.
