34125369|t|MRI imaging features of HIV-related central nervous system diseases: diagnosis by pattern recognition in daily practice.
34125369|a|With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the prognosis of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has improved, and the frequency of HIV-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases has decreased. Nevertheless, mortality from HIV-related CNS diseases, including those associated with ART (e.g., immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) remains significant. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can improve the outlook for people with HIV through early diagnosis and prompt treatment. For example, HIV encephalopathy shows a diffuse bilateral pattern, whereas progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, HIV-related primary CNS lymphoma, and CNS toxoplasmosis show focal patterns on MRI. Among the other diseases caused by opportunistic infections, CNS cryptococcosis and CNS tuberculosis have extremely poor prognoses unless diagnosed early. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome shows distinct MRI findings from the offending opportunistic infections. Although distinguishing between HIV-related CNS diseases based on imaging alone is difficult, in this review, we discuss how pattern recognition approaches can contribute to their early differentiation.
