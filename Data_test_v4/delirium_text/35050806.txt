35050806|t|Development and Internal Validation of the Postoperative Analgesic Intake Needs Score: A Predictive Model for Post-Operative Narcotic Requirement after Spine Surgery.
35050806|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a clinical tool to pre-operatively risk-stratify patients undergoing spine surgery based on their likelihood to have high postoperative analgesic requirements. METHODS: A total of 1199 consecutive patients undergoing elective spine surgery over a 2-year period at a single center were included. Patients not requiring inpatient admission, those who received epidural analgesia, those who had two surgeries at separate sites under one anesthesia event, and those with a length of stay greater than 10 days were excluded. The remaining 860 patients were divided into a derivation and validation cohort. Pre-operative factors were collected by review of the electronic medical record. Total postoperative inpatient opioid intake requirements were converted into morphine milligram equivalents to standardize postoperative analgesic requirements. RESULTS: The postoperative analgesic intake needs (PAIN) score was developed after the following predictor variables were identified: age, race, history of depression/anxiety, smoking status, active pre-operative benzodiazepine use and pre-operative opioid use, and surgical type. Patients were risk-stratified based on their score with the high-risk group being more likely to have high opioid consumption postoperatively compared to the moderate and low-risk groups in both the derivation and validation cohorts. CONCLUSION: The PAIN Score is a pre-operative clinical tool for patients undergoing spine surgery to risk stratify them based on their likelihood for high analgesic requirements. The information can be used to individualize a multi-modal analgesic regimen rather than utilizing a "one-size fits all" approach.
