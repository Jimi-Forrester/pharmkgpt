37139246|t|Effect of a Delirium Screening Tool on Antipsychotic Medication Use in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.
37139246|a|Objective: Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium has been associated with increased length of hospital stay, morbidity, mechanical ventilation, and health care resource utilization. Antipsychotics are frequently used for ICU delirium management, despite a lack of robust evidence in the literature to support their benefit. Delirium screening may result in pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic treatment. Methods: In January 2019 we began screening patients admitted to the pediatric ICU (PICU) for delirium using the Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD). We compared prescribing rates of antipsychotic medications before and after implementation. We also assessed length of hospital and ICU stay prior to initiating therapy, delirium score prior to initiation of therapy, time after initiation of therapy until score decreased to a level not suggestive of delirium, and continuation of antipsychotics outside of the PICU. Results: We did not observe a difference in the rate of antipsychotics use. There was, however, an increase in variability between pre- and post-intervention rates of prescribing. Patients who received an antipsychotic medication were hospitalized for an average of 18 days and in the ICU for 14 days prior to the first dose of an antipsychotic agent. They had an average CAPD score of 16, and had an average of 4 scores above 8 prior to starting treatment. Conclusion: This study highlights the need for additional research to demonstrate the role of antipsychotic medications in managing delirium in the PICU.
