29927411|a|AIM: To estimate the association of rs11218343 in the sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene with cognitive performance in the elderly and with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Russian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample included 586 elderly people (mean age 70.9+-5.7 years) without AD diagnosis and 100 patients with late-onset AD (mean age 72.1+-7.8 years) from the Tomsk population. SORL1 rs11218343 was genotyped using PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Cognitive performance in the sample of elderly without AD was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. RESULTS: Allele frequencies of the SORL1 polymorphism were not significantly different between the elderly without AD and AD patients. However mean MoCA score in the carriers of the rare allele (19.00+-6.61) was significantly lower than in homozygotes for the common variant (22.25+-3.89) (F=4.97; p=0.026). CONCLUSION: The rare variant in SORL1 gene previously associated with AD in genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses was associated with lower total MoSA scores in the random sample of elderly people that suggests declined cognitive functions in the carriers of this variant in elderly.
