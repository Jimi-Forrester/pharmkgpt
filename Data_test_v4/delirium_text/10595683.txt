10595683|a|Several alleles of introns or untranslated regions in the presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2) genes have been reported to behave as risk factors for senile Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, mutations in the three presenile AD genes also have been identified in a small number of sporadic presenile AD and senile AD cases. The present study evaluated the genetic contributions of PS-2 exons and introns to 56 senile and 18 Japanese cases of presenile AD using polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. In the PS-2 gene, one exonic polymorphic site without amino acid substitution, 9 intronic polymorphic sites, and 2 intronic variant sites were detected. However, in all cases, amino acid substitutions in exons between 4 and 12 of the PS-2 gene were not observed. The risk factors of senile and presenile AD were evaluated using a population-based study of restriction cleavages between patients and controls in introns 3, 4, 10 and 11. Regarding PS-2, there was no association between AD and intronic polymorphisms.
