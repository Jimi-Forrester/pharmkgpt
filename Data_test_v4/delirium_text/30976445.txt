30976445|t|Delayed retroperitoneal hemorrhage during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a case report.
30976445|a|CASE: There are several reports of retroperitoneal hemorrhage induced by percutaneous femoral cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, there are no reports of delayed retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which develops a few days after ECMO initiation and is unrelated to the ECMO cannulation. Herein, we report a rare case of delayed retroperitoneal hemorrhage during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). OUTCOME: A 54-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We initiated VV-ECMO. The patient had severe delirium and was confined to a long-term supine position to maintain circuit safety. On day 13, computed tomography unexpectedly revealed a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage spreading around the psoas muscle. CONCLUSION: Delayed retroperitoneal hemorrhage can develop during VV-ECMO management a few days after its initiation. Anticoagulant use and forceful muscular strain could be risk factors of delayed retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
