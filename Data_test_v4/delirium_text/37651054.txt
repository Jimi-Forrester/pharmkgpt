37651054|t|Application of P7C3 Compounds to Investigating and Treating Acute and Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury.
37651054|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading worldwide cause of disability, and there are currently no medicines that prevent, reduce, or reverse acute or chronic neurodegeneration in TBI patients. Here, we review the target-agnostic discovery of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/NADH-stabilizing P7C3 compounds through a phenotypic screen in mice and describe how P7C3 compounds have been applied to advance understanding of the pathophysiology and potential treatment of TBI. We summarize how P7C3 compounds have been shown across multiple laboratories to mitigate disease progression safely and effectively in a broad range of preclinical models of disease related to impaired NAD+/NADH metabolism, including acute and chronic TBI, and note the reported safety and neuroprotective efficacy of P7C3 compounds in nonhuman primates. We also describe how P7C3 compounds facilitated the recent first demonstration that chronic neurodegeneration 1 year after TBI in mice, the equivalent of many decades in people, can be reversed to restore normal neuropsychiatric function. We additionally review how P7C3 compounds have facilitated discovery of new pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurodegeneration after TBI. This includes the role of rapid TBI-induced tau acetylation that drives axonal degeneration, and the discovery of brain-derived acetylated tau as the first blood-based biomarker of neurodegeneration after TBI that directly correlates with the abundance of a therapeutic target in the brain. We additionally review the identification of TBI-induced tau acetylation as a potential mechanistic link between TBI and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, we summarize historical accounts of other successful phenotypic-based drug discoveries that advanced medical care without prior recognition of the specific molecular target needed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.
