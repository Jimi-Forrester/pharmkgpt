38179593|a|BACKGROUND: North Korean defectors (NKDs) have often been exposed to traumatic events. However, there have been few studies of neural alterations in NKDs with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (cPTSD). AIMS: To investigate neural alterations in NKDs with PTSD and cPTSD, with a specific focus on alterations in resting-state functional connectivity networks, including the default mode network (DMN). METHOD: Resting-state functional connectivity was assessed using brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in three groups of NKDs: without PTSD, with PTSD and with cPTSD. Statistical tests were performed, including region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel analysis, followed by post hoc correlation analysis. RESULTS: In the ROI-to-ROI analysis, differences in functional connectivity were found among the components of the DMN, as well as in the thalamus and the basal ganglia. Right hippocampus-left pallidum and right amygdala-left lingual gyrus connectivity differed between groups in the ROI-to-voxel analysis, as did connectivity involving the basal ganglia. The post hoc analysis revealed negative correlations between Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale (CAPS) score and left posterior cingulate cortex-right pallidum connectivity and between CAPS score and right putamen-left angular gyrus connectivity in the control group, which were not observed in other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that there are alterations in the functional connectivity of the DMN and the limbic system in NKDs with PTSD and cPTSD, and that these alterations involve the basal ganglia. The lower correlations of CAPS score with right basal ganglia-DMN functional connectivity in patients compared with controls further implies that these connectivities are potential targets for treatment of PTSD and cPTSD.
