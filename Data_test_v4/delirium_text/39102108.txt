39102108|a|In recent years, significant advancements have been made in understanding Alzheimer's disease from both neurobiological and clinical perspectives. Exploring the complex systems underlying AD has unveiled insights that could potentially revolutionize therapeutic approaches. Recent investigations have highlighted intricate interactions among genetic, molecular, and environmental factors in AD. Optimism arises from neurobiological advancements and diverse treatment options, potentially slowing or halting disease progression. Amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles crucially influence AD onset and progression. Emerging treatments involve diverse strategies, such as approaches targeting multiple pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction pathways. Clinical trials using humanized monoclonal antibodies, focusing on immunotherapies eliminating amyloid-beta, have shown promise. Nonpharmacological interventions such as light therapy, electrical stimulation, cognitive training, physical activity, and dietary changes have drawn attention for their potential to slow cognitive aging and enhance brain health. Precision medicine, which involves tailoring therapies to individual genetic and molecular profiles, has gained traction. Ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration are expected to yield more effective treatments.
