31387520|a|BACKGROUND: Several human cancers, especially cervical cancer are caused by the infection of high risk strains of human papillomaviruses (HPV), notably HPV16. It is implicated that the oncoprotein E6 expressed from HPV, is inhibiting the apoptotic pathway by binding to adaptor molecule FADD (Fas-associated death domain). Inhibiting E6 interactions with FADD could provide a promising treatment for cervical cancer. There are few small molecules reported to inhibit such interactions. However, the FADD binding site information on the HPV E6 is not currently available. This binding site information may provide an opportunity to design new small molecule inhibitors to treat E6 mediated cancers. In this study we report the possible binding pocket on HPV16 E6 oncoprotein by using activity data of reported inhibitors through a stepwise molecular modeling approach. RESULTS: Blind docking and removing duplicates followed by visual inspection to determine ligand-receptor interactions provided 68 possible binding sites on the E6 protein. Individual docking of all known inhibitors lead to the identification of 28 pockets having some kind of correlation with their activity data. It was also observed that several of these pockets overlapped with each other, having some amino acids in common. Amino acids Leu50 and Cys51 were identified as key E6 residues for high affinity ligand binding which are seen in most of these pockets. In most cases, ligands demonstrated a hydrogen bond interaction with Cys51. Ala61, Arg131 and Gln107 were also frequently observed showing interactions among these pockets. A few amino acids unique to each ligand were also identified representing additional interactions at the receptor site. CONCLUSIONS: After determining receptor-ligand interactions between E6 oncoprotein and the six known inhibitors, the amino acids Cys51, Leu50, Arg102, Arg131, Leu67, Val62, and Gln107 were identified to have importance in E6 inhibition. It was generally observed that Leu50 and Cys51 are necessary for high binding affinity with Cys51 being essential for hydrogen bonding. This study identified a potential binding pocket for the E6 inhibitors. Identification of the ligand binding pocket helps to design novel inhibitors of HPV16 E6 oncoprotein as a promising treatment for cervical cancer.
