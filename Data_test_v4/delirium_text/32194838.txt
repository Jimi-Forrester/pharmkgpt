32194838|a|Rationale: Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress occur in vascular dementia (VaD), but the specific molecular mechanism regulating these events remains unclear. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a master regulator for mitochondrial function. This study aims to investigate whether PGC-1alpha is involved in the pathophysiology of VaD. Methods: We firstly generated PGC-1alphaf/f Eno2-Cre mice to induce neuron-specific overexpression of PGC-1alpha by crossbreeding PGC-1alphaf/f mice with Eno2-cre mice. Then, the mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Neurological function and hippocampal PGC-1alpha expression was evaluated. Next, RNA-Seq analysis and Seahorse assay were performed on the hippocampal neurons. In addition, mitochondrial antioxidants, uncoupling proteins, ROS production and the activation of glial cells were also measured. Results: Our results showed that hippocampal PGC-1alpha expression is down-regulated in the mouse VaD model induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. In contrast, neuronal PGC-1alpha overexpression significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that PGC-1alpha improved energy metabolism of neurons under hypoxic condition, and Seahorse assay confirmed that PGC-1alpha increases the metabolic activity of neurons. Further study demonstrated that PGC-1alpha boosted the expressions of mitochondrial antioxidants and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), including SOD2, Prx3, GPx1, UCP2, UCP4 and UCP5, which in turn reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, the activation of microglia and astrocytes was also found to decrease in the hippocampus. All of these changes greatly contributed to protect hippocampal neurons against ischemic insults. Conclusions: PGC-1alpha could suppress the excessive ROS and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, opening up a potential therapeutic target for cognitive impairment.
