34336434|t|Preoperative Evaluation of Parkinson's Disease.
34336434|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disease of older adults. It presents a unique set of anesthetic challenges. With increasing life expectancy and the rapid growth of oldest-old patients, it is now more likely for anesthesiologists to encounter older patients with PD. Due to polypharmacy in the older adults with PD a potential for drug interactions during and after surgery needs to be considered. More data from prospective, multicenter trials about short- and long-term outcomes of anesthesia in PD patients are needed.
