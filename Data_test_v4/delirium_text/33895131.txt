33895131|t|Tau/Abeta chimera peptides: A Thioflavin-T and MALDI-TOF study of Abeta amyloidosis in the presence of Cu(II) or Zn(II) ions and total lipid brain extract (TLBE) vesicles.
33895131|a|Currently, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition, with limited therapeutic options. Several factors, like Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, bio-metals dyshomeostasis and oxidative stress contribute to AD pathogenesis. These pathogenic processes might occur in the aqueous phase but also on neuronal membranes. Thus, investigating the connection between Abeta and biomembranes, becomes important for unveiling the molecular mechanism underlying Abeta amyloidosis as a critical event in AD pathology. In this work, the interaction of two peptides, made up with hybrid sequences from Tau protein 9-16 (EVMEDHAG) or 26-33 (QGGYTMHQ) N-terminal domain and Abeta16-20 (KLVFF) hydrophobic region, with full length Abeta40 or Abeta42 peptides is reported. The studied "chimera" peptides Ac-EVMEDHAGKLVFF-NH2 (tau9-16-KL) and Ac-QGGYTMHQKLVFF-NH2 (tau26-33-KL) are endowed with Abeta recognition and metal ion interaction capabilities provided by the tau or Abeta sequences, respectively. These peptides were characterized in previous study along with their metal dependent interaction and amyloidogenesis, either in the presence or absence of metal ion and artificial membranes made up with Total Lipid Brain Extract (TLBE) components, (Sciacca et al., 2020). In the present paper, the ability of the two peptides to inhibit Abeta aggregation is studied using composite experimental conditions including aqueous solution, the presence of metal ions (Cu or Zn), the presence of lipid vesicles mimicking neuronal membranes as well as the co-presence of metals and TLBE artificial membranes. We used Thioflavine-T (ThT) fluorescence or MALDI-TOF spectrometry analysis of Abeta limited proteolysis to respectively monitor the Abeta aggregation kinetic or validation of the Abeta interacting regions. We demonstrate that tau9-16-KL and tau26-33-KL peptides differently affect Abeta aggregation kinetics, with the tau sequence playing a crucial role. The results are discussed in terms of chimera's peptides hydrophobicity and electrostatic driven interactions at the aqueous/membrane interface.
