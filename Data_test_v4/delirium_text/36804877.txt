36804877|a|The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), plays a critical role in cognition. Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting protein-1 (LINGO-1) negatively affects nerve growth in the central nervous system; however, its role in the pathological damage to the mPFC remains to be studied in AD. In this study, an anti-LINGO-1 antibody was administered to 10-month-old APP/PS1 mice, and behavioral tests, stereological methods, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to answer this question. Our results revealed that LINGO-1 was highly expressed in the neurons of the mPFC of AD mice, and the anti-LINGO-1 antibody improved prefrontal cortex-related function and reduced the protein level of LINGO-1, atrophy of the volume, Abeta deposition and massive losses of synapses and neurons in the mPFC of AD mice. Antagonizing LINGO-1 could effectively alleviate the pathological damage in the mPFC of AD mice, which might be an important structural basis for improving prefrontal cortex-related function. Abnormal expression of LINGO-1 in the mPFC may be one of the key targets of AD, and the effect initiated by the anti-LINGO-1 antibody may provide an important basis in the search for drugs for the prevention and treatment of AD.
