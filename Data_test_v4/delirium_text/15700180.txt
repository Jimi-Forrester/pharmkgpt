15700180|t|Reduced phospholipid breakdown in Alzheimer's brains: a 31P spectroscopy study.
15700180|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of membrane phospholipid metabolism have been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated, with the aid of (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the in vivo intracerebral availability of phosphomonoesters (PME) and phosphodiesters (PDE) in patients with AD. METHODS: Eighteen outpatients with mild or moderate probable AD and 16 nondemented elderly volunteers were assessed with the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly (CAMDEX) and its cognitive subscale of the CAMDEX schedule (CAMCOG). Scans were performed on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imager addressing a 40-cm(3) voxel in the left prefrontal cortex. Main outcome measures were mean relative peak areas of PME and PDE, which provide an estimate of membrane phospholipid metabolism. RESULTS: PME resonance and the PME/PDE ratio were increased in AD patients as compared to controls (p<0.05). PME was negatively correlated with global cognitive performance as shown by the Mini-Mental State Examination (r(s)=-0.36, p=0.05) and CAMCOG scores (r(s)=-0.49, p=0.007), as well as with discrete neuropsychological functions, namely, memory (r(s)=-0.53, p=0.004), visual perception (r(s)=-0.54, p=0.003), orientation (r(s)=-0.36, p=0.05), and abstract thinking (r(s)=-0.48, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of reduced membrane phospholipid breakdown in the prefrontal cortex of mild and moderately demented AD patients. These abnormalities correlate with neuropsychological deficits that are characteristic of AD.
