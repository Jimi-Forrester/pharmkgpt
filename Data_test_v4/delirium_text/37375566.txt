37375566|t|Sarcopenic Dysphagia Revisited: A Cross-Sectional Study in Hospitalized Geriatric Patients.
37375566|a|Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a frequent finding in older patients with potentially lethal complications such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration. Recent studies describe sarcopenia as a causative factor for OD, which is occasionally referred to as "sarcopenic dysphagia" in the absence of a neurogenic etiology. In most of the previous studies on sarcopenic dysphagia, the diagnosis was based only on clinical assessment. In this study, flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was used as an objective method to evaluate the presence of OD, its association with sarcopenia, and the presence of pure sarcopenic dysphagia. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 109 acute care geriatric hospital patients with suspected OD received FEES examination and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in clinical routine. 95% of patients had at least one neurological disease, 70% fulfilled the criteria for sarcopenia, and 45% displayed moderate or severe OD. Although the prevalence of sarcopenia and OD was high, there was no significant association between OD and sarcopenia. Considering these results, both the association between sarcopenia and OD and pure sarcopenic dysphagia appear questionable. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate if sarcopenia is merely an epiphenomenon of severe disease or whether it plays a causative role in the development of OD.
