33984602|a|Emerging evidence suggests that the reduction of ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn) is associated with in Alzheimer's disease and metabolic diseases. However, the mechanistic bases for PlsEtn on the these diseases are not well understood. Plasmalogens are primarily synthesized in the liver and enriched in brain. To this end, the present study sought to investigate the potential role of PlsEtn on steatohepatitis and memory impairments and its underlying mechanism. Here we show that peroxisome dysfunction and impairment of PlsEtn synthesis pathway occurs in both of hippocampus and liver, resulting in the decrease of PlsEtn level in APP/PS1 mice and HFD-fed mice. shGNPAT induced PlsEtn deficiency in hepatocytes induces p75NTR enhancement leading to decreased lipolysis activity, thereby exacerbating steatosis. Moreover, in the brain, PlsEtn administration appears to not only improve steatosis but also prevent Alzheimer's disease through restoration of TrkA/p75NTR balance. Together, our findings reveal a molecular mechanistic insight into the preventive role of plasmalogen modulation against steatosis and memory impairments via p75NTR inhibition.
