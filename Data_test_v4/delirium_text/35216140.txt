35216140|t|New Function of Cholesterol Oxidation Products Involved in Osteoporosis Pathogenesis.
35216140|a|Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic bone disease characterized by decreased bone strength, microarchitectural changes in bone tissues, and increased risk of fracture. Its occurrence is closely related to various factors such as aging, genetic factors, living habits, and nutritional deficiencies as well as the disturbance of bone homeostasis. The dysregulation of bone metabolism is regarded as one of the key influencing factors causing OP. Cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) are important compounds in the maintenance of bone metabolic homeostasis by participating in several important biological processes such as the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, bone formation in osteoblasts, and bone resorption in osteoclasts. The effects of specific COPs on mesenchymal stem cells are mainly manifested by promoting osteoblast genesis and inhibiting adipocyte genesis. This review aims to elucidate the biological roles of COPs in OP development, starting from the molecular mechanisms of OP, pointing out opportunities and challenges in current research, and providing new ideas and perspectives for further studies of OP pathogenesis.
