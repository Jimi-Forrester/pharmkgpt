31521199|t|CSF evidence of pericyte damage in Alzheimer's disease is associated with markers of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and disease pathology.
31521199|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the relationship between levels of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker of pericyte damage, soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (sPDGFRbeta) and CSF markers of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity (CSF albumin and CSF/serum albumin ratio) and disease pathology (reduced CSF Abeta42 and elevated CSF total and phosphorylated tau) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: sPDGFRbeta and albumin were measured by sandwich ELISA in ante-mortem CSF from 39 AD and 39 age-matched controls that were grouped according to their biomarker profile (i.e. AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and Abeta42 < 550 pg/mL). sPDGFRbeta was also measured in matched serum and CSF samples (n = 23) in a separate neurologically normal group for which the CSF/serum albumin ratio had been determined. RESULTS: CSF sPDGFRbeta level was significantly increased in AD (p = 0.0038) and correlated positively with albumin (r = 0.45, p = 0.007), total tau (r = 0.50, p = 0.0017) and phosphorylated tau (r = 0.41, p = 0.013) in AD but not in controls. CSF sPDGFRbeta did not correlate with Abeta42. Serum and CSF sPDGFRbeta were positively correlated (r = 0.547, p = 0.0085) in the independent neurologically normal CSF/serum matched samples. CONCLUSIONS: We provide further evidence of an association between pericyte injury and BBB breakdown in AD and novel evidence that a CSF marker of pericyte injury is related to the severity of AD pathology.
