39011450|a|The aim of this study is designed an improved ResNet 50 network to achieve automatic classification model for pain expressions by elderly patients with hip fractures. This study built a dataset by combining the advantages of deep learning in image recognition, using a hybrid of the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN). Based on ResNet50 network framework utilized transfer learning to implement model function. This study performed the hyperparameters by Bayesian optimization in the learning process. This study calculated intraclass correlation between visual analog scale scores provided by clinicians independently and those provided by pain expression evaluation assistant(PEEA). The automatic pain expression recognition model in elderly patients with hip fractures, which constructed using the algorithm. The accuracy achieved 99.6% on the training set, 98.7% on the validation set, and 98.2% on the test set. The substantial kappa coefficient of 0.683 confirmed the efficacy of PEEA in clinic. This study demonstrates that the improved ResNet50 network can be used to construct an automatic pain expression recognition model for elderly patients with hip fractures, which has higher accuracy.
