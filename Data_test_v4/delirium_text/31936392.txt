31936392|a|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common pediatric psychiatric disorder, frequently treated with methylphenidate (MPH). Recently, MPH's cardiovascular safety has been questioned by observational studies describing an increased cardiovascular risk in adults and blood pressure alterations in children. We considered members of the L-arginine (Arg)/nitric oxide (NO) pathway as possible early cardiovascular risk factors in pediatric ADHD children. They include the NO metabolites, nitrite and nitrate, the NO precursor Arg, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor and a cardiovascular risk factor in adults. We conducted a prospective clinical trial with 42 ADHD children (aged 6-16 years) with (n = 19) and without (n = 23) MPH treatment. Age-matched children without ADHD (n = 43) served as controls. All plasma and urine metabolites were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We observed higher plasma nitrite and lower plasma ADMA concentrations in the ADHD children. MPH-treated ADHD children had higher plasma nitrite concentrations than MPH-untreated ADHD children. As NOS activity is basally inhibited by ADMA, MPH treatment seems to have decreased the inhibitory potency of ADMA. Percentiles of systolic blood pressure were higher in MPH-treated ADHD children. The underlying mechanisms and their implications in the MPH therapy of pediatric ADHD with MPH remain to be elucidated in larger cohorts.
