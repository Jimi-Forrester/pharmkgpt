15853497|t|Acetylcholinergic neurotransmission and the beta-amyloid cascade: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
15853497|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by both decreases in acetylcholinergic neurotransmission and increases in beta-amyloid accumulation. Currently, available clinical psychopharmacologic treatment is focused on increasing acetylcholinergic neurotransmission, whereas no clinical treatments to directly reduce beta-amyloid accumulation are available. Cholinesterase inhibitors improve cognition, certain neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional impairment in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, and it is believed that this is mainly symptomatic treatment. However, this review discusses various levels of interaction between acetylcholinergic neurotransmission and the beta-amyloid cascade, which suggest that some specific acetylcholinergic treatments may reduce beta-amyloid accumulation, and therefore may slow disease progression over the long term. Various suggestions are made on how such potential disease-modifying effects could be studied in the future.
