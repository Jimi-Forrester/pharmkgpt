39065815|t|Medicinal Plant Extracts against Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Associated with Obesity: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets.
39065815|a|Obesity has increasingly become a worldwide epidemic, as demonstrated by epidemiological and clinical studies. Obesity may lead to the development of a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. In addition to hypertension, there are other cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs) such as visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, elevated levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein, and others, all of which increase the risk of CVD events. The mechanisms involved between obesity and CVD mainly include insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and adipokine dysregulation, which cause maladaptive structural and functional alterations of the heart, particularly left-ventricular remodeling and diastolic dysfunction. Natural products of plants provide a diversity of nutrients and different bioactive compounds, including phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, carotenoids, anthocyanins, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and others, which possess a wide range of biological activities including antihypertensive, antilipidemic, antidiabetic, and other activities, thus conferring cardiometabolic benefits. In this review, we discuss the main therapeutic interventions using extracts from herbs and plants in preclinical and clinical trials with protective properties targeting CRFs. Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of herb and plant extracts for the prevention and treatment of CRFs are also reviewed.
