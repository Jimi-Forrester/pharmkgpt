16720802|t|Topiramate effect in catatonia: a case series.
16720802|a|The authors describe four cases of catatonia in which topiramate treatment was used. Commonly effective therapies, including benzodiazepines and divalproex, were proven refractory. In all four cases, subjects experienced complete remission of catatonic symptoms and tolerated treatment well. In one case, all psychotropic medications were discontinued because the patient became delirious. The delirium resolved after discovery and treatment of a urinary tract infection. Catatonic agitation relapsed when topiramate was withdrawn but remitted again when topiramate and lorazepam therapy was restored. In two cases, continued topiramate therapy was accompanied by sustained remission. These case reports present a novel approach to the treatment of catatonia.
