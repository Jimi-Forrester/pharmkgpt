31876283|t|[Effects of the H6R and D7H Mutations on the Heparin-Dependent Modulation of Zinc-Induced Aggregation of Amyloid beta].
31876283|a|Zinc ions and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are found in amyloid deposits and are known to modulate the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation, which is thought to be a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correlation spectroscopy was used to study how the H6R and D7H mutations of the metal-binding domain (MBD) of Abeta42 affect the modulation of its zinc-induced aggregation by the model GAG heparin. The H6R mutation was shown to decrease and the D7H mutation to increase the Abeta42 propensity to aggregate in the presence of zinc ions. In addition, H6R diminished and D7H enhanced the modulating effect of heparin. The difference in the heparin-dependent modulation was associated with coordination of zinc ions within the MBDs of the mutant peptides. The findings indicate that anion-binding sites formed by complexes of zinc ions with the Abeta MBD play an essential role in the interaction of zinc-induced Abeta aggregates with heparin.
