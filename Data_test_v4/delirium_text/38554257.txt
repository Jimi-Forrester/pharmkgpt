38554257|t|The Association between Postural Sway and Preclinical Alzheimer Disease among Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
38554257|a|BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether older adults with preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) experience changes in postural sway compared to those without preclinical AD. The purpose of this study was to understand the effect of dual tasking on standing balance, or postural sway, for people with and without preclinical AD. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a longitudinal cohort study. Participants were cognitively normal older adults with and without preclinical AD. Postural sway (path length) was tested using a force plate under standard and dual task balance conditions. Dual task cost (DTC) was calculated to examine performance change in balance conditions. Logistic regression models were used to predict preclinical AD status as a function of DTC. RESULTS: 203 participants (65 preclinical AD+) were included. DTC for path length was significantly greater for participants with preclinical AD (DTC path length mean difference 19.8, 95% CI 2.6 to 37.0, t(201)=2.29, p=0.024). Greater DTC was significantly associated with increased odds of having preclinical AD (adjusted odds ratio for a 20-unit increase in DTC 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.32). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with preclinical AD are more likely to demonstrate significantly greater DTC in postural sway than those without preclinical AD. Dual tasking should be integrated into balance and fall risk assessments and may inform early detection of preclinical AD.
