31640096|t|A Curcumin Analog Reduces Levels of the Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Amyloid-beta Protein by Modulating AbetaPP Processing and Autophagy.
31640096|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no cure currently available. A pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), a ~4 kDa peptide generated through serial cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Curcumin is a natural compound primarily found in the widely used culinary spice, turmeric, which displays therapeutic potential for AD. Recently, we reported the development of curcumin analogs and identified a lead compound, curcumin-like compound-R17 (CLC-R17), that significantly attenuates Abeta deposition in an AD transgenic mouse model. Here, we elucidated the mechanisms of this analog on Abeta levels and AbetaPP processing using cell models of AD. Using biochemical methods and our recently developed nanoplasmonic fiber tip probe technology, we showed that the lead compound potently lowers Abeta levels in conditioned media and reduces oligomeric amyloid levels in the cells. Furthermore, like curcumin, the lead compound attenuates the maturation of AbetaPP in the secretory pathway. Interestingly, it upregulated alpha-secretase processing of AbetaPP and inhibited beta-secretase processing of AbetaPP by decreasing BACE1 protein levels. Collectively, our data reveal mechanisms of a promising curcumin analog in reducing Abeta levels, which strongly support its development as a potential therapeutic for AD.
