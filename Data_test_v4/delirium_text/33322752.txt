33322752|t|Styrylpyrazoles: Properties, Synthesis and Transformations.
33322752|a|The pyrazole nucleus and its reduced forms, pyrazolines and pyrazolidine, are privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry due to their remarkable biological activities. A huge number of pyrazole derivatives have been studied and reported over time. This review article gives an overview of pyrazole derivatives that contain a styryl (2-arylvinyl) group linked in different positions of the pyrazole backbone. Although there are studies on the synthesis of styrylpyrazoles dating back to the 1970s and even earlier, this type of compound has rarely been studied. This timely review intends to summarize the properties, biological activity, methods of synthesis and transformation of styrylpyrazoles; thus, highlighting the interest and huge potential for application of this kind of compound.
