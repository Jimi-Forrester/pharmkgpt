29403140|t|Early Marked Behavioral Symptoms in Bilateral Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke: A Disguised Presentation.
29403140|a|Clinical signs and symptoms of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke are varied and can be challenging to diagnose at early stage. A case of bilateral PCA infarct presenting with marked behavioral symptoms and minimal neurological symptoms is presented here. A 34 years old female had presented with marked behavioral symptoms, blurring of vision and tingling sensation in left half of body. Though the latter complaints resolved following day, her behavioral complaints persisted. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain revealed acute non-hemorrhagic infarct in bilateral PCA territory. Psychotropics were beneficial for her behavioral symptoms. Isolated behavioral symptoms in PCA stroke led to speculate anatomical substrate for those symptoms. We discussed possible anatomical substrates for behavioral symptoms. Our case adds to the existing literature on a range of disguising presentations in PCA stroke and also emphasizes those distinctions between 'neurological' or 'psychological' or 'psychiatric' disorders are often sketchy.
