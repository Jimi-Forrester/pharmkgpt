21289976|a|The abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and its subsequent intra- and extracellular accumulation constitute the disease-causing cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The detection of Abeta aggregates and senile plaque formation, however, is nearly impossible during early pathogenesis, and the absence of a convenient screen to validate the activity of Abeta aggregation regulators impedes the development of promising drug targets and diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we conjugated amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) peptide to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to visualize Abeta42 aggregation via Abeta42 aggregation-induced AuNP precipitation. AuNP-Abeta42 precipitate was quantified by optical density measurements of supernatants and thioflavin T binding assay. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis also showed reduced interparticle distance of AuNPs and confirmed the Abeta42 aggregation-induced AuNP precipitation. Transthyretin, a widely known Abeta aggregation inhibitor, limited AuNP-Abeta42 precipitation by preventing Abeta42 aggregation. Finally, according to TEM analysis, Abeta42-conjugated AuNPs treated with blood-driven serum revealed the differentiated aggregation patterns between normal and AD. These findings may open a scientific breakthrough in finding a possible diagnostic and prognostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases involving abnormal protein aggregation as their key pathogenesis processes.
