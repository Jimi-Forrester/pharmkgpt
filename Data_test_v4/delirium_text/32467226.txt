32467226|a|The accumulation of amyloid Tau aggregates is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Molecular chaperones are known to maintain protein homeostasis. Here, we show that an ATP-dependent human chaperone system disassembles Tau fibrils in vitro We found that this function is mediated by the core chaperone HSC70, assisted by specific cochaperones, in particular class B J-domain proteins and a heat shock protein 110 (Hsp110)-type nucleotide exchange factor (NEF). The Hsp70 disaggregation machinery processed recombinant fibrils assembled from all six Tau isoforms as well as Sarkosyl-resistant Tau aggregates extracted from cell cultures and human AD brain tissues, demonstrating the ability of the Hsp70 machinery to recognize a broad range of Tau aggregates. However, the chaperone activity released monomeric and small oligomeric Tau species, which induced the aggregation of self-propagating Tau conformers in a Tau cell culture model. We conclude that the activity of the Hsp70 disaggregation machinery is a double-edged sword, as it eliminates Tau amyloids at the cost of generating new seeds.
