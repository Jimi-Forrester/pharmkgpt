32706577|t|Metallic Woodpile Nanostructures for Femtomolar Sensing of Alzheimer's Neurofilament Lights.
32706577|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, accompanies a massive degradation of neurons including axonal injury. Being an axonal neuron-specific protein, neurofilament light (NfL) is a blood biomarker that reflects the neurodegeneration in AD, but no attempt has been made yet to develop sensing platforms that target NfLs in blood serum or plasma. Here, we report three-dimensional cross-stacked Pt nanowire arrays for the ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection of NfLs. We constructed a woodpile-like Pt nanowire array (PtWP)-based biocathode by printing multilayer Pt nanowire arrays in an orthogonal configuration and conjugating them with NfL-specific DA2 antibodies. According to our collective electrochemical analyses, the five-layered PtWP electrode modified with DA2 antibodies exhibited high oxygen reduction activities due to the large electrochemical active surface area and the effective electron transfer properties. We have combined the DA2-PtWP biocathode with a water-oxidizing, iron oxyhydroxide-deposited bismuth vanadate (FeOOH/BiVO4) photoanode to assemble a bias-free PEC detection system. Powered by a white-light-emitting diode, the unbiased PEC platform accurately recognizes NfLs in blood plasma with the limit-of-detection of 38.2 fg/mL and limit-of-quantification of 853 fg/mL, which is 40 times lower than the NfL levels in AD patients' blood.
