35441485|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of early intervention for perioperative delirium in older (> 60 years) hip fracture patients. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled hip fracture patients aged >=60 years who were admitted into our hospital between July 2011 and August 2019. Hip fractures were classified according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteo-synthesefragen (AO) classification. This study included patients with isolated hip fracture and excluded patients with pathological or peri prosthetic fracture or patients with multiple traumatic injuries and high-energy trauma. They were randomized to receive conventional orthopedic care group (n = 65) or comprehensive orthopedic care group including preoperative psychological counseling and preventative risperidone (n = 63). Daily assessment was based on patient interview with the CAM-CR, and delirium was diagnosed by the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98). The rate, severity and duration of perioperative delirium and the length of postoperative stay were analyzed. RESULTS: Totally 200 patients were screened for eligibility. Twenty patients were excluded due to alcohol abuse and 40 were excluded because of brain lesions on head CT. In addition, 12 patients were excluded because of impaired cognition. Finally 128 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 75.3 +- 2.2 years for the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 73.5 +- 6.1 years for the conventional orthopedic care group, and 53.9% of the patients were female. Sixty-eight (53.1%) patients had intertrochanteric fracture, 39.8% patients had femoral head fracture, and 7.0% patients had subtrochanteric fracture. In addition, 58.6% patients underwent internal fixation and 41.4% patients received arthroplasty. In this study, 63 patients were randomized to the comprehensive orthopedic care group and 65 patients to the conventional orthopedic care group. The two groups were comparable in demographic and baseline characteristics (P > 0.05). The rate of perioperative delirium was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group vs the conventional care group (15.9% vs. 30.8%; P < 0.05). The comprehensive care group had significantly reduced length of postoperative hospital stay vs the conventional care group (11.3 +- 2.5 days vs. 14.2 +- 2.2 days, P < 0.01). The mean DRS-R-98 score was 7.1 +- 2.7 for the comprehensive care group, and was significantly lower than that of the conventional orthopedic care group (11.2 +- 3.0; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our early intervention may reduce the incidence of perioperative delirium in elderly hip fracture patients (>60 years).
