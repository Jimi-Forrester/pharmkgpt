35307412|a|Geroprotection is defined as protection from the adverse effects of aging. The need for geroprotection implies changes towards individually tailored interventions that preserve an individual's independence, physical function, and cognition. Genistein, a phytoestrogen obtained from soya, has been reported to have beneficial properties on age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases or cancer. Indeed, genistein is a multimodal agent: it acts as a cancer protective agent, promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis, but it also acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloid-beta and autophagy promoter. Altogether, these properties make genistein a possible treatment for the specific aspects of age-related diseases such as hypertension, metabolic diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis.
