12106772|a|White matter lesions (WMLs) in the brain is a common, unspecific finding on magnetic resonance imaging appearing both in the healthy elderly as well as in a number of different diseases including dementia disorders. However, the pathophysiological and clinical significance of WMLs in dementia disorders is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the possibility of their origin being inflammatory by studying the correlation between WMLs and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the proinflammatory cytokine soluble interleukin-1 receptor type II (sIL-1RII). The sIL-1RII is a member of the IL-1 family, and has been found to be elevated in CSF from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present study, two groups of patients complaining of memory disturbances with little or extensive WMLs respectively, were examined, as well as healthy subjects. In accordance with other reports, WML scores (total, periventricular as well as deep lesions) were positively correlated with age but not mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores, and were significantly higher in patients with a dementia diagnosis as compared to non-demented subjects. There were no differences in sIL-1RII levels in CSF regardless of amount of total, periventricular or deep WMLs, nor were there any differences between demented and non-demented subjects. In conclusion, sIL-1RII levels in CSF are not correlated to magnetic resonance imaging WMLs in patients with dementia disorders or in healthy subjects.
