36624183|a|BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the application of CSF real-time quaking-induced conversion in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance to investigate test accuracy, influencing factors, and associations with disease incidence. METHODS: In a prospective surveillance study, CSF real-time quaking-induced conversion was performed in patients with clinical suspicion of prion disease (2014-2022). Clinically or histochemically characterized patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 888) and patients with final diagnosis of non-prion disease (n = 371) were included for accuracy and association studies. RESULTS: The overall test sensitivity for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was 90% and the specificity 99%. Lower sensitivity was associated with early disease stage (p = 0.029) and longer survival (p < 0.001). The frequency of false positives was significantly higher in patients with inflammatory CNS diseases (3.7%) than in other diagnoses (0.4%, p = 0.027). The incidence increased from 1.7 per million person-years (2006-2017) to 2.0 after the test was added to diagnostic the criteria (2018-2021). CONCLUSION: We validated high diagnostic accuracy of CSF real-time quaking-induced conversion but identified inflammatory brain disease as a potential source of (rare) false-positive results, indicating thorough consideration of this condition in the differential diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The surveillance improved after amendment of the diagnostic criteria, whereas the incidence showed no suggestive alterations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
