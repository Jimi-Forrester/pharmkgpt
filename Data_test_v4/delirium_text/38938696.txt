38938696|t|The Role of Vitamins in Spinal Cord Injury: Mechanisms and Benefits.
38938696|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common neurological disease worldwide, often resulting in a substantial decrease in quality of life, disability, and in severe cases, even death. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for this disease. Nevertheless, current basic and clinical evidence suggests that vitamins, with their antioxidant properties and biological functions, may play a valuable role in improving the quality of life for individuals with SCI. They can promote overall health and facilitate the healing process. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of vitamins in the treatment of SCI.
