32424118|a|In preceding efforts, we demonstrated that antibiotic (ABX) cocktail-mediated perturbations of the gut microbiome in two independent transgenic lines, termed APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 and APPPS1-21, leads to a reduction in Abeta deposition in male mice. To determine whether these observed reductions of cerebral Abeta amyloidosis are specific to any individual antibiotic or require the synergistic effects of several antibiotics, we treated male APPPS1-21 transgenic mice with either individual ABX or an ABX cocktail and assessed amyloid deposition. Specifically, mice were subject to oral gavage with high dose kanamycin, gentamicin, colistin, metronidazole, vancomycin, individually or in a combination (ABX cocktail) from postnatal days (PND) 14 to 21, followed by ad libitum, low-dose individual ABX or ABX cocktail in the drinking water until the time of sacrifice. A control group was subject to gavage with water from PND 14 to 21 and received drinking water till the time of sacrifice. At the time of sacrifice, all groups showed distinct cecal microbiota profiles with the highest differences between control and ABX cocktail-treated animals. Surprisingly, only the ABX cocktail significantly reduced brain Abeta amyloidosis compared to vehicle-treated animals. In parallel studies, and to assess the potential exposure of ABX to the brain, we quantified the levels of each ABX in the brain by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) at PND 22 or at 7 weeks of age. With the exception of metronidazole (which was observed at less than 3% relative to the spiked control brains), we were unable to detect the other individual ABX in brain homogenates. Our findings suggest that synergistic alterations of gut microbial consortia, rather than individual antimicrobial agents, underlie the observed reductions in brain amyloidosis.
