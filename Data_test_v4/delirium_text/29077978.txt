29077978|t|Comparison of African American and Caucasian Caregiver Self-Efficacy.
29077978|a|Self-efficacy influences one's behavior and can determine the degree to which one is motivated to take action. The current study explores changes in caregiver self-efficacy pre- and post-participation in a Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH II) program, a multi-component intervention aimed at caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The study specifically compared this construct in African American and Caucasian populations, which may give indications of how to empower dementia caregivers and whether REACH II is culturally sensitive and thus, an important component to examine. Nurses are the connection between families and community resources and must serve as referral sources to programs that work. Although African American and Caucasian caregivers showed comparable rates of increase in self-efficacy, African American caregivers started and ended at higher rates of self-efficacy for obtaining respite and overall self-efficacy. Applications of the results and directions for future research are discussed. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 44(3), 16-21.].
