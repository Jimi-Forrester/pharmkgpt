36374406|t|Role of SIRT3 in neurological diseases and rehabilitation training.
36374406|a|Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) is a deacetylase that plays an important role in normal physiological activities by regulating a variety of substrates. Considerable evidence has shown that the content and activity of SIRT3 are altered in neurological diseases. Furthermore, SIRT3 affects the occurrence and development of neurological diseases. In most cases, SIRT3 can inhibit clinical manifestations of neurological diseases by promoting autophagy, energy production, and stabilization of mitochondrial dynamics, and by inhibiting neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress (OS). However, SIRT3 may sometimes have the opposite effect. SIRT3 can promote the transfer of microglia. Microglia in some cases promote ischemic brain injury, and in some cases inhibit ischemic brain injury. Moreover, SIRT3 can promote the accumulation of ceramide, which can worsen the damage caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). This review comprehensively summarizes the different roles and related mechanisms of SIRT3 in neurological diseases. Moreover, to provide more ideas for the prognosis of neurological diseases, we summarize several SIRT3-mediated rehabilitation training methods.
