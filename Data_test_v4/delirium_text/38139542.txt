38139542|t|Label-Free, Impedance-Based Biosensor for Kidney Disease Biomarker Uromodulin.
38139542|a|We demonstrate the development of a label-free, impedance-based biosensor by using a passivation layer of 50-nm tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) on interdigitated electrodes (IDE). This layer was fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and has a high dielectric constant (high-kappa), which improves the capacitive property of the IDE. We validate the biosensor's performance by measuring uromodulin, a urine biomarker for kidney tubular damage, from artificial urine samples. The passivation layer is functionalized with uromodulin antibodies for selective binding. The passivated IDE enables the non-faradaic impedance measurement of uromodulin concentrations with a measurement range from 0.5 ng/mL to 8 ng/mL and with a relative change in impedance of 15 % per ng/mL at a frequency of 150 Hz (log scale). This work presents a concept for point-of-care biosensing applications for disease biomarkers.
