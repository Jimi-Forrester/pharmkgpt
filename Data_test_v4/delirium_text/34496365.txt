34496365|t|The Functional Roles of Curcumin on Astrocytes in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
34496365|a|Progressive abnormality and loss of axons and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) cause neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Protein misfolding and its collection are the most important pathological features of NDs. Astrocytes are the most plentiful cells in the mammalian CNS (about 20-40% of the human brain) and have several central functions in the maintenance of the health and correct function of the CNS. Astrocytes have an essential role in the preservation of brain homeostasis, and it is not surprising that these multifunctional cells have been implicated in the onset and progression of several NDs. Thus, they become an exciting target for the study of NDs. Over almost 15 years, it was revealed that curcumin has several therapeutic effects in a wide variety of diseases' treatment. Curcumin is a valuable ingredient present in turmeric spice and has several essential roles, including those which are anticarcinogenic, hepatoprotective, thrombosuppressive, cardioprotective, anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, chemopreventive, chemotherapeutic, and anti-infectious. Furthermore, curcumin can suppress inflammation; promote angiogenesis; and treat diabetes, pulmonary problems, and neurological dysfunction. Here, we review the effects of curcumin on astrocytes in NDs, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple scleroses, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
