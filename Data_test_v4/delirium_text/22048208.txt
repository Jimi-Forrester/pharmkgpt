22048208|t|[Abuse of gamma-hydroxybutyrate].
22048208|a|BACKGROUND: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is naturally present in the human body, but may also be used as an intoxicating drug. Information from several sources has suggested its increased availability and use in Norway. There have also been reports of an increasing use of the chemical precursor gamma-butyrolactone (GBL).There is currently a need for knowledge on symptoms, addictiveness and overdoses, as well as targeted preventive measures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on a discretionary selection of articles resulting from a literature search in PubMed, as well as reports from Norwegian and European authorities and research institutions. RESULTS: An intake of small amounts of GHB produces an intoxicating effect, whereas higher doses can result in poisoning. Deaths have been reported. The effect may be variable, due to a steep dose-response curve and interaction with alcohol and other intoxicants. Treatment of poisoning is symptomatic and supportive. Treatment of abstinence is also supportive, while delirium may be treated as delirium tremens. INTERPRETATION: Preventive measures should be tailored specifically to potential user-groups.
