34864680|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in older adults and extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is one of the two characterized pathologies of AD. Obesity is significantly associated with AD developing factors. Several studies have reported that high fat diet (HFD) influenced Abeta accumulation and cognitive performance during AD pathology. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of HFD influenced Abeta accumulation and cognitive performance during AD pathology. METHODS: 2.5-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were randomly separated into two groups: 1) the normal diet (ND) group, fed a standard diet (10 kcal%fat); and 2) the HFD group, fed a high fat diet (40 kcal%fat, D12492; Research Diets). After 4 months of HFD or ND feeding, mice in the two groups were subjected for further ethological, morphological, and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: A long-term HFD diet significantly increased perirenal fat and impaired dendritic integrity and aggravated neurodegeneration, and augmented learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the HFD increased beta amyloid cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) dephosphorylation and SUMOylation, resulting in enhanced enzyme activity and stability, which exacerbated the deposition of amyloid plaques. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that long-term HFD consumption aggravates amyloid-beta accumulation and cognitive impairments, and that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as obesity, can induce BACE1 post-modifications which may contribute to AD pathogenesis.
