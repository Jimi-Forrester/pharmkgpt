37513822|a|Around 50% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may experience psychotic symptoms after onset, resulting in a subtype of AD known as psychosis in AD (AD + P). This subtype is characterized by more rapid cognitive decline compared to AD patients without psychosis. Therefore, there is a great need to identify risk factors for the development of AD + P and explore potential treatment options. In this study, we enhanced our deep learning model, DeepBiomarker, to predict the onset of psychosis in AD utilizing data from electronic medical records (EMRs). The model demonstrated superior predictive capacity with an AUC (area under curve) of 0.907, significantly surpassing conventional risk prediction models. Utilizing a perturbation-based method, we identified key features from multiple medications, comorbidities, and abnormal laboratory tests, which notably influenced the prediction outcomes. Our findings demonstrated substantial agreement with existing studies, underscoring the vital role of metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and liver function pathways in AD + P. Importantly, the DeepBiomarker model not only offers a precise prediction of AD + P onset but also provides mechanistic understanding, potentially informing the development of innovative treatments. With additional validation, this approach could significantly contribute to early detection and prevention strategies for AD + P, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
