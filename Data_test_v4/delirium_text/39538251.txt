We examined the nationwide trends and outcomes of cardiovascular surgery patients with dementia to determine its effect on morbidity, mortality, and discharge disposition. METHODS: From 2002 to 2014, 11,414 (0.27%) of the 4,201,697 cardiac surgery patients from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample had a preoperative diagnosis of dementia. Propensity-score matching was used to balance dementia and non-dementia groups. Primary outcomes included postoperative morbidity, mortality, and discharge to skilled nursing facility (SNF). RESULTS: Dementia patients were more often male (67%) and 65-84 years old (84%). Postoperative mortality among patients with dementia was lower compared to patients without dementia (3.4% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.05). In dementia patients, there were more complications (65% vs. 60%, p < 0.01), more blood transfusions [OR 1.3, 95%CI (1.1, 1.5), p < 0.01] and delirium [OR 3.6, 95%CI (2.9, 4.5), p < 0.0001). Dementia patients (n = 5,623, 49.8%) were twice as likely to be discharged to SNF [OR 2.1, 95%CI (1.9, 2.4), p < 0.0001]. Dementia patients discharged to SNF more often had delirium (18.2% vs. 12%, p < 0.01), renal complications (17% vs. 8%, p < 0.01), and prolonged mechanical ventilation (15% vs. 8%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite an aging population with increasing prevalence of dementia, patients with dementia can undergo cardiovascular surgery with a lower in-hospital mortality and similar hospitalization costs compared to their non-dementia counterparts. Dementia patients are more likely to experience complications and require discharge to skilled nursing facility. Careful patient selection and targeted physical therapy may help mitigate some dementia associated complications.
