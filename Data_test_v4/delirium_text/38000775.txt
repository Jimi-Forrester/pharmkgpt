38000775|a|The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small South American monkey, is an important nonhuman primate model in the study of aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and related dementias. Thorough characterization of the wild type marmoset brain agingmodel, including biomarkers of aging and neural degeneration, will further the marmoset's utility in translational research. We measured serum concentration of four key biomarkers of neural degeneration [total tau (T-tau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1)] via single molecule array from 24 marmosets (female n = 13, male n = 11) ranging in age from 1.3 to 18.7 years. Aged marmosets (>7 years) had significantly higher GFAP, NfL, UCH-L1, and T-tau than adult marmosets. Sex differences were not detected for any of these biomarker concentrations. These data provide an important initial range of reference values for GFAP, NfL, T-tau, and UCH-L1 to evaluate aging and neural health in marmosets, as well as evaluation of therapeutics in clinical models of disease.
