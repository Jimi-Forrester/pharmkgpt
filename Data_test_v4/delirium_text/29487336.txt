29487336|a|The Fibronectin Leucine-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (FLRT2) has been implicated in several hormone -and sex-dependent physiological and pathological processes (including chondrogenesis, menarche and breast cancer); is known to regulate developmental synapses formation, and is expressed in the hippocampus, a brain structure central for learning and memory. However, the role of FLRT2 in the adult hippocampus and its relevance in sex-dependent brain functions remains unknown. We here used adult single-allele FLRT2 knockout (FLRT2+/-) mice and behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular/biological assays to examine the effects of FLRT2 haplodeficiency on synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Female and male FLRT2+/- mice presented morphological features (including body masses, brain shapes/weights, and brain macroscopic cytoarchitectonic organization), indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts. However, in vivo examinations unveiled enhanced hippocampus-dependent spatial memory recall in female FLRT2+/- animals, concomitant with augmented hippocampal synaptic plasticity and decreased levels of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 and beta estrogen receptors. In contrast, male FLRT2+/- animals exhibited deficient memory recall and decreased alpha estrogen receptor levels. These observations propose that FLRT2 can regulate memory functions in the adulthood in a sex-specific manner and might thus contribute to further research on the mechanisms linking sexual dimorphism and cognition.
