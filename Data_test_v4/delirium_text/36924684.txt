36924684|a|Emerging evidence indicates that vascular stress is an important contributor to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its metabolites (acid-labile (e.g., iron-sulfur clusters) and bound (e.g., per-, poly-) sulfides) have been shown to modulate both vascular and neuronal homeostasis. We recently reported that elevated plasma sulfides were associated with cognitive dysfunction and measures of microvascular disease in ADRD. Here we extend our previous work to show associations between elevated sulfides and magnetic resonance-based metrics of brain atrophy and white matter integrity. Elevated bound sulfides were associated with decreased grey matter volume, while increased acid labile sulfides were associated with decreased white matter integrity and greater ventricular volume. These findings are consistent with alterations in sulfide metabolism in ADRD which may represent maladaptive responses to oxidative stress.
