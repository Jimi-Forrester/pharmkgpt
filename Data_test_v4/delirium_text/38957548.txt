38957548|t|Identifying discriminative features of brain network for prediction of Alzheimer's disease using graph theory and machine learning.
38957548|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a challenging neurodegenerative condition, necessitating early diagnosis and intervention. This research leverages machine learning (ML) and graph theory metrics, derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data to predict AD. Using Southwest University Adult Lifespan Dataset (SALD, age 21-76 years) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS, age 64-95 years) dataset, containing 112 participants, various ML models were developed for the purpose of AD prediction. The study identifies key features for a comprehensive understanding of brain network topology and functional connectivity in AD. Through a 5-fold cross-validation, all models demonstrate substantial predictive capabilities (accuracy in 82-92% range), with the support vector machine model standing out as the best having an accuracy of 92%. Present study suggests that top 13 regions, identified based on most important discriminating features, have lost significant connections with thalamus. The functional connection strengths were consistently declined for substantia nigra, pars reticulata, substantia nigra, pars compacta, and nucleus accumbens among AD subjects as compared to healthy adults and aging individuals. The present finding corroborate with the earlier studies, employing various neuroimagining techniques. This research signifies the translational potential of a comprehensive approach integrating ML, graph theory and rs-fMRI analysis in AD prediction, offering potential biomarker for more accurate diagnostics and early prediction of AD.
