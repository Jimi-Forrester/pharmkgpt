33417204|t|Peroxisomal Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Disease: A Bidirectional Crosstalk.
33417204|a|Peroxisomes are multifunctional organelles best known for their role in cellular lipid and hydrogen peroxide metabolism. In this chapter, we review and discuss the diverse functions of this organelle in brain physiology and neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on oxidative stress. We first briefly summarize what is known about the various nexuses among peroxisomes, the central nervous system, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative disease. Next, we provide a comprehensive overview of the complex interplay among peroxisomes, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration in patients suffering from primary peroxisomal disorders. Particular examples that are discussed include the prototypic Zellweger spectrum disorders and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, the most prevalent peroxisomal disorder. Thereafter, we elaborate on secondary peroxisome dysfunction in more common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we highlight some issues and challenges that need to be addressed to progress towards therapies and prevention strategies preserving, normalizing, or improving peroxisome activity in patients suffering from neurodegenerative conditions.
