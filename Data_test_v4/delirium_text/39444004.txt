39444004|t|NDRG1 upregulation by ubiquitin proteasome system dysfunction aggravates neurodegeneration.
39444004|a|Protein turnover is crucial for cell survival, and the impairment of proteostasis leads to cell death. Aging is associated with a decline in proteostasis, as the progressive accumulation of damaged proteins is a hallmark of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously discovered that the declining function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in motor neurons contributes to sporadic ALS pathologies, such as progressive motor neuron loss, protein accumulation, and glial activation. However, the mechanisms of UPS dysfunction-induced cell damage, such as cell death and aggregation, are not fully understood. This study used transcriptome analysis of motor neurons with UPS dysfunction and found that the expression of N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) gets upregulated by UPS dysfunction. Additionally, the upregulation of NDRG1 induces cell death in the Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. These results suggest that NDRG1 is a potential marker for UPS dysfunction and may play a role in neurodegeneration, such as that seen in ALS.
