35979969|t|Safe Hugs in Palliative Care.
35979969|a|Mnemonics are word formulations that aid physicians in recalling instances hidden among typical applications and may be neglected due to workload. Mnemonic abbreviations that benefit not only physicians but the entire care team are widely used throughout the world. Given that palliative care is the work of a multidisciplinary team, these mnemonics become even more significant. The aim of this study is to introduce the acronym "SAFE HUGS IN PC" (Sleep patterns, Analgesia, Feeding, Environment, Hospital Discharge-Home Care, Ulcer, Gastrointestinal, Social Support-Spiritual, Infection, Need of Religion, Physiotherapy-Psychotherapy, Goals of Care), which we believe will meet the requirements in the palliative care. The following databases were searched: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, and Pubmed for studies exploring experiences of palliative care. With this mnemonic, which we use in our own clinic, patients' and patients' relatives' satisfaction and end-of-life quality have increased. We believe this simple mnemonic will encourage teamwork and help improve the quality of life on palliative care.
