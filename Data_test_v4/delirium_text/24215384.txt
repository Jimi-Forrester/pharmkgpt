24215384|t|Influenza encephalopathy and related neuropsychiatric syndromes.
24215384|a|Influenza is occasionally complicated by CNS disorders, in particular impairment of consciousness. Severe disorders encompass multiple, distinct syndromes manifesting acute encephalopathy, whereas mild disorders represent multiple, ill-defined neuropsychiatric syndromes. Acute encephalopathy is manifested with seizures and coma, with or without multi-organ involvement. The outcome varies from death or neurologic sequelae to recovery and differs among syndromes. Transient neuropsychiatric disorders are manifested with delirium and/or abnormal behavior. There also are multiple syndromes. The outcome is usually favorable, although occasional fatal accidents warrant caution.
