34412959|a|OBJECTIVE: To understand the experiences in nursing care in the prevention and treatment of delirium in people hospitalized in intensive care units. METHODOLOGY: Hermeneutic phenomenological qualitative study. The selection of participants was by intentional sampling: seven nursing assistants and eight nurses. Theoretical saturation was achieved. The phenomenological interview was applied to collect data from a central question and the analysis was carried out following the approaches of Heidegger's hermeneutical circle. RESULTS: Four significant themes emerged from the analysis: 1) Delirium prevention, 2) Pharmacological treatment, 3) Non-pharmacological treatment, and 4) Barriers to non-pharmacological treatment. These themes were accompanied by 35 interrelated units of meaning: in the first theme, the most repetitive units were communication, orientation, and family bonding; in the second was the use of pharmacological treatment only in the acute phase; in the third was the modification of the environment according to the patient's preference (where the family is a priority and strategies that provide cognitive and social stimulation can be reinforced), and in the fourth was the work overload for the nursing team. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of the nursing team in the prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients highlight that communication allows an approach to the patient as a human being immersed in a reality, with a personal history, needs and preferences. Therefore, family members must be involved in these scenarios, as they can complement and support nursing care.
