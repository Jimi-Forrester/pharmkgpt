37516848|a|BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying drug use necessitates better Alzheimer disease (AD) detection. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) leverages cognitive decline to identify the risk group; similarly, mild behavioral impairment (MBI) leverages behavioral change. Adding MBI to MCI improves dementia prognostication over conventional approaches of incorporating neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Here, to determine if adding MBI would better identify AD, we interrogated associations between MBI in MCI, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers [beta-amyloid (Abeta), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and total-tau (tau)-ATN], cross-sectionally and longitudinally. METHODS: Data were from two independent referral-based cohorts, ADNI (mean[SD] follow-up 3.14[1.07] years) and MEMENTO (4.25[1.40] years), collected 2003-2021. Exposure was based on three-group stratification: 1) NPS meeting MBI criteria; 2) conventionally measured NPS (NPSnotMBI); and 3) noNPS. Cohorts were analyzed separately for: 1) cross-sectional associations between NPS status and ATN biomarkers (linear regressions); 2) 4-year longitudinal repeated-measures associations of MBI and NPSnotMBI with ATN biomarkers (hierarchical linear mixed-effects models-LMEs); and 3) rates of incident dementia (Cox proportional hazards regressions). RESULTS: Of 510 MCI participants, 352 were from ADNI (43.5% females; mean [SD] age, 71.68 [7.40] years), and 158 from MEMENTO (46.2% females; 68.98 [8.18] years). In ADNI, MBI was associated with lower Abeta42 (standardized beta [95%CI], -5.52% [-10.48-(-0.29)%]; p = 0.039), and Abeta42/40 (p = 0.01); higher p-tau (9.67% [3.96-15.70%]; p = 0.001), t-tau (7.71% [2.70-12.97%]; p = 0.002), p-tau/Abeta42 (p < 0.001), and t-tau/Abeta42 (p = 0.001). NPSnotMBI was associated only with lower Abeta42/40 (p = 0.045). LMEs revealed a similar 4-year AD-specific biomarker profile for MBI, with NPSnotMBI associated only with higher t-tau. MBI had a greater rate of incident dementia (HR [95%CI], 3.50 [1.99-6.17; p < 0.001). NPSnotMBI did not differ from noNPS (HR 0.96 [0.49-1.89]; p = 0.916). In MEMENTO, MBI demonstrated a similar magnitude and direction of effect for all biomarkers, but with a greater reduction in Abeta40. HR for incident dementia was 3.93 (p = 0.004) in MBI, and 1.83 (p = 0.266) in NPSnotMBI. Of MBI progressors to dementia, 81% developed AD dementia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a biological basis for NPS that meet MBI criteria, the continued inclusion of MBI in NIA-AA ATN clinical staging, and the utility of MBI criteria to improve identification of patients for enrollment in disease-modifying drug trials or for clinical care.
