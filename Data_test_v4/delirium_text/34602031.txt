34602031|t|Systematic Patent Review of Nanoparticles in Drug Delivery and Cancer Therapy in the Last Decade.
34602031|a|BACKGROUND: The application of nanotechnology has been considered a powerful platform in improving the current situation in drug delivery and cancer therapy, especially in targeting the desired site of action. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the patent review is to survey and review patents from the past ten years that are related to the two particular areas of nanomedicines. METHODS: The patents related to the nanoparticle-based inventions utilized in drug delivery and cancer treatment from 2010 onwards were browsed in databases like USPTO, WIPO, Google Patents, and Free Patents Online. After conducting numerous screening processes, a total of 40 patents were included in the patent analysis. See the PRISMA checklist 2020 checklist. RESULTS: Amongst the selected patents, an overview of various types of nanoparticles is presented in this paper, including polymeric, metallic, silica, lipid-based nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and albumin-based nanomedicines. CONCLUSION: Nanomedicines' advantages include improvements in terms of drug delivery, bioavailability, solubility, penetration, and stability of drugs. It is concluded that the utilization of nanoparticles in medicines is essential in the pursuit of better clinical practice.
