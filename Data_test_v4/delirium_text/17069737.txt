17069737|a|INTRODUCTION: Although delirium is a reversible cerebral syndrome, the effect of treatment of the elderly is unsatisfactory, involving prolonged hospitalizations and increased risk of relapse and mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether hospitalization for delirium (severe delirium) diagnosed by ICD-10 criteria predicts increased morbidity, utilization of health services and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Delirious inpatients (n = 26) discharged after treatment in an old-age psychiatric university clinic were studied for nine years. In a register-based design, the above-mentioned parameters of the delirium cohort were compared with a group of controls (n = 116). RESULTS: There was a trend to increased mortality in the delirium cohort. Compared with the controls, the delirium cohort had a significantly increased incidence of disorders of vital organs, serious psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, increased use of hospital psychiatry and general practitioner's out-of-hours service, but less use of office-hour services. The incidence of delirium in the cohorts was low. In the delirium cohort, there was no significantly increased use of services or the number of diagnoses in somatic hospitals. CONCLUSION: Increased somatic and psychiatric morbidity and a trend to increased mortality indicate a serious prognosis after severe delirium in the elderly. It is noteworthy that the delirium cohort had increased use of GPs' out-of-hours services but less use of office-hour services.
