36383265|a|BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) exert neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, studies on the relationships between serum IGF-1 and EGF levels and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients have been rare. METHODS: A Siemens automatic chemical analyzer was used to determine serum IGF-1 levels, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect serum EGF levels in 100 healthy controls and 100 PD patients, including those in the early (n = 49) and middle-late (n = 51) stage of the disease. Evaluation of motor symptoms and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients was assessed by the associated scales. RESULTS: Serum IGF-1 and EGF levels were higher in PD patients than in healthy controls, and serum IGF-1 and EGF levels were higher in early stage PD patients than in middle-late stage PD patients. Serum IGF-1 levels were significantly negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction; serum EGF levels were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive dysfunction. Combining IGF-1 and EGF in the diagnosis of PD was more valuable than using a single factor in the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that serum IGF-1 levels were correlated with the nonmotor symptoms of anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction and that EGF levels were correlated with cognitive dysfunction. The combination of IGF-1 and EGF increased the value for a PD diagnosis. This is the first report of the simultaneous detection of IGF-1 and EGF levels to explore the correlation with nonmotor symptoms of PD.
