1821049|t|Intravenous premedication with atropine and postanesthetic delirium. Report of two cases.
1821049|a|The authors report two cases of postanesthetic delirium in patients receiving intravenous atropine sulphate before surgery. In the first case the diagnosis of atropinic syndrome has been suggested by a cause effect relationship; in the second case the diagnosis has been supported by the prompt resolution after intravenous physostigmine salycilate administration. Since such syndrome was never observed in patients receiving atropine sulphate as i.m. premedicant, authors are prone to consider the i.m. route a safer approach to premedication with this drug.
