39577557|t|TCM-ADIP: a multidimensional database linking traditional Chinese medicine to functional brain zones of Alzheimer's disease.
39577557|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, with existing therapeutic drugs typically targeting specific disease stages. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), known for its multi-target and multi-mechanism therapeutic approach, has demonstrated efficacy in treating various stages of AD. In the present work, through a systematic review of classical Chinese medical texts, the formulae for preventing and treating AD were identified. Meanwhile, the active ingredients within these formulae were extracted and cataloged. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of omics data was performed to identify differentially expressed genes across different functional brain regions in AD patients at various stages. Finally, by integrating the multidimensional data, we proposed the first database, TCM-ADIP, dedicated to TCM based AD prevention and treatment, which is freely available at https://cbcb.cdutcm.edu.cn/TCM-ADIP/. TCM-ADIP not only supports interactive searching of multidimensional data, but also provides tools for gene localization and functional enrichment analysis of formulae, herbs, and ingredients for AD intervention in specific brain zones. TCM-ADIP fills a crucial gap in existing databases, offering a comprehensive resource for TCM in the treatment of AD.
