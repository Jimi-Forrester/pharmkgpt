32884214|t|Molecular docking analysis of doronine derivatives with human COX-2.
32884214|a|Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is linked to inflammation. Therefore, it is of interest to design and develop novel inhibitors for COX-2. Hence, we report the molecular docking based binding features of doronine derivatives (desacetyldoronine, floradnin, onetine, 22310115, 21159807) with the human Cyclooxygenase-2 as potential inhibitors. A pyrrolizidine alkaloid doronine a molecular constituents of Emilia sonchifolia is an herbal alternative to known drugs in the prophylaxis of inflammation. We report the molecular docking, pharmacophore, ADMET and molecular properties analysis data of doronine and its similar compounds. Docking and ADMET Data shows that COX-2 binds with doronine with optimal features for further consideration.
