32516349|a|This study aimed to determine whether family-centered multidisciplinary rounds could alleviate anxiety and uncertainty in illness and meet needs for critically ill patients' families. A family-centered multidisciplinary rounds protocol was developed identifying needs of critically ill patients' families, and family experiences were reviewed through in-depth interviews. A sequential mixed-methods study was utilized, combining survey data and semi-structured interviews in a tertiary medical intensive care unit in South Korea. A structured questionnaire assessed needs, anxiety, and uncertainty in illness for 50 participants. Interview data of 10 participants were analyzed using grounded theory. Assurance was the highest family need, followed by information need. Family needs differed according to gender, relationship to the patient, and length of intensive care unit stay. Participants reported family-centered multidisciplinary rounds provided a sense of relief, a chance to listen to medical staff, and a chance to provide medical staff with comprehensive information about patient care. Proximity needs were found to have a positive correlation with state anxiety, while comfort needs had a negative correlation with uncertainty in illness. Families reported family-centered multidisciplinary rounds were positive, useful experiences. Thus, standardization of family-centered multidisciplinary rounds is needed to meet families' various needs.
