38911128|t|Qualitative Insights Into Patients' and Family Members' Experiences of In-Hospital Medication Management After a Critical Care Episode.
38911128|a|Background: Patient recovery after a critical illness can be protracted, requiring a care continuum that extends along a patient pathway from the critical care unit, hospital ward, and into the community care setting. High-quality care on patient transfer from critical care, including medication safety, is facilitated by education for patients and families, family engagement, support systems, and health care professional (HCP)-patient communication. Currently, uncertainty exists regarding how HCPs can and should engage with critical care patients and family members about their medication. Research Question: What are the views and experiences of critical care patients and family members about their involvement in, communication about, understanding of, and decision-making related to their medication after transfer from critical care to the hospital ward? Study Design and Methods: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews, conducted with critical care patients and family members after transfer from critical care to a hospital ward in a large National Health Service hospital trust. Anonymized transcripts of interviews were analyzed thematically using a coding framework developed from understandings of patient and family engagement in medication administration. Results: Twenty-seven participants (15 patients and 12 family members of patients) completed the interviews. We identified five themes and 15 subthemes, providing an overview of patients' and family members' views on medication management during acute illness and ongoing recovery. Themes identified were: impact of acute illness and treatment burden on preexisting illness, preexisting knowledge and capability, beliefs about persons roles and expectations, care continuity and individualized information exchange, and engagement in practice. Interpretation: This study demonstrated that critical care patients and family members want to engage with HCPs about medication administration. HCPs must take an individualized approach to communication and timing, acknowledging the dynamic interplay between patients and family members, using multimodal forms of communication.
