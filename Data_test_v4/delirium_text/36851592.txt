36851592|t|Assessment and Diagnosis of HIV-Associated Dementia.
36851592|a|The modern combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has substantially lowered the incidence of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The dominant clinical features include deficits in cognitive processing speed, concentration, attention, and memory. As people living with HIV become older, with high rates of comorbidities and concomitant treatments, the prevalence and complexity of cognitive impairment are expected to increase. Currently, the management of HAD and milder forms of HAND is grounded on the best clinical practice, as there is no specific, evidence-based, proven intervention for managing cognitive impairment. The present article acknowledges the multifactorial nature of the cognitive impairments found in HIV patients, outlining the current concepts in the field of HAD. Major areas of interest include neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging to evaluate CNS status, focusing on greater reliability in the exclusion of associated diseases and allowing for earlier diagnosis. Additionally, we considered the evidence for neurological involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with wider consequences to population health than can be attributed to the virus itself. The indirect effects of COVID-19, including the increased adoption of telehealth, decreased access to community resources, and social isolation, represent a significant health burden, disproportionately affecting older adults with dementia who have limited social networks and increased functional dependence on the community and health system. This synopsis reviews these aspects in greater detail, identifying key gaps and opportunities for researchers and clinicians; we provide an overview of the current concepts in the field of HAD, with suggestions for diagnosing and managing this important neurological complication, which is intended to be applicable across diverse populations, in line with clinical observations, and closely representative of HIV brain pathology.
