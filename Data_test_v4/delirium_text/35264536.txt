35264536|a|PURPOSE: The number of hospitalizations of older patients with dementia who require medical treatment has increased and delirium or physical restriction have become problems in the acute care setting. Dementia nursing intervention ability developing program by e-learning assumed the quality improvement of dementia medical care and the nursing of older patients with dementia based on person-centered aimed at reduction of body restriction. The purpose of this study was to validate the effectiveness of the developed e-learning programs for nurses in the acute care setting of seven to one nursing standards. METHOD: This study was conducted between April and December 2020. This study was introduced to the floor nurse of the hospital for suitable application. Interested nurses were asked to attend "Developing programs for Dementia nursing intervention ability (4 weeks)" at four different time points (1) before attendance (baseline), post-attendance (1 month later), (3) practiced 3 months post-attendance, and (4) practiced 6 months post-attendance. A questionnaire to evaluate program effectiveness asked about consciousness of the dementia nursing with four items on "Interest in nursing of people with dementia and so on (four items)".In the evaluation on the person-centered dementia care, using the Self-assessment Scale of Nursing Practice for Elderly Patients with Cognitive Impairment, the Approach to Dementia Questionnaire - Japanese Edition (19 items). In the evaluation of ethics, ethical sensitivity scale for clinical nurses (19 items), self-efficacy on reduction of the physical restriction (six items). A statistical analysis was conducted using the Bonferroni test as the multiple test method to compare baseline values with the values obtained 1, 3, and 6 months later. RESULTS: A total of 70 subjects were analyzed in this study. They belonged to different wards including the surgical and internal wards from where 60 subjects (85.7%) were recruited. The average clinical experience of the nurses was 13.5+-9.5 years. The degree of self-efficacy was assessed in terms of attaching mitten type gloves as a physical restraint to avoid the pulling of tubes used for intravenous feeding, central veins, normal feeding, etc. by the patients and so on. Most patients had cognitive functional disorder, including dementia [n = 30 (42.9%)]. The self-assessed scale of nursing practice for elderly people with cognitive impairment, which aimed to promote person-centered care in an acute care hospital, revealed that the total score of each of the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire - Japanese Edition significantly increased just after intervention (1 month) in comparison to baseline, and 3 months and 6 months after intervention. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the program developed to improve dementia nursing intervention ability significantly increased the above-mentioned evolution and consciousness of nurses after the intervention program (1 month), followed by 3 months and 6 months later. Along with ethical sensitivity, practice aimed at person-centered care was also found to improve. It was suggested that the intervention program of this study was effective and that nurses could easily learn using their respective free time and practice.
