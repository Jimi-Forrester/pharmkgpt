35075374|t|Dysregulation of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) Expression as a Biomarker of Keratoconus.
35075374|a|BACKGROUND: Because of the implications of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) in keratoconus (KC), we describe a differential expression of RAGE transcripts and proteins in corneal tissues and tears of KC and healthy patients. METHODS: Using a case-controlled study, corneal epitheliums and tears of KC and healthy subjects were obtained during corneal collagen cross-linking and photorefractive keratectomy (PKR) and during usual consultations. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) and Western-Blot were performed to analyze RAGE transcripts and proteins' expression in corneal tissues and tears. RESULTS: One hundred and six patients were included in this study. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: 56 KC (25 corneal epithelium and 31 tears) and 50 control subjects (25 corneal epithelium and 25 tears). Transcripts of RAGE, HMGB1, and S100 family ligands were quantified by RT-qPCR, identifying a significantly higher expression of RAGE and HMGB1 in the healthy group than in the KC group (p = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Western Blot showed a significantly higher fl-RAGE expression in KC corneal epithelium than control (p < 0.001) and lower s-RAGE expression in KC tears than control (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Linked with the inflammatory process occurring in KC pathophysiology, we propose for the first time that the RAGE expression (total and truncated forms of receptor and ligands) in KC corneal tissues and tear samples provides viable biomarkers.
