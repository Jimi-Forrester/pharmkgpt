6274034|t|[Sultopride in acute manic psychoses (author's transl)].
6274034|a|Sultopride, a benzamide derivative, provides rapid sedation. This makes it one of the main drugs used in psychiatric emergencies. Our study includes 26 cases of psychomotor hyperactivity originating in manic-depressive psychosis of schizophrenia. The medication had no effect on wakefulness. It was always effective on agitation but not on delusion or hallucinations. Manic forms of primary delirious experiences are the best indication for sultopride. It is mainly effective on delirium as a state rather than on delirium as an idea (Wahn, Delusion) which is secondary from a pathogenetic standpoint.
