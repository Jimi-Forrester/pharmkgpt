37980531|t|The metabolic spatial covariance pattern of definite idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: an FDG PET study with principal components analysis.
37980531|a|Identification of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) in a collective with suspected neurodegenerative disease is essential. This study aimed to determine the metabolic spatial covariance pattern of iNPH on FDG PET using an established technique based on scaled subprofile model principal components analysis (SSM-PCA).We identified 11 patients with definite iNPH. By applying SSM-PCA to the FDG PET data, they were compared to 48 age-matched healthy controls to determine the whole-brain voxel-wise metabolic spatial covariance pattern of definite iNPH (iNPH-related pattern, iNPHRP). The iNPHRP score was compared between groups of patients with definite iNPH, possible iNPH (N = 34), Alzheimer's (AD, N = 38), and Parkinson's disease (PD, N = 35) applying pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests and correction for multiple comparisons.SSM-PCA of FDG PET revealed an iNPHRP that is characterized by relative negative voxel weights at the vicinity of the lateral ventricles and relative positive weights in the paracentral midline region. The iNPHRP scores of patients with definite iNPH were substantially higher than in patients with AD and PD (both p < 0.05) and non-significantly higher than those of patients with possible iNPH. Subject scores of the iNPHRP discriminated definite iNPH from AD and PD with 96% and 100% accuracy and possible iNPH from AD and PD with 83% and 86% accuracy.We defined a novel metabolic spatial covariance pattern of iNPH that might facilitate the differential diagnosis of iNPH versus other neurodegenerative disorders. The knowledge of iNPH-associated alterations in the cerebral glucose metabolism is of high relevance as iNPH constitutes an important differential diagnosis to dementia and movement disorders.
