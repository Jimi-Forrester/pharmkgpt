39349103|t|The Mediterranean Diet: A Powerful Defense Against Alzheimer Disease-A Comprehensive Review.
39349103|a|Recent studies have explored the impact of lifestyle, particularly diet, on cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The Mediterranean diet has emerged as a potential safeguard, with observational studies indicating it might help defend against cognitive disorders. High adherence is linked with lower cognitive impairment risk, while low adherence elevates the risk for AD. Though these studies suggest connections between the Mediterranean diet and reduced cognitive decline or AD, they do not establish causality. Potential mechanisms might involve vascular factors, glucose/lipid metabolism, and anti-inflammatory effects. Specific Mediterranean diet components like vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, fish, and monounsaturated fats might contribute to cognitive benefits. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to ascertain the diet's influence on AD and cognitive health. Currently, the Mediterranean diet cannot be definitively named as a preventive strategy for AD due to insufficient evidence. More research is essential to identify key ingredients and processes that might have preventive effects on AD. In summary, while the Mediterranean diet shows promise against cognitive decline and AD, further research is needed.
