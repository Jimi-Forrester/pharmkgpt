32919611|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) likely plays a primary role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, but longitudinal Abeta, tau, and neurodegeneration (A/T/N) measurements in the same individuals have rarely been examined to verify the temporal dynamics of these biomarkers. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the temporal ordering of Abeta, tau, and neurodegeneration using longitudinal biomarkers in nondemented elderly individuals. A total of 395 cognitively unimpaired individuals and 204 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (320 [53%] were female) were classified into 8 A+-/T+-/N+- categories according to the abnormal (+)/normal (-) status of Abeta (18F-florbetapir or 18F-florbetaben) positron emission tomography (PET), 18F-flortaucipir PET, and adjusted hippocampal volume (aHCV). Follow-up Abeta PET, tau PET, and aHCV measurements at 0.6 to 4.1 years were available for 35% to 63% of the sample. Baseline Abeta, tau, and aHCV were compared between different A/T/N profiles. We investigated the associations of baseline and longitudinal Abeta, tau, and neurodegeneration in relation to one another continuously. RESULTS: Among T- participants, tau was higher for A+/T-/N- individuals compared with the A-/T-/N- group (p = .02). Among N- participants, neurodegeneration was worse among A+/T+/N- individuals compared with the A-/T-/N- group (p = .001). High baseline Abeta was associated (p < .001) with subsequent tau increase and high baseline tau was associated (p = .002) with subsequent aHCV decrease, whereas high tau and low aHCV at baseline were not associated with subsequent Abeta increase. CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a sequence of pathological events in Alzheimer's disease that support a current model of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in which Abeta appears early, followed by deposition of abnormal tau aggregates and subsequent neurodegeneration.
