35885916|t|Identification of Novel Circular RNAs of the Human Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) Gene, Expressed in Breast Cancer Cells.
35885916|a|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a type of RNA formed through back-splicing. In breast cancer, circRNAs are implicated in tumor onset and progression. Although histone methylation by PRMT1 is largely involved in breast cancer development and metastasis, the effect of circular transcripts deriving from this gene has not been examined. In this study, total RNA was extracted from four breast cancer cell lines and reversely transcribed using random hexamer primers. Next, first- and second-round PCRs were performed using gene-specific divergent primers. Sanger sequencing followed for the determination of the sequence of each novel PRMT1 circRNA. Lastly, bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict the functions of the novel circRNAs. In total, nine novel circRNAs were identified, comprising both complete and truncated exons of the PRMT1 gene. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the back-splice junctions consist of novel splice sites of the PRMT1 exons. Moreover, the circRNA expression pattern differed among these four breast cancer cell lines. All the novel circRNAs are predicted to act as miRNA and/or protein sponges, while five circRNAs also possess an open reading frame. In summary, we described the complete sequence of nine novel circRNAs of the PRMT1 gene, comprising distinct back-splice junctions and probably having different molecular properties.
