34893659|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one type of dementia, is a complex disease affecting people globally with limited drug treatment. Thus, natural products are currently of interest as promising candidates because of their cost-effectiveness and multi-target abilities. Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Sw., an edible fern, inhibited acetylcholinesterase in vitro, inferring that it might be a promising candidate for AD treatment by supporting cholinergic neurons. However, evidence demonstrating anti-AD properties of this edible plant via inhibiting of neurotoxic peptides production, amyloid beta (Abeta), both in vitro and in vivo is lacking. Thus, the anti-AD properties of D. esculentum extract both in vitro and in Drosophila models of Abeta-mediated toxicity were elucidated. Findings showed that an ethanolic extract exhibited high phenolics and flavonoids, contributing to antioxidant and inhibitory activities against AD-related enzymes. Notably, the extract acted as a BACE-1 blocker and reduced amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42) peptides in Drosophila models, resulting in improved locomotor behaviors. Information gained from this study suggested that D. esculentum showed potential for AD amelioration and prevention. Further investigations in vertebrates or humans are required to determine the effective doses of D. esculentum against AD, particularly via amyloidogenic pathway.
