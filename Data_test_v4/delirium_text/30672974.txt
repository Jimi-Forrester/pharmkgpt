30672974|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term, health-related quality of life of intensive care unit survivors by systematic review. METHODS: The search for, and selection and analysis of, observational studies that assessed the health-related quality of life of intensive care unit survivors in the electronic databases LILACS and MEDLINE  (accessed through PubMed) was performed using the indexed MESH terms "quality of life [MeSH Terms]" AND "critically illness [MeSH Terms]". Studies on adult patients without specific prior diseases published in English in the last 5 years were included in this systematic review. The citations were independently selected by three reviewers. Data were standardly and independently retrieved by two reviewers, and the quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: In total, 19 observational cohort and 2 case-control studies of 57,712 critically ill patients were included. The follow-up time of the studies ranged from 6 months to 6 years, and most studies had a 6-month or 1-year follow up. The health-related quality of life was assessed using two generic tools, the EuroQol and the Short Form Health Survey. The overall quality of the studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term, health-related quality of life is compromised among intensive care unit survivors compared with the corresponding general population. However, it is not significantly affected by the occurrence of sepsis, delirium, and acute kidney injury during intensive care unit admission when compared with that of critically ill patient control groups. High-quality studies are necessary to quantify the health-related quality of life among intensive care unit survivors.
