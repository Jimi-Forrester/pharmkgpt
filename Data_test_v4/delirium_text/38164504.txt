38164504|a|Neurodegenerative disorders encompass diseases that involve the degeneration of neurons, particularly those within the central nervous system. These are the most commonly observed disorders among the geriatric population. The treatment or management of this condition presents additional challenges due to therapeutics that may not be as effective as desired. The primary obstacle that often hinders the efficacy of therapy is the existence of a blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB serves as a vital safeguard for the brain, effectively obstructing the passage of drugs into the brain cells. Hence, the management of damaging neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), Huntington's disease (HD), and Multiple sclerosis (MS) is currently the primary area of research interest. The innovative utilization of nanoparticles as drug carriers provides renewed optimism in addressing many complicated medical conditions. In this article, I have aimed to gather published information regarding various lipid nanoparticles that can efficiently transport medication to the brain to address neurodegenerative disorders. According to the published literature, liposomes, solid-lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured nanoparticles, microemulsions, and nanoemulsions are potential nanocarriers that can treat neurodegenerative disorders.
