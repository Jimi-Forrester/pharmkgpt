34926030|t|Psychological and Clinical Predictors of COVID-19 Severity and Outcomes.
34926030|a|Objective The present study aimed to assess the psychological and clinical determinants of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their association with the disease severity and outcomes. Methods This prospective study was conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar-Pakistan. Admitted patients were screened for COVID-19 with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequently, 250 COVID positive patients were included in the final analysis. Data were obtained from the patient's medical chart; demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Psychological determinants, including anxiety and depression, were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The predictors of disease severity and outcomes (recovery vs. mortality) were also studied. Results A total of 250 patients were included in this study; out of which, 193 patients recovered from this deadly virus and 57 died. Based on psychological assessment, 58.4% of the enrolled COVID-19 patients had poor HADS scores. Most of the patients who died (70.2%) had severe symptoms (poor HADS scores). Similarly, 49.6% of the total cases were observed with poor HADS, and 50.9% of those who died had severe depression. Conclusion It is concluded from the study results that psychological distress is frequent in COVID-19 patients. Age, hypertension, fatigue, abnormal respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, ferritin, and poor HADS sore were determined as the significant predictors of COVID-19 severity and outcomes.
