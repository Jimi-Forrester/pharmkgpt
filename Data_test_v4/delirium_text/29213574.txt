29213574|t|Subclinical naming errors in mild cognitive impairment: A semantic deficit?
29213574|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impairments in semantic memory have been demonstrated to be a critical factor in early AD. The Boston Naming Test (BNT) is a straightforward method of examining semantic or visuo-perceptual processing and therefore represents a potential diagnostic tool. The objective of this study was to examine naming ability and identify error types in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Twenty aMCI patients, twenty AD patients and twenty-one normal controls, matched by age, sex and education level were evaluated. As part of a further neuropsychological evaluation, all subjects performed the BNT. A comprehensive classification of error types was devised in order to compare performance and ascertain semantic or perceptual origin of errors. RESULTS: AD patients obtained significantly lower total scores on the BNT than aMCI patients and controls. aMCI patients did not obtain significant differences in total scores, but showed significantly higher semantic errors compared to controls. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that semantic processing is impaired during confrontation naming in aMCI.
