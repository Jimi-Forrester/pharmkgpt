37384713|t|Readmission prediction after colorectal cancer surgery: A derivation and validation study.
37384713|a|BACKGROUND: Unplanned readmissions after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery are common, expensive, and result from failure to progress in postoperative recovery. The context of their preventability and extent of predictability remains undefined. This study aimed to define the 30-day unplanned readmission (UR) rate after CRC surgery, identify risk factors, and develop a prediction model with external validation. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent CRC surgery between 2012 and 2017 at Christchurch Hospital were retrospectively identified. The primary outcome was UR within 30 days after index discharge. Statistically significant risk factors were identified and incorporated into a predictive model. The model was then externally evaluated on a prospectively recruited dataset from 2018 to 2019. RESULTS: Of the 701 patients identified, 15.1% were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Stoma formation (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.59-3.81), any postoperative complications (PoCs) (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.48-3.52), high-grade PoCs (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.18-5.11), and rectal cancer (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.48-3.52) were statistically significant risk factors for UR. A clinical prediction model comprised of rectal cancer and high-grade PoCs predicted UR with an AUC of 0.64 and 0.62 on internal and external validation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: URs after CRC surgery are predictable and occur within 2 weeks of discharge. They are driven by PoCs, most of which are of low severity and develop after discharge. Atleast 16% of readmissions are preventable by management in an outpatient setting with appropriate surgical expertise. Targeted outpatient follow-up within two weeks of discharge is therefore the most effective transitional-care strategy for prevention.
