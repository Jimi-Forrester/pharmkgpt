38627688|t|Association between the circulating very long-chain saturated fatty acid and cognitive function in older adults: findings from the NHANES.
38627688|a|BACKGROUND: Age-related cognitive decline has a significant impact on the health and longevity of older adults. Circulating very long-chain saturated fatty acids (VLSFAs) may actively contribute to the improvement of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between arachidic acid (20:0), docosanoic acid (22:0), tricosanoic acid (23:0), and lignoceric acid (24:0) with cognitive function in older adults. METHODS: This study used a dataset derived from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A total of 806 adults (>= 60 years) were included who underwent comprehensive cognitive testing and plasma fatty acid measurements. Multivariable linear regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and interaction analyses were used to assess associations between VLSFAs and cognitive function. Partial Spearman' s correlation analysis was used to examine the correlations between VLSFAs and palmitic acid (16:0), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, systemic inflammatory markers, and dietary nutrients. RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression analysis, adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical conditions, and lifestyle factors, showed that 22:0 and 24:0 levels were positively associated with better global cognitive function (beta = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01, 0.73; beta = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.29, 1.2, respectively) as well as better CEARD-DR Z-score (beta = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.36, 1.3 and beta = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.63, 1.8, respectively). RCS analysis showed linear associations between higher 22:0 and 24:0 levels and better cognitive performance in both global cognitive function and CERAD-DR tests. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that higher levels of 22:0 and 24:0 are associated with better global cognitive function in older adults. 22:0 and 24:0 may be important biomarkers for recognizing cognitive impairment, and supplementation with specific VLSFAs (22:0 and 24:0) may be an important intervention to improve cognitive function. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms between VLSFAs and cognitive function.
