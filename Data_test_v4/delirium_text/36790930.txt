36790930|t|Actin-dependent astrocytic infiltration is a key step for axon defasciculation during remodeling.
36790930|a|Astrocytes are essential for synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity; however, their function during developmental neuronal remodeling is largely unknown. To identify astrocytic molecules required for axon pruning of mushroom body (MB) gamma neurons in Drosophila, we profiled astrocytes before (larva) and after (adult) remodeling. Focusing on genes enriched in larval astrocytes, we identified 12 astrocytic genes that are required for axon pruning, including the F-actin regulators Actin-related protein 2/3 complex, subunit 1 (Arpc1) and formin3 (form3). Interestingly, perturbing astrocytic actin dynamics does not affect their gross morphology, migration, or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) secretion. In contrast, actin dynamics is required for astrocyte infiltration into the axon bundle at the onset of pruning. Remarkably, decreasing axonal adhesion facilitates infiltration by Arpc1 knockdown (KD) astrocytes and promotes axon pruning. Conversely, increased axonal adhesion reduces lobe infiltration by wild-type (WT) astrocytes. Together, our findings suggest that actin-dependent astrocytic infiltration is a key step in axon pruning, thus promoting our understanding of neuron-glia interactions during remodeling.
