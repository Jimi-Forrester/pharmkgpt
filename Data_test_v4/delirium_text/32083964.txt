32083964|a|PURPOSE: Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be protective in AD, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of VEGF on mitochondrial function in models of AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adeno associated virus (AAV)-VEGF was injected into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Cognitive function was assessed in these mice with use of the Morris water maze (MWM) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in the hippocampus were also measured. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined in the SH-SY5Y cells treated with Abeta25-35 which served as a cell model of AD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate structural changes in mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were also recorded. Finally, we investigated the effects of VEGF upon mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) as determined both in vivo and in vitro with western blots. RESULTS: VEGF treated mice showed improvements in spatial learning and memory along with reduced Abeta levels. VEGF protected SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta25-35 induced neurotoxicity as demonstrated by increased cell viability and decreased ROS production. Associated with these effects were improvements in mitochondrial structure and function, and increased numbers of mitochondria resulting from stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF alleviates Abeta related patholoy in models of AD. In part, these beneficial effects of VEGF result from protection of mitochondria and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.
