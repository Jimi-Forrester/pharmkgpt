34439092|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of certain pre-operative parameters directly on the post-operative intensive care unit (ICU)-length of stay (LOS), in order to identify at-risk patients that are expected to need prolonged intensive care management post-operatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospectively, patients managed in an ICU after undergoing major oral and maxillofacial surgery were analyzed. Inclusion criteria entailed: age 18-90 years, major primary oral cancer surgery including tumor resection, neck dissection and microvascular free flap reconstruction, minimum operation time of 8 h. Exclusion criteria were: benign/borderline tumors, primary radiation, other defect reconstruction than microvascular, treatment at other centers. Separate parameters used within the clinical routine were set in correlation with ICU-LOS, by applying single testing calculations (t-tests, variance analysis, correlation coefficients, effect sizes) and a valid univariate linear regression model. The primary outcome of interest was ICU-LOS. RESULTS: This study included a homogenous cohort of 122 patients. Mean surgery time was 11.4 (+-2.2) h, mean ICU-LOS was 3.6 (+-2.6) days. Patients with pre-operative renal dysfunction (p < 0.001), peripheral vascular disease-PVD (p = 0.01), increasing heart failure-NYHA stage categories (p = 0.009) and higher-grade categories of post-operative complications (p = 0.023) were identified as at-risk patients for a significantly prolonged post-operative ICU-LOS. CONCLUSIONS: At-risk patients are prone to need a significantly longer ICU-LOS than others. These patients are those with pre-operative severe renal dysfunction, PVD and/or high NYHA stage categories. Confounding parameters that contribute to a prolonged ICU-LOS in combination with other variables were identified as higher age, prolonged operative time, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and intra-operatively transfused blood.
