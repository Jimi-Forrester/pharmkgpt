34108969|t|Integration of Immunome With Disease-Gene Network Reveals Common Cellular Mechanisms Between IMIDs and Drug Repurposing Strategies.
34108969|a|Objective: Development and progression of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) involve intricate dysregulation of the disease-associated genes (DAGs) and their expressing immune cells. Identifying the crucial disease-associated cells (DACs) in IMIDs has been challenging due to the underlying complex molecular mechanism. Methods: Using transcriptome profiles of 40 different immune cells, unsupervised machine learning, and disease-gene networks, we constructed the Disease-gene IMmune cell Expression (DIME) network and identified top DACs and DAGs of 12 phenotypically different IMIDs. We compared the DIME networks of IMIDs to identify common pathways between them. We used the common pathways and publicly available drug-gene network to identify promising drug repurposing targets. Results: We found CD4+Treg, CD4+Th1, and NK cells as top DACs in inflammatory arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA); neutrophils, granulocytes, and BDCA1+CD14+ cells in systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic scleroderma; ILC2, CD4+Th1, CD4+Treg, and NK cells in the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We identified lymphoid cells (CD4+Th1, CD4+Treg, and NK) and their associated pathways to be important in HLA-B27 type diseases (psoriasis, AS, and IBDs) and in primary-joint-inflammation-based inflammatory arthritis (AS and RA). Based on the common cellular mechanisms, we identified lifitegrast as a potential drug repurposing candidate for Crohn's disease and other IMIDs. Conclusions: Existing methods are inadequate in capturing the intricate involvement of the crucial genes and cell types essential to IMIDs. Our approach identified the key DACs, DAGs, common mechanisms between IMIDs, and proposed potential drug repurposing targets using the DIME network. To extend our method to other diseases, we built the DIME tool (https://bitbucket.org/systemsimmunology/dime/) to help scientists uncover the etiology of complex and rare diseases to further drug development by better-determining drug targets, thereby mitigating the risk of failure in late clinical development.
