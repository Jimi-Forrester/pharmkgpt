35411010|t|Clustering of Parkinson subtypes reveals strong influence of DRD2 polymorphism and gender.
35411010|a|Most classification approaches for idiopathic Parkinson's disease subtypes primarily focus on motor and non-motor symptoms. Besides these characteristics, other features, including gender or genetic polymorphism of dopamine receptors are potential factors influencing the disease's phenotype. By utilizing a kmeans-clustering algorithm we were able to identify three subgroups mainly characterized by gender, DRD2 Taq1A (rs1800497) polymorphism-associated with changes in dopamine signaling in the brain-and disease progression. A subsequent regression analysis of these subgroups further suggests an influence of their characteristics on the daily levodopa dosage, an indicator for medication response. These findings could promote further enhancements in individualized therapies for idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
