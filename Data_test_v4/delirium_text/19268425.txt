19268425|t|Mitochondria, calcium and cell death: a deadly triad in neurodegeneration.
19268425|a|Mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation is a tightly controlled process, in turn regulating functions as diverse as aerobic metabolism and induction of cell death. The link between Ca(2+) (dys)regulation, mitochondria and cellular derangement is particularly evident in neurodegenerative disorders, in which genetic models and environmental factors allowed to identify common traits in the pathogenic routes. We will here summarize: i) the current view of mechanisms and functions of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis, ii) the basic principles of organelle Ca(2+) transport, iii) the role of Ca(2+) in neuronal cell death, and iv) the new information on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, highlighting the role of Ca(2+) and mitochondria.
