39064831|t|Phytochemistry and Biological Profile of the Chinese Endemic Herb Genus Notopterygium.
39064831|a|Notopterygium, a plant genus belonging to the Apiaceae family, is utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for its medicinal properties. Specifically, the roots and rhizomes of these plants are employed in phytotherapy to alleviate inflammatory conditions and headaches. This review provides a concise overview of the existing information regarding the botanical description, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and molecular mechanisms of the two Notopterygium species: Notopterygium incisum and N. franchetii. More than 500 distinct compounds have been derived from these plants, with the root being the primary source. These components include volatile oils, coumarins, enynes, sesquiterpenes, organic acids and esters, flavonoids, and various other compounds. Research suggests that Notopterygium incisum and N. franchetii exhibit a diverse array of pharmacological effects, encompassing antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, anticoagulant, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties on various organs such as the brain, heart, digestive system, and respiratory system. Building activity screening models based on the pharmacological effects of Notopterygium species, as well as discovering and studying the pharmacological mechanisms of novel active ingredients, will constitute the primary development focus of Notopterygium medicinal research in the future.
