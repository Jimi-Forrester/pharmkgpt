39416235|a|Background: Various surgical procedures have employed microporous polysaccharide hemosphere (MPH) hemostatic agents. However, data regarding their effectiveness in preventing pocket hematomas (PHs) during the implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) among the Asian population are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential benefits of using MPH hemostatic agents during CIED implantations as a preventive measure against post-procedural PHs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center, observational study involving 255 consecutive Japanese patients who underwent CIED implantation between November 2017 and April 2021. We compared PH occurrences within 28 days after CIED implantation between patients who received MPH hemostatic agents (n = 145) and those who did not (n = 110). Results: PH development was observed in nine (6.2%) patients who received MPH hemostatic agents and in 13 (11.8%) patients without MPH hemostatic (p = .111). Kaplan-Meier analysis of PH development revealed no significant difference between the two groups (log-rank p = .102). However, utilizing MPH hemostatic agents among patients taking antithrombotic drugs, including antiplatelet medications, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin, significantly reduced PH incidence (log-rank p = .03). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that MPH hemostatic agent utilization independently correlated with a decreased PH risk (hazard ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.08-0.63, p = .004). Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the incorporation of MPH hemostatic agents into standard practice may benefit to mitigate PH risk during CIED implantations in patients on antithrombotic therapy. This simple and practical measure may be valuable, especially in high-risk patients, such as those taking antithrombotic medications.
