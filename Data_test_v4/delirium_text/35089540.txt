35089540|a|OBJECTIVE: Despite growing recognition of how curriculum modules can benefit child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) training, there are few standardized teaching resources for pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry (PCLP). A Special Interest Group (SIG) of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Physically Ill Child Committee (PICC) conducted a needs assessment to establish interest in, and availability of, a library of online, self-paced learning modules specific to PCLP. METHOD: An email needs assessment survey was distributed to the PICC listserv in the fall of 2019 with four core areas of inquiry: (1) clinical service description, (2) teaching barriers, (3) interest in curriculum resources, and (4) interest in evaluation resources. RESULTS: Respondents were representative of typical academic PCLP programs. The response rate was 28% (n = 39). Programs endorsed barriers to teaching including high service obligations and limited protected teaching time. All respondents indicated that they would utilize high-quality, online learning modules. Psychiatric complications of medical illness, catatonia, and delirium were identified as priority topics in the care of pediatric patients with comorbid medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: There are currently no published educational studies regarding the training needs for PCLP programs, even among tertiary care academic facilities. This training needs assessment is the first step in establishing a national PCLP training curriculum. New paradigms to develop standardized curriculum resources for PCLP are needed.
