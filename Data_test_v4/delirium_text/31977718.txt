31977718|a|We aimed to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer disease (AD). A total of 221 participants were divided into the following five groups: normal controls (NCs), SCD without memory concerns (SCD-0), SCD with memory concerns (SCD-1), MCI, and AD according to their cognitive status. Compared with NC, individuals with SCD-0, SCD-1, MCI, and AD had more sleep problems and reduced HRQOL. Participants with poor sleep quality had an increased risk of cognitive impairment compared with participants with good sleep quality. Within all five subgroups, individuals with poor sleep quality reported more difficulties in HRQOL than individuals with good sleep quality. Future studies employing a longitudinal design, larger samples, and objective evaluation tools are needed.
