35860313|t|Delta-Catenin as a Modulator of Rho GTPases in Neurons.
35860313|a|Small Rho GTPases are molecular switches that are involved in multiple processes including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. These GTPases are activated (turned on) and inactivated (turned off) through various upstream effector molecules to carry out many cellular functions. One such upstream modulator of small Rho GTPase activity is delta-catenin, which is a protein in the p120-catenin subfamily that is enriched in the central nervous system. Delta-catenin affects small GTPase activity to assist in the developmental formation of dendrites and dendritic spines and to maintain them once they mature. As the dendritic arbor and spine density are crucial for synapse formation and plasticity, delta-catenin's ability to modulate small Rho GTPases is necessary for proper learning and memory. Accordingly, the misregulation of delta-catenin and small Rho GTPases has been implicated in several neurological and non-neurological pathologies. While links between delta-catenin and small Rho GTPases have yet to be studied in many contexts, known associations include some cancers, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Cri-du-chat syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Drawing from established studies and recent discoveries, this review explores how delta-catenin modulates small Rho GTPase activity. Future studies will likely elucidate how PDZ proteins that bind delta-catenin further influence small Rho GTPases, how delta-catenin may affect small GTPase activity at adherens junctions when bound to N-cadherin, mechanisms behind delta-catenin's ability to modulate Rac1 and Cdc42, and delta-catenin's ability to modulate small Rho GTPases in the context of diseases, such as cancer and AD.
