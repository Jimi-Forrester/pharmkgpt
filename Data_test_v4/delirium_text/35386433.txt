35386433|t|A Brief Review of circRNA Biogenesis, Detection, and Function.
35386433|a|Circular RNA (circRNA) is a non-coding molecule produced through alternative splicing of one or more exons of a gene in the presence of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Its formation depends on complementary intron sequences on both sides of the circularized sequence. CircRNA functions as a sponge for miRNA, playing the role of the transcriptional regulator or potential biomarker. It has an impact on fetal growth and on synaptic facilitation in the brain. In this review, we illustrate biogenesis mechanisms, characteristics, and functions of cirRNAs. We also summarize methods using sequence feature and RNA next-generation sequencing data for circRNA prediction. Finally, we discuss the state of the research on circRNA in diseases, which will bring new contributions to future disease treatments.
