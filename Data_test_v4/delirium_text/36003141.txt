36003141|a|Neuropathologically, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and subsequent formation of the so-called Abeta plaques. Along with neuronal loss, previous studies report white matter anomalies and corpus callosum (CC) atrophy in AD patients. Notably, perturbations in the white matter can be observed years before expected disease onset, suggesting that early stages of disease progression play a role in AD-associated loss of myelin integrity. Through seed-induced deposition of Abeta, we are able to examine alterations of central nervous system (CNS) integrity during the initial stages of plaque formation. In this study, we investigate the impact of Abeta seeding in the CC utilizing various imaging techniques as well as quantitative gene expression analysis and demonstrate that Abeta deposits result in an imbalance of glial cells in the CC. We found increased amounts of phagocytic microglia and reactive astrocytes, while oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) numbers were reduced. Moreover, white matter aberrations adjacent to the Abeta seeding were observed together with an overall decline in callosal myelination. This data indicate that the initial stages of plaque formation induce oligodendrocyte dysfunction, which might ultimately lead to myelin loss.
