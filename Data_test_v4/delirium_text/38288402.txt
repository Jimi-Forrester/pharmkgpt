38288402|a|This paper systematically reviews the latest evidence regarding Quercetin's (Q) effect following exercise performance, aerobic and anaerobic exercise, muscle-damaging bouts and highlights blood biomarkers associated with muscle damage and recovery. Google Scholar, Web of Science, and MedLine (PubMed) searches were conducted through July-December 2021. Peer-reviewed studies that investigated Q as a single ingredient or in combination with other ingredients at dosages of 500 mg - 3000 mg, ranging from 15 min-to-1 h prior to exercise bout or chronic dose (7 days - 8 weeks) of consumption were included. A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Key results include significant performance improvements in the following: VO2max (n = 2), time to exhaustion (n = 4 articles), fatigue decrement (n = 1 article), muscle damage (n = 3 articles), strength, torque velocity, and neuromuscular performance (n = 3 articles), redox potential (n = 1 article), repeated sprint performance and oxygen extraction (n = 1). Q also caused a change in systemic biomarkers: decrease in creatine kinase (n = 2), c-reactive protein (n = 4), lactate dehydrogenase (n = 4), inflammatory markers (n = 3), lipid peroxidation (n = 3) in aerobic and anaerobic performance. Varied findings exist regarding the efficacy of Q supplementation on exercise performance and recovery outcomes. The source of Q, training status of subjects, and exercise protocol performed may contribute to the effectiveness of Q as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or ergogenic agent in exercise.
