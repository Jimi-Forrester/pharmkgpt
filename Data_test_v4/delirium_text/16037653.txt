16037653|a|Within the Cronos Project, 503 Alzheimer's disease units were activated throughout the country. In June/July 2002 a questionnaire was sent to all Alzheimer's disease units to collect data on neuropsychological tests utilised in the diagnostic process of dementias. Only 196 of Alzheimer's disease units that have responded to the questionnaire (196/392) declare to utilize neuropsychological test while 97.8% use the mini mental state examination. This paper aims to collect, for the first time in Italy, data on use of the neuropsychological tests in the specialist units on dementia and to propose a discussion on the reliability of neuropsychological instruments.
