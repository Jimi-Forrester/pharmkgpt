31453104|a|Fusobacterium nucleatum is a rod-shaped gram-negative obligate anaerobe; this organism, and other anaerobes, are usually not a part of the culture performed for a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. To date, four cases of Fusobacterium meningitis in adults have been published. We report successful treatment of a case of primary meningitis due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in an otherwise healthy 72-year-old male.
