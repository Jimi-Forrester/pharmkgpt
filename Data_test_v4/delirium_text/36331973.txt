36331973|a|BACKGROUND: There is variability in intensive care unit (ICU) resources and staffing worldwide. This may reflect variation in practice and outcomes across all health systems. AIM: To improve research and quality improvement measures administrative leaders can create long-term strategies by understanding the nature of ICU practices on a global scale. METHODS: The Global ICU Needs Assessment Research Group was formed on the basis of diversified skill sets. We aimed to survey sites regarding ICU type, availability of staffing, and adherence to critical care protocols. An international survey 'Global ICU Needs Assessment' was created using Google Forms, and this was distributed from February 17th, 2020 till September 23rd, 2020. The survey was shared with ICU providers in 34 countries. Various approaches to motivating healthcare providers were implemented in securing submissions, including use of emails, phone calls, social media applications, and WhatsApp . By completing this survey, providers gave their consent for research purposes. This study was deemed eligible for category-2 Institutional Review Board exempt status. RESULTS: There were a total 121 adult/adult-pediatrics ICU responses from 34 countries in 76 cities. A majority of the ICUs were mixed medical-surgical [92 (76%)]. 108 (89%) were adult-only ICUs. Total 36 respondents (29.8%) were 31-40 years of age, with 79 (65%) male and 41 (35%) female participants. 89 were consultants (74%). A total of 71 (59%) respondents reported having a 24-h in-house intensivist. A total of 87 (72%) ICUs were reported to have either a 2:1 or >= 2:1 patient/nurse ratio. About 44% of the ICUs were open and 76% were mixed type (medical-surgical). Protocols followed regularly by the ICUs included sepsis care (82%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (79%); nutrition (76%), deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (84%), stress ulcer prophylaxis (84%), and glycemic control (89%). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this international, multi-dimensional, needs-assessment survey, there is a need for increased recruitment and staffing in critical care facilities, along with improved patient-to-nurse ratios. Future research is warranted in this field with focus on implementing appropriate health standards, protocols and resources for optimal efficiency in critical care worldwide.
