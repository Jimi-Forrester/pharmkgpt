38859553|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis constitutes a condition that involves life-threatening organ dysfunction induced by severe infection. This nested case-control study investigated risk factors for severe sepsis and whether antipsychotic use is associated with severe sepsis risk in patients with schizophrenia, a topic that has not been comprehensively explored in previous studies. METHODS: We selected 39,432 patients with schizophrenia aged between 15 and 65 years from Taiwan's Psychiatric Inpatient Medical Claims database for the period 2000-2012. The case group comprised patients with severe sepsis after their first psychiatric admission (n = 1382). The case and control groups were randomly matched (1:4) by age, sex and first psychiatric admission (year) and finally comprised 1382 and 5528 individuals, respectively. We employed multivariable conditional logistic regression to identify (1) risk factors (physical illnesses and nonpsychiatric medications) and (2) antipsychotic-severe sepsis associations. RESULTS: Higher numbers of psychiatric admissions and physical illnesses such as delirium, cerebrovascular disease and cancer were significantly associated with a higher risk of severe sepsis. Furthermore, severe sepsis was associated with the use of antithrombotic agents, systemic corticosteroids and agents targeting the renin-angiotensin system. Clozapine (adjusted risk ratio = 1.65) and quetiapine (adjusted risk ratio = 1.59) use were associated with an increased risk of severe sepsis. The use of more than one antipsychotic drug could further increase this risk. CONCLUSION: Several physical illnesses and nonpsychiatric medications increase the risk of severe sepsis in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, clozapine or quetiapine use significantly increased the risk of severe sepsis in these patients.
