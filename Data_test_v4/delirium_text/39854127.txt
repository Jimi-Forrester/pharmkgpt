39854127|t|Dose-response analysis of music intervention for improving delirium in intensive care unit patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
39854127|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and severe condition among adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Music intervention, as a non-pharmacological approach, has the potential to reduce delirium, but the optimal dosage and type of intervention remain unclear. AIM: To explore the effects of music intervention at different doses and types on reducing delirium in ICU patients. STUDY DESIGN: This study was conducted as a systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including Cochrane Library, EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Airiti Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data were searched until 29 February 2024. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 criteria. Data were analysed using RevMan 5.4.1 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 1434 ICU patients were included. Four studies were of good quality (low risk of bias), seven were of moderate quality (unclear risk) and three were of low quality (high risk). Pooled analysis showed that music interventions significantly reduced the risk of delirium (12 studies, RR = .49, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.40, .61]). Slow-tempo music had the strongest effect (11 studies, RR = .46, 95% CI [.37, .57]). The optimal intervention dosage involves conducting music interventions twice daily (12 studies, RR = .46, 95% CI [.34, .63]), with each session lasting 30 min (12 studies, RR = .41, 95% CI [.30, .55]). Additionally, a pooled analysis showed that a 7-day music intervention (6 studies, RR = .43, 95% CI [.26, .71]) was the most effective in reducing the risk of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Music intervention reduces delirium in ICU patients, especially with two 30-min sessions daily for 7 days. However, the certainty of evidence is low, highlighting the need for further high-quality research. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Music intervention is a simple, non-invasive method that may help reduce delirium in ICU patients. However, given the low certainty of the current evidence, it should be used cautiously, and further research is needed to validate its effectiveness before routine implementation.
