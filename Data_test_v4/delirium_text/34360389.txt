34360389|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and depression are common and frequently misdiagnosed in older adults in primary care. In particular, depression combined with cognitive dysfunction is associated with a higher risk of dementia. We tried to find the usefulness of orientation to time as an easy case-finding tool for suspecting MCI or depression. This cross-sectional study included 2668 community-dwelling adults aged 70-84 years from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (mean age of 76.0 +- 3.9 years). MCI was defined based on the criteria from the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association; depression was defined as a score of >=6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF). Time orientation to year, month, day of the week, date, and season were tested. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of each of MCI and depression was the highest for the orientation to year (MCI, 17.7%; depression, 16.0%). For the diagnosis of MCI or depression, orientation to the year had the highest sensitivity (15.5%), and the specificity, PPV, NPV was 95.5%, 67.0%, 65.5%. In conclusion, asking "what year is it?" can be helpful as an aid to case finding to suspect MCI or depression in community and primary care settings.
