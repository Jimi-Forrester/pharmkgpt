16106382|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is the major component of senile plaques, the pathological hallmark of the neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the effect of Toki-shakuyaku-san (TSS), a traditional medicine, on Abeta25-35-induced neuronal death and lipid peroxidation assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), respectively. Abeta25-35 at 10 microM induced neuronal damage and increased the LDH and MDA. TSS at concentrations of 100 and 300 microg/mL significantly reduced the Abeta25-35-induced neuronal death and the lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that TSS has a protective effect against Abeta25-35-induced neuronal damage. TSS may be beneficial for the treatment of AD.
