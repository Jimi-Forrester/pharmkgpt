31520071|t|pLG72 levels increase in early phase of Alzheimer's disease but decrease in late phase.
31520071|a|pLG72, named as D-amino acid oxidase activator (although it is not an activator of D-amino acid oxidase demonstrated by later studies), in mitochondria has been regarded as an important modulator of D-amino acid oxidase that can regulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Both oxidative stress in mitochondria and NMDAR neurotransmission play essential roles in the process of neurodegenerative dementia. The aim of the study was to investigate whether pLG72 levels changed with the severity of neurodegenerative dementia. We enrolled 376 individuals as the overall cohort, consisting of five groups: healthy elderly, amnestic mild cognitive impairment [MCI], mild Alzheimer's disease [AD], moderate AD, and severe AD. pLG72 levels in plasma were measured using Western blotting. The severity of cognitive deficit was principally evaluated by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. A gender- and age- matched cohort was selected to elucidate the effects of gender and age. pLG72 levels increased in the MCI and mild AD groups when compared to the healthy group. However, pLG72 levels in the moderate and severe AD groups were lower than those in the mild AD group. D-serine level and D- to total serine ratio were significantly different among the five groups. L-serine levels were correlated with the pLG72 levels. The results in the gender- and age- matched cohort were similar to those of the overall cohort. The finding supports the hypothesis of NMDAR hypofunction in early-phase dementia and NMDAR hyperfunction in late-phase dementia. Further studies are warranted to test whether pLG72 could reflect the function of NMDAR.
