38082283|a|BACKGROUND: Sweet-type Star fruit (SF) (Averrhoa carambola L.) is seasonal and more available for purchase in many markets in Thailand, when compared to the sour-type. But, its antioxidant activity results and potentially more modified supplement for elderly health during regular exercise in the community are unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity and physical capacity from supplementation of sweet-type SF among elderly people performing home walking exercise. METHODS: Mixing SF juice with honey industrially prepared the SF product. Its effects on oxidative stress status and physical capacity were studied in four groups; a supplement with walking exercise (n = 11, 67.00 +- 4.17 years), control (n = 12, aged 67.50 +- 5.58 years), supplementation (n = 11, aged 69.63 +- 7.14 years), and walking exercise (n = 12, aged 67.91 +- 4.33 years). Twenty grams or two teaspoons of supplement in warm water (150 mL) was the guideline for consumption twice daily for 4 weeks. In contrast, the walking exercise was prescribed with moderate intensity for 30 min, 3 days per week. Before and after the 4-week period, the oxidative stress status; glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (Vit C), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) were evaluated. RESULTS: Results after the 4-week period, showed that Vit C and TAC increased and the MDA decreased significantly in the supplementation group, except the GSH and 6MWD results. The GSH and Vit C slightly decreased in the walking exercise group, whereas, its TAC, MDA and 6MWD increased significantly. Finally, The GSH and Vit C did not decrease and MDA slightly decreased in the combined group, but, their TAC and 6MWD increased significantly. CONCLUSION: Supplementation of the SF product during walking exercise possibly controls oxidative stress status and may enhance walking capacity.
