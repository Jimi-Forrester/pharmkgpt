36299268|t|Design and implementation of a Stroke Rehabilitation Registry for the systematic assessment of processes and outcomes and the development of data-driven prediction models: The STRATEGY study protocol.
36299268|a|Background: Stroke represents the second preventable cause of death after cardiovascular disease and the third global cause of disability. In countries where national registries of the clinical quality of stroke care have been established, the publication and sharing of the collected data have led to an improvement in the quality of care and survival of patients. However, information on rehabilitation processes and outcomes is often lacking, and predictors of functional outcomes remain poorly explored. This paper describes a multicenter study protocol to implement a Stroke rehabilitation Registry, mainly based on a multidimensional assessment proposed by the Italian Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PMIC2020), in a pilot Italian cohort of stroke survivors undergoing post-acute inpatient rehabilitation, to provide a systematic assessment of processes and outcomes and develop data-driven prediction models of functional outcomes. Methods: All patients with a diagnosis of ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke confirmed by clinical assessment, admitted to intensive rehabilitation units within 30 days from the acute event, aged 18+, and providing informed consent will be enrolled. Measures will be taken at admission (T0), at discharge (T1), and at follow-up, 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) after the stroke. Assessment variables include anamnestic data, clinical and nursing complexity information and measures of body structures and function, activity and participation (PMIC2020), rehabilitation interventions, adverse events and discharge data. The modified Barthel Index will be our primary outcome. In addition to classical biostatistical analysis, learning algorithms will be cross-validated to achieve data-driven prognosis prediction models. Conclusions: This study will test the feasibility of a stroke rehabilitation registry in the Italian health context and provide a systematic assessment of processes and outcomes for quality assessment and benchmarking. By the development of data-driven prediction models in stroke rehabilitation, this study will pave the way for the development of decision support tools for patient-oriented therapy planning and rehabilitation outcomes maximization. Clinical tial registration: The registration on ClinicalTrials.gov is ongoing and under review. The identification number will be provided when the review process will be completed.
