37299129|t|Potential of Halophytes as Sustainable Fodder Production by Using Saline Resources: A Review of Current Knowledge and Future Directions.
37299129|a|Good quality water and arable land are required for both domestic and agricultural uses. Increasing population leads to urbanization and industrialization increasing the need to share these resources and creating threats to the food supply. Higher meat consumption requires mitigation strategies to protect food and mitigate economic crises, especially in developing nations. The production of food crops for energy purposes and lower yield due to climate change increase food prices as well as have a negative impact on the economy. Thus, an alternative food source is required featuring high forage components to reduce grazing periods and to prevent rangeland degradation. Halophytes can tolerate high salinity and can be easily grown for fodder in coastal areas where fodder is a problem. Varied climate conditions offer opportunities to grow suitable halophytes for specific purposes. One important feature is their use as fodder. To reduce food shortages, saline areas could be used to grow nutritive and productive halophytic forage. Wild plants have undesirable metabolites produced in harsh conditions which may be harmful for ruminant health. Halophytes have moderate amounts of these metabolites which are nontoxic. Halophytes can be grown without intruding on agricultural lands and freshwater resources and could promote livestock production which may improve the socio-economic conditions of poor farmers in a sustainable and ecofriendly manner.
