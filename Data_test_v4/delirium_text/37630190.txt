37630190|t|Utilizing Proteomic Approaches to Uncover the Neuroprotective Effects of ACE Inhibitors: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
37630190|a|Two types of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, lisinopril and benazepril HCl, were tested in neuroblastoma cells and found to upregulate low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B) and 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta. Additionally, benazepril HCl was found to increase the expression of calreticulin. The upregulation of these proteins by ACE inhibitors may contribute to the amelioration of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease/dementia, as well as the clinically observed deceleration of functional decline in Alzheimer's patients. This discovery suggests that the supplementation of ACE inhibitors may promote neuronal cell survival independently of their antihypertensive effect. Overall, these findings indicate that ACE inhibitors may be a promising avenue for developing effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
