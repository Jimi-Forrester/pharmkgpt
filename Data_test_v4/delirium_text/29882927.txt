29882927|t|Comparison of Three Extraction Approaches for the Isolation of Neurotransmitters from Rat Brain Samples.
29882927|a|The determination of neurotransmitters (NTs) as relevant potential biomarkers in the study of various central nervous system (CNS) pathologies has been demonstrated. Knowing that NTs-related diseases mostly occupy individual regions of the nervous system, as observed, for instance, in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases), the analysis of brain slices is preferred to whole-brain analysis. In this report, we present sample preparation approaches, such as solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, and discuss the pitfalls and advantages of each extraction method. The ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate)-assisted solid-phase microextraction (IL-SPME) is found to be, in our research, the relevant step towards the simultaneous determination of six NTs, namely, dopamine (DA), adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT), l-tryptophan (l-Trp), l-tyrosine (l-Tyr) in rat brain samples. The development of a novel bioanalytical technique for the evaluation of biomarkers in the context of green chemistry might be accelerated just with the use of IL, and this approach can be considered an advantageous strategy.
