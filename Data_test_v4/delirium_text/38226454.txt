38226454|t|Association Between Preoperative Long-Term Poor Sleep Quality and Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Multi-Center Observational Study.
38226454|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in elderly patients after cardiac surgery, and sleep disorders have been suggested as a potential risk factor. However, few studies have explored the link between long-term preoperative poor sleep quality and postoperative delirium (POD) in this population. This study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative sleep quality and POD in elderly cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: The study enrolled 194 patients aged 60 years or older who underwent cardiac surgery. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) objectively assessed preoperative sleep quality, while the Confusion Assessment Method screened for POD. The measurable outcomes encompassed the identification of risk factors associated with POD, while the secondary outcomes focused on factors influencing levels of consciousness. The statistical analysis is logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients with POD had a higher prevalence of preoperative sleep disorders and higher PSQI scores than those without delirium (12.9 +- 5.1 vs 7.8 +- 3.4, P = .007). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the number of months with high PSQI scores and age were significantly associated with POD. The predictive ability of the number of months with high PSQI scores for POD was .762 (95% CI: .671-.854). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that preoperative sleep disorder was a significant predictor of exacerbation of POD (P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that long-term poor preoperative sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, is associated with an increased risk of POD in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
