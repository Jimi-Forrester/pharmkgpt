39391442|a|Professor Klaus Fassbender is a distinguished neurologist from Germany, widely recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to the fields of neurology and neurodegenerative disease. His work has been pivotal in advancing our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as in refining therapeutic strategies for their treatment. His studies in cerebrovascular disease have elucidated the complex molecular and cellular processes involved in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, leading to the development of novel therapeutic interventions, often bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and their application in clinical settings. Professor Klaus Fassbender is "the father" of the mobile stroke unit (MSU). With the "time is brain" concept in mind, he proposed and developed the MSU concept for the first time, allowing prehospital stroke imaging, diagnosis, and treatment directly at the site of emergency. This concept reduced times between symptoms onset and treatment, resulting in an increased proportion of patients receiving treatment within "the golden hour" and leading to the improvement of functional outcomes at 90 days. Professor Fassbender's work has been instrumental in shaping contemporary approaches to diagnosing and managing stroke and neurodegenerative disease, making him a leading figure in modern neurology.
