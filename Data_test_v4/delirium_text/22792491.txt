22792491|t|Consequences of inhibiting amyloid precursor protein processing enzymes on synaptic function and plasticity.
22792491|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, one of whose major pathological hallmarks is the accumulation of amyloid plaques comprised of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. It is now recognized that soluble Abeta oligomers may lead to synaptic dysfunctions early in AD pathology preceding plaque deposition. Abeta is produced by a sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the activity of beta- and gamma-secretases, which have been identified as major candidate therapeutic targets of AD. This paper focuses on how Abeta alters synaptic function and the functional consequences of inhibiting the activity of the two secretases responsible for Abeta generation. Abnormalities in synaptic function resulting from the absence or inhibition of the Abeta-producing enzymes suggest that Abeta itself may have normal physiological functions which are disrupted by abnormal accumulation of Abeta during AD pathology. This interpretation suggests that AD therapeutics targeting the beta- and gamma-secretases should be developed to restore normal levels of Abeta or combined with measures to circumvent the associated synaptic dysfunction(s) in order to have minimal impact on normal synaptic function.
