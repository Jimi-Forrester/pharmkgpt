37335551|t|An Early and Unequal Decline: Life Course Trajectories of Cognitive Aging in the United States.
37335551|a|OBJECTIVES: Cognitive aging is a lifelong process with implications for Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This study aims to fill major gaps in research on the natural history of and social disparities in aging-related cognitive decline over the life span. METHODS: We conducted integrative data analysis of four large U.S. population-based longitudinal studies of individuals aged 12 to 105 followed over two decades and modeled age trajectories of cognitive function in multiple domains. RESULTS: We found evidence for the onset of cognitive decline in the 4th decade of life, varying gender differences with age, and persistent disadvantage among non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and those without college education. We further found improvement in cognitive function across 20th century birth cohorts but widening social inequalities in more recent cohorts. DISCUSSION: These findings advance an understanding of early life origins of dementia risk and invite future research on strategies for promoting cognitive health for all Americans.
