35745992|t|Photo-Responsive Micelles with Controllable and Co-Release of Carbon Monoxide, Formaldehyde and Doxorubicin.
35745992|a|Endogenous gases have attracted much attention due to their potent applications in disease therapies. The combined therapy, including gaseous molecules and other medicines that can create synergistic effects, is a new way for future treatment. However, due to the gaseous state, gas utilization in medical service is still limited. To pave the way for future usage, in this work, an amphiphilic block copolymer containing nitrobenzyl ether, 3-hydroxyflavone (3-HF) derivatives and ether linker was constructed. The nitrobenzyl ether group endows the polymer with a photo-responsive character. Upon light illumination, 3-HF derivatives can be triggered for carbon monoxide (CO) release. The ether linker can also be released emitting formaldehyde (FA). The self-assembly induced micelle can encompass medicine, e.g., doxorubicin (DOX), into it and a controlled release of DOX can be realized upon light illumination. As far as we know, there is no report on the combination donor of CO and DOX and this is the first attempt on the co-release of CO, FA and DOX.
