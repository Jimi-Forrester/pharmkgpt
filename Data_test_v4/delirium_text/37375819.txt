37375819|t|Actinomycetes as Producers of Biologically Active Terpenoids: Current Trends and Patents.
37375819|a|Terpenes and their derivatives (terpenoids and meroterpenoids, in particular) constitute the largest class of natural compounds, which have valuable biological activities and are promising therapeutic agents. The present review assesses the biosynthetic capabilities of actinomycetes to produce various terpene derivatives; reports the main methodological approaches to searching for new terpenes and their derivatives; identifies the most active terpene producers among actinomycetes; and describes the chemical diversity and biological properties of the obtained compounds. Among terpene derivatives isolated from actinomycetes, compounds with pronounced antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and other effects were determined. Actinomycete-produced terpenoids and meroterpenoids with high antimicrobial activity are of interest as a source of novel antibiotics effective against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Most of the discovered terpene derivatives are produced by the genus Streptomyces; however, recent publications have reported terpene biosynthesis by members of the genera Actinomadura, Allokutzneria, Amycolatopsis, Kitasatosporia, Micromonospora, Nocardiopsis, Salinispora, Verrucosispora, etc. It should be noted that the use of genetically modified actinomycetes is an effective tool for studying and regulating terpenes, as well as increasing productivity of terpene biosynthesis in comparison with native producers. The review includes research articles on terpene biosynthesis by Actinomycetes between 2000 and 2022, and a patent analysis in this area shows current trends and actual research directions in this field.
