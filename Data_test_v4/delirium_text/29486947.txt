29486947|a|INTRODUCTION: The incidence of clinical complications in hip fracture (HF) patients is high and variable due to their heterogeneous nature. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical complications and their associated factors in HF patients admitted to the Orthopaedic Geriatric Unit of a 283 bed University Hospital. An average of 200 HF patients is attended yearly. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, observational and analytical study was conducted on 383 consecutive patients admitted to the unit during the years 2013 and 2014. Clinical complications were defined according to recommendations supported by the AOTrauma Network (International Network of Traumatologists for the Study of Osteosynthesis). RESULTS: A total of 273 patients (71.28%) showed some clinical complication. The main ones were, delirium (55.4%), renal failure (15.4%), and cardiac complications (12.3%). An ASA III-IV score of OR = 1.962 (95% CI; 1.040-3.704, P=.038), lower Barthel index at discharge (b = -3.572, 95% CI -0.866 to -0.104, P=.01), the increase in pre-operative stay (OR = 1.165, 95% CI 1.050-1.294, P=.004) and an increased length of stay (b = 2.663, 95% CI 3.522-0.325; P<.001) were factors associated with clinical complications. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium, renal failure, and cardiac complications were the most frequent complications according the new recommendations. An ASA III-IV score, worse functional status at discharge, prolonged pre-operative period, and increased length of stay, were risk factors associated with clinical complications. Cardiac, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications were the main causes of mortality in the unit.
