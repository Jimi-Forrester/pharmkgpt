34638578|t|Emerging Roles of Astrocyte Kir4.1 Channels in the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Brain Diseases.
34638578|a|Inwardly rectifying Kir4.1 channels in astrocytes mediate spatial potassium (K+) buffering, a clearance mechanism for excessive extracellular K+, in tripartite synapses. In addition to K+ homeostasis, astrocytic Kir4.1 channels also play an essential role in regulating extracellular glutamate levels via coupling with glutamate transporters. Moreover, Kir4.1 channels act as novel modulators of the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in astrocytes. Specifically, inhibition of astrocytic Kir4.1 channels elevates extracellular K+ and glutamate levels at synapses and facilitates BDNF expression in astrocytes. These changes elevate neural excitability, which may facilitate synaptic plasticity and connectivity. In this article, we summarize the functions and pharmacological features of Kir4.1 channels in astrocytes and highlight the importance of these channels in the treatment of brain diseases. Although further validation in animal models and human patients is required, astrocytic Kir4.1 channel could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders and epilepsy.
