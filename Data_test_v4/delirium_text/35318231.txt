35318231|t|Does difficulty in chewing induce subjective musculoskeletal symptoms? A case-control study.
35318231|a|OBJECTIVES: Risk factors associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorders and symptoms remain an important issue worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between oral health problems such as difficulty chewing and the occurrence of stiff neck/shoulders (SN/S) and low back pain (LBP). DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2020. The subjects were 77 341 workers among 646 281 workers from several employers in Japan. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were asked to evaluate their subjective SN/S and LBP symptoms using a self-administered questionnaire. METHODS: We defined the chewing condition using a questionnaire, and workers who responded with 'I can chew anything' were classified as the good condition group (GCG), and those who responded with 'Sometimes I have difficulty chewing due to problems with the teeth, gums, or bite' or 'I can hardly chew' were classified as the poor condition group (PCG). Setting the year 2018 as the baseline, we performed a logistic regression model using propensity score and inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods and chewing condition groups as explanatory variables and SN/S and LBP as objective variables. RESULTS: The IPW-adjusted logistic regression model showed that the OR of SN/S was approximately 1.25 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.33) times higher in the PCG than that in the GCG (p<0.001). Similarly, the OR of LBP was about 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48) times higher in the PCG than that in the GCG in the IPW-adjusted logistic regression model (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the occurrence of SN/S and LBP symptoms in workers could be predicted depending on the presence of difficulty in chewing. Therefore, oral health and health guidance are gaining importance for the prevention of subjective musculoskeletal symptoms.
