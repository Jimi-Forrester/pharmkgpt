29276990|a|This study examined the effects of bright light therapy (BLT) on the incidence of delirium in post-operative patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and delineates risk and protective factors. We included 62 patients in a single-blind, randomized controlled study. The intervention group was treated with care as usual plus BLT for three consecutive days. Delirium was diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria with the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Risk factors for delirium were measured, including the APACHE II score, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), as well as hematocrit and bicarbonate levels. Results were adjusted for treatment with nasal cannula oxygen and medications. Thirteen patients developed delirium within the three days following surgery. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed a significant preventive effect of BLT on delirium, which was independent of risk or treatment factors. Higher APACHE-II and ISI scores, lower hematocrit and lower bicarbonate levels increased the risk of developing delirium. BLT plus nasal cannula oxygen significantly reduced the likelihood of delirium. BLT significantly lowered ISI scores, while nasal cannula oxygen significantly enhanced bicarbonate levels. The results indicate that BLT and supplementary oxygen therapy may protect against delirium by targeting sleep-wake and deficits in the bicarbonate buffer system.
