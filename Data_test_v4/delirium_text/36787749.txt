36787749|a|Social experience is essential for the development and maintenance of higher-order brain function. Social deprivation results in a host of cognitive deficits, and cellular studies have largely focused on associated neuronal dysregulation; how astrocyte function is impacted by social deprivation is unknown. Here, we show that hippocampal astrocytes from juvenile mice subjected to social isolation exhibit increased Ca2+ activity and global changes in gene expression. We found that the Ca2+ channel TRPA1 is upregulated in astrocytes after social deprivation and astrocyte-specific deletion of TRPA1 reverses the physiological and cognitive deficits associated with social deprivation. Mechanistically, TRPA1 inhibition of hippocampal circuits is mediated by a parallel increase of astrocytic production and release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA after social deprivation. Collectively, our studies reveal how astrocyte function is tuned to social experience and identifies a social-context-specific mechanism by which astrocytic TRPA1 and GABA coordinately suppress hippocampal circuit function.
