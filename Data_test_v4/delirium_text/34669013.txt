34669013|a|Systemic effects of advanced cancer impact on the heart leading to cardiac atrophy and functional impairment. Using a murine melanoma cancer model (B16F10 melanoma cells stably transduced with a Ganciclovir (GCV)-inducible suicide gene), the present study analysed the recovery potential of cancer-induced cardiomyopathy with or without use of doxorubicin (Dox). After Dox-free tumor elimination and recovery for 70 +- 5 days, cancer-induced morphologic, functional, metabolic and molecular changes were largely reversible in mice previously bearing tumors. Moreover, grip strength and cardiac response to angiotensin II-induced high blood pressure were comparable with healthy control mice. In turn, addition of Dox (12 mg/kg BW) to melanoma-bearing mice reduced survival in the acute phase compared to GCV-alone induced recovery, while long-term effects on cardiac morphologic and functional recovery were similar. However, Dox treatment was associated with permanent changes in the cardiac gene expression pattern, especially the circadian rhythm pathway associated with the DNA damage repair system. Thus, the heart can recover from cancer-induced damage after chemotherapy-free tumor elimination. In contrast, treatment with the cardiotoxic drug Dox induces, besides well-known adverse acute effects, long-term subclinical changes in the heart, especially of circadian clock genes. Since the circadian clock is known to impact on cardiac repair mechanisms, these changes may render the heart more sensitive to additional stress during lifetime, which, at least in part, could contribute to late cardiac toxicity.
