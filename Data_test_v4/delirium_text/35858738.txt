35858738|a|Although novel immunotherapy has shown promise for patients with melanoma, a more activated state of the immune system may lead to adverse systemic effects. Immunotherapy-induced meningoencephalitis is a rare and seldom reported adverse effect of immunotherapy but with the expanding role of immunotherapy in cancer treatments it must be recognised. Patients receiving immunotherapy should receive a proper warning about the potential for this life-threatening condition. Herein, we report a patient in his 70s with neurological changes after his second treatment with dual immunotherapy for a primary metastatic melanoma of the bladder neck.
