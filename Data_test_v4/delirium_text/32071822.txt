32071822|t|RNA-sequencing analysis of the effect of luteolin on methamphetamine-induced hepatotoxicity in rats: a preliminary study.
32071822|a|In this study, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized to investigate the effects of luteolin on hepatotoxicity caused by methamphetamine (METH). The rats in METH group were administrated with METH (15 mg/kg, two times per day) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections for four consecutive days. The rats in luteolin + METH group were firstly administrated with luteolin (100 mg/kg, once a day) by oral gavage for 3 days before METH treatment. Lueolin attenuated the hepatotoxicity induced by METH via histopathological and biochemical analysis. The results of RNA-seq showed that luteolin could regulate 497 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the selected DEGs were mainly enriched in eight pathways, according to KEGG analysis. Furthermore, qRT-PCR was utilized to verify the results of RNA-seq. Six genes were selected as follows: liver enriched antimicrobial peptide 2 (Leap2), fatty acid synthase (Fasn), fatty acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5), patatin like phospholipase domain containing 3 (Pnpla3), myelin basic protein (Mbp) and calmodulin 3 (Calm3). Though because of the design flaws, the luteolin group has not been included, this study demonstrated that luteolin might exert hepato-protective effects from METH via modulation of oxidative phosphorylation, cytochrome P450 and certain signaling pathways.
