37633929|t|Mass spectrometry-based proteomics as an emerging tool in clinical laboratories.
37633929|a|Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics have been increasingly implemented in various disciplines of laboratory medicine to identify and quantify biomolecules in a variety of biological specimens. MS-based proteomics is continuously expanding and widely applied in biomarker discovery for early detection, prognosis and markers for treatment response prediction and monitoring. Furthermore, making these advanced tests more accessible and affordable will have the greatest healthcare benefit.This review article highlights the new paradigms MS-based clinical proteomics has created in microbiology laboratories, cancer research and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. The technique is preferred over conventional methods in disease detection and therapy monitoring for its combined advantages in multiplexing capacity, remarkable analytical specificity and sensitivity and low turnaround time.Despite the achievements in the development and adoption of a number of MS-based clinical proteomics practices, more are expected to undergo transition from bench to bedside in the near future. The review provides insights from early trials and recent progresses (mainly covering literature from the NCBI database) in the application of proteomics in clinical laboratories.
