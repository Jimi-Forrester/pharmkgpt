35620787|a|Objective: In order to analyze the clinical characteristics of epileptic seizures in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during treatment. Methods: The clinical and imaging data of children diagnosed as ALL with epilepsy seizures from January 2013 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 2217 children with ALL were admitted during the study, of whom 229 (10.33%) had epileptic seizures after ALL treatment. Among them, 45 (19.65%) were in the high-risk group and 184 (80.35%) were in the low-risk group. Epileptic seizures mainly occurred in the induction remission period (24.02%), maintenance treatment period (25.33%) and after bone marrow transplantation (21.40%). The common causes were MTX-related demyelinating encephalopathy (34.06%) and reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (25.3%). The first symptom was mainly convulsion (34.50%). The first attack had a comprehensive attack and partial attack. Most patients stop themselves. 30 cases (13.10%) had acute recurrence of epilepsy (recurrence within 3 months after the first attack), and 49 cases (25.76%) had neurological dysfunction after follow-up. 36 cases developed symptomatic epilepsy. Among the 130 children who completed the follow-up, 78 (60.00%) had no obvious neurological sequelae, and 52 (40.0%) had neurological sequelae. Among the 52 cases, there were 34 cases of mild sequelae and 18 cases of severe sequelae, including 8 cases of epilepsy combined with cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Epileptic seizure is a common neurological complication during ALL treatment. The etiology and associated manifestations of the first epileptic seizure are diverse. Early neuroimaging and EEG examination are helpful for early diagnosis and treatment.
