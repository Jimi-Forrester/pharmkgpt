This study aims to examine the impact of children's residential proximity and spousal presence on the key modifiable risk factors for dementia among older adults with cognitive impairment. Methods: Utilizing the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data from 1995 to 2018, we analyzed 14,731 participants (35,840 person-waves) aged 50 and older with cognitive impairment. Family support was characterized based on the presence of a spouse and residential proximity to children. Smoking, depressive symptoms and social isolation were included as the key modifiable risk factors for dementia identified in later life. Using mixed-effects logistic regressions, associations between access to family support and the modifiable risk factors were determined, adjusting for various socio-demographic and health-related factors. Results: Significant associations were found between access to family support and modifiable risk factors for dementia. Cognitively impaired older adults with less available family support, characterized by distant-residing children and the absence of a spouse, had significantly higher risks of smoking, depressive symptoms, and social isolation. Moreover, we revealed a consistent gradient in the prevalence of the risk factors based on the degree of family support. Relative to older adults with a spouse and co-resident children, those without a spouse and with all children residing further than 10 miles displayed the highest risks of smoking, depressive symptoms, and social isolation. Conclusion: Access to family support, particularly from spouses and proximate children, plays a protective role against key modifiable risk factors for dementia in older adults with cognitive impairment. The findings highlight the need for bolstering family and social support systems to enhance the well-being of this vulnerable population.
