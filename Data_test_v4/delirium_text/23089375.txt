23089375|t|[Dexmedetomidine and clonidine: a review of their pharmacodynamy to define their role for sedation in intensive care patients].
23089375|a|Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists ("alpha-2 agonists") present multiple pharmacodynamic effects: rousable sedation, decreased incidence of delirium in the setting of critical care, preservation of respiratory drive, decreased whole body oxygen consumption, decreased systemic and pulmonary arterial impedance, improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, preserved vascular reactivity to exogenous catecholamines, preserved vasomotor baroreflex with lowered set point, preserved kidney function, decreased protein catabolism. These pharmacodynamic effects explain the interest for these drugs in the critical care setting. However, their exact role for sedation in critically ill-patients remains open for further studies. Given the few double-blind randomized multicentric trials available, the present non exhaustive analysis of the literature aims at presenting the utilization of alpha-2 agonists as potential first-line sedative agents, in the critical care setting. Suggestions regarding the use of alpha-2 agonists as sedatives are detailed.
