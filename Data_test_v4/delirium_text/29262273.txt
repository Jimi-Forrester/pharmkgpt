29262273|a|Allium hirtifolium Boiss and Astragalus hamosus L. are mentioned in Iranian traditional medicine documentation as therapy for a kind of dementia with the features and symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, the effects of these herbs on neuro-inflammation and memory have been evaluated as new therapies in amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced memory impairment model. Separate groups of rats were fed with A. hirtifolium or A. hamosus extract (both 100 mg/(kg day)-1) started 1 week before stereotaxic surgery to 24 h before behavioral testing (totally, for 16 successive days). The effects of oral administration of mentioned extracts on the memory and neuro-inflammation were assessed in the Abeta-injected rats. The results of this study showed that oral administration of both A. hirtifolium and A. hamosus improved the memory, examined by using Y-maze test and shuttle box apparatus. Also, Western blotting analysis of cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed that these herbs have ameliorating effects against the neuro-inflammation caused by Abeta. These findings suggest that the use of A. hirtifolium and A. hamosus as herbal therapy may be suitable for decreasing AD-related symptoms and treatment of other neurodegenerative disorders.
