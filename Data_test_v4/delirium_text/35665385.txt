35665385|a|Giant focal nodular hyperplasia (GFNH) is rarely seen in children, presenting complex diagnostic and management considerations. Pathognomonic radiographic findings can be absent in this population, and the nuances of pathologic examination are critical. We present a child with a GFNH involving the right side of the liver arising in the background of hepatic steatosis. The details of the diagnosis and therapeutic decisions involved in his treatment are discussed.
