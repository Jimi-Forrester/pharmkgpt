30599045|t|Medical Plants and Nutraceuticals for Amyloid-beta Fibrillation Inhibition.
30599045|a|Plaque formation due to amyloid-beta oligomerization and fibrillation is a key issue for its deposition in the brains of dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients. Related drugs preventing this peptide fibril accumulation bear the potential of considerable medical and social value. In this study, we performed in vitro fibrillation inhibition tests with eight different medical plant extracts and nutraceuticals using fluorescence spectroscopy. Successful inhibition of the following plant extracts and nutraceuticals were obtained: Withania somnifera, Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, and Convolvulus pluricaulis, providing new drug candidates for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
