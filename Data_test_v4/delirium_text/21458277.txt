21458277|a|Aggregation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) plays a pathogenic role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and small molecules that attenuate Abeta aggregation have been identified toward a therapeutic strategy that targets the disease's underlying cause. Compounds containing aromatic structures have been repeatedly reported as effective inhibitors of Abeta aggregation, but the functional groups that influence inhibition by these aromatic centers have been less frequently explored. The current study identifies analogs of naturally occurring coumarin as novel inhibitors of Abeta aggregation. Derivatization of the coumarin structure is shown to affect inhibitory capabilities and to influence the point at which an inhibitor intervenes within the nucleation dependent Abeta aggregation pathway. In particular, functional groups found within amyloid binding dyes, such as benzothiazole and triazole, can improve inhibition efficacy. Furthermore, inhibitor intervention at early or late stages within the amyloid aggregation pathway is shown to correlate with the ability of these functional groups to recognize and bind amyloid species that appear either early or late within the aggregation pathway. These results demonstrate that functionalization of small aromatic molecules with recognition elements can be used in the rational design of Abeta aggregation inhibitors to not only enhance inhibition but to also manipulate the inhibition mechanism.
