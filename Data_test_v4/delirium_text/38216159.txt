38216159|t|Ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy in a patient with a normal renal function.
38216159|a|Ceftriaxone-induced encephalopathy is an exceptionally rare adverse effect of this commonly used cephalosporin and is generally observed in patients undergoing haemodialysis or suffering from severe renal failure. We present a case of a fit woman in her mid-80s with a normal renal function who developed severe fluctuating neurological symptoms (aphasia, loss of contact, chorea-like tongue movements) while being treated with ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection with bacteraemia. The symptoms began on day 4 of treatment and an adverse drug reaction was suspected on day 7, after exhaustive investigations failed to reveal another cause. A complete recovery was observed 3 days after discontinuing ceftriaxone. Our case highlights the need to consider the diagnosis of ceftriaxone encephalopathy, even if the traditional risk factors are lacking. In this article, we also provide a brief overview of the pathophysiology as well as a literature review concerning the subject.
