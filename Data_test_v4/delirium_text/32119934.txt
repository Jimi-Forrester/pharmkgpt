32119934|a|Cerebral small vessel disease is a common condition linked to dementia and stroke. As an age-dependent brain pathology, cerebral SVD may share molecular processes with core neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Many neurodegenerative diseases feature abnormal protein accumulation and aberrant protein folding, resulting in multimerization of specific proteins. We investigated if a small NOTCH3 N-terminal fragment (NTF) that co-registers with pathologically affected cells in the inherited SVD, CADASIL, is capable of multimerization. We also characterized endogenous small molecule vascular enhancers and inhibitors of multimerization. NTF multimerizes spontaneously and also forms conjugates with vascular catecholamines, including dopamine and norepinephrine, which avidly promote multimerization of the protein. Inhibition of catecholamine-dependent multimerization by vitamin C and reversal by reducing agents implicate an essential role of oxidation in NTF multimerization. Antibodies that react with degenerating arteries in CADASIL tissue preferentially bind to multimerized forms of NTF. These studies suggest that multimerization of proteins in the aging brain is not restricted to neuronal molecules and may participate in age-dependent vascular pathology.
