Our objective was to evaluate evidence of causality between these two common diseases. METHODS: We conducted a one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran program. The study included 334,672 participants >=65 years of age with type 2 diabetes and dementia case-control status and genotype data. RESULTS: For each standard deviation increase in genetically predicted diabetes, we found increased odds of three dementia diagnoses in non-Hispanic White participants (all-cause: odds ratio [OR] = 1.07 [1.05-1.08], P = 3.40E-18; vascular: OR = 1.11 [1.07-1.15], P = 3.63E-09, Alzheimer's disease [AD]: OR = 1.06 [1.02-1.09], P = 6.84E-04) and non-Hispanic Black participants (all-cause: OR = 1.06 [1.02-1.10], P = 3.66E-03, vascular: OR = 1.11 [1.04-1.19], P = 2.20E-03, AD: OR = 1.12 [1.02-1.23], P = 1.60E-02) but not in Hispanic participants (all P > 0.05). DISCUSSION: We found evidence of causality between diabetes and dementia using a one-sample MR study, with access to individual level data, overcoming limitations of prior studies using two-sample MR techniques.
