39855275|t|Roles of NLRC4 inflammasome in neurological disorders: Mechanisms, implications, and therapeutic potential.
39855275|a|The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family caspase recruitment domain containing 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome, a vital component of the innate immune system, is known for defending against bacterial infections. However, recent insights have revealed its significant impact on neurological disorders. This comprehensive review discussed the mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of the NLRC4 inflammasome, highlighting the complexity of its response to cellular stress and damage signals. The biological functions of NLRC4 were explored, particularly its influence on cytokine production and the induction of pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death. This review further emphasized the role of the NLRC4 inflammasome in brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. In the realm of brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the NLRC4 inflammasome played a pivotal role in modulating neuroinflammatory responses, which was crucial for understanding the progression and potential therapeutic targeting of these conditions. The emerging role of NLRC4 in psychiatric disorders and its potential impact on glioma progression were also examined. Additionally, this review presented a thorough summary of the latest research on inhibitors that impeded the assembly and activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome, pointing to new therapeutic possibilities in neurological disorders. In conclusion, by integrating current knowledge on the activation and regulation of NLRC4 with its biological functions and clinical implications, this article underscored the importance of NLRC4 inflammasome in neurological pathologies, which opened new possibilities for the treatment of challenging neurological conditions.
