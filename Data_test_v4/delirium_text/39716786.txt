Drosophila melanogaster offers the potential to model features of Alzheimer's disease, study disease mechanisms, and conduct drug screening. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the neuroprotective properties of the drug "carnicetine", which is an acetylated form of the natural low molecular weight compound L-carnitine. The drug is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is currently used as a means of improving cellular metabolism. METHODS: Using tissue-specific drivers, direct expression of amyloid beta peptide (42 amino acids) was exhibited in certain groups of neurons in the Drosophila melanogaster brain, namely in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (carnicetine) on the death of these neurons and the memory of flies was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of amyloid beta peptide in dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons resulted in neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the Drosophila brain and memory impairment. The use of carnicetine added to animal food made it possible to treat these disorders. At the same time, no effect on dopaminergic neurons was noted. CONCLUSION: The data obtained confirmed the neuroprotective properties of the drug under study, demonstrating its participation in the restoration of the cholinergic system and the feasibility of using carnicetine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
