36774453|t|Frailty index and its association with the onset of postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing elective surgery.
36774453|a|BACKGROUND: The association of frailty based on the accumulation of deficits with postoperative delirium (POD) has been poorly examined. We aimed to analyze this association in older patients undergoing elective surgery. METHODS: Preoperative data was used to build a 30-item frailty index (FI) for participants of the PAWEL-study. Delirium was defined by a combination of I-CAM and chart review. Using logistic regressions models we analysed the association between frailty and POD adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, education and type of surgery. RESULTS: Among 701 participants (mean age 77.1, 52.4% male) median FI was 0.27 (Q1 0.20  Q3 0.34), with 528 (75.3%) frail participants (FI >= 0.2). Higher median FI were seen in orthopedic than cardiac surgery patients (0.28 versus 0.23), and in women (0.28 versus 0.25 in men). Frail participants showed a higher POD incidence proportion (25.4% versus 17.9% in non-frail). An increased odds for POD was observed in frail versus non-frail participants (OR 2.14 [95% CI 1.33, 3.44], c-statistic 0.71). A 0.1 increment of FI was associated with OR 1.57 [95% CI 1.30, 1.90] (c-statistic 0.72) for POD. No interaction with sex or type of surgery was detected. Adding timed-up-and-go-test and handgrip strength to the FI did not improve discrimination. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a significant association between frailty defined through a 30-item FI and POD among older adults undergoing elective surgery. Adding functional measures to the FI did not improve discrimination. Hence, our preoperative 30-item FI can help to identify patients with increased odds for POD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PAWEL and PAWEL-R (sub-) study were registered on the German Clinical Trials Register (number DRKS00013311 and DRKS00012797).
