36009778|a|The past years have seen an increasing concern about frailty, owing to the growing number of elderly people and the major impact of this syndrome on health and social care. The identification of frail people passes through the use of different tests and biomarkers, whose concerted analysis helps to stratify the populations of patients according to their risk profile. However, their efficiency in prognosis and their capability to reflect the multisystemic impairment of frailty is discussed. Recent works propose the use of miRNAs as biological hallmarks of physiological impairment in different organismal districts. Changes in miRNAs expression have been described in biological processes associated with phenotypic outcomes of frailty, opening intriguing possibilities for their use as biomarkers of fragility. Here, with the aim of finding reliable biomarkers of frailty, while considering its complex nature, we revised the current literature on the field, for uncovering miRNAs shared across physical and cognitive frailty domains. By applying in silico analyses, we retrieved the top-ranked shared miRNAs and their targets, finally prioritizing the most significant ones. From this analysis, ten miRNAs emerged which converge into two main biological processes: inflammation and energy homeostasis. Such markers, if validated, may offer promising capabilities for early diagnosis of frailty in the elderly population.
