32741828|a|BACKGROUND: The inhibition of tau hyperphosphorylation is one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) modifying drugs. Escitalopram, a kind of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, has been previously reported to ameliorate tau hyperphosphorylation in vitro. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we determined whether escitalopram alleviates tau pathologies in the aged P301L mouse. METHODS: Mice were intraperitoneal injected with either escitalopram or saline for 4 weeks, and a battery of behavioral tests were conducted before tissue collection and biochemical analyses of brain tissue with western blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Wild-type (Wt) mice statistically outperformed the aged pR5 mice in the Morris water maze, while escitalopram treatment did not significantly rescue learning and memory deficits of aged pR5 mice. Tau phosphorylation at different phosphorylation sites were enhanced in the hippocampus of aged pR5 mice, while escitalopram treatment significantly decreased tau phosphorylation. The levels of phosphorylated GSK-3beta and phosphorylated Akt were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of aged pR5 mice, while escitalopram administration markedly increased the expression level. The aged pR5 mice showed significant decreases in PSD95 and PSD93, while the administration of escitalopram significantly increased PSD95 and PSD93 to levels comparable with the Wt mice. CONCLUSION: The protective effects of escitalopram exposure during advanced AD are mainly associated with significant decrease in tau hyperphosphorylation, increased numbers of neurons, and increased synaptic protein levels, which may via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway.
