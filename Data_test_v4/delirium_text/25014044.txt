25014044|a|Neuroplasticity has been defined "the ability of the nervous system to respond to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, function and connections". The nervous system monitors and coordinates internal organ function. Thus neuroplasticity may be associated with the pathogenesis of other diseases besides neuropsychiatric diseases. Decreased neuroplasticity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a disease related to decreased neuroplasticity may confer a greater CVD risk. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is related to CVD and DM induces decreased neuroplasticity, which is manifested as depression, Alzheimer's disease and diabetic neuropathy. Therefore we conclude that DM may induce CVD by decreasing neuroplasticity.
