31501780|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the dose needed to achieve the propofol effect-site concentration using target-controlled infusion in intellectually disabled patients and to detail the most effective method for achieving a safe level of consciousness without hemodynamic changes as well as detail any resulting adverse effects. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of sedation service records of 138 intellectually disabled patients (51, mental retardation; 36, autism; 30, brain lesion, 12 genetic diseases, 9 dementia) aged over 15 years and weighing over 30 kg. These patients had received propofol via target-controlled infusion in the special care dental clinic of Seoul National University Dental Hospital from May 2008 to September 2018 for restorative treatment (112), minor surgery (13), prosthodontics (7), periodontics treatment (5), and implant (1). RESULTS: For all groups, the duration of dental treatments was 43 +- 18 minutes, total sedation time was 73 +- 23 minutes, and total BIS values was 57 +- 12. The propofol maintenance dosage values for each group were: mental retardation, 3 +- 0.5 (2-4) microg/ml; autism, 3.1 +- 0.7 (2-5) microg/ml; brain lesion, 2.8 +- 0.7 (1.5-5) microg/ml; genetic disease, 2.9 +- 0.9 (1-4) microg/ml; and dementia 2.3 +- 0.7 (1-3.4) microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The dementia group needed a lower dosage to reach a safe, effective propofol effect-site concentration than the other groups. Since there were no complications, deep sedation is a great alternative to general anesthesia for dental treatment of intellectually disabled patients.
