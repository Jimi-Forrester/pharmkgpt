39064167|t|Decreased Cerebral Creatine and N-Acetyl Aspartate Concentrations after Severe COVID-19 Infection: A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study.
39064167|a|Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate brain metabolism using MR spectroscopy (MRS) after recovery from Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and to test the impact of disease severity on brain metabolites. Methods: We performed MRS on 81 individuals (45 males, 36 females, aged 40-60), who had normal MRI findings and had recovered from COVID-19, classifying them into mild (17), moderate (36), and severe (28) groups based on disease severity during the acute phase. The study employed two-dimensional spectroscopic imaging above the corpus callosum, focusing on choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). We analyzed Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios as well as absolute concentrations using water as an internal reference. Results: Results indicated that the Cho/Cr ratio was higher with increasing disease severity, while absolute Cho and NAA/Cr ratios showed no significant differences across the groups. Notably, absolute Cr and NAA levels were significantly lower in patients with severe disease. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the severity of COVID-19 during the acute phase is associated with significant changes in brain metabolism, marked by an increase in Cho/Cr ratios and a reduction in Cr and NAA levels, reflecting substantial metabolic alterations post-recovery.
