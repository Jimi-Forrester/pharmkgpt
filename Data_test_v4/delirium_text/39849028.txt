39849028|t|Prediction of ADMET profile and anti-inflammatory potential of chamuangone.
39849028|a|Chamuangone, a compound extracted from the leaves of Garcinia cowa, exhibits various biological activities. Yet, its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile as well as anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages remain unexplored. In this study, we employed a computational tool to predict the ADMET profile of chamuangone and performed molecular docking simulations to assess its interactions with key proteins involved in inflammatory pathways. Additionally, in vitro experiments using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages were performed to evaluate its anti-inflammatory effects. The present findings suggest that chamuangone has favorable ADMET properties, interacts strongly with major proteins involved in inflammation, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced macrophages, making it a promising anti-inflammatory agent.
