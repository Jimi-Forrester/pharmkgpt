35614521|t|Brain Imaging Abnormalities in Mixed Alzheimer's and Subcortical Vascular Dementia.
35614521|a|BACKGROUND: A large proportion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have coexisting subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD), a condition referred to as mixed dementia (MixD). Brain imaging features of MixD presumably include those of cerebrovascular disease and AD pathology, but are difficult to characterize due to their heterogeneity. OBJECTIVE: To perform an exploratory analysis of conventional and non-conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in MixD and to compare them to those observed in AD and SVaD. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, region-of-interest-based analysis of 1) hyperintense white-matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) on T2-FLAIR and hypointense WMSA on T1-weighted MRI; 2) diffusion tensor imaging; 3) quantitative susceptibility mapping; and 4) effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*) in N = 17 participants (AD:5, SVaD:5, MixD:7). General linear model was used to explore group differences in these brain imaging measures. RESULTS: Model findings suggested imaging characteristics specific to our MixD group, including 1) higher burden of WMSAs on T1-weighted MRI (versus both AD and SVaD); 2) frontal lobar preponderance of WMSAs on both T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted MRI; 3) higher fractional anisotropy values within normal-appear white-matter tissues (versus SVaD, but not AD); and 4) lower R2* values within the T2-FLAIR WMSA areas (versus both AD and SVaD). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a preliminary picture of the location and type of brain imaging characteristics associated with MixD. Future imaging studies may employ region-specific hypotheses to distinguish MixD more rigorously from AD or SVaD.
