37969264|a|Background: The clinical benefits of totally minimal invasive esophagectomy (TIME) compared to open esophagectomy are documented and include reduced morbidity like pulmonary infections, shorter hospital stay and an increase in short-term quality of life. However, transition to TIME can be associated with a learning curve associated increased morbidity. We report our implementation of TIME using a 2-step approach, where the thoracoscopic part was added to the laparoscopic part in carefully selected patients. The hypothesis was that the 2-step implementation provides a safe and efficient implementation without compromising the outcomes for the patients. The aim of this study was to evaluation the implementation of minimal invasive esophagectomy at Aarhus University Hospital, where a 2-step implementation strategy has been used. Methods: In this retrospective observational cohort study a total of 369 patients with esophagus or gastroesophageal cancers underwent esophagectomy from September 1st, 2016 to July 31st, 2021 in a single high-volume tertiary institution. Totally minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy was performed by experienced minimal invasive surgeons in 120 of the cases. The study presents the complication rates of the TIME patients in the implementation phase. Results: Anastomotic leakage occurred in 7.5% of the cases and pneumonia occurred in 5.8% of the cases. The lymph node count reached 16 or more in 94.3% of the cases and R0-resection was performed in 98.3% of the cases. Textbook outcome for esophageal cancer surgery was achieved in 45.8% of the patients. Conclusions: Hybrid minimal invasive esophagectomy can serve as a step towards totally minimally invasive esophagectomy. In our institution, major learning curve associated complications was avoided and a high level of cancer control was achieved by a 2-step implementation strategy in carefully selected patients.
