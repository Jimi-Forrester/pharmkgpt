12731644|t|Unfolding story of inclusion-body myositis and myopathies: role of misfolded proteins, amyloid-beta, cholesterol, and aging.
12731644|a|Sporadic inclusion-body myositis and hereditary inclusion-body myopathies are progressive muscle diseases leading to severe disability. We briefly summarize their clinical pictures and pathologic diagnostic criteria and discuss the latest advances in illuminating their pathogenic mechanism(s). We emphasize how different etiologies might lead to the strikingly similar pathology and possibly similar pathogenic cascade. On the basis of our research, several processes seem to be important in relation to the still speculative pathogenesis, including (a) increased transcription and accumulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein and accumulation of its proteolytic fragment amyloid-beta; (b) abnormal accumulation of components related to lipid metabolism, for example, cholesterol, accumulation of which is possibly owing to its abnormal trafficking; (c) oxidative stress; (d) accumulations of other Alzheimer's disease-related proteins; and (e) a milieu of muscle cellular aging in which these changes occur. We discuss a potentially very important role of unfolded and/or misfolded proteins as a possible mechanism in the formations of the inclusion bodies and other abnormalities.
