35640838|t|Is COVID-19 really a geriatric syndrome?
35640838|a|Geriatric syndromes are a group of medical conditions, such as cognitive impairment, delirium, frailty, dizziness, syncope, and incontinence, associated with age increase. Many studies have reported a higher mortality rate for older COVID-19 patients, which could be explained by the complications of COVID-19, including the components of geriatric syndromes. We read with great interest the paper "Prevalence of unwillingness and uncertainty to vaccinate against COVID-19 in older people: A systematic review and meta-analysis" by Nicola Veronese et al. Their valuable work determines how uncertainty and unwillingness towards receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are more prevalent among older adults and how this hesitancy could affect vaccine uptake, and ultimately, the mortality rate. Regarding this paper, we wish to address some points.
