27574337|t|Predictors of Cognitive Decline in a Rural and Remote Saskatchewan Population With Alzheimer's Disease.
27574337|a|To determine the predictors of cognitive decline in a rural and remote population with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examined the association between cognitive change and sociodemographic, clinical, and functional data at the initial day of diagnosis. Simple linear regression analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to determine the predictors of cognitive decline as measured by the difference in the Mini-Mental State Examination over 1 year. Our sample included 72 patients with AD. Age at the clinic day appointment was 75.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 7.44). History of hypertension and decreased ability to carry out activities of daily living were statistically significant and predicted greater cognitive decline at 1 year. Many previously suggested predictors of cognitive decline were not evidenced in this study. This research helps identify clinically useful predictors of decline in a rural and remote population with AD.
