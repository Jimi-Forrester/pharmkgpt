34204362|a|Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an emergent infectious disease that has caused millions of deaths throughout the world. COVID-19 infection's main symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, and neurological manifestations such as headache, myalgias, anosmia, ageusia, impaired consciousness, seizures, and even neuromuscular junctions' disorders. In addition, it is known that this disease causes a series of systemic complications such as adverse respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and liver dysfunction. Due to the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19, damage in the central nervous system has been suggested as well as the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. It is known that CoV infections are associated with an inflammation process related to the imbalance of the antioxidant system; cellular changes caused by oxidative stress contribute to brain tissue damage. Although anti-COVID-19 vaccines are under development, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and its clinical manifestations and complications; only supportive treatments with immunomodulators, anti-vascular endothelial growth factors, modulating drugs, statins, or nutritional supplements have been used. In the present work, we analyzed the potential of antioxidants as adjuvants for the treatment of COVID-19 and specifically their possible role in preventing or decreasing the neurological manifestations and neurological complications present in the disease.
