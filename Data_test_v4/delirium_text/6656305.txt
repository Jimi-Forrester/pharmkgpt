6656305|t|Fine-structural and degenerative features in adult and aged human sympathetic ganglion cells.
6656305|a|Sympathetic ganglia, either cervical and upper thoracic or lumbar, were removed from adult and aged patients suffering from circulatory deficiencies in their upper or lower extremities, respectively. The ganglion cells had several features that can be associated with age. Lipofuscin was ample in all ganglion cells and was usually polarly concentrated. Its amount tended to increase with age and it was present also in the glial cells. Lipofuscin autofluorescence often prevented the visualization of the formaldehyde induced fluorescence for catecholamines. At the electron microscopic level, pigment bodies were seen to be composed of three different kinds of osmiophilic properties: (1) gray component that had (2) dark patches dispersed into it and (3) pale, oval, incorporated droplets. In principal ganglion cells, the first two formed the major part, the pale one taking over in the small granule-containing cells. Various inclusion bodies included a cylinder-shaped type that had a varying pattern of rod-like structures inside it. Myelin figures (laminar bodies) were sometimes found to fill neurite profiles, occasionally with random mitochondrial accumulations. These bore a distant resemblance to the primitive type of neuritic (senile) plaques, although none of the patients was diagnosed to have, for example, Alzheimer's disease or senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. Nevertheless, it appears to us that it might be possible to find coexistent neuropathological changes in peripheral sympathetic ganglia in diseases affecting primarily the central nervous system.
